Can NASA send a crew to the Lunar Surface by 2024? And safely return them to Earth?\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYes, they can.<p>Sandworm laid out the mission cost in lives problem, but modern spaceflight already has defined an acceptable margin for loss of crew in most missions - 1 in 270 as set by NASA for its Commercial Crew Transportation System (CCTS) program. The historical mortality rate for astronauts remains at 3.2%, or a Loss of Crew (LOC) rate of 4 in 125 across all vehicles and missions. Let us assume that the political calculus changes and the 3.2% LOC rate becomes acceptable. What&#x27;s next?<p>What&#x27;s next would be the design of a navigation system for translunar and cislunar navigation - after Apollo, and the exploration of the solar system, this has become a solved problem. We can run and code an AGC with inputs from far better sensors on an Arduino. NASA&#x27;s engineers can also automate astrogation using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology. There are also highly efficient hydrogen upper stage engines available off the shelf for the Orion and the lander.<p>Unlike Apollo, 2020&#x27;s NASA can use a more modern approach of Earth-Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) to construct the Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage with a lander and lunar orbiter via separate launches. Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) rendezvous and docking has become routine for us in this era. It&#x27;s a maneuver that&#x27;s performed several times each year at the International Space Station. LIDAR and automated docking has made an EOR safe and, virtually, error-free.<p>For this theoretical exercize, the vehicle could be automatically assembled in an 100mi orbit. Crew could go up and rendezvous in the final lunar orbiter-and-return component of the vehicle, or in a temporary (Dragon) capsule. The EOR approach reduces the size of the launch vehicles required, making it feasible for a COTS provider like SpaceX to provide a Falcon Heavy for this purpose. It also allows for the re-use of current CCTS providers, by letting crew proceed to the vehicle in a human-space-flight rated Dragon capsule (or a mated CSM-equivalent). This system can be constructed via hardware that is currently being flight-rated, or will be flight rated soon, making the SLS redundant (in the short-term).<p>The SLS - for political reasons - could be repositioned as a long-term support and heavy payload delivery vehicle as a part of an extended Space Transport System, as originally envisioned for the Shuttle. SpaceX could provide the reusable &quot;shuttle&quot; aspect. The SLS heavy-lifter capabilities. And a lunar gateway as a refueling station. A deal that keeps all parties happy.<p>For the LEM component, NASA has the benefit of hindsight. The LEM designs still exist, there are LEMs in storage and can be mapped in 3D to study them. The data collected from 6 landings can be used to implement &quot;in hindsight&quot; improvements, making it easier to take the LEM template from Apollo and modernize it by reducing the electronics requirement and payload capacity. NASA doesn&#x27;t have to redesign everything from scratch, there is a design that works. A design that was taken down to the surface with great uncertainty in 11 and 12, but worked for 14, 15, 16 and 17.<p>The most difficult aspect of the mission - the ascent stage - was studied following Apollo, and can now be trivially simulated in computer games, such as Kerbal Space Program. We can beg, borrow and steal the LEM design, and simulate what the original planners could not, giving NASA a much faster turn-around time this time around. It is conceivable that, if the payload characteristics were more realistic, and the goals of staying on the surface were trimmed down, a slightly up-scaled LEM and a down-scaled Altair&#x2F;LSAM <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Altair_(spacecraft)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Altair_(spacecraft)<\/a> could be made in 2 years or less. Flown in 3. Making it possible for an autonomous lunar landing in 4 and a surface jaunt in 4.5 years. However, that&#x27;s theory, which would require tremendous resources to achieve.<p>After a cislunar docking maneuver, our astronauts can come home riding a far superior thermal protection systems than any contemporary material available in the Apollo-era. The amount of research that has gone into this area is extremely impressive, and gives our pioneers a safe journey home, where they&#x27;ll land and descend via parachutes - which are far more complicated, but something that NASA, the organization, has more cultural experience with than SpaceX or Boeing.<p>From this template, a mission is not only conceivable - it&#x27;s doable. The only question is <i>how much<\/i>.<p>How much is congress willing to give to make this a reality?

Cards backlinked to other cards using said IDs. He also used a card branching mechanism implemented in IDs as e.g. 123 -&gt; 123a -&gt; 123a1 which he called Folgezettel.<p>Lastly, he also had cards whose role was mostly to connect topics by serving as a link hub.<p>It&#x27;s a really simple system that you can implement using plain text, Org, Markdown or some note taking application like Apple Notes or OneNote plus a few conventions.<p>After trying many things, for personal use I think nothing beats plain text (or a plain text format).

However, if you already use rollerballs, and you&#x27;re looking at this and thinking you&#x27;d like to try it out, but you haven&#x27;t ever tried a fountain pen, I would heavily advise giving one a shot. If you know you need a rollerball, then a stick with a rollerball. But don&#x27;t dismiss a fountain pen out-of-hand -- the cheaper brands will be the same price as the pens listed here, and will be a big jump in quality for a nontrivial number of readers.<p>In particular, I&#x27;ve used a Fine nib Twisbi Eco (~$30) for multiple years now as my main pen, and I consider it to be one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s cheap enough that I can throw it into a bag or my pocket alongside my keys without worrying too much about it getting scratched or stolen, but it still looks reasonably nice, writes beautifully, holds a ton of ink, and is just a joy to use. There are cheaper pens out there, but I really like having a piston-fill pen, and I think it&#x27;s just a really good quality, versatile, fun line -- there are even a lot of different color options.<p>I can describe mechanically why a fountain pen feels good, but I can&#x27;t really convey how it feels. The best thing I can say is that it takes something that&#x27;s very mundane (writing) and it makes it feel a tiny bit more pleasurable and &#x27;extravagant&#x27; (for lack of a better word). I write a lot, I fill notebooks with handwritten notes. With a fountain pen, it just feels good to write. My handwriting has improved a lot, particularly my cursive -- I suspect in part because I pay more attention to what I&#x27;m writing. It&#x27;s easy to take care of, but it feels good to occasionally wash it out and switch to a new ink color. It feels nice to use permanent things.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few people talking about avoiding fountain pen ink even in the rollerballs because they dissolve in water. On that note I will swear by Noodler&#x27;s Black Waterproof ink. I&#x27;ve completely submerged and soaked pages that I wrote on with that ink, and not only does it not dissolve, it does not even smudge. It&#x27;s really crazy. One of the really nice things about fountain pens is that there&#x27;s such a wide variety of colors and styles and glitters, and it just adds to this feeling of making your handwriting feel more expressive and personal.

Where many in this thread are enthusiasts or writing professionals, I rather want to convey a more utilitarian mindset. My goals are to have people understand what I write and not be in pain. For whatever reason, ballpoint pens and I can&#x27;t mix with legibility. I believe it&#x27;s the pressure and dragging that kills it for me. Pencil is also not great when writing with my left (because it smudges, using a #2.5 pencil helps a bit, but then I&#x27;m using more pressure to get the lines dark).<p>I found I could write much more legibly using a fountain pen, so I&#x27;ve been using them since 1st or 2nd grade. There&#x27;s a ton of drawbacks to using fountain pens for everything daily. First, while rare, I&#x27;d still get leaks and ink on my hands. For instance, if I dropped the pen. Second, there&#x27;s a bit of a maintenance burden on fountain pens, the nibs need to be cleaned from time to time. Finally, pretty much all of these inks will wash out if the paper gets wet, so it&#x27;s super bad for legal documents. I like the Pilot Metropolitan fountain pens as they strike the right balance of affordability and quality. The Fine nib for me (correlates to EF from American&#x2F;European companies) seems to be the sweet spot, Medium feels imprecise for me. Noodler ink seems great, I was previously using Schaeffer ink and it was just ok.<p>The latest pens I&#x27;ve come enjoy using are Pilot&#x27;s Frixxion line. I grabbed on a whim awhile back and feel like every student of mathematics should know of these pens. They are a gel pen with fine point options but they can be &#x27;erased&#x27; by rubbing a plastic nub on the back against paper. This heats up the paper and causes the ink to disappear. The effect can be reversed by throwing the paper in the freezer if erasure was unintended (or if a notebook was left in an extremely hot cat). I wish I had known about these pens when I was in school. Gel-type pens seem a bit more practical than fountain for daily carry or occasional use, not as good as a fountain but the ink seems to flow better than ballpoint and the tips don&#x27;t get messed up like a felt pen.<p>EDIT: More on topic though, I have tried rollerball pens and did not like them.

Programming and music are very different beasts, both very tough, both very worthwhile. I just wanted to post because the documenta above has a lot of great information (on a quick browse) and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s filled with good intentions, but it&#x27;s a very poor way to learn music. If you&#x27;re a mathematician or physicist or software engineer trying to learn how to play the guitar, be it by ear or in any other way, it&#x27;s not going to cut it. It&#x27;s great if you read it and learn the information, but only the last 6 pages or so really talk about actually playing, and they are not going to teach you.<p>If you want to learn to write and play music, don&#x27;t delve into the math except as a side project. Learn to play a few simple songs that you like, using 3-4 simple chords (there are a ton of tutorials for that), and then spend 1,000 hours playing around on the vicinity of that musical environment. There is no shortcut, it is not about learning patterns, music is a different language, and learning music is about awakening your musical self.<p>Learning to accompany yourself while you sing a few songs needs no understanding of the mathematical foundations at all (and they don&#x27;t really help), it&#x27;s mostly about learning a few basic patterns (3-4 chord finger positions) and then being good at performing (mostly tied to self-confidence). Learning to play common songs doesn&#x27;t take much more. Learning to improvise and to write your own songs requires 1,000+ hours of the type of &quot;playing&#x2F;dancing&#x2F;exploring&quot; I was mentioning above.

I opened the PDF and started reading, and eventually found myself jumping past the mathematical harmonic mumbo-jumbo and into the good stuff, and unfortunately I was disappointed. He ended up covering the basics of Music Theory found in a lot of books with no real application to ear training.<p>1) Learning Material<p>I can sympathize with the author&#x27;s plight about not having access to good learning materials or schools. For those who want to pick up guitar and want a bit of extra &quot;why things are the way they are&quot; explanations, I have found books such as &quot;Fretboard Logic&quot; and &quot;The Advancing Guitarist&quot; to be useful. There are plenty more, like Ted Greene&#x27;s &quot;Chord Chemistry&quot; and whatnot that have insight on ear training. Also, you have software today like Ear Master, Rocksmith and others that can help and are fun as well. YouTube is full of backing tracks that you can use to practice and hear how various notes, phrasings, melodies sound on top of the backing chords.<p>2) Notes<p>Personally I have not found using &quot;natural&quot; note names to be that useful; using relative note names like root, second, third is to me much more functional, because the third of any key sounds like a third. The whole &quot;returning to _root_&quot; thing he mentions should be hint enough.<p>3) Ear Training<p>His story of his dad being a multi-instrumentalist struck a chord with me (sorry). I have friends and teachers who are like this and I&#x27;ve come to believe that it&#x27;s less about knowing any of what he is talking about (although it is important) and more about their storytelling ability and translating it over into music. I doubt his dad was a shredder, but his dad&#x27;s ability to pick up and play an instrument wowed him all the same.<p>To put another way - most people are lucky if they can passably play one instrument. The question is, how is it that there are people that can pick up an instrument and leave an impression on others? I doubt they have a massive IQ or some arcane knowledge of music theory.<p>Storytelling and Composition are the same thing. All the high brow shit about Principles of Composition and Counterpoint and whatnot does not matter. Being able to evoke imagery in someone&#x27;s mind or make them feel a certain way with music is something that the first half of the author&#x27;s paper cannot begin to rationalize.<p>I believe it&#x27;s important to really _hear_ the music you are listening to. It doesn&#x27;t matter if there are no vocals explicitly telling you how to feel (ie. pop music); it is on you to allow yourself to engage with what you&#x27;re hearing and to eventually formulate an opinion on how something sounds and how it makes you feel. I&#x27;ve heard music teachers expressing this sentiment, and it&#x27;s no surprise that it goes over most people&#x27;s heads. It&#x27;s not a subject for the dabblers. Composers for film, Classical composers etc excel at this. Learning from them is a masterclass in both ear training and storytelling. They&#x27;ve written plenty of books on this subject.<p>Take a song you know, and start hearing it on a deeper level. Start transcribing it first by singing&#x2F;humming&#x2F;whistling along to it and then with your instrument. Take a chunk of it, and alter it in some way. Slow it down, add vibrato if there isn&#x27;t already, elongate certain passages.<p>I can&#x27;t stress enough listening to music that actually tries to tell a story, because that&#x27;s when you will hear the most _functional_ use of chord changes, progressions, melodies and vocals, which will ultimately aid in your ear training abilities and answer &quot;why&quot; better than the first half of the paper. Yes, you still have to sit down and woodshed (scales, progressions, metronome practice, etc) and whatnot, but that&#x27;s assumed to be the case.<p>PS. Lastly, you can find most of his mathematical explanations on Music Theory Stack Exchange. None of it will help you play by ear any better."],"time":["2020-02-09 03:53:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["OldGuyInTheClub"],"id":[22284022],"kids":[22286686,22285232,22286508],"parent":[22271214],"text":["Some good tips for us mortals.

What it basically came down to is that midlife crisis feelings had come to dominate my psyche. I found myself asking &quot;what&#x27;s the point?&quot; about basic tasks that must be done.<p>The start of a cure turned out to be separating a task into writing the todo list for it and then doing it afterwards. The next evolution of that is to also separate your evaluation of the work from the work itself, so that you don&#x27;t wallow in critical feelings as you work. Try to be zenful and just concentrate on the now.<p>Basically it all comes down to anxiety management. So for example, say you are cleaning and you get a text message to deal with an issue. I normally would make a mental note to remember to do it, since I lean towards intellectual pursuits. But it&#x27;s better to add the item to the top of your todo list and stop thinking about it or the fear of forgetting it. Better yet, pause cleaning (since it&#x27;s low-priority) and deal with the issue immediately.<p>I&#x27;ve found that mechanizing the thought processes that I had taken for granted until they failed me boosted my mood. If you think of it as a scale from 0 to 10, our default with stress is to hover below a 5 (say 3). It takes effort to get above 5.

The concept is an inductor and a switch across the input. Close the switch, and the inductor&#x27;s magnetic field builds up. Open the switch, and the inductor tries to maintain constant current by producing a high voltage. If the input side inductor is part of a transformer, you can get a higher or lower voltage out as the magnetic field collapses. That&#x27;s an auto ignition from the mid 20th century.<p>That approach suffers from arcing at the switch points, blithers all over the RF spectrum, and wastes energy by keeping the input on too long. Progress since then focuses on solving all those problems, plus some others.<p>Power MOSFETs provided an electronic switch with a really low ON resistance, in the millohm range, an OFF resistance in the kiloohm or even megohm range, and a switching time fast enough that you don&#x27;t spend much time between ON and OFF. At very low resistance, almost no energy is dissipated in the switch, and at very high resistance, almost no energy is dissipated in the switch. Between those points, the switch loses energy through resistive heating. This is why switching power supplies get warm. The less time spent transitioning between OFF and ON, the less heating.<p>A switching power supply is almost a dead short across its input if the switch stays turned on after the inductor reaches magnetic saturation. This is why switching power supplies can burn up or catch fire. Failure of the power MOSFET (and they usually fail ON) or the control circuitry is big trouble. Which is why they need protection circuitry. This is what UL approval is for. Along with insisting that the input and output windings of the power transformer have enough insulation between them, so you don&#x27;t get power line voltage at the USB jack.<p>In most other areas of electronics, you avoid generating spikes. Switching power supplies generate big spikes on purpose. Getting the energy of those spikes into the output capacitor is what it&#x27;s all about. The energy can leak out as spikes on the input side, spikes on the output side, loud RF noise, or heat. Getting all those under control requires some extra parts. Surface mount ferrite beads and chip capacitors, mostly. Things you usually don&#x27;t have to think about, such as the inductance of capacitors, are big issues. This is what FCC approval is for.<p>I designed and built a special purpose switching power supply a few years ago, and it&#x27;s on Github. [1] There&#x27;s a detailed explanation of how it works, including what all those minor parts do. The traditional linear solution to that problem is about 5% efficient, runs hot, and much larger.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;John-Nagle&#x2F;ttyloopdriver\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;John-Nagle&#x2F;ttyloopdriver<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-10 04:39:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["analog31"],"id":[22283206],"kids":[22284668,22285865,22284614],"parent":[22282756],"text":["Interestingly, the same transistors have revolutionized audio amplifiers.

Some people here are saying the feedback needs to have substance or not just be insults, but even those are meaningful. Your job is to read between the lines. The real question you need answered isn’t the same as the question they answer, so you always need to think about how to translate their answer into priorities.<p>Even no feedback is positive feedback, because it’s telling you that people aren’t in love with your creation the way you are, and you then need to find out why. When I created a web app, I solved the problems that I strongly felt needed solving, and then I found out that maybe 5% of my audience agreed with my choice of priorities, and 95% of them cared deeply about things I hadn’t considered carefully.<p>There’s a corollary for startups that negative feedback from investors is also positive. The second best thing an investor can do is say no (where the best is yes &amp; a check). They hardly ever say no. They usually say come back with such and such improved metrics, and we’ll talk again. When they say no, it gives you valuable information, and it releases you from chasing something that’s unlikely to work out. When I was pitching, I was so thankful to the couple of investors who said no and gave direct feedback about why.

TRUST - I&#x27;m part of a tight-knit group of bootstrapper&#x2F;indie devs and a real aspect of how we&#x27;re able to offer real feedback is that we have the backdrop of knowing each other in other ways.<p>If someone who I consider a fantastic developer and sent me a Christmas card last year tells me: &quot;Mike, this makes no sense.&quot; take that a lot more seriously.<p>2. DATA - as a human I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m often wrong, so I try to evaluate my own opinions against data. In the context of apps&#x2F;sites this is often A&#x2F;B tests or other quantifiable things.<p>3. FEEDBACK NOT ACTION - People tend to offer feedback along with a kneejerk suggestion on what action to take to resolve it.<p>Example: I had a service that required users to OAuth (with a bunch of legitimately scary permission scopes) and also make DNS changes to enable it and was told repeatedly as feedback that it was &quot;too much&quot; and &quot;people would never use it&quot;.<p>Their recommendation: shut it down.<p>The direction I took: go crazy building trust in the process.<p>The result: my most successful project to date with thousands of paying customers.<p>3. SCOPE - feedback is often scoped improperly. Is someone asking for feedback about a startup idea: &quot;Will this connect with people?&quot; it&#x27;s not useful to critique the fonts used on their homepage or something else. (both HN and I are too often guilty of this).<p>4. BELIEVE FEEDBACK - one of the most important exercises I do for all my projects now is a &quot;UX walk through&quot; where I sit someone down and just try and let them sign up and work through the process of signing up for the service with as little intervention from myself as possible.<p>I find it incredibly painful.<p>Even interfaces that I think are incredibly polished and straightforward suddenly become opaque nightmares when presented to people that haven&#x27;t seen them before. This is the &quot;curse of knowledge&quot; - I&#x27;m too close to the process and can&#x27;t see the issues clearly.<p>In these situations, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to argue with people about it and say: &quot;how can you not have seen that button?&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re not really paying attention&quot; or something else dumb.<p>But if I&#x27;m able to make myself believe the feedback, not take it personally and really address the issues at hand I find I get fantastic results. Last time I did this I ended up scrapping months of works (painful), migrating to a new auth system (painful) and rebuilding the entire onboarding from scratch (incredibly painful), but the end result was a move from 30% successful user onboarding to over 70%.<p>Feedback works."],"time":["2020-02-09 15:32:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ben0x539"],"id":[22281001],"kids":{},"parent":[22279041],"text":["Uh, this post sucks!

Hes still not trained for overnight though. It makes me feel like a failure as a father. We have always used disposable diapers with him.<p>My second (5) has been out of diapers during the day for nearly 2 years. She consistently uses the toilet for bowel movements but fails to urinate in the toilet every time, except when I take her on a timer&#x2F;regular interval. We aren&#x27;t sure why she has this problem or how to remediate it. We are very concerned as she begins kindergarten this year. We always used disposable diapers with her, and I feel like a failure as a father on this, too.<p>We just began potty training with my 2 year old. We are 3 or 4 days into it, and he is already independently going to the restroom and following all the rehearsed steps when he needs to urinate. We are having occasional accidents, and he is catching on to the idea that urinating on himself is undesirable. We offer him praise when he is successful, and no praise when he fails (we just walk him through the process of washing off, replacing his clothing, etc so he understands the outcome). He was cloth diapered exclusively until about 6 months ago when his younger brother started using up all the cloth diapers! He hasn&#x27;t had enough encounters with BMs to catch on to going to the restroom at the appropriate time yet, but I&#x27;m confident we will get there soon.<p>My youngest is 8 months and we haven&#x27;t started any such exercises yet, but it sounds like it may be a good idea.<p>To echo the article&#x27;s suggestion, possibly one of the most frustrating things is potty training. Or maybe more frustrating, the lack of potty training. I still awake to change diapers for four children every morning, and on average theres at least one guaranteed BM for me to handle. (And let&#x27;s be real, a 6 year old doesn&#x27;t poop like a baby.) Although its nice not changing diapers of my 5 year old anymore during the day, it comes at the cost of regular urine cleanup &#x2F; permanently stained furniture and HEAVY use of our washing machine.<p>If anyone knows any resources for training special needs children overnight (or in the case of my 5 year old...anytime!), I would be super grateful. We had a period of 2 years where both of my older children were in therapy sessions between 20-40 hours&#x2F;week, and sadly potty training efforts even by trained therapists has been met with limited success. My current plan is to stay the course, just practicing and hoping it all sinks in, especially before my 5 year old starts school, as I don&#x27;t want her to suffer this embarrassment (and I certainly worry about the way she will be treated&#x2F;educated as its understandably difficult and even frustrating to deal with this particular kind of problem; for example, we enrolled my then-4 year old in a private kindergarten program last year, but after 2 days the school informed us that unfortunately they cannot manage her and she would not be allowed to attend)."],"time":["2020-02-09 18:05:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["keith__talent"],"id":[22281135],"kids":{},"parent":[22257205],"text":["MIT - What! where is the Editor?

It took much longer for intel to be competitive on floating point code.<p>(By the way, it blows my mind that we went from 200 MHz to 1 GHz in about 4 years. Meanwhile, it’s been 15 years since my first 2 GHz+ MacBook, and a new MacBook still has a base clock around that range. Maybe it’ll turbo boost to 4 GHz for 10 seconds before it exceeds its thermal envelope.)"],"time":["2020-02-09 15:50:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zozbot234"],"id":[22282269],"kids":[22282317,22282800],"parent":[22282049],"text":["The Alpha had an incredibly weird memory model that could create this behavior:<p><i>Assume: p=&amp;a, a=1, b=0<\/i><p><pre><code>  Thr. 1         | Thr. 2\n  b = 1          |\n  memory_barrier | i = *p\n  p = &amp;b         |\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<i>The result can be i = 0<\/i><p>Even though p=&amp;b happens <i>after<\/i> b=1 in Thread 1, it is seen as happening <i>before<\/i> it by Thread 2.

Alpha is almost twice as fast as intel, and mips is in between.<p>None of these processors are absolutely top of the line - you can get 195 mhz r10k with 4meg L2, 300 mhz PII, and 600 mhz 21164a. Because my codes are highly scalable, we were better off buing more processors at a lower price, rather than the absolute fastest available.<p>Some comments on the cost of speed:<p>A 4 cpu pentium pro with plenty of memory can be had for around $20k from bargain integrators. Most of our Quake licensees have one of these.<p>For about $60k you can get a 4 cpu, 466 mhz alphaserver 4100. Ion Storm has one of these, and it is twice as fast as a quad intel, and a bit faster than six of our mips processors.<p>That level of performance is where you run into a wall in terms of cost.<p>To go beyond that with intel processors, you need to go to one of the &quot;enterprise&quot; systems from sequent, data general, ncr, tandem, etc. There are several 8 and 16 processor systems available, and the NUMA systems from sequent and DG theoretically scale to very large numbers of CPUS (32+). The prices are totally fucked. Up to $40k PER CPU! Absolutely stupid.<p>The only larger alpha systems are the 8200&#x2F;8400 series from dec, which go up to 12 processors at around $30k per cpu. We almost bought an 8400 over a year ago when there was talk of being able to run NT on it.<p>Other options are the high end sun servers (but sparc&#x27;s aren&#x27;t much faster than intel) and the convex&#x2F;hp systems (which wasn&#x27;t shipping when we purchased).<p>We settled on the SGI origin systems because it ran my codes well, is scalable to very large numbers of processors (128), and the cost was only about $20k per cpu.

On my team we have a strong style guide with a lot of well-reasoned, detailed, and consistent rules. One of the main differences to other style guides is that we design our style to make review easier. One of the primary ways of doing this is minimising diff noise.<p>While Black&#x27;s vision is to reduce diff noise and design for easier review through a consistent style, it creates more diff noise and has a less consistent style than our style guide, and so we&#x27;ve had many discussions internally about whether it&#x27;s right for us.<p>I have no doubt that Black is better than weak&#x2F;no style guide, and for open source projects the automation it brings would absolutely be the right choice. I just wish it was better at what it sets out to do.<p>Edit: to address some of the questions raised:<p>- Yes Black does save time over code review picking on style details, but we already have automated linters for most things we&#x27;d raise about style anyway, which negates some of the time saving.<p>- The easiest example of where Black differs from our style guide and falls down on its promises is formatting lists&#x2F;function calls&#x2F;definitions.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  foo = [bar, bar]\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhen reaching the line length limit, we will turn this into:<p><pre><code>  foo = [\n    bar,\n    baz,\n    quux,\n  ]\n<\/code><\/pre>\nHowever Black will format this first as:<p><pre><code>  foo = [\n    bar, baz, quux\n  ]\n<\/code><\/pre>\nOnly when it goes on a few more characters does it then format into the way we&#x27;d go straight to. This means that there&#x27;s more diff noise more of the time, and when reading code there are 3 forms of this construction that one must be aware of, rather than the 2 forms that we have, meaning the code is less consistently formatted.<p>This is picky, yes, but the point of Black is to be picky, and in a team where we can have a very good shared understanding of a style, and where we do already have that style, Black is much less convincing."],"time":["2020-02-09 12:47:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["teddyh"],"id":[22282247],"kids":[22282860,22283578],"parent":[22281210],"text":["I again quote &#x2F;u&#x2F;whiteinge on Reddit¹:<p>“<i>Let&#x27;s assume the project is over-promised and will be late and under-deliver.

The phone is dead nearly all the time, because so many basic charging features we normally take for granted don&#x27;t work. First, the phone doesn&#x27;t seem like it has any kind of idle power mode. It is hot from the minute you power on until the battery dies, even with the screen off. You can&#x27;t leave the phone on the charger overnight to charge it—you&#x27;ll wake up to a dead phone. I think what is happening is that there&#x27;s no trickle charge, so the phone charges to full, then stops charging, then the battery dies.<p>Yikes. In my mind, this isn&#x27;t actually a phone in its current form.

Instead we get this Frankenstein of a project, sold to the public long before it&#x27;s done (along with marketing copy that makes the company look unethical - there should be big warnings on the store page about how far along this project truly is and what you&#x27;re getting for your $750).<p>The worst part about this is that it makes all open source projects look bad. It makes them look like a bad compromise.

Walk into stores across the country to get service and support. What Purism is telling us is, essentially, if you want to take a stand against the proprietary world, you have to <i>give up everything<\/i>. You have to use a chunky, ugly, crudely assembled phone. You have to give up acceptable power management.

Build bridges with investors before you may need to cross them, ie. Don’t go to them when you need the money. There are a multitude of angles to use, but each angle has to come from a core place of self-less and selfish interest. Know what they want and need, know what you want and need. Each angle will also dictate how early you can &#x2F; should get on their radar.<p>2. If you are introducing your startup to them, then around 6 months. If your angle is to aid startups in their portfolio, introduce startups to them (filter them, don’t send them any and all), or introduce family offices looking to put funds into a pool; then you can contact them a lot earlier.<p>3. There is another way that you can connect with investors, “get an intro to us via someone in our network”. With some investors this will be the only way.<p>4. Note the investor landscape, find out their investment thesis. See if their portfolio has any that could be competitors, any synergies, etc.<p>5. Find out the required milestones (for your current stage and the next one). This can be a difficult one to find out, for it can pin some of them down a bit too much, especially when they take so many other things into consideration. If they don’t mention it on their site, and there is nothing in Crunchbase et al, you’ll have to ask them down the line.<p>6. Find out more about the appropriate partner at the VC firm whom is involved in your niche. If you can’t find the appropriate partner, aim for the top, and have them point you in the right direction.<p>7. Acquire information about the partner and use it to formulate an email that is about them. I will typically provide a few of my thoughts on something they said in an article. They will be genuine thoughts. No brown-nosing, no compliments for the sake of it, etc, etc.<p>8. Find out the firms current position in the fund life-cycle: are they open to new investments, only open to portfolio synergies, only follow-on funds left, etc.<p>9. If the investor’s portfolio has competitors and&#x2F;or synergies find out where they stand on this. Some will be open to funding competitors, some won’t. If so, find out how things are kept ethical and above board.<p>10. Find out what their investment approval process is; stages, duration, etc.<p>11. Ask them for their due diligence (DD) checklist, and work on that organically. Until then, use this one: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seraf-investor.com&#x2F;compass&#x2F;article&#x2F;seraf-toolbox-due-diligence-checklist\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seraf-investor.com&#x2F;compass&#x2F;article&#x2F;seraf-toolbox-due...<\/a><p>12. DD goes both ways, so find out what you can about them, what they are like after investment.<p>13. Prepare a presentation deck, not a pitch deck, and present it to your team. Let your team know beforehand, and to attempt to trap and flummox you as you walk them through it.<p>14. Update the deck and send it to a few of the investors, and use them as data points. The reason it’s not a pitch deck is because the deck should explicitly state that you’re not looking for funding at this moment in time.<p>15. Send it to ones you either have good relations with, and ones that do not fund in your geographical area. There are some gems out there who will go out of their way to aid you and to give you feedback. Granted they may not know the launch country market, but they will know the startup niche. Basically work your way inwards to the set of investors you are targeting, using the feedback to hone and refine startup &#x2F; deck.<p>16. If you don’t want to slice by geography, or want to start closer to home, slice the investors into tiers. Can be based on many things, niche relevancy, track record, connections, dumb or smart money, etc. Work your inwards from the ones you least want.<p>17. Once you get to the set of investors you are interested in, same thing, not looking for funding yet. If it’s a decent startup &#x2F; deck you could be asked to come in for a chat, or to keep them updated as to your progress.<p>18. If you are going to go down the path of external funding, then investor pre-validation is vital.<p>19. Keep them informed as to your progress, monthly update is fine. Keep it short and to the point. Be brutally honest, so good and bad, hits and misses.<p>20. Even if your angle of approach is for your own startup, keep an eye out for any startups that you think they would be interested in. Same thing with investors and family offices, some of them go solo (or dedicated fund manager), some want to put their funds into a pool.<p>21. When you are ready, send the pitch deck.<p>One last thing, no one ever got funded off a pitch deck. Napkin maybe. but not a deck. It’s a foot in the door at best. Besides, founder(s) of an early stage startup, they’re investing in you.<p>Copied from a place I do not want to promote at the moment.<p>Cheers, Ace."],"time":["2020-02-09 22:45:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["smarri"],"id":[22288575],"kids":{},"parent":[22284025],"text":["Do you need investors?"],"time":["2020-02-10 13:42:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["adamqureshi"],"id":[22285109],"kids":[22285139],"parent":[22284025],"text":["You don&#x27;t find investors.

Here are my lessons.<p>1) work from home is really hard. Home is home, work is work. You need either a fully isolated work room where you only work or go to some co-working space which is work. Dress like you’re going to work. No pajama work days. Best is when you have couple of folks in same city that make a remote satellite office. I’ve seen great success with many satellite offices.<p>2) ensure you have good internet connection, a good headset with noise cancellation mic and speakers, a good camera that works in low light. A good powerful machine. MacBook pros are prolly the most popular.<p>3) Out of sight, out of mind is a real thing. Reply to messages within a certain timeframe, say an hour. I used to have morning hours which was reviews and discussion. I replied immediately and was open to any interruptions. Evening hours I liked to get 3-4 hours of in the zone focus.<p>4) write things down. Google docs, slack, wikis are great tools. For every project I used to have a team doc with overall eagle eye plan + weekly notes. What happened last week? what metrics&#x2F;impact we moved? What we’re gonna do this week, why we’re gonna do it and what metrics&#x2F;impact we think will be made. Anyone could look at the doc and had a good idea where things were headed. Documenting progress is just as important as actually making the progress.<p>5) There’s usually some work timezone where everyone is expected to have at-least 4 hours in common. Make use of that. Set 1:1s, talk about feelings, ideas, overall health of business, kitchen sink conversations etc.<p>6) remote folks sometimes end up being over worked.

I joined to lead our European expansion so from the outset it was clear that I was going to be defacto ‘remote’. Although, at the time it wasn’t discussed as such. What was very obvious was that at the start the responsibility was very much on me to get in front of the people I needed, be heard, aggressively communicate what I wanted&#x2F;needed, wake up early, stay online late, set reminders to ping people before I would go to bed...<p>Then in order to acquire the best talent, the company decided to become remote-friendly (and later remote-first). And more or less immediately I felt the burden of responsibility lifting form our small European team because I (and the European team) was no longer alone in the remote work situation.<p>The moment the company was clear on its intention, the habits started to settle in and everyone seemed to get on the same page. It was quite impressive to watch. But this shift was absolutely intentional and top-down driven.<p>One interesting impact the shift to remote-friendly (which lead us to become remote-first) was the following:<p>An increasing number of people took advantage of this shift, the HQ office slowly started to empty and lost the upbeat and busy atmosphere it once had. The remote attitude also started to extend to people working at HQ and remote became synonymous for ‘Work from home’ and making this a recurring habit was tempting. Seeing as the default was starting to be remote, it mattered far less if the HQ people were physically in the office because all those habits necessary for remote work had settled in.<p>I would certainly avoid the blend of remote work and centralised office because right from the outset it creates two separate cultures. I would advocate for going all in if you are doing in. While we were transitioning we certainly had two cultures.<p>Common mistakes:\n- not being explicit and intentional with the decision\n- not knowing why you are doing this shift in the first place\n- seeing it as a perk rather than a fundamentally new way of working\n- not preparing for such a shift\n- being very clear on what &#x27;remote&#x27; means for your company (how are you defining it)"],"time":["2020-02-12 06:18:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dominotw"],"id":[22282970],"kids":{},"parent":[22282205],"text":["I&#x27;ve worked with teams in india and employees there ( rightly) feel no involvement&#x2F;empathy for the project.

The same thing is true of the “crammed spacing” claim, there is nothing inherent to the floating label that reduces spacing.<p>Finally, the article suggests that “IFTA label” is better by using colour to differentiate between complete and incomplete fields. This manages to ignore well-established research showing users with achromatopsia and low vision won’t be able to differentiate between those states at all since the contrast difference is only 1.25:1! At least unfilled fields with floating labels have no label at all above the field—which is not a great UI clue either, but is at least one that is legible for everybody.

First of all, in many places, divorce rates are declining (as are marriage rates). Second, while I understand the point about how marriage expectations are different now, at least for roughly half the population (women), divorce is much less painful than in the past -- women are less expected &#x2F; forced &#x2F; taught to define themselves as extensions of their husbands and families, have more options, etc., meaning they&#x27;re less likely to be in the &quot;I don&#x27;t know who I am without this&quot; trap.<p>&gt; Not to be outdone by romance, companies also jumped on the identity-producing game. Jobs used to be described in terms of action ... Now they describe a persona ... You no longer merely work at BigCorpInc; you’re a Googler, Postie, Amazonian.<p>On what timescale is this true? Historically, your whole life was defined by your job. That&#x27;s where many last names come from -- something way more permanent that being a &quot;Googler&quot;.

I think people who don&#x27;t like Org mode are partially just overwhelmed. One key is to do as little as you need to and then use the tools available as you find a need for them. One big file works well for that. Or starting with the minimal set of Org mode works well for that.

Business ideas, call stacks of ViEmu bugs that I worked on, passwords, financial forecasts, bug and feature lists, database schemas, tracking of billable time for contracting and consulting work... can&#x27;t recommend it too much. Having a single file is great, I had actually switched from having two separate log files, one from each project, which I had kept during 2005 (one for ViEmu and another for NGEdit, the text editor I was working in that never saw the light of the day but did give birth to ViEmu). Of course, I always edited this file under vim, &quot;murphy&quot; color scheme.

Several great things: text formatting, having separate notes for some things, good mobile integration back then. I tried several options mainly to make sure synchronization would work fine, and really poor conflict resolution on both Apple&#x27;s Notes app and on Evernote got me to adopt OneNote. I&#x27;ve been using it until 2019, OneNote on MacOS has become basically unusable. Input lags like it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s business, rendering it nearly unusable. Mobile does not work well at all any more, especially with large notes. The very non-standard document model together with their MacOS and iOS implementations make it unbearable. A pity, but I couldn&#x27;t wait a few seconds for characters to show after I type them.<p>So, a few months ago, I went back to... using plain text files with vim. I missed some coloring, so I set up some autocmds to color buffers according to some rules. I&#x27;m using a few files (less than 10) to handle different projects and keep them separate, I miss the single file for searching and there are always items that overlap different areas, but i prefer it this way now - plus I do have a &quot;main&quot; catchall file (chautauqua.txt, after Robert Pirsig&#x27;s book reference).<p>This kind of &quot;journalling&quot; is very useful but kind of addictive too, so I&#x27;m sometimes ambivalent about this. I did stop tracking my weight daily after doing it for about 10 years too, I like to stay aware of my weight and somewhat fit but I don&#x27;t want to depend on a daily fix of a Excel spreadsheet to do that.<p>People, do journal and track things if you have never done it, it&#x27;s a boon. Then find your best way, and maybe even do find the areas of your life you don&#x27;t want to keep track of, there is something to be said for that too."],"time":["2020-02-08 20:14:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dolongbien"],"id":[22305811],"kids":{},"parent":[22276184],"text":["me was an Google Sheet, the result is incredibly amazing"],"time":["2020-02-12 05:32:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["graycat"],"id":[22280462],"kids":{},"parent":[22276184],"text":["Yes, one of my best tools is a single text\nfile, FACTS.DAT, that I use to remember\nessentially all little <i>facts<\/i>.<p>What is amazing is the combination of (i)\nhow simple the file is, (ii) how easy it\nis to use, (iii) how little work it took\nto start using it, and (iv) how useful it\nis.<p>I maintain the file, add to it, search it,\nextract from it with my favorite text\neditor KEdit and some macros I wrote for\nKEdit.

However, what&#x27;s perhaps more useful is that the Navy continues to offer a telephone time service (202-762-1401) while NIST does not. Additionally, the GPS time, while operated by the Air Force, is precisely synchronized to the Navy time plus or minus a known offset (due to the decision to no longer apply leap seconds to the GPS constellation to avoid leap-second-related problems).<p>There is some history here. The NIST is interested in timekeeping from a metrological perspective since it is important to many commercial and scientific pursuits. The Navy, on the other hand, has long been interested in accurate timekeeping because it is required for celestial navigation. The transit telescope maintained at the Naval Observatory comes from the legacy of the Naval Observatory as a tool to correctly adjust the clocks used by ships at sea for navigation. Similarly, many of the most significant advances in mechanical timekeeping were spurred by the need for compact and reliable clocks for use at sea.<p>The Navy operates master clock equipment at Schriever AFB for closer proximity to the NIST equipment at Boulder, but the primary means of comparison of the two time bases is by observing the GPS time.

Some key info from the article:<p>----<p>Caixin: Based on your clinical experience, what&#x27;s the disease progression of the new coronavirus?<p>Peng: Lately I&#x27;ve been spending the daytime seeing patients in the ICU, then doing some research in the evenings. I just wrote a thesis. I drew on data from 138 cases that South Central Hospital had from Jan 7 to Jan 28 and attempted to summarise some patterns of the novel coronavirus.<p>A lot of viruses will die off on their own after a certain amount of time. We call these self-limited diseases.<p>I&#x27;ve observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don&#x27;t. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.<p>But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body&#x27;s other organs start to fail, that&#x27;s when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.<p>The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.<p>For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they&#x27;re good.
