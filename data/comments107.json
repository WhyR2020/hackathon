So it compiles down to code - that code just runs the same way you&#x27;d expect any other code to run. Main differences is that it&#x27;s mainly event-driven and that you execute functions only in response to the statecharts <i>changes<\/i> - but at the end of the day you&#x27;re still just executing functions.<p>A very simple example is:<p>doorOpened -&gt; ringBell()<p>ringBell() is only called when the door is opened.<p>What statecharts adds is simply an extra level of indirection where instead of being event -&gt; action(), it&#x27;s event -&gt; state -&gt; action(). Meaning that the state is always checked before executing a function:<p>doorOpened -&gt; opened -&gt; ringBell()<p>This is crucial because emitting doorOpened again may yield different results based on the state of the chart! Let&#x27;s emit it again:<p>doorOpened -&gt; closed -&gt; keepDoorOpen()<p>This extra level of &quot;check&quot; before executing functions may seem trivial but opens the doors to designing quite complex event-driven reactive behavior using a drawing!

If we had 10x as many ventilators, and 100x as much protective equipment, this would be less dangerous. If we had an effective treatment (like a Tamiflu for Covid), then this would be less dangerous.

Here&#x27;s some real advice:<p>1. Don&#x27;t go out unless absolutely necessary.<p>2. If you go out, wear the highest specification mask available to you.<p>3. If you go out, wear the best eye covering available to you.  Sealed goggles are ideal, but even a pair of sunglasses will provide protection.<p>4. If you have to improvise a mask, try to use a filter material better than cotton.  Some ideas: Vacuum Bags, HEPA filters, Furnace Filters, Car Cabin Air Filters.  Try to make a mask that seals well against your face.<p>5. If you have extra masks, donate them.  You may want to wait to donate them until hospitals start routinely disinfecting and reusing their PPE, because otherwise the masks you donate may get used once and thrown out.  Masks donated later may make more of a difference.<p>Do not feel shame about wearing a medical mask out.  The most useless mask is the one that sits on a shelf while its owner is outside getting infected or spreading infection.  You are not denying a healthcare worker a mask by wearing one.  You are being responsible and not getting infected.  If you don&#x27;t infected, you don&#x27;t go to the hospital and infect a healthcare worker.  If you don&#x27;t get infected, you don&#x27;t spread the virus to anyone else, and they don&#x27;t go to the hospital either.<p>Look in your garage.

Almost everyone was getting on their soapbox on social media to shame people who were wearing masks or trying to acquire a mask.<p>Yes I know there’s a difference between an N95 respirator and a cloth mask. But that’s beside the point. If the virus can be transmitted over an air gap, then people should be able to buy whatever face covering they want to contain the risk to themselves or their family maximally. And there’s nothing morally wrong with them trying to acquire the highest degree of protection possible, including N95 respirators.<p>Predictably someone is going to respond to this comment and say that the mask is more necessary for medical professionals or that it is more to prevent particles from exiting your own mouth towards others. The former might be true but it is totally okay for people to want to prioritize their own health. And as for the latter - clearly the reverse transmission is very possible (particles into your mouth&#x2F;nose) and it is just a matter of time before everyone acknowledges this more openly and starts recommending N95s (most likely once supply constraints are alleviated and the lies are no longer needed).<p>Just as a reminder: the WHO, possibly at China’s behest, claimed even as late as the middle of January that the virus wasn’t transmissible between humans, a month after Wuhan doctors observed exactly this. It took several weeks for airborne transmission on particles to be acknowledged.

That being said, there&#x27;s no reason not to do it right and use a mode like GCM with a longer key - most hardware supports acceleration for AES-256 these days.

So the vaunted &quot;software engineering&quot; behind Postgres is not that solid.<p>- Currently Postgres is subject to around a dozen metasploit vulnerabilities that any script-kiddy can execute.<p>The simple fact is, if you use Postgres, you almost certainly have a security compliance problem.<p>I could make the same arguments about replication, or online schema changes, multi-master writes, or any enterprise database feature.<p>Some constructive advice to the Postgres developers is to take a week and add grant commands to limit COPY FROM and COPY TO, and look at the metasploit options and see what can be done ASAP.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate if you&#x27;re itching to write a hasty response that you actually check your facts first.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;How is it possible that everybody else is wrong about Postgres being the best?&quot;, just remember the decade of Mongo fanboism on HN.

I&#x27;ve never had reiki but I have spent some time in hospitals. You know what you NEVER get in a hospital? Someone touching you in a way that isn&#x27;t associated with a (usually painful) medical procedure. There is literally no aspect of hospital life that accommodates human sociality. So the idea that someone comes in to your hospital room and touches you gently and that makes you feel better? OF COURSE it makes you feel better. In the same way that therapy dogs make you feel better. It&#x27;s social touch. It&#x27;s pleasant. It addresses an incredibly deep-seated need in the human psyche, one that if it is not met eventually results in - if nothing else - significant mental health issues.<p>So it seems to me that the right scientific study to do here is not whether reiki improves on (say) chemotherapy outcomes; it&#x27;s whether any sort of touch therapy, including therapy animals or just regular hugs from family, results in improved outcomes."],"time":["2020-04-03 16:12:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nprateem"],"id":[22768207],"kids":[22769891,22769802],"parent":[22764824],"text":["Really there are only 2 positions here:<p>1.

Not many here will pull more comments than points. I cant see the word &quot;Reiki&quot; without hearing &quot;URAMESHI!&quot;<p>To me, most new-age medicine is an exercise in low grade mental programming. By forming and guiding behavior under close supervision, positive reinforcement helps to remake harmful neural short-circuits. By giving your treatment a name, a method, and a history, you are creating a corrective program that is then delicately implanted in the patient, then activated in the physical sessions. If coercive brainwashing and mind-control is black magic, what these people and other similar healers do can best be called white magic. Braincleaning. \nIn the article, they especially note that these treatments are effective on problems that cannot be fixed with surgery or medicine, thus are almost totally in the mind. There is such a thing as psychosomatic illness, and the nervous system doesnt end at the spinal cord. Your muscles have a simple, low-level form of memory in the patterns of nerves and motor neurons, and this extends throughout the body. Sometimes these systems get badly imbalanced, and the body&#x27;s failsafe mechanisms, the sympathetic, parasympathetic, lymphatic and immune systems cannot correct it. Rolfing, chiropractice, and massage techniques act physically on this system to reset muscles and nerves, putting them back into line. By combining a physical regime with psychological correction, you can clear the nervous system of stubborn low-grade  problems.<p>True, in a double-blind experimental setup, it may be difficult or impossible to reproduce the results. This is because the results hinge on a relationship between patient and practitioner, the experimental setup tends to nullify the methods that this relationship advances on.

This seems reasonable to me.<p>Beyond that, we have all sorts of people making all sorts of claims about it in the comments here. The problem, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is if you make a claim without a shred of evidence to back it up then you are practising religion, not science.<p>As far as I can tell, the best anyone can offer so far are flimsy hypotheses, with very few suggestions as to how to test them. And then they try to claim this as some actual truth.<p>Subtle energy?

For example, I watched a really interesting program a while ago about using the placebo effect to help people with back problems. They took a large group of people who had ongoing back troubles and told them they were giving them a new medicine to help with back pain. Half were given the medicine and half were given the placebo, except they were all given the placebo because there was no new medicine. On top of that half out of each group were given very short, brusque, medical appointments (as we are normally used to these days) and half were given longer appointments with doctors that spent time talking to them and listening to them.<p>Despite everyone being given a placebo, some made really dramatic recoveries, and many made at least minor improvements. And those who were cared for more seemed to make better recoveries than those who were given short appointments.<p>There is so much about the placebo effect and how we can heal ourselves that we do not understand even in the slightest yet.<p>I could give you carrots mashed in rabbit urine and swear blind that it has been proven to cure headaches.

Reiki is different from mindfulness and meditation (which my dad taught me when I was 7) but not unlike them, is tied to healing activities practiced since ancient times and has many psychological, or even evolutionary, explanations on where its benefits come from.

I guess I know how the bitcoin guys feel.<p>But I found out my aunt and uncle owned about a hundred acres near Klamath Falls. And they were cool with me doing whatever out there. Tons of lumber and there was already a well. So over a summer we built a cabin with working plumbing and a septic tank. And by cabin I mean the unibomber would have considered it a downgrade. We had no clue about what we were doing.<p>But it was fun to camp out and build something, even if it was shit. That was about as far as we got. There is now a rotting log cabin out there."],"time":["2020-04-03 10:42:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["numbsafari"],"id":[22767854],"kids":[22769975,22772968],"parent":[22766328],"text":["I enrolled my wife and I in a local Permaculture Design Course as part of a Christmas present (she got us into bees last year).

Permaculture is a design method based in a set of simple ethics, that lead to a set of basic principles, that help you select, adapt, and use various practices.<p>Is there a “earth share, people share, fair share” set of ethics that could become the basis for how you solve tech problems?

The contrast lead Grothendieck to eventually leave Paris, in October of 1949 on the advice of Cartan and Weil who recommended he instead travel to Nancy to work with Schwartz and Dieudonné on functional analysis.<p>And this was a guy whose internal mathematical drive was strong enough to independently discover measure theory as a teenager!<p>Then there are all the other &quot;failures&quot; absent from a short biographical blurb: he finished his PhD &quot;with few prospects for employment after his graduation in 1953&quot;, then &quot;planned to write a book on topological vector spaces, but it never materialized&quot;, spent a year failing to solve the &quot;approximation problem&quot;, despaired that the field of his thesis was &quot;dead&quot;, pivoted away from analysis, rest is history, etc."],"time":["2020-04-03 20:00:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stareatgoats"],"id":[22767430],"kids":[22768960,22772531,22767775],"parent":[22766691],"text":["An interesting, and sad story: that such a beautiful mind ended up with paranoia.

A test based on the sense of smell would have a very high amount of noise. There is no good, concrete measure of a person&#x27;s sense of smell. One has to ask the person to get a &quot;measurment&quot; and it&#x27;s very hard to know what different people would mean by &quot;I can smell fine&quot; or &quot;I can&#x27;t smell as well as I used to&quot;.<p>Maybe some people would convince themselves they have no sense of smell (like some people convince themselves they are gluten or lactose &quot;intolerant&quot;).
