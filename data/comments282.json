There are several reasons why individual secondhand bookshops are on the way out, but Oxfam is not a particularly significant one.<p>I am honestly puzzled by the author citing the Oxfam shop on St Giles as an exemplar, because it&#x27;s a poor shop full of tat and tired old guidebooks to Greece in the 1960s. Even the Oxfam bookshop 15 miles up the road in little Chipping Norton has more interesting stock. But it&#x27;s interesting that he cites an Oxford example, because independent retail in Oxford generally has been on the decline for 20+ years, and I suspect the woes of the secondhand bookshops in Oxford are the same as those of small retailers generally.<p>Abebooks and Amazon, eBay etc. are a more significant cause. You can now order the rare book you want from a dealer somewhere in the countryside without them needing to pay for retail premises. One of my favourite secondhand bookshops, Sedgeberrow Books in Pershore, has recently gone that way - the shop has closed but the operation lives on as an Abebooks dealer. Pershore still has a secondhand bookshop, which is a lovely relic that doesn&#x27;t even take debit&#x2F;credit cards.

On the tech side, it was interesting to see online marketplaces taking off, how ordinary people use computers, the sorry state of single-purpose software meant for a small group of paying customers.

There&#x27;s been some consolidation, and they got bought by--who else--Amazon, but I ordered something from them recently, and as far as I could tell, it wasn&#x27;t just Amazon sellers. Amazon and Ebay looked like huge markets to tap, we we never had much luck on either. Ebay, especially around 2000, was more auction-oriented, and those work great for mid-price, in-demand products. For books, to hit the price range for making a good listing make sense, it would have to be rare, but how many people are in the market for a first edition of &quot;The Jungle.&quot; The smaller marketplaces made more sense because that&#x27;s where the buyers were. It was a hard business, even then. The bookstore closed its storefront and moved everything into a second home because the rent&#x2F;mortgage was cheaper. The other thing that became clear is that &quot;rare&quot; books weren&#x27;t as rare as people thought once they started surfacing online, so prices dropped. I have no idea how Amazon sellers selling copies of old, but popular books for $2 can turn a profit.

What gems by marginalised authors might we not have read without this &quot;excess&quot; of publishing? Personally, I think this abundance of new published writing (including really interesting examples of self-publishing like Your Name Here by Helen Dewitt) is part of what makes second-hand bookshops less attractive. There is simply so much great stuff being written now by people who would never previously have had an audience, as well as unjustly-neglected authors being rediscovered. I used to feel like I knew most fiction authors&#x27; names in second-hand bookshops, even if only by reputation, but I&#x27;m not sure that would be the case any more. On balance I think I&#x27;d rather have a broader set of voices than a limited selection of second-hand books. And when you also have access to older titles that you might be interested in on abebooks, you can follow your own literary path rather than be guided by someone else&#x27;s opinions about what&#x27;s &quot;important&quot;.<p>Edit: Thinking about this more, maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in my late 40s now, but I get a lot of good recommendations from friends who have been reading all their lives, so I don&#x27;t feel the need for anyone else to recommend things. My &quot;to read&quot; pile is huge as it is! I guess one thing second-hand shops were good for was suggesting things to me that I might not have read otherwise. But personally I think the internet, particularly Wikipedia and niche blogs, gives me a really good route to the next thing I want to read. After reading Bruno Schulz I&#x27;ve started delving into Polish fiction, and it feels like I&#x27;ve struck yet another goldmine."],"time":["2020-08-24 00:35:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GnarfGnarf"],"id":[24255538],"kids":{},"parent":[24251417],"text":["Another problem is that retiring boomers are keen on downsizing, and are flooding the market with used books, for which there is little demand."],"time":["2020-08-23 23:46:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["orionblastar"],"id":[24257585],"kids":{},"parent":[24251417],"text":["Second Hand books get recycled or donated to thrift stores or bought out in bulk and sold on Amazon for pennies with $5 shipping.

Time passed and most cities had UBS shops.\nThen the internet happened, craigslist EBAY, etc., which enabled anyone +dog to list all they had as line items, author, date, condition etc - often with photos. This enabled the collector to select what he wanted at very low prices compared to the UBS stores, as there was a huge overhanging mass of books that people wanted small $$ for - competition soon drove the prices down. True rare books maintained a higher value - but the mass of pulpable junk swamped the market. USB could not easily bulk buy from these Ebayers or Craigslisters because their business model required them to offer lowball offers.\nOne by one these UBS died off.

In situations of bullying, people who remain silent may be afraid, may be disenfranchised in some other way to make them powerless, or may simply feel powerless. I&#x27;ve been seeing arguments like this crop up in other contexts as well, from social issues to personal disputes and it&#x27;s more than just wrong, it can also be tactically unsound, and can lead to worse social outcomes.<p>In terms of tactics: the organizer who uses this tactic is trying to accomplish two things, they&#x27;re trying to rile up their supporters and they&#x27;re trying to recruit new supporters. This tactic is extremely successful in the former, by artificially generating a new out-group to unite against: the innocent bystander. The tactic of attacking bystanders is however abysmal at recruiting new supporters, no matter one&#x27;s beliefs, they&#x27;re less likely to side with the person pointing the finger at them.<p>Use of this tactic has bad social outcomes for the very same reason. Getting pepople riled up makes them less likely to make logical decisions, it makes them more likely to turn to violence, it makes them more likely to entrench their views and polarize.<p>Given all this, why do people use this tactic when they&#x27;re trying to rally people? Why would you spend energy attacking people with no power to help? Unfortunately there&#x27;s a perverse incentive to do so. When your supporters are fervent, they support you more wholeheartedly, increasing their financial contribution as well as contributing to your power. For the supporter, it <i>feels<\/i> like you&#x27;re helping when you attack people, period, whether they&#x27;re actually your opponent or not, and the innocent bystander is both powerless to stop your attack and is less likely to fight back.

Here are a few examples of question overlap, for context.<p><pre><code>    Test Question:  who plays max voice in a goofy movie\n    Train Question: who does max voice in a goofy movie\n    Answer:         Jason Marsden\n\n    Test Question:  when will the 2018 oscar nominations be announced\n    Train Question: when are the oscar nominations for 2018 announced\n    Answer:         January 23 2018\n\n    Test Question:  who has scored more goals in the premier league\n    Train Question: most goals scored by a premier league player\n    Answer:         Alan Shearer\n\n    Test Question:  where are the cones in the eye located\n    Train Question: where are cone cells located in the eye\n    Answer:         retina\n\n    Test Question:  who led the conquest of the incas in south america\n    Train Question: conquistador who defeated the incan empire in peru\n    Answer:         francisco pizarro\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt makes sense that questions like these are especially susceptible to brute memorization. These are certainly bugs in the benchmark—and, in fact, about a third of questions in each dataset have this issue.<p>The paper also considers answer overlap; that is, when the answer to the question also occurs in the training set. This alone does not imply memorization, but it does open the door for some shortcuts. Some examples from the paper are:<p><pre><code>    Open Natural Questions\n    Duplicated: Phil Simms, Brian Johnson, 8, the Indians, the 1830s\n    Unique:     Cloves, Matt Monro, 1,020 – 1,080 kg, Hermann Ebbinghaus, Matt Flinders\n\n    TriviaQA\n    Duplicated: David Bowie, Battle of camlann, Heligoland, Henry VII, Niagra Falls\n    Unique:     Death in the afternoon, Clash of the Titans, ice-cream sundae, Camshaft, Cumberland\n\n    WebQuestions\n    Duplicated: Harvard, Alderaan, India, 2011, Zeus\n    Unique:     Queen Victoria, Braslia, Paddington, Tom Corbett, Gary\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt&#x27;s less obvious how to treat answer overlap. In particular, removing answer overlap might bias the dataset towards harder questions. Some of the reduction in model scores is presumably because models have to work harder to understand the question, as merely looking for topical similarities will be ineffective, but it also removes questions whose answers are general enough to apply to many questions, like ‘8’, ‘the 1930s’, ‘Harvard’, ‘2011’, etc. This means that reductions in the score don&#x27;t clearly say how much cheating happened. However, the success of the BERT-based Nearest Neighbor model, which retrieves the answer of the most semantically similar fine-tuning sample, scores similarly to BART, which seems much too high for comfort.<p>It should be noted that a lot of the discussions about causal knowledge and intelligence aren&#x27;t too relevant to these questions, as they are largely tests of memory or retrieval. It is expected that these models answer the questions by searching their training data or their document index. The issue is that their training data isn&#x27;t meant to contain copies of the test questions, just the information sufficient to answer them."],"time":["2020-08-24 01:17:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rndmize"],"id":[24252755],"kids":[24254742,24256496,24256527],"parent":[24249949],"text":["I bet this kind of mess is exactly what Zuck was trying to avoid when he didn&#x27;t want to implement free speech restrictions or fact checking, because there&#x27;s no solution to be found here - if you don&#x27;t mark anti climate change material as false, your fact checkers are worthless and you&#x27;re kowtowing to political&#x2F;moneyed elements that are against it; and if you do, those elements will declare you biased, claim censorship, and seek political action.

Your users WILL notice and complain about performance. Instead, use the native WebBrowser control in .NET for Windows and WebView using macOS to display your UI. Disable right clicking and highlighting using HTML&#x2F;JS. To the user, it&#x27;ll feel like any other native app. Add this meta tag to the HTML file to ensure the WebBrowser control knows to use new versions of IE to render the UI: &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;x-ua-compatible&quot; content=&quot;ie=edge&quot;&gt; (and&#x2F;or look up how to add the FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION registry key)<p>3) Use the built in script calling functions to transfer settings back and forth between the UI and main app in JSON. Do the back end stuff in native code.<p>4) You can then re-use most of the UI code you wrote to easily port over to macOS. Use the same functions and logic you wrote on Windows to make your Swift functions.<p>* I&#x27;ve been making a living from building&#x2F;maintaining my desktop application for about 5 years and had no regrets setting it up this way.

On one end there is Electron which makes it easy to build but then if its a trivial app and your users are not likely to &#x27;ve faster machines - your users are likely to suffer. Chrome the culprit is pretty much a joke. And on the other end there is QT, GTK which are awful to say the least.<p>* More than building, it is the publishing these apps that is painful which gets rarely discussed here. It costs you both time and money. By time, on how bureaucratic the process is involved in procuring the SSL from a licensed vendor, its verification and so on. And money to get the code signing licenses which are separate for both MAC and windows. And good luck publishing them without code signing - apss will be treated like malware by OS. However popular apps still go ahead and do this (notepad++ etc)<p>I would say use electron if you do not have sufficient resources to build natively for every OS. With some webpack optimizations you can squeeze in the app size to less than 300 MB but many electron apps without these optimizations go upto 650+ MB.  Or else build it for MAC&#x2F;Windows - release and see your adoption and take the next step.<p>[1] : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xgenecloud&#x2F;xgenecloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xgenecloud&#x2F;xgenecloud<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-23 17:40:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lukevp"],"id":[24253579],"kids":[24253751],"parent":[24242412],"text":["People dislike electron because they are using apps where it is not implemented well. Javascript is single threaded and blocks rendering when it’s executing, just like most major UI frameworks. You have to run everything outside the main UI thread and marshal data back to the renderer. In JS the furthest most go is using promises with async&#x2F;await, which lets you not block during a long-running request, but the continuation callback is still executing within the same thread. If you implemented an app using a web worker internally and kept the main thread just dispatching events and doing quick render updates, it would perform amazingly well. CSS and JS are crazy efficient, there is no reason that an electron app can’t refresh at 144hz. The limitations are purely architectural. Most other UI frameworks put all deferred callbacks into a separate execution context and force martialing (eg in WPF, having to use dispatcher.BeginInvoke). JS doesn’t force this but is possible.<p>The ram usage is going to be higher than a native app, and so is the exe size. Those issues can’t be comparable. but the performance of the electron itself is not so poor as people believe.

One issue with solar panels right now I&#x27;d imagine is that even 25 years and the ROI are quite long periods of time for many Americans who don&#x27;t plan on staying in their houses for that long and solar isn&#x27;t mainstream enough that people appreciate the value it adds."],"time":["2020-08-23 20:29:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moneytide1"],"id":[24253954],"kids":{},"parent":[24253534],"text":["Is there a way to mass-disassemble panels and replace the cells?

Changing these could make an enormous difference in bringing new ideas and different perspectives to the Pentagon. Making pay more competitive would be great, too, but that is not the primary problem. Many will exchange a certain amount of compensation for a chance to work on vitally important matters and to serve their country, if only the system encouraged their recruitment.<p>The clearance process takes so long that hiring someone without a clearance usually results in a months-long (could be over a year) wait before they can actually start their job. Given that the nature of the job is a key attraction, and the pay is often mediocre compared to private-sector alternatives, this is a losing proposition for many people.<p>It&#x27;s even worse if the clearance doesn&#x27;t come through. For many first- or second-generation Americans with family living abroad, this is a distinct possibility. The clearance process is opaque enough, as well, that people who experimented with recreational drugs in college can&#x27;t be sure if they&#x27;ll qualify or not. If your clearance doesn&#x27;t come through, your resume now has a long &quot;hole,&quot; and you have to explain to future potential employers that you had to leave your last job because e.g. you have grandparents and cousins in Indonesia or you tried cocaine twice when you were 19.<p>Those risks simply aren&#x27;t worth it for many people."],"time":["2020-08-23 16:10:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["panzagl"],"id":[24252778],"kids":{},"parent":[24251420],"text":["Pentagon culture is a subculture of the military, an influential one, but hardly as dominant as portrayed.<p>Wifi, cell service and laptops are mostly distractions in an acquisition environment.

Right now, there are a myriad of broken, old, difficult to upgrade systems that prevent basically any significant innovation from taking place in the payment transfer landscape. This has been commented on a lot. But I think it&#x27;s important to step back a bit and understand <i>why<\/i> that is.<p>Finance is dominated by extremely large, extremely risk averse institutions, that all compete with one another. Any one of them certainly has the resources to develop &quot;the app store&quot; for finance, but the problem is that all the other ones are incentivized not to adopt it. JPMorgan doesn&#x27;t want BofA to own the app store for finance, and so they will never integrate with it.<p>This is, fundamentally, a tragedy of the commons. All these big institutions, and all of us customers would benefit from some unified, universal financial platform. But nobody can build it, because every actor in a position to doesn&#x27;t want to accept anyone else owning such an important choke point.<p>So what happens? Well, we get standards imposed by the only actor in the space powerful enough to create something like this: governments. Governments are, in general, not great at this sort of thing, and they certainly aren&#x27;t very fast moving, or responsive to consumer demand.<p><i>This<\/i>, is the problem that blockchain solves. We all know that anything you can do on Ethereum you can do in a relational database 1000x more efficiently and better. Better in every way except one: Ownership. Any traditional relational database is going to be <i>owned by someone<\/i>. Public blockchains are owned by no-one. JPMorgan can build applications on top of Ethereum or Bitcoin, not because they need its technical capabilities, but because Bank of America doesn&#x27;t own it.<p>This is the critical insight to understanding why this stuff is important and valuable. It solves the coordination problem imposed by platforms. Platforms have tremendous value to users and efficiency, but they confer far too much power upon their owner for any financial institution to use a platform owned by another. The ability to make a &#x27;financial commons&#x27; that is not owned by any one institution, government, or entity is what makes this technology powerful and useful."],"time":["2020-08-23 07:52:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["valenciarose"],"id":[24264143],"kids":{},"parent":[24249477],"text":["Every jurisdiction regulates financial institutions for good reasons (yes, also some bad reasons).

Take the chance and set up your own infrastructure!<p>One reason why our web became so successful is Decentralization. But, in recent years I feel like we are heading to more and more centralized web, where only a few big companies control the entire ecosystem. Take email and instant messaging as an example. Everybody can maintain it&#x27;s own, independent mail service, but everybody can still communicate with each other. On the other hand there are very few messaging services that are totally incompatible to each other. Depending on where you live, you might only use iMessage, Whatsapp or WeChat. Even tough it may be technically possible to use other services like Signal or Threema, you are most definitively going to experience a lot inconveniences. In my personal bubble only very few use these apps and as if that were not enough, these few users are also distributed across a wide variety of different services. If it were like mail, everybody could use his&#x2F;her preferred messaging system and still talk to each other.<p>Thats only one example and I dont want our web to be like Whatsapp in a few years from now.

Therefore, by means of such experiments he ascertained that the weights by which all tones on equal strings .. were reciprocally as the squares of the lengths of the string by which the musical instrument emits the same tones. But the proportion discovered by these experiments, on the evidence of Macrobius, he applied to the heavens and consequently by comparing those weights with the weights of the Planets and the lengths of the strings with the distances of the Planets, he understood by means of the harmony of the heavens that the weights of the Planets towards the Sun were reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the Sun.&quot;<p>This article has more:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1098\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1098<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-23 16:57:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["growlist"],"id":[24238691],"kids":[24245596,24243104],"parent":[24233820],"text":["Pages 43 and 44!<p>Although by some accounts Newton could be pretty nasty, a quick look at this almost makes me feel sorry for him given the advancement of his mind versus the state of knowledge at the time.

Anything that is &quot;something else&quot; should at the very least be questioned. Questions 10x if the party doing &quot;something else&quot; is trying to <i>encourage<\/i> information asymmetry as part of this. e.g. Apple telling app developers that not only can they not integrate another payment option in their apps, they can&#x27;t even <i>inform<\/i> users that such an option exists elsewhere.<p>Arguably the main issue in this case is that Apple is not just requiring themselves to be the payment gateway in transactions where they are involved (getting an app onto your device), they also want to insert themselves into transactions where they provide no value (e.g. subscriptions). In the case of my Spotify subscription, Apple is not paying for bandwidth, payment processing costs, or anything else, but they still get a cut.<p>If you&#x27;re capturing value from a transaction you&#x27;re not directly involved in, I think that&#x27;s a problem. Apple&#x27;s argument is that they are enabling such things by building the device&#x2F;operating system, and historically that has been a valid argument, but I think we&#x27;ve come to the point where that just isn&#x27;t enough anymore.

Very unfortunately life is often filled with suffering and miseries and most (including myself) would often get blinded and overlook the nice things, as well as its game-like nature.<p>Perhaps getting into one of these man-made simulators is not that bad of a thing, especially if it engages the social module and in some way enriches the overall gameplay of life.<p>I think many progresses in science &amp; technologies are often hindered by our tendencies to not appreciate games.
