Is tesseract.js pure JavaScript?<p>Yes, it is 100% JavaScript and it leverages Webassembly port of original tesseract-ocr. (means we compile the C sorce code to JavaScript Webassembly code, powered by Emscripten)<p>2. The accuracy of tesseract.js is poor.<p>In my experience, it is hard to get perfect results without applying additional techniques to your source images. You may need to some preprocessing and sometimes train a custom traineddata. It is not easy, but it is the price of high accuracy.<p>3. Cloud OCR service is much more accurate<p>Yes, that&#x27;s true. But tesseract.js provides an in browser offline option to do your OCR, it is useful for scenarios like PWA and high confidential image content (which you don&#x27;t want to send to server). Tesseract.js is not a silver bullet, but it is handy sometimes.<p>Hope you enjoy this library and feel free to leave any comment to us!"],"time":["2019-12-22 01:49:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bhanhfo"],"id":[21844795],"kids":{},"parent":[21843713],"text":["Related Chrome extension:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;project-naptha&#x2F;molncoemjfmpgdkbdlbjmhlcgniigdnf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;project-naptha&#x2F;mol...<\/a><p>Another extension (not using Tesseract.JS):\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;copyfish-%F0%9F%90%9F-free-ocr-soft&#x2F;eenjdnjldapjajjofmldgmkjaienebbj?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;copyfish-%F0%9F%90...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-20 16:25:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[21846200],"kids":{},"parent":[21843713],"text":["A thread from 2016: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12694004\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12694004<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-20 19:18:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gwbas1c"],"id":[21845597],"kids":[21847084],"parent":[21843713],"text":["I&#x27;m curious about the performance tradeoffs of Javascript versus native code?<p>A few weeks ago, I tried writing something that was long-running, CPU intense, ect, in a webworker.

I used it to trade all sorts of things (FI, credit, equities, fx, derivs on all those) and there was always some convenient function you could type in to give you a calculator for whatever it was. Whatever derivatives model you found in a textbook, you could find it in the terminal. With relevant data loaded in.<p>- Data is convenient too. Once you know how to work the API, you can pull a huge amount of data. A lot of it is available elsewhere, but nowhere has so much in one place, in one API.<p>- They are very serious about you not sharing the terminal or the data. Obviously once you have the data in a text file, they can&#x27;t do much about that, but they do limit the amount you can download, and then they phone you once you trigger something. Sounds like a warning, but also a sales call at the same time.<p>- It&#x27;s not so easy to share the terminal itself. The standard tricks like installing it on a VM, or installing remote desktop &#x2F; VNC won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m sure someone has figured it out, but it&#x27;s not as easy as sharing most other software services. They&#x27;d be fine with a small business sharing a terminal though, as long as it stayed on one machine that different staff would take turns on. And in case you thought a Bloomberg Anywhere would solve it for your distributed team, that used to use a special biometric device. Not sure if it&#x27;s still there.<p>- Chats I&#x27;m guessing are not nearly as interesting as a few years ago, before the revelations about what was being said.

And it warns you if you&#x27;re about to send a swear word, heh.<p>- A lot of small firms use the terminal to trade directly with counterparties, there&#x27;s a whole OTC infrastructure in there. I never used it much but all the banks had their own Bloomberg pages for doing trades in all sorts of things with them.<p>- In terms of infrastructure, you can get a dedicated line for your bbg, they come and stick some stuff into your rack. This can fail over to internet if you want, simply a matter of changing the config on the app and phoning them. Also IIRC you can get a special data server, depending on whether the guy above scared you into buying one.<p>- The help function is for users, not coders. You&#x27;ll wait for ages while the agent on the helpdesk figures out that he doesn&#x27;t understand your problem if you&#x27;re a coder.

It&#x27;s always frustrating when I try to do development in an interactive way, and finds out that hooking on jupyter-notebook (whether the language is Python or Node.JS or etc...) is the best way.<p>I think there should be a better integration between editors &amp; REPLs, something like Common Lisp &amp; Emacs SLIME. SLIME queries a server running on Common Lisp to incrementally compile &amp; evaluate code from the editor (like LSP, but not autocomplete queries but evaluation queries). I hope the LSP protocol gains ability to evaluate code for languages with REPLs, it would be awesome if it allows interactive development in multiple editors &amp; multiple languages (like how LSP is facilitating autocomplete)."],"time":["2019-12-20 18:50:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xvilka"],"id":[21846570],"kids":{},"parent":[21834368],"text":["Worth mentioning there is an emerging scientific computational framework Owl[1][2] and interesting concept of using OCaml-based languages for more formal protocol or logic description with Imandra[3].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.xyz<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owlbarn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owlbarn<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imandra.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imandra.ai<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-20 20:03:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mark_l_watson"],"id":[21846579],"kids":{},"parent":[21834368],"text":["Really nice.

I was in Liberia at the time, from December 2016 through June 2017, doing a project for the Liberia Ministry of Health, and got acquainted with some people working for Cellcom. I also gained a great friend in one member of my team, who later worked briefly for Lonestar and is now employed by Orange. There aren&#x27;t that many opportunities for a young developer in Liberia outside of NGOs (fickle) and the telecoms. Obviously I forwarded the article to him (coincidentally, Israel is his name).<p>Liberia&#x27;s history is quite interesting indeed, and I actually like to compare it with the state of Israel -- both are the result of an unholy alliance of people wanting to help, on the one hand, and get rid of, on the other, another people in &quot;their&quot; land: African descendants in the USA, and Jewish people in Europe.<p>I went back to live in Liberia for three months earlier this year, to try and trace some ancestors of a family member. Things are dire, indeed, with an economy hit hard by the Ebola crisis, on top of years of military rule, civil war, corruption and abuse.<p>Apart from being used for resources, mainly by Firestone (now Bridgestone) for rubber, but also iron (Arcelor Mittal) and gold (large parts of which is being smuggled to UAE), it remains a strategic interest for the US (their presence is still huge, with CIA&#x27;s only listening post in Africa), meanwhile trade is controlled by the Indian and Lebanese communities.<p>Also of interest is that some Cherokee opted to join the free African Americans, with one ending up a chief of the Vai tribe, and possibly inspiring the Vai script with knowledge of the Cherokee script, recently posted here on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21737230\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21737230<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-20 22:51:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwaway666555"],"id":[21846950],"kids":[21848539],"parent":[21845375],"text":["Throwaway for obvious reasons.

More than a half-million security cameras around the world tried to connect to a handful of servers used by Lonestar Cell MTN, a local mobile phone operator, and Lonestar’s network was overwhelmed. Internet access for its 1.5 million customers slowed to a crawl, then stopped.<p>On a more serious note,this is seriously exaggerated. Internet penetration(mostly mobile  broadband) was 21% during this period and was split between LoneStarCell, Cellcom, the govt carrier - Libtelco and smaller ISPs. For a population of 4.5m people, 21% meant each mobile operator had less than 500k Internet subscribers.<p>The post-apocalyptic description of the impact of the DDoS doesn&#x27;t fit the feeling in that period ( Nov &#x27;16). Friends from outside Liberia reached out (ironically over WhatsApp) to ask whether Liberia&#x27;s Internet was cut off. I checked and saw international media reporting an Internet shutdown which was even more confusing. After emailing a couple of friends at various ISPs and the regulator, I finally got confirmation that LoneStar was under attack. Apparently, they were keeping it a secret. It did not make national news for another 2 months until the formal complaint and lawsuits were filed. Mobile broadband was very patchy back then so perhaps people just assumed it was the usual state of affairs. Now, we have LTE on both operators and an upcoming pre-5G operator.<p>Source: I&#x27;m from and have been based in Liberia (2015-present) and used to manage services at the national Internet exchange during that period.<p>National Regulator: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emansion.gov.lr&#x2F;doc&#x2F;CONSULTATION-DOCUMENT.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emansion.gov.lr&#x2F;doc&#x2F;CONSULTATION-DOCUMENT.pdf<\/a>\nExport.Gov: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.export.gov&#x2F;article?id=Liberia-Telecommunications-Services\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.export.gov&#x2F;article?id=Liberia-Telecommunications...<\/a>\nTwitter Thread: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;tksiakor&#x2F;status&#x2F;794863602230558720\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;tksiakor&#x2F;status&#x2F;79486360223055872...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-21 08:28:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["barli"],"id":[21845378],"kids":[21846640],"parent":[21845375],"text":["Actually hacker related stuff.."],"time":["2019-12-20 17:38:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["barli"],"id":[21847457],"kids":{},"parent":[21845375],"text":["I read some more info on him from Krebs&#x27; blog.

First of all, it was not Jason A. Donenfeld, the author of Wiregard, which added the ChaCha20-based cryptographic random number to Linux.  It was me, as the maintainer of Linux&#x27;s random number generator.  The specific git commit in question can be found at [1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux.git&#x2F;commit&#x2F;?id=e192be9d9a30555aae2ca1dc3aad37cba484cd4a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;lin...<\/a><p>Secondly, I think a lot of people have forgotten what things were like in the early 90&#x27;s.  Back then encryption software was still export controlled, so we couldn&#x27;t put DES (AES wasn&#x27;t released until 2001) into the kernel without triggering all sorts of very onerous US government restrictions (and Europe was guilty of this too, thanks to the Wassenaar Agreement); you couldn&#x27;t just put things up on an FTP. Also, back then, there was much less public understanding of\ncryptography; the NSA definitely knew a lot more about cryptoanalysis that in the public world, and while it was known by 1996 that MD5 had Problems, there wasn&#x27;t huge trust that the NSA hadn&#x27;t put a back door into SHA-1 which was designed by them with zero explanation about its design principles.<p>This is why the original PGP implementation, as well as the Linux Kernel random number generator, was very much focused on entropy estimation.  We knew that it was potentially problematic, but then again, so was relying on cryptographic algorithms that were poitentially suspect.  There was a good reason why in the 90&#x27;s, it was generally considered a very good idea to be algorithm agile; there simply wasn&#x27;t a lot of trust in crypto design, and people wnated to be able to swap out cryptographic algorithms if it was found that some algorithm (e.g., like MD4, and later MD5) was found to be insecure.  So the snide comments about people not trusting algorithms seems to miss the point that even amongst the experts in the field --- for example, at the Security Area Directorate at the IETF, of which I was a member during that time --- there was a lot of thinking about how we could deploy upgrades if it were found that some crypto algorithm had a fatal weakness, and we would need to swap out crypto suites with minimal interoperability issues.<p>Unfortunately, being able to negotiate crypto suites leads to downgrade attacks, such as we&#x27;ve seen with TLS --- but what people forget is that when the original SSL&#x2F;TLS algorithm suites were designed, people thought they were good!  It was only later that some crypto suites were found to be insecure, leading to the downgrade attack issues.  But it also shows that people were <i><\/i><i>right<\/i><i><\/i> to be skeptical about crpyto algorithms in that era.<p>Since then, we&#x27;ve learned a lot more about cryptographic algorithm design, and so people are a lot more confident that algorithms can be relied upon to be secure --- or, at least, other issues are much more likely to be weak link.  That&#x27;s why Wireguard is designed without any ability to negotiate algorithms, and as a result, it makes it <i>much<\/i> simpler than IPSEC.  And it&#x27;s probably the right choice for 2019.  (At least, until Quantuum Computing wipes out most of our existing crypto algorithms; but that&#x27;s a rant for another day.)<p>As far as monitoring entropy levels in Linux, in general, the primary reason why we need it is because even if we are willing to invest a lot of faith into the ChaCha20 CRNG, we still need to provide a secure random number seed from <i>somewhere<\/i>.  And that can be tricky.  If you fully trust a hardware random number generator, then sure, no worries.  Or if you are using a cloud provider, so you <i>have<\/i> to trust the hypervisor anyway, then using virtio-rng to get randomness from the cloud provider is fine.  (If you cloud provider wants to screw you, they can just reach into the guest memory or intercept network or disk traffic at boot time, so if you don&#x27;t trust not to backdoor virtio-rng, you shouldn&#x27;t be using the cloud provider at all.)<p>As far as whether or not to trust RDRAND, the blog post seems to assume that it&#x27;s absurd to trust that NSA couldn&#x27;t possibly have backdoored the CPU instruction.  On the author hand, there are those who remember DUAL-EC-DRBG, where most people <i>do<\/i> now believe the NSA did put in a backdoor.  And Snowden revelations did show that NSA teams were putting backdoors into Cisco routers by intercepting them between when they are shipped and when they were delivered.  So given that you can&#x27;t audit the Intel CPU&#x27;s RDRAND, and Intel <i>is<\/i> a US company, it&#x27;s not <i>that<\/i> insane to perhaps have some qualms about RDRAND.  After all, if you were using a chip provided from a Chinese company (where the owner of said company miight also have been a high ranking general in the PLA), or a CPU provided by a Russian company controlled by a Russian Oligarch who is good friends with Putin and\nwho also had a background from the KGB --- is it <i>really<\/i> insane to be worried about those CPU&#x27;s?  Let&#x27;s not even talk about concerns over China and 5G telephony equipment.  Why is it then completely absurd for some people to be considered about the complete inauditability of RDRAND, and the fact that no functional or statistical test can determine whether or not there is a backdoor or not?<p>Of course, if you really don&#x27;t trust a CPU, you should simply not use it.  But creating a CPU from scratch, using only 74XX TTL chips really isn&#x27;t a practical solution.  (When I was an undergraduate at MIT, we did it as part of an intro CS class; but MIT doesn&#x27;t make its CS students do that any more.)  So the best we can try to do is to try to spread out the entropy sources; that way, even if source 1 might be compromised, if it is being mixed with source 2 and source 3, hopefully at least one of them is secure.  (Or maybe source 1 is backdoored by the NSA, and the source 2 is backdoored by the Chinese MSS, but if we hash it all together, hopefully the result will only be vulnerability if the NSA and MSS work together, which hopefully is highly improbable.)<p>The bottom line is that it&#x27;s complicated.  Of course I agree that we should use a CRNG for most purposes.  But we still have to figure out good ways of seeding a CRNG.  And in case the kernel memory gets compromised and read by an attacker, or if there is a theoretical vulnerability in the CRNG, it&#x27;s good practice to periodically reseed the CRNG.  And so that means you still need to have an entropy pool and some way of measuring how much entropy you think you have accumulated, and how much has been possibly revealed (&quot;used&quot;) for reseeding purposes.  In a perfect world, of course, assuming that we had perfectly trustworthy hardware to get an initial seed, and in a world where we are 100% sure that algorithms are bug free(tm), then a lot of this isn&#x27;t necessary.  But we in real world engineering, we have safety margins because sometimes theory breaks down in the face of reality...."],"time":["2019-12-21 00:56:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tptacek"],"id":[21848137],"kids":[21848568],"parent":[21843081],"text":["This is Thomas Pornin, by the way, from whom I and many others have learned a lot, and whose original Stack Exchange answer† about random vs. urandom set me and presumably Thomas Huhn (there&#x27;s something about urandom and Thomases) tilting against this Linux windmill with our respective urandom advocacy pages, both of which pop up on HN every couple of months.<p>This article is authoritative and also covers some recent updates, like Jason Donenfeld&#x27;s work on the Linux RNG, is well worth a read, and hopefully will show up on HN at least as often as me and Thomas Huhn&#x27;s.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;3936&#x2F;is-a-rand-from-dev-urandom-secure-for-a-login-key\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;3936&#x2F;is-a-rand-...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-21 00:00:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sleevip"],"id":[21848407],"kids":[21848988,21849029,21848807],"parent":[21843081],"text":["A few problems with the reasoning in this article.<p>It assumes that either &quot;cryptography works&quot; (and you only need to seed the CSRNG once) or &quot;cryptography does not work&quot; (and the entropy pool is necessary).

Like other commenters, it reminded me of Clemens Szyperski&#x27;s &quot;Component Software&quot; book. While a component model of software production has succeeded in some niches, it has (so far) failed to become a central organising principle for large scale software production. The article suggests that new micropayment mechanisms such as blockchain might enable Brad Cox&#x27;s vision of pay-as-you-use software components. But I think this misses the point. I would argue that software differs from physical goods in important ways that make it a poor fit for this model. In particular, software is cheap to modify, evolve and customise, but expensive to specify independent of implementation (cf. Refactoring, Agile processes versus ISO Standards Development.)<p>One issue that Szyperski&#x27;s book examined was the composition model (i.e. object model: COM, CORBA, JavaBeans, etc) used for defining interfaces between software components and how those interfaces can be composed. The idea of standardizing interfaces and composition mechanisms does not get so much attention today. It seems that things are currently balkanized into language communities, each doing their own thing.<p>The industrial manufacturing concept of &quot;interchangeable components&quot; comprises of two things: (1) standardized specifications, (2) multiple independent manufacturers who are able to independently implement specifications. We do have this kind of practice in, for example, the specification and implementation of the C++ standard library. But that&#x27;s not how most software is developed, and it is commonly held that it is not how most software should be developed. On the other hand, we do have &quot;component reuse&quot; in the form of software libraries -- but the interfaces are unique and idiosyncratic to each library, not standardised, and there is usually a single &quot;manufacturer&quot;."],"time":["2019-12-21 05:26:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mhd"],"id":[21848178],"kids":{},"parent":[21833331],"text":["I don&#x27;t think this is a failure of OOP itself, nor does it come down to any language&#x27;s shortcomings.<p>I think it&#x27;s mostly a market failure.

However, the improved productivity comes at cost of level quality assurance. Authoring, improving and maintaining grammars is difficult because it is hard to predict how each grammar rule impacts the overall level quality, and tool support is lacking. We propose a novel metric called Metric of Added Detail (MAD) that indicates if a rule adds or removes detail with respect to its phase in the transformation pipeline, and Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR) for expressing level properties and analyzing how qualities evolve in level generation histories. We demonstrate MAD and SAnR using a prototype of a level generator called Ludoscope Lite. Our preliminary results show that problematic rules tend to break SAnR properties and that MAD intuitively raises flags. MAD and SAnR augment existing approaches, and can ultimately help designers make better levels and level generators.&quot;<p>And:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ir.cwi.nl&#x2F;pub&#x2F;28418\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ir.cwi.nl&#x2F;pub&#x2F;28418<\/a> &quot;Wonderful design: Applying Appraisal Theory to Procedural Level Generation&quot;<p>Abstract:<p>&quot;Procedural level generation for games is an active field of research with successful applications. However, how to generate content that embodies design intent is still an open research question. Level designers lack abstractions and tools for authoring generated artifacts for affecting emotion. We propose a novel pattern language for generative level design inspired by Appraisal Theory. Its patterns enable designers to add meaning, depth, and cohesiveness to the resulting content, and modify artifacts to make the content more engaging. We illustrate how these patterns can be implemented in a generative grammar for level generation for an adventure game. Formative evaluation of generated level content demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and suggests points for further improvements. Future work could focus on other elements which seem important for affecting emotions, including pacing, perception, and expectation.&quot;"],"time":["2019-12-24 05:36:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jmiskovic"],"id":[21842698],"kids":{},"parent":[21833921],"text":["I made an android app that implements isomorphic note layouts.

This makes fingerings very flexible. The closer spacing of the key layout means you can reach bigger chords more easily - I can comfortably play a 10th, for example. The layout is isomorphic, so transposing is as simple as shifting your hands along.<p>I have played (standard) piano for over 30 years, and this was immediately intuitive for anything melodic. I am far from an expert yet, but the biggest difficulty has been the lack of colours on the keys, which makes it hard to jump big intervals, or play the same note in different octaves in both hands. The lack of colours is because keys don&#x27;t play a fixed note; the whole keyboard can be transposed by pressing a couple of buttons. Also, because the layout is isomorphic and they were trying to get away from the traditional note system. I am planning to try different colourings with masking tape or post-its, but I wish it had an RGB led for each key (not sure I can justify the effort of rigging that up).<p>The layout itself is great, and is the reason to buy this. Everything else is less great, and really shows its age (I have the newer model, the CT-312, which dates from something like 2007). The biggest hardware deficiency is the lack of a sustain pedal input, but I expect I can find a way around that with MIDI out or by rigging something up with the (toggle!) sustain button on the control panel. The sound synthesis is also pretty poor, but again, MIDI out.<p>The best thing about the Chromatone in comparison to all these other alternative keyboards, is that it&#x27;s (1) Available, and (2) Free!

As Kay notes, it doesn&#x27;t affect their conclusion, but interesting nonetheless.<p>There&#x27;s also a neat dispute on the pin factory analysis I thought I&#x27;d share. Kevin Carson, drawing on work by Steven Marglin, argued that the pin factory example doesn&#x27;t prove what Smith thinks it did, because it neglected the possibility of a single worker batching each step himself and reaping the same benefits[1]:<p>&gt;Marglin took Adam Smith&#x27;s classic example of the division of labor in pin-making, and stood it on its head. The increased efficiency resulted, not from the division of labor as such, but from dividing and sequencing the process into separate tasks in order to reduce set-up time. This could have been accomplished by a single cottage workman separating the various tasks and then performing them sequentially (i.e., drawing out the wire for an entire run of production, then straightening it, then cutting it, etc.).<p>George Reisman, in a Mises Institute article, disputed these claims [2], saying that you can&#x27;t get the enhanced efficiency this way because of set-up time, tool duplication, the requirement to do it at scale to make a profit:<p>&gt;If, for example, there were six distinct steps entailed in pin making, then instead of six workers working side by side continuously,in  one  factory,  each  continuously  using  a  definite  tool  or  piece  of equipment,  we  would  have,  under  cottage  production,  six  cottage workers each performing a large volume of a given operation, while the  tools  and  equipment  required  for  the  other  five operations remained idle. His output from any given operation would also then remain  idle  until  he  finished  that  operation  and  turned  to  the  next operation.<p>&gt;The  clear  implication  is  that  under  the  arrangement  of  cottage production so beloved of Carson and Marglin, the six workers would need between them thirty-six sets of tools and equipment instead of only six such sets and would have an unnecessarily large volume of partially finished product on hand at any given time. ...<p>&gt;In sum, cottage production would entail a tremendous waste ofcapital and be enormously inefficient, ...<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutualist.org&#x2F;sitebuildercontent&#x2F;sitebuilderfiles&#x2F;MPE.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutualist.org&#x2F;sitebuildercontent&#x2F;sitebuilderfiles...<\/a> p. 166<p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.mises.org&#x2F;20_1_5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.mises.org&#x2F;20_1_5.pdf<\/a> p. 7 in PDF"],"time":["2019-12-20 21:24:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jdsully"],"id":[21847243],"kids":[21848865],"parent":[21830044],"text":["&gt; But does it matter?<p>I think it matters that the examples are untrue.

Watt had ... some degree of difficulty ... in establishing himself professionally in Edinburough (the degree of interference from the blacksmiths&#x27; guild, the Hammermen, is displuted), and gained stability through a position at the University of Edinburough, in part through the intercession of Smith himself, in 1757, and the two were friends.  Watt worked on a Newcomen engine at the University, that being the basis of his own improved designs, beginning in 1763.<p>The bulk of the commercial significance of steam didn&#x27;t occur until <i>after<\/i> the publication of *Wealth of Nations, with about 500 engines existing in 1800, at the expiry of Watt&#x27;s (previously extended) patent, and after Smith&#x27;s own death.

I often ask, “Do you really think committee A or initiative B would not survive without you?” They hem and haw, but have no concrete statements to back up their reasoning. And don’t get me started on academics who continue to practice into the 70s and 80s, well past their best before date. Most can’t even remember the names of their grad students. It’s pure hubris. The norm should be retiring to teaching-only roles, and hand the mantle of research over to the younger faculty or stepping away from the lab they created by selecting a successor. Rather, it’s the exception.<p>If all the senior faculty across academia collectively took a break in the same timeframe, say one or two months every year, it would create opportunities for the younger members to step in and shine in their own way across the stratum of activities.

The sense that it could close up or drastically change (for the worse) has always been one of its defining characteristics. This is only the most recent in a string of disappointments following commitments to reinvigoration by successive owners. I remember telling Marissa Mayer, in person, thanks for investing in Flickr under Yahoo when they invited users to their relaunch [<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;nrbelex&#x2F;8766466511&#x2F;in&#x2F;album-72157633572443128&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;nrbelex&#x2F;8766466511&#x2F;in&#x2F;album-72...<\/a>]. Almost immediately Yahoo lost interest. They made some minor UI changes, but the service as a whole languished. They probably came to the same conclusion: there&#x27;s virtually no realistic path to profitability.<p>At this point, Flickr is simply too lumbering to become a competitor to Instagram. That&#x27;s probably for the best. If they&#x27;d tried to make Flickr an Instagram clone, they&#x27;d probably have lost what few remaining dedicated users exist. The platform emphasizes the photos, and the community, or at least parts of it if you know where to look, really is focused on high quality images.<p>It&#x27;s a particular bummer because Flickr is one of those services that&#x27;s supposed to prove that a service can be primarily subscription-supported rather than ad supported if the product is good enough. If Flickr can&#x27;t pull it off, even with a seemingly the best possible owner, what hope do other online services have?

I&#x27;ve been a freelance developer for a really long time and tried everything. Here&#x27;s how I see it from a contractor &#x2F; freelance POV.<p>It&#x27;s complicated because it&#x27;s almost impossible to come up with a good number for a results based project that isn&#x27;t trivial. That would be &quot;good&quot; in the sense of it makes sense for both the freelancer and the person hiring you where in the end both of you are happy and want to work together again in the future.<p>Results oriented payments sets you up to start hating what you&#x27;re doing if your estimate was a bit off where you need to work more hours than you thought. Suddenly you find yourself working much longer and it feels like &quot;damn it, why won&#x27;t this gig end already -- this is such an inefficient use of my time&quot;, or if the estimate is off in the other direction the person hiring you might feel like they overpaid (even if you slam dunked the project it&#x27;s still a negative).<p>But hourly by itself isn&#x27;t close to perfect either. Hourly sets you up to become a &quot;wage worker&quot; where you get punished for being a master of your craft, because if you invested a lot of time off the clock to improve then suddenly you&#x27;re getting paid less because you finish your work faster.<p>A prime example is, let&#x27;s say you have an iron clad user registration system written that you made for a side project on your own time and it took 25 hours. You have great test coverage, it works perfectly and it&#x27;s pretty easy to plop it into another project and customize it.<p>So now a client hires you to make them an app that requires a user registration system. Now you can implement that into their code base in literally 5 minutes because you have a project skeleton to start your app off with, vs starting at ground zero.<p>This is where the problem starts. If you charge $100 an hour, you just &quot;lost&quot; $2,500 because now you finished something that took you 25 hours on your unbilled time in 5 minutes.<p>So what do you do? Do you hide that aspect from your client and bill them somewhere between 15-25 extra hours and then try to come off like a hero where you contact them in 3 days with a progress report with the user system in place? That 15-25 number is something you decide on the fly with a thought process of &quot;well, I invested the time and continue to maintain this feature on my own time, I should be able to bill for that and re-use it for 5, 10 or 50 clients over the next few years&quot;.<p>Or do you not do that but instead drastically raise your rates but let them know you can finish things faster because you have years worth of license free personal code you&#x27;ve written?<p>What if you step back and use another example of investing 200 hours into tweaking your development environment to the point where you can actually finish real work faster than someone who didn&#x27;t, so now on a 200 hour project you can legit finish things in 180 hours (a 10% increase isn&#x27;t unreasonable IMO). How do you factor that in other than raising your rates?<p>All of these things are complicated questions. I typically go with hourly based rates but I&#x27;m also transparent with my clients when it comes to implementing things I already have code for. I let them know they are getting a huge discount by not having me implement this thing from scratch and in turn we decide on a fair figure on the spot (on a per client &#x2F; per project basis).<p>But for things like general skills that make me faster at coding, I raise my base rates. Nothing wrong with doing that. If I can finish things faster then it&#x27;s a benefit to everyone. The client gets their work done faster, I gain hours back from my life in the long run and I have an incentive to continue becoming better at my craft."],"time":["2019-12-20 19:58:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anticensor"],"id":[21845801],"kids":{},"parent":[21844002],"text":["The domain name checks."],"time":["2019-12-20 18:32:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ttctciyf"],"id":[21845165],"kids":[21845388,21845372,21845395],"parent":[21844303],"text":["TFA says:<p>&gt; The switch to Signal will also allow the Conservative party to stem the flow of leaks emerging from its inner circle.<p>How will it do that?<p>&gt; Like WhatsApp, Signal has end-to-end encryption baked in, preventing a foreign power or individual from accessing sensitive conversations.

They will not be happy about this ruling.<p>Here is some context on how things worked thus far:\nSince Uber is not allowed to dispatch directly to independent drivers (see the ruling from 2015), they instead partnered with rental-car companies that employ the drivers.  So in theory, Uber would dispatch a ride to one of their partners, who then dispatches it to one of their drivers. In practice, however, everything worked just as you know it from other countries, with the only difference being that Uber would send an email to the business owner containing two links: one to accept the ride and one to decline. Whenever the business owner clicks accept, the driver would get a text message with the approval. But at this time, he already would have accepted the ride in the app and be on his way. So effectively, the business owners had zero control.<p>It is no surprise that the Taxi companies are mad, because they are unable to compete under the current set of rules.
