There are DSLs with specializing compilers precisely for all sorts of weird tile shapes - imagine writing a weather simulator. Think autotuning, synthesis, etc. It&#x27;s a dangerously niche space.

Obviously, it&#x27;s impossible to force something to directly align with such disparate and abstract requirements, so you have to create abstractions (layers) to enable a hypothetically-pure realm.<p>In our architecture, we&#x27;ve created roughly 2 different kinds of abstraction: Platform and Business.<p>The Platform abstractions are only intended to support themselves and the Business abstractions. These are not supposed to be easily-accessible by non-technical folks. Their entire purpose is to make the Business abstractions as elegant as possible. The idea is these should be slowly-changing and stable across all use cases. Developers are only expected to visit this realm maybe once every other week. We effectively treat ourselves as our own customer with this layer.<p>The Business abstractions are built using only first-party primitives and our Platform layer. Most of this is very clean because we explicitly force all non-business concerns out into the Platform layer. Things like validation logic are written using purely functional code in this realm, which makes it very easy to reason with. Developers are expected to live in this area most of the time. Organization of business abstractions typically falls along lines of usage or logical business activity. We explicitly duplicate some code in order to maintain very clean separation of differing business activities. I&#x27;ve watched first hand as the subtle variances of a single combined Customer model across hundreds of contexts eventually turned it into a boat anchor.<p>As a consequence of all this, our project managers and other non-code-experts are actually able to review large parts of the codebase and derive meaningful insights without a developer babysitting them. We are at a point where project managers can open PRs for adjusting basic validation and parameter items in our customers&#x27; biz code.

For example, if I need to memorize a poem, I start with the last line or 2 lines.  Then, I put a line (or complete thought) in front of it and memorize that as it flows into the already memorized part.  Rinse and repeat.<p>Caveat: It sounds like an n^2 algorithm.  Yes and no.  Larger works can be broken up into chunks so that once the last &quot;chunk&quot; is learned, then only focus on the penultimate chunk, with only occasionally reviewing the flow from chunk to chunk.<p>I have not found any mentions of this technique specifically in the context of memorization, but rather first heard about it in the context of dog training.  E.g., teach a dog the last action of a trick.  Once the dog can perform the part of the trick, add one step in front of the learned part, and keep repeating that until the sequence is solid.  Then add another step to the beginning of the sequence, etc.  Evidently, in this way, animals can learn complex and long sequences of behaviors.<p>Backward Chaining [<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chaining\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chaining<\/a>] is the closest description that I could find matching this technique, but even that isn&#x27;t totally correct, as the description deals with performing the entire chain rather than ignoring the chain as a whole and only focusing on the end.<p>I have personally applied this technique to memorization of poetry, scripture passages, and learning piano pieces.  It&#x27;s amazing!<p>In fact, I teach all of my piano students this method to learn a piece of music.  They never &quot;start at the beginning and stumble through the entire piece&quot; unless they are intentionally practicing sight reading.  Rather, we focus on the last phrase, and they learn (memorize) it up to tempo.  Then they add the previous musical phrase, tying into the part that they just learned.  Usually, we go for a ratio of loosely 10:1 (i.e., 10 repetitions of the new section, then 1 of the new section tied to the old section, maintaining a constant tempo).  It works very well!<p>The end result: 1. It is usually easy to remember how something begins.  2. With this method, the performance gets stronger, as the more difficult passages (often towards the end) have more focused attention.  3. The &quot;newest&quot; part is always at the beginning of wherever you are in the learning process, so your brain is always fresh at the place where it needs to work the hardest.<p>My students love this approach, because, from their own testimony, it makes learning a complicated piece of music a <i>very<\/i> straightforward and repeatable skill."],"time":["2020-05-07 15:53:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["eyelidlessness"],"id":[23099253],"kids":{},"parent":[23087781],"text":["I&#x27;m a lasagna<p>Hog go hang a salami<p>This sentence no verb"],"time":["2020-05-07 05:05:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["clairity"],"id":[23099215],"kids":{},"parent":[23087781],"text":["a dormmate used to play <i>life goes on<\/i> on repeat in college. i couldn&#x27;t help but learn the words even as i quickly got tired of it. that 2pac was a lyrical genius."],"time":["2020-05-07 04:59:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23099057],"kids":{},"parent":[23087781],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-07 04:32:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["balfirevic"],"id":[23102162],"kids":{},"parent":[23087781],"text":["If you want a fun take on Shakespeare&#x27;s poetry, Zach Weinersmith&#x27;s (author of SMBC comic) <i>Shakespeare’s Sonnets: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness<\/i> is free for the duration of pandemic [0].

The problem is that the resonant frequency changes if the distance between the source and receiver changes by even a small amount.<p>In their first breakthrough three years ago, the researchers developed a wireless charger that could transmit electricity even as the distance to the receiver changes. They did this by incorporating an amplifier and feedback resistor that allowed the system to automatically adjusts its operating frequency as the distance between the charger and the moving object changed. But that initial system wasn’t efficient enough to be practical. The amplifier uses so much electricity internally to produce the required amplification effect that the system only transmitted 10% of the power flowing through the system.<p>In their new paper, the researchers show how to boosts the system’s wireless-transmission efficiency to 92%.

However, the work of the article linked is certainly not the first time that a rotating detonation engine running H2&#x2F;O2 has been demonstrated successfully or for an extended period of time (read: dozens of minutes). Some short tests using H2&#x2F;O2 are shown in the UT Arlington video above. A wealth of research on RDEs successfully running H2&#x2F;O2 can be found on Google Scholar going more than 7 years back.<p>AFRL East (specifically the Turbines and Combustion Branch at Wright-Patterson AFB) has been running and publishing results of rotating detonation engines using oxidizer&#x2F;fuel combos of atmospheric air and standard liquid hydrocarbon aviation fuels for several years now. AFRL West (in this case referring to Edwards AFB, which was involved in the research in the linked article) is interested in RDE applications where there is no atmosphere to use as an oxidizer supply, so an oxidizer would need to be held in a tank. AFRL East is instead more interested in terrestrial applications, so RDE research work there has naturally focused on using air as the oxidizer.<p>There are several aspects of using liquid fuels and regular air that create additional challenge compared to using gaseous fuel&#x2F;oxidizer combos (including H2&#x2F;O2), not the least of which is ensuring proper atomization and mixing of the liquid fuel in the vary narrow window of time that it can be fed into the detonation annulus before a detonation front returns to consume them.<p>For a 6-inch diameter RDE, the detonation wave circles the annulus around 3000 times per second, depending on the fuel and oxidizer used and their equivalence ratio (the ratio of fuel and oxidizer in the annular detonation chamber). This creates an incredibly loud sound that is roughly 3 kHz, which is directly related to the 3000 times&#x2F;sec the wave circles the annulus. Sometimes, two or more (in the paper they mention five) separate waves (distinct detonation fronts) will emerge, usually distributed equi-radially. This means that a detonation wave will pass a given point in the annulus five times as frequently, so the noise heard by an observer is then 5*3kHz = 15kHz.<p>When using aviation fuels in air-breathing RDEs, it is typically necessary to preheat the liquid fuel before mechanical atomization via injector, which is easier in H2&#x2F;02 configurations. Hydrogen and oxyen are stored in tanks as liquid and may be quite cold, but between raising their temperature before injection using waste heat [0] and their higher volatility, getting them to atomize and mix is considerably simpler.<p>At my former employer,  when we tested new parts for our research RDE rig that were fresh from the machine shop, we would run H2&#x2F;O2 or H2&#x2F;N2O as an easier cheat test to see if there were any glaring manufacturing issues before moving on to the more involved air and liquid aviation fuels tests.<p>So yes, I’ve personally seen larger RDEs running on H2&#x2F;O2 fire literally hundreds of separate times. I can think of five or so other institutions doing RDE research that have already accomplished (and published on) more than what I see in this article. I love the RDE research space, but the linked article has me scratching my head at their claim to be first.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regenerative_cooling_(rocket)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regenerative_cooling_(rocket)<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-07 11:43:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["valuearb"],"id":[23097208],"kids":[23098482,23101101,23101127,23102292],"parent":[23091918],"text":["How much higher ISP, and how much more engine weight&#x2F;complexity?

If we want to talk about rabbitholes I nominate BioPerl.<p>&gt; here are a list of terms that you’d never come across as a bioinformatician: [&quot;X-Forwarded-Proto&quot;, &quot;proxying&quot;, &quot;requests&quot;, &quot;TLS connection&quot;, &quot;HTTP&quot;, &quot;loopback&#x2F;localhost&quot;, &quot;whitelisted proxy servers&quot;, &quot;gunicorn&quot;, &quot;nginx&quot;, &quot;Apache&#x2F;httpd&quot;, &quot;HAProxy&quot;, &quot;Django&quot;, &quot;SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT&quot;, &quot;SecurityMiddleware&quot;, &quot;adapter&quot;, &quot;URI&quot;]<p>This list is more than a little disingenuous:<p>Django: This is like, the framework OP built their software on top of. I don&#x27;t know how one gets the point of filing this bug without knowing the term Django<p>requests: literally, a user&#x27;s web request.<p>HTTP&#x2F;URI: this is the web developer equivalent of a biologist not knowing the term DNA. Or DOI for that matter.<p>whitelist: the opposite of a blacklist<p>Much of rest comes down to the simple fact that job of web developers is to build a network service. This is primarily done with layers; each layer only needs to know how to interface with the adjoining layers above and below, like a lego brick. This is actually a _solution_ to the complexity, allowing us to constrain the design of each layer to interact only with those above and below it. This layer abstraction lets us reason about each layer locally, independently of the system as a whole.<p>nginx, Apache&#x2F;httpd, HAProxy: in this context, mentioned as possible proxies forming the outermost layer. in this context, accepts HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS connections and makes HTTP connections to gunicorn<p>gunicorn: the thing that runs the Django app. Accepts HTTP connections, makes WSGI calls to the Django app<p>Django: Accepts WSGI function calls, routes them through middleware, then to the app as you define in urlpatterns<p>SecurityMiddleware: a class that potentially modifies inbound requests and outbound responses<p>Finally, OP is in the unhappy situation of bridging two network protocols: HTTP and email. The normal trick of using a protocol relative URI will not work here because you&#x27;ve gone outside the browser request-response loop. This puts them in the unhappy state of the lowest layer needing to know the details of the highest layer, hence the discussion of absolute uris. This is a direct violation of the local reasoning constraint, and what makes all of this hard.<p>X-Forwarded-Proto: An HTTP header, added to incoming HTTP requests designed to indicate to layers below which URI scheme was originally used, HTTP or HTTPS.<p>SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT: a setting for SecurityMiddleware that will stop processing the request and send a response to the browser telling it to resend the query over https (an HTTP 302 redirect), if the incoming connection is seen as coming over not http.<p>tl;dr: email is the thing that sucks."],"time":["2020-05-07 09:25:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mrmonkeyman"],"id":[23100235],"kids":{},"parent":[23100002],"text":["You are just new.

So while the article is a great bit of work, quite praiseworthy and possibly an instant classic of Emacs lore I&#x27;m going to be critical of it because I was hoping for something different.<p>Emacs the system is a programming environment that is used to create a model of what a text editor should look like (in Elisp), then an implementation of that model with windows and suchlike (in Elisp, C and with a bit more thrown in for good measure). Extensions build on that model to accomplish magic of various forms. I was anticipating an interesting read on competing ideas of what that model should look like, and how extensions customarily interacted with it, and how the culture has changed over time. 1985 was not the high point for string manipulation and I expect there has been a lot of change through the 90s and 00s, let alone the 10s.<p>This document is a record of the mechanisms behind the Emacs model. Important to record, a great service for the archivists who really will care, but if I&#x27;m going to invest an evening learning about mechanism I&#x27;d rather read up on the JVM which is frankly more powerful and interesting than the Elisp interpretor.

After a certain number of requests fail, the load balancer simply removes all the backends for a certain period of time, and causes all requests to immediately fail.  This attempts to mitigate the cascading failure by simply isolating the backend from the frontend for a period of time.  If you have something like a &quot;stateless&quot; web-app that shares a database with the other replicas, and the database stops working, this is exactly what you want.  No replica will be able to handle the request, so don&#x27;t send it to any replica.<p>Another option to look into is the balancer&#x27;s &quot;panic threshold&quot;.  Normally your load balancer will see which backends are healthy, and only route requests to those.  That is what the load balancer in the article did, and the effect was that it overloaded the other backends to the point of failure (and this is a somewhat common failure mode).  With a panic threshold set, when that many backends become unhealthy, the balancer stops using health as a routing criterion.  It will knowingly send some requests to an unhealthy backend.  This means that the healthy backends will receive traffic load that they can handle, so at least (healthy&#x2F;total)% of requests will be handled successfully (instead of causing a cascading failure).<p>Finally, other posts mention a common case like running ab against apache&#x2F;mysql&#x2F;php on a small machine.  The OOM eventually kicks in and starts killing things.  Luckily, people are also more careful on that front now.  Envoy, for example, has the overload manager, so you can configure exactly how much memory you are going to use, and what happens when you get close to the limits.  For my personal site, I use 64M of RAM for Envoy, and when it gets to 99% of that, it just stops accepting new connections.  This sucks, of course, but it&#x27;s better than getting OOM killed entirely.  (A real website would probably want to give it more than 64M of RAM, but with my benchmarking I can&#x27;t get anywhere close with 8000 requests&#x2F;second going through it... and I&#x27;m never going to see that kind of load.)<p>I guess the TL;DR is that in 2011 it sounded scary to have a &quot;suicide pact&quot; but now it&#x27;s normal.  Sometimes you&#x27;ve got to kill yourself to save others.

If solar plants there get a 30% capacity factor (typical for temperate deserts, maybe a bit low for Morocco) and use low-cost 16%-efficient solar panels, they&#x27;ll produce 48 W&#x2F;m² (on average around the clock), which is 48 MW&#x2F;km²; the country as a whole could produce 34 terawatts, about double world marketed energy consumption.<p>— <U+2042> —<p>Historically speaking, the humans have burned fossil fuels because their photovoltaic panel manufacturing was too inefficient; until the 1990s, it took more energy to produce a solar panel than it would produce during its design lifetime of 30 years.  Now low-cost solar modules cost €0.18 per (peak) watt7, following a dramatic fall in crystalline silicon PV module prices from €2.17 per peak watt in May 2009° to €0.19 in December 2018, representing dramatic improvements in efficiency of some 22% per year; since then, a price-fixing cartel then announced at Davos has prevented further improvements in efficiency from further lowering wholesale prices.  Still, their cost is now comparable to the cost of the heat engines and electric generators needed to harness fossil fuels for purposes other than raw heat, exclusive of fuel and other operational expenses.<p>It&#x27;s commonly commented that the sun doesn&#x27;t shine at night, so solar power only works at night if you have transcontinental power transmission lines (not yet existing, probably HVDC, perhaps a strategic vulnerability similar to Twitter) or utility-scale energy storage.  The need for storage can make solar energy roughly as expensive at night as fossil-fuel energy, but during the day it&#x27;s considerably cheaper in areas with large solar resources.  If transcontinental HVDC becomes a real thing, the countries mentioned could become bigger exporters of solar energy than they ever were of oil energy.<p>— <U+2042> —<p>One more note about Morocco: Morocco has a lot of Arabs, but it also has a lot of Berbers¹; it seems sort of \nflamebaity to describe it as an &quot;Arab state&quot;!<p>—<p>° <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20100722072720&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarserver.com&#x2F;service&#x2F;pvx-spot-market-price-index-solar-pv-modules.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20100722072720&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solars...<\/a><p>¹ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Morocco\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Morocco<\/a><p>² <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_consumption\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_consumption<\/a><p>³ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghawar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghawar<\/a><p>4 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barrel_%28unit%29#Oil_barrel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barrel_%28unit%29#Oil_barrel<\/a><p>5 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_density\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_density<\/a><p>6 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_oil_production\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_oil_produ...<\/a><p>7 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarserver.de&#x2F;pv-modulpreise&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarserver.de&#x2F;pv-modulpreise&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-07 21:51:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["threwrwe23423"],"id":[23106066],"kids":[23106176],"parent":[23104636],"text":["Do you know which country has the most&#x2F;largest Solar power plants in the world ?

Like, the fetch() hook that used to be used to load data at a page level (e.g. &quot;before transitioning to this route, load this set of data&quot;) was totally overhauled to now be &quot;load data for this component,&quot; with no &quot;pre-transition await&quot; available anymore (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuxtjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuxtjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nux...<\/a>).

An incredibly high amount of people are out and about, even people who seem to just be socializing, standing around &#x2F; hangout out on their stoop, talking to friends or neighbors, having small 5-15 person gatherings or cookouts \n(on their stoop), or going for walks (without pets). There is a big culture among natives of socializing outside in front of your building, gathering to share in smoking, eating, listening to music, and chatting, which is honestly a beautiful thing about New York when it isn&#x27;t a pandemic. But these gatherings seemingly haven&#x27;t decreased, at least not to the degree one might expect.<p>2. An incredible amount of people have access to surgical masks. This was news to me as I figured stocks were still depleted, but it turns out that they are to be found in a variety of pharmacies, groceries, hardware stores, bodegas etc. just at inflated prices and in small batches. I purchased a replacement pack of 6 surgical masks at my grocery store checkout counter for about a dollar each. I would estimate 80-90% of people in public here are wearing a mask, mostly surgical, a minority KN95 (also was available at the grocery I was at in individual units at a fairly high price) or bandana&#x2F;improvised masks.<p>3. A huge percentage (maybe 30-45%)? of people that I see wearing masks seem to be putting them around their chins or wearing them over their mouth but with nostrils exposed or hanging around their neck. Or I see people pulling them down and only pulling them back up when they walk by someone or go into a store (most stores have signs on the entrance requiring masks but state that improvised is OK).<p>It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating seeing people wearing PPE incorrectly and&#x2F;or treating it as optional outside of stores.<p>4. The young transplant&#x2F;white&#x2F;yuppie minority population in the area seems to be either wearing masks correctly, clutching their grocery basket tightly with a stern look on their face or alternatively treating the whole thing like a joke and walking their dogs outside shining new development luxury buildings with a look of glee and wearing no masks at all. For the most part they are not to be seen at all except for seemingly in a grocery store or walking back from one, or walking a pet. Where I would normally see dozens of young, predominantly white hipsters in bars or at restaurants, coming and going to the subway, or just walking, now I see 10-20% of usual traffic of them.<p>5. Older people seem to be more likely than younger people to be wearing no mask, to be wearing a mask incorrectly, or to be just standing around on their front porch&#x2F;stoop aimlessly.<p>Anyway, these are not meant to be construed as directly relevant as evidence for a cause for the present infection demographics as we don&#x27;t have a complete picture of initial infections, of percentages of population that can work from home vs works outside as essential workers, etc.<p>But certainly if you asked me about what my hypothesis might be about the causes of minority populations in NYC having bad outbreaks, I would say we can&#x27;t ignore self inflicted wounds due to bad education or cultural disregard &#x2F; machismo around rules and authority, skepticism towards government or science, etc. No idea what the solution would be besides reducing inequality and lifting people out of poverty, improving their education, or role models within the communities stepping up and speaking out to those who flaunt social distancing.<p>Lastly, I don&#x27;t think these communities are alone in not abiding by quarantine as much as they can, I think most of the United States is being as lackadaisical, but the initial seeded infection just had much more time to develop here unchecked so we&#x27;re seeing those much worse outcomes despite most of the country also breaking social distancing rules in a multitude of ways."],"time":["2020-05-08 00:04:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["6510"],"id":[23110563],"kids":{},"parent":[23108188],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;basic-report&#x2F;physical-activity-fundamental-preventing-disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;basic-report&#x2F;physical-activity-fundamen...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-08 03:52:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SrslyJosh"],"id":[23109603],"kids":{},"parent":[23108188],"text":["&gt; “Much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself.
