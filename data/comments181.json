Our technology solves the data problem with massively parallel biochemistry in the form of DNA Encoded Libraries (DELs), allowing us to analyze 100-1000x more compounds compared to traditional approaches. By feeding our algorithms with this data we can identify better compounds faster than competing solutions.

Familiarity with current ML and data pipeline tools is a must. We favor python, but aren’t dogmatic.<p>Computational Chemist: We are looking for a computational chemist to create a cutting edge drug discovery toolchain.

Using a novel decentralized PKI, Celo lets you send cryptocurrency to phone numbers in a fully decentralized way. Additionally, Celo uses stable-value tokens pegged to fiat currencies, like the US Dollar, to minimize volatility, and crucially allows transaction fees to be paid with these tokens. To make sure that the platform is scalable and fast enough for day-to-day use, Celo uses a new Proof-of-Stake protocol with fast block times and one block finality. Further, it uses SNARK-based proofs to allow light clients to sync with the chain near instantly. The protocol is now live (run by hundreds of entities) and we are now working with organizations such as GiveDirectly on an open-source social payments app (Valora) that looks and feels like Venmo, yet is fully decentralized. Additionally, Coinbase Pro listed Celo today.<p>Investors: Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain, General Catalyst, Coinbase, Reid Hoffman and Jack Dorsey, among others.<p>Stack: Typescript, Solidity, Go, React Native, Python, Android, iOS, Rust, zk-SNARKs<p>Team backgrounds: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Square, Zcash, QEDIT, MIT, Stanford (~100 people today)<p>More about us here:<p>Code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;celo-org&#x2F;celo-monorepo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;celo-org&#x2F;celo-monorepo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;celo-org&#x2F;celo-blockchain\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;celo-org&#x2F;celo-blockchain<\/a><p>Blog: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;celoorg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;celoorg<\/a><p>Chat: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.celo.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.celo.org<\/a><p>Mobile App: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valoraapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valoraapp.com<\/a><p>Mainnet Stats: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thecelo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thecelo.com<\/a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stats.celo.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stats.celo.org<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-01 21:24:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["knottvicki"],"id":[24424322],"kids":{},"parent":[24342498],"text":["Crux OCM | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cruxocm.ocm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cruxocm.ocm<\/a> | Software Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE\nCrux OCM is seeking a talented Software Engineer to join the team.

USD 6.5 billion alternative asset management company with around 220 people across multiple time zones and locations. Our core technology team has been remote first for some time, and the whole company is following suit, post-COVID.<p>I&#x27;m one of the three people running the firm, responsible amongst other things for technology across the firm and I’m posting this myself. That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm. We are three years into a period of transformation from initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming but are oriented towards solving their business problems with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that&#x27;s now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.<p>The language is written in D, we hosted dconf last year and will do so again this year. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.<p>It&#x27;s quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it&#x27;s commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.<p>We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren&#x27;t a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We&#x27;ve recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.<p>Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure - don&#x27;t be surprised if our founder and CIO starts asking you questions about your work.<p>Symmetry Talks:<p>- All Spreadsheets Must Die (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FZi9CSB9_kk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FZi9CSB9_kk<\/a>)<p>- Lessons from a DSL where all you have is Ranges (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA<\/a>)<p>- Alternative Investment Management (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1rMq-4rWgis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1rMq-4rWgis<\/a>)<p>Links:<p>- Symmetry GitHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;symmetryinvestments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;symmetryinvestments<\/a>)<p>- Symmetry Autumn of Code (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;23&#x2F;symmetry-autumn-of-code-2020-projects-and-participants&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;23&#x2F;symmetry-autumn-of-code-20...<\/a>)<p>Contact: Email laeeth at kaleidic.io and cc jthompson at symmetryinvestments dot com."],"time":["2020-09-02 05:46:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["raeleehemenway"],"id":[24347314],"kids":{},"parent":[24342498],"text":["Auth0 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;<\/a>) | Seattle - Buenos Aires - London - Sydney - Tokyo - Remote | Full-time | Engineering<p>Auth0 is a Series E&#x2F;650 employee company with major growth plans for 2020.

I was able to come up with a simple CRDT style system where I just log the modifications made per device and share them out with other devices via simple files (i.e. upload to central file store and download peer journals).

For example, I could cap the journal files to a certain size and create a new one when the limit is reached. This avoids having to upload the same contents too frequently. I could also have a strategy where I merge all journals into a central file every so often so that the state of the world is shared there instead of the journals (which can then be discarded)."],"time":["2020-09-01 08:05:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mey"],"id":[24337972],"kids":[24338776,24339762,24338039,24339886,24339253,24338603,24339421],"parent":[24337244],"text":["Immutability is an interesting property, but reality is messy.

Unfortunately, git did a very poor job of surfacing those primitives for general use and I wasn’t having much luck finding the right approach myself.<p>Shortly after joining Protocol Labs I realized they had already figured this out in a project called IPLD. Not long after that, I started leading the IPLD project&#x2F;team and then putting together my ideal database whenever I found a free moment.<p>It’s very young, lots of missing features, still working on some better data-structures for indexing, but it is very much a database that replicates the way git does and approaches indexing over a primary store the way CouchDB does, but there’s a lot more too.<p>With these primitives we can easily nest databases inside of other databases (and create unified indexes over them) and we can easily extend the data types in the database to user provided types. Using some of these features it already supports streams of binary data, databases in databases, and linking between pieces of data.<p>Let me know what you think, there’s still plenty of work to do, but it has 100% code coverage, so it does what it says it does :) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikeal&#x2F;dagdb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikeal&#x2F;dagdb<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-02 19:06:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sroussey"],"id":[24337853],"kids":[24340853],"parent":[24337244],"text":["Gotta figure out what your needs are.

It is a universal storage engine based on dense and sparse multi-dimensional arrays. I explain each point below.<p>&gt; embedded<p>TileDB Embedded [1] is an open source (MIT licensed) embeddable C++ library which exposes C and C++ APIs. We also built APIs for Python, R, C++, Java and Go, and integrations into MariaDB, PrestoDB, Spark, GDAL, PDAL and more. Via MariaDB we even have embeddable SQL[2]. TileDB abstracts the storage backends behind an extendible VFS class, and currently supports S3, GCS, Azure, HDFS, and local disk.<p>&gt; immutable<p>TileDB is designed around immutable objects. Every write creates a new &quot;fragment&quot; using a MVCC model[3]. No file is ever updated in place. TileDB is designed to naturally handle the eventual consistency and restraints of cloud object stores. This allows for features like multi-reader&#x2F;multi-writer support, time traveling, and update support all within the storage engine without any external orchestration.<p>&gt; syncable<p>TileDB&#x27;s MVCC approach to handling the eventual consistency of cloud object stores, yields directly into its sync-ability. Every write operation in TileDB creates a new &quot;fragment&quot; [3]. A fragment is an immutable folder (or prefix on object stores) that contains all the data from a single write session. Fragments are created with a timestamp and a UUID to ensure uniqueness. The fragment is ignored until a special `.ok` file is available in listing (each write is atomic). Incomplete fragments (without the .ok file) are gracefully ignored.<p>This means that every fragment is self-contained and syncable. The only requirement is that the special `.ok` file must show up only after the complete fragment folder is synced. With cloud object stores this is not a problem with the read-after-write consistency guarantees. For other systems the synchronization can be managed to handle this behavior.<p>&gt; relational database<p>Tables can be easily modeled as multi-dimensional sparse arrays[4]. Through TileDB&#x27;s integrations with MariaDB and PrestoDB (and Spark), you gain a full SQL interface, while being able to query the data directly via the language APIs without using SQL. For more robust features, such as foreign key enforcement, it is easy to use embeddable MariaDB to achieve this, while we work to push such features into the storage engine itself. We are always seeking feedback on which features are most used and requested to pushdown common operations to the storage engine.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.com&#x2F;embedded\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.com&#x2F;embedded<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tiledb.com&#x2F;main&#x2F;api-usage&#x2F;embedded-sql\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tiledb.com&#x2F;main&#x2F;api-usage&#x2F;embedded-sql<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tiledb.com&#x2F;main&#x2F;basic-concepts&#x2F;physical-storage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tiledb.com&#x2F;main&#x2F;basic-concepts&#x2F;physical-storage<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tiledb.com&#x2F;main&#x2F;handling-dataframes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tiledb.com&#x2F;main&#x2F;handling-dataframes<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-01 21:03:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["v3gas"],"id":[24340149],"kids":{},"parent":[24337244],"text":["Love this!

The current model of big, centralized services is kinda like democracy. Bad in a lot of ways, but everything else has even bigger problems, so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re stuck with.<p>First, it&#x27;s very hard for end users to actually connect and discover eachother. NATs are everywhere, so direct connections are often not possible, and introducing a central server defeats the point. Most non-techies spend a majority of their time on mobile, so having connections in the background is also not an option. Everyone having their own servers is not realistic either. It has been proven time and time again that, if people can choose between paying or getting something for free, they will choose the latter. Whether the ads are personalized or not (what some people call tracking) doesn&#x27;t matter that much.<p>Monetization is hard with decentralized services, and money \nis very often required to make something with good enough UX for most people. If you don&#x27;t collect a lot of data, you make ad fraud easier, so ads are not an option. People don&#x27;t like to pay (see above) and payments are hard to enforce if you&#x27;re not managing the service, so charging is not an option either.<p>Making decentralized services is much harder than making centralized ones. It&#x27;s easier to pretend everything in the world happens in order and accept events one by one, than to deal with the messy reality of thousands of devices doing thousands of things at once, without a coordinating entity. Imagine if one user kicks everyone out from a group, while getting kicked out himself in the meantime in other parts of the network. What to do when he goes back? Who should decide? Timestamps can&#x27;t be trusted either, as they can be faked. Now you&#x27;re having consensus problems, dealing with byzantine fault tolerance and inventing a blockchain. A central, trusted server is easier to write and less prone to security exploits.<p>Storing everything on your own device isn&#x27;t great either. If you have 100 friends on Facebook, and each of them has 1000 photos, you don&#x27;t have enough space to store them all. Not storing them isn&#x27;t an option either, as you might actually want some of them at some point. Asking the original poster doesn&#x27;t work, as he might not currently be in the app, so disconnected from the network. With something like a decentralized Amazon, you need search, and good, privacy-friendly, decentralized search is somewhere between hard and impossible.<p>If you can&#x27;t have captchas, rate limits and a lot of data about your users, it&#x27;s hard to prevent spam, spreading fake news, attacks, catfishing and similar behavior. Restricting your network to friends works, as long as you accept the fact that no stranger (i.e. at your new place of work) can ever find or contact you.<p>Even if you manage to overcome all those problems, there&#x27;s still a pretty high risk that someone might do an embrace, extend, extinguish on your network with their proprietary app, kind of like Gmail is doing with email.<p>I want decentralization to work and Facebook to be gone just like everyone else, but, as sad as that is, it never will."],"time":["2020-09-01 13:31:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RedShift1"],"id":[24338602],"kids":[24338859],"parent":[24337244],"text":["Ah yes immutability.

It&#x27;s just the difference between two offset moving averages. The length of the average (peak time) serves as an integration that removes high frequency noise. The offset (gap time) provides differentiation of the integrated signal, which removes low frequency changes in baseline. Timing precision is improved by using the trap filter output rather than the raw signal compared to a threshold, as it effectively acts like a constant fraction discriminator. It also makes it easier to deal with pile-up events where multiple waveforms lie on top of each other, though that&#x27;s improbable unless you measure a source that&#x27;s really hot or pulsed."],"time":["2020-09-02 13:48:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["epa"],"id":[24347515],"kids":[24350793],"parent":[24344382],"text":["Awesome to see an original EEE Pc still being used in 2020!"],"time":["2020-09-01 23:48:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[24350802],"kids":{},"parent":[24344382],"text":["I missed the ATLAS&#x2F;TDAQ HLT&#x2F;Alice references, though. :)"],"time":["2020-09-02 09:12:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sandworm101"],"id":[24345474],"kids":{},"parent":[24344382],"text":["A very interesting home experiment.

I&#x27;ve helped numerous businesses of varying sizes in varying industries get their technology investment right and I can do the same for you.<p>Recent projects include:<p>+ Successfully lead, developed and delivered complete greenfield and bespoke web site and back-end web platform for a leading UK children’s charity, forming a core component of a complete brand refresh and redesign.<p>+ Successfully lead project to develop industry leading anti-motor fraud website, web service, OLAP &amp; OLTP system and data warehouse including one of Europe&#x27;s largest anti-fraud databases for a Top 40 UK law firm.<p>+ Successfully designed and delivered market-leading, best-of-breed corporate travel management web &amp; desktop-based product suite for a company who, largely as a result of the technology, were later acquired in a multi-million pound deal."],"time":["2020-09-06 17:52:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["creative_tech"],"id":[24344800],"kids":{},"parent":[24342496],"text":["Location: Boston<p>Remote: Yes (Preferred)<p>Willing to relocate: No<p>Technologies: Front end (React, Vue, Backbone, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3&#x2F;SCSS), Python (Django, Flask), UX Design, Physical Computing, Unity, and more<p>Résumé&#x2F;CV: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshpeterson.art&#x2F;Peterson-Josh-Resume-2020.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshpeterson.art&#x2F;Peterson-Josh-Resume-2020.pdf<\/a><p>Email: joshkpete@gmail.com<p>Website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshpeterson.art\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshpeterson.art<\/a><p>I&#x27;m an interdisciplinary developer &#x2F; creative technologist with a focus on front end web. 5+ years experience.

I’ve invented version of the Free Applicative structure with most optimal asymptotics (and stack safe), which was adopted in PureScript and Scala from my original JavaScript version. Implemented stack safe version of PureScript&#x27;s Effect monad. Was mentioned in Acknowledgments of Build Systems à la Carte and Selective Applicative Functors. (links are in the resume)<p>Besides my technical skills, I have worked closely with designers and product people discussing how to deliver better UX when there are hard technological constraints (for example implementing UI&#x2F;UX for already deployed smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain), proposed alternative UI&#x2F;UX sketches for better solving user problems.
