What Aleksey said[0] about RLS that &quot;[RLS&#x27;s] current architecture is not a good foundation for a perfect IDE long-term,&quot; feels similar to my coworker&#x27;s conclusion in her effort to provide better editor support for PHP[1].<p>Parsers for compiling code into machine-executables vs parsers to serve LSP responses have different tradeoffs. For example, Anders mentioned TS parser need to have good error-recovery, can respond with completions&#x2F;errors when one file changes inside a thousand-files-project. I vaguely remember TS had a goal to provide completions in &lt; 50ms and errors in &lt;150ms. Such goals are hard to achieve as after-thought. If your core compiler doesn&#x27;t do error recovery, such as PHP, you need someone to write a new compiler from scratch for a language server implementation. If tools such as RLS rely on compiler to dump all JSON metadata and figure out LSP responses[0], it&#x27;s too slow for editors.<p>TS&#x27;s good editor support doesn&#x27;t come free. I think one of the most under-appreciated achievement of TS is how it took editor support seriously and designed its compiler infrastructure to do it well. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t believe in those hot-new-web-languages that try to take over TS by designing a better type system. TS brought the average developer&#x27;s expectation of a language to having fast completion, fast error reporting, editor autofix, F2 to rename and renaming-a-file-in-editor-to-update-all-references. It&#x27;s 2020 and people aren&#x27;t going back to write code like in Notepad.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferrous-systems.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-analyzer-2019&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferrous-systems.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-analyzer-2019&#x2F;<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;tolerant-php-parser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;tolerant-php-parser<\/a><p>---<p>EDIT: grammar."],"time":["2020-02-02 17:09:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["W-Stool"],"id":[22215220],"kids":[22215288,22215640,22216521,22215352],"parent":[22214687],"text":["Turbo Pascal (which he authored) was quite the accomplishment back in the day - editor and compiler in 64K.

They would include full schematics and operational theory that often went well beyond what was needed by a technician who was tasked with maintaining the gear.  Often the documentation was written by the design engineers themselves, who were the Michael Jordans and Kobe Bryants of their field.  The educational value of this material was (and is) immense.  Not only could you get your scope up and running after spending some time with these manuals, you understood a lot about how it worked and what motivated the underlying design decisions.<p>Dennis is right in that this wonderful literature went away well before its time, but I think he undersells the other side of the argument, which is that these manuals would inevitably become less useful over time as well.  It was true that management became less engineering-driven in the 1980s-1990s period, which was both unfortunate and avoidable, but it&#x27;s also true that over the same timeframe he&#x27;s referring to, companies like Tektronix and HP had to migrate to custom ASICs and software-heavy architectures that were inherently less user-serviceable.<p>These aren&#x27;t like products from manufacturers like Apple, Tesla, or John Deere whose overt market abuses have spawned the right-to-repair movement -- they&#x27;re the tools used by the people who design those products.  The instrumentation companies had to stay well ahead of the technology curve, just as they do now, and increasing integration often has the unfortunate side effect of making the inner workings of the product less accessible to the user.  Personally, I&#x27;m not sure things could have evolved much differently than they did, regardless of the ratio of MBAs to EEs in management.<p>Bummer, too, because those manuals were AWESOME.  One thing that <i>is<\/i> indisputable is that both Tektronix and HP stopped publishing component-level service manuals about 5-10 years before the technology justified it.  Because their technology had to stay ahead of the market, a lot of gear that is still very useful in many applications today is now almost impossible to keep running."],"time":["2020-02-02 22:53:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bathtub365"],"id":[22219618],"kids":[22219669,22220600],"parent":[22210024],"text":["This is equivalent to what Apple has done.

Barring sources like steam methane reformation from landfill-reclaimed methane, it&#x27;s stuck between not being nearly as portable due to hydrogen embrittlement of storage container materials and ease of leak because of the small molecular size as traditional fossil fuels (albeit less C02 intensive), but a fair bit less efficient overall than just directly using the electricity.<p>That said, Germany&#x27;s somewhat unique situation with regard to limited natural capacity for renewable energy means that that, in an argument for any degree of national energy independence, hydrogen could make sense if they can maintain some control the means of production and export.<p>The mention of using hydrogen in heavy industry is also interesting, and aligns with what I think of as a realistic stance. I used to work in the R&amp;D section of a hydrogen fuel cell OEM, and one of the primary applications of hydrogen vs. batteries is in exactly the area stated: things that need quite a bit of consistent power generation, like buses or cranes or forklifts. Areas where recharge rate and up-time are really important, since available voltage doesn&#x27;t drop with remaining energy capacity (you have the some available voltage until you stop supplying hydrogen to a fuel cell) and tanks can be refilled or swapped out more quickly than batteries.<p>I think it&#x27;s also worth noting, that at least as far as I know, the tech for that sort of thing isn&#x27;t years and years away on the energy-conversion side. The manufacturing capacity isn&#x27;t exactly at scale yet, but because of the work put in by giants like Toyota and for specialty industries like refrigerated warehouses, I&#x27;d put the maturity of the fuel cells themselves closer to a TRL-7 or -8 than a TRL-2 or -3.

Even though social media is banned in our household, I’ve laid out a few ground rules that must remain sacrosanct for the sake of basic safety.<p>1. Your “real” identity - the one to which your “real” phone number and Social Security number are linked - is for banking, buying a house, trading stocks, paying utility bills, e-commerce, car registration, life insurance, and so on.<p>2. Never do or say anything online that would reveal your “real” identity in any way. There’s a surprisingly broad spectrum of activities which might reveal your identity. Don’t take selfies next to your (or my) car. Don’t take selfies next to home. Better yet, don’t take selfies at all. Don’t geotag anything. Don’t “check into” places. Don’t mention your first name. Don’t be telling anyone about your real birthday. Build an impenetrable firewall between “the internet” and your “real identity”, and keep it in good repair.<p>3. All identities other than the “real” one are throwaway. Use a different e-mail address, phone number, and name for each website. Never use the same pseudonym more than once.<p>4. Don’t tell your real-life friends anything about your “other” identities. Don’t use social media under your “real” identity. This way, the two can never be linked.<p>5. Don’t be afraid to periodically “pull a _why” on your pseudonymous identities. The forest of “yous” will grow thick and lush, and will need a preventive burn every now and again in order to avoid an uncontrollable conflagration later. Delete what you can; abandon what you can’t. Move on and move up.<p>6. If you ever feel compelled to make an exception to the rule, come talk to me before you make the decision. Chances are that I’ll be able to hear you out and make a convincing case against breaking rules 1-5.<p>Ever since I’ve come up with these ground rules, I’ve slowly wound down my own social media presence. I have set up an alter ego under which I’m conducting my open source and other online activities. When asked why I don’t use my “real name” GitHub for anything but work, I say that this is my way of keeping things separate for the sake of sanity and safety. People nod their understanding, but they don’t really get it, and that’s okay. They can’t possibly get to know every side of me."],"time":["2020-02-02 13:28:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22215570],"kids":{},"parent":[22213210],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-02 07:55:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["dhbradshaw"],"id":[22221143],"kids":[22221238,22223725],"parent":[22209984],"text":["The result itself isn&#x27;t shocking of course.<p>However, being able to guess that painting with your feet leads to different brain patterns is much different than showing that it&#x27;s the case.

The process includes things like (a) rapidly reintegrating learning, (b) listing out assumptions and attacking them with an invalidation-minded perspective, (c) brainstorming novel ways to uncover new information cheaply, and (d) rapidly building new mental models and sharing them.<p>That&#x27;s process, too, but not process that creates a functioning machine.

Same experience here (jump in, build knowledge assets, build team). Last part different, be CTO&#x27;s worst fear, have you team scrambled, projects refused, go somewhere else taking on a bigger and harder challenge. Funny part is they lost 2 years, hired obedient lead, then went on building exactly what I presented them. They even went to the press claiming this stuff was their own idea. How would you feel ?<p>Yes, we hate meetings. We understand each other fast, work together at stellar speed, clash often. Sometimes, we code without tests. Bad practice ? Break my code.<p>Pionners and process people are at odds most of the time. Let&#x27;s push this idea further.<p>Pionners are <i>always<\/i> despised by the tenants of current state of affairs. Bourdieu explained this very well regarding art. Why ? Process people have the power and spent most of their lives perfecting their current knowledge and craft. Inventing something disruptive will disrupt their power. Galileo, one example amongst a lot.<p>Even the most advanced people at their time have had theirs quirks around this fact. Maxwell predicted that his models had solved physics and that the few problems remaining (like Black-body radiation) were minor problems, where it led to relativity and a new revolution in physics.<p>Process people are made of habits that work well, ensuring intellectual comfort and easiness, which is very reassuring. We make you itch and scratch, because we live in never-ending uncertainty and know that theories are ephemeral in the grand scheme of things.<p>Some dogmas of biology have collapsed in recent time. One of the most funny was &quot;brain cells don&#x27;t divide after end of adult growth&quot;...<p>This line of reasoning also invalidates a whole part of human theories about things. Fukuoka explained it very clearly: we draw pseudo-conclusions, only valid in a closed-system which in itself is a pale representation of reality. We try to reduce complexity to make it manageable by our current brain power. Those conclusions are wrong, when complexity is taken into account. Economics is based on wrong assumptions, but it works most of the time.<p>Knowing this leads to respect and not mess with fundamental building blocks we don&#x27;t understand (gene editing is such a monstruosity).<p>Tell me about discomfort.<p>Pionners are risk-taking, and don&#x27;t bother about controversies, they create those. They are despised and critisized by process people because they disrupt and destroy, as they create new paradigms. Destruction créatrice. They overthrow intellectual kings.<p>Speaking of experience, being a pionner is <i>very<\/i> difficult as everyone is against you and you got to prove to everyone that what you&#x27;re doing is better and possible.<p>Let&#x27;s digress about personal examples in order to settle those assumptions into reality.<p>When I was a kid I could solve the problems that math teacher gave using different methods. Most teachers would not even look at the method but rather blame it. They didn&#x27;t want to make the intellectual effort to understand the stuff.<p>When I did my PhD I destroyed theories of some peers using experiments. Well, let me tell you, my academic career didn&#x27;t last long.<p>When I worked in aerospace, during the day my boss yelled at me &quot;shitty stuff&quot;, while copying my code in another codebase at night.<p>How can pionners bring value to this world ? It&#x27;s as hard as producing metallic hydrogen. How to convince an investor when you always look at things from another POV. When the problem you&#x27;re tackling is far from solved. Risk seems too high.<p>Let&#x27;s rather focus on solving big corp problems and get easy money.<p>Funny thing is : we have an ability to connect to each other. A gang of weirdos trying to attack the doxa.<p>So, the problem is : can there be a collaboration between those two kind of people ? Here is a very fun example. Rust. This language brings to a large audience some very powerful concepts like ownership, truly a pioneering work. What do people do with that language ? Rewrite the same tools.<p>Problem with pionners is we cannot stand repetitive work. So after the thrill of finding a new solution is gone, we tackle some other problem. That&#x27;s were we can build together as innovating is far from enough, and there is a lot of work left for process people, as told by aforementioned piece.<p>That&#x27;s why I only work in small startups. Because once the group is too large, we are naturally surrounded by process people. Pionners are a small fraction of people. Once critical mass is reached, burden to leap forward is simply <i>too high<\/i>.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Too many pioneers together is a bad mix too. Pionners have strong opinions and this may lead to frequent clash and incompatibilities. Process people all have the same processes, so there is less to argue about.<p>Following that line of reasoning, large organisations are just unable to produce breakthroughs. When processes take over, you&#x27;re doomed.<p>So much respect for Elon Musk who has built crazy ventures that manages to break paradigms. That&#x27;s a crazy achievement. Same holds for Steve Jobs, who could torture an org to squeeze new ideas.<p>But what&#x27;s important ? Intellectual thrill or steady business ?

I&#x27;ll never touch GL.h again.<p>As for what the author of DOME says on exposing fewer abstractions than LOVE, I found I didn&#x27;t have to muck around with low-level details like window resolution that much. LOVE provides the functions wrapping all that and preventing undefined behavior while benefiting ergonomics. The process of resizing the window which took far longer than it should have for me to get right in C++ is handled by a single call to love.window.setMode - and it handles hidpi and fullscreen and stencil buffers and MSAA and a bunch of other things[2]. Imagine implementing all that yourself, supposing that yes, you really do need that stencil buffer in the future. The work has been done already.<p>Where LOVE&#x27;s very large standard library becomes useful is when I code myself into a corner with some inefficiency or wrong drawing output, then I look at the wiki and discover this neat feature I never knew existed that solves the problem. As an example, I wanted to control the size of a sprite batch, but drawing it ignores width and height.

Moreover, it extends to a coherent physical interpretation of the entire Dirac theory, and it implies a <i>zitterbewegung<\/i> interpretation for the Schroedinger theory as well.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;geocalc.clas.asu.edu&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;ZBW_I_QM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;geocalc.clas.asu.edu&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;ZBW_I_QM.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-03 12:31:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sofos123"],"id":[22290768],"kids":[22292693],"parent":[22219730],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;proton-spin-mystery-gains-a-new-clue1&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;proton-spin-myste...<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017-03-proton.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017-03-proton.html<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017-10-proton-puzzle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017-10-proton-puzzle.html<\/a>\nRLM model by Vagenas solves the spin problem easily, some are still trying...that theory of everything based on the standard model is just for hackers... lol"],"time":["2020-02-10 17:49:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mechhacker"],"id":[22220287],"kids":{},"parent":[22219730],"text":["It looks like there is a related article by the same author in 2016.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1742-6596&#x2F;738&#x2F;1&#x2F;012080&#x2F;pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1742-6596&#x2F;738&#x2F;1&#x2F;0...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-03 00:44:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lopsidedBrain"],"id":[22220224],"kids":{},"parent":[22219730],"text":["Press release: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academyofathens.gr&#x2F;en&#x2F;announcements&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;20190328\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academyofathens.gr&#x2F;en&#x2F;announcements&#x2F;press-release...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-03 00:33:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["svd4anything"],"id":[22229911],"kids":{},"parent":[22219730],"text":["This model seems like an incredible breakthrough.

I find too many programmers don&#x27;t understand the value of batches, at every level of code. Batching is super important, both to amortize fixed costs and to reduce serialized blocking for &quot;IO&quot; (this case, if we define IO as &quot;operations which fetch data from a slower data source than the one upon which we&#x27;re operating&quot;).<p>There&#x27;s another mistake programmers are prone to make after learning about the importance of batching. If batches of ten are good, why not a hundred? Why not a million? Lots of people make the mistake, after learning the value of batches, of assuming that bigger is always better. This isn&#x27;t the case either. There are a few reasons why too large batches can also cause problems. For streaming work, large batches hurt latencies of initial results. Access locality can also be harmed when batches are too big. If your cache can fit a hundred of your objects and you perform operations batch-wise in batches of a thousand, you have to fetch each object from main memory per batch. If you worked in units of a hundred instead, then you would fetch each object from main memory once.<p>I find there are a couple of good rules of thumb for batching. Batches should be as small as possible, as long as they are large enough to solve the issues I mentioned earlier. I like to target batch sizes that are large enough that the fixed costs are no more than about 5% of the total costs of executing the batch. In the case of CPU-local work like the one described in this article, you would pick batch size s.t. operation 0 and associated fetches have finished on batch element 0 before you loop back to it to begin work on operation 1. In network situations where tracking batch completion and context switching is less expensive, this doesn&#x27;t make as much sense. Just make it so that multiple batches can run concurrently, and issue multiple network requests to handle each one."],"time":["2020-02-02 18:19:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ncmncm"],"id":[22219434],"kids":{},"parent":[22216738],"text":["Backtrace hires thoughtful people.

The 40% in that line is only for that particular function (I presume the function is taking ~10% total CPU time, and 40% of that is on that singular instruction)<p>------<p>&gt; The first thing to note is that instruction-level profiling tends to put the blame on the instruction following the one that triggered a sampling interrupt.<p>Hmm, in my experience with AMD-based hardware profiling, AMD CPUs may place the blame as far back as ~200 instructions (pathological worst-case) behind the instruction that was interrupted.<p>This is most obvious on AMD branch mispredictions. A branch mispredict can, by definition, only happen on branch instructions (a cmp&#x2F;jmp pair, since cmp&#x2F;jmp turn into a single double-instruction micro-op on both AMD and Intel). But you&#x27;ll find mispredictions &quot;blamed&quot; on all sorts of non-branching instructions on AMD-hardware.

Intel has PEBS, precision event-based sampling, which helps narrow down the specific instruction to &quot;blame&quot;.<p>This blogpost doesn&#x27;t say which CPU its using, but unfortunately, these little details do matter. Ultimately, I&#x27;d investigate more before concluding the prefetcht0 instruction is actually the problem.<p>If Store Forwarding might be an issue, then LD_BLOCKS.STORE_FORWARD event on Intel Skylake would be a performance counter to check.<p>--------------<p>&gt; and accelerate random accesses to the hash table with software prefetching.<p>Does prefetching actually help in this case?

As a customer, my costs would be more predictable with less risks, and you could always have a mixed model (like for example Jetbrains has with it&#x27;s IDEs), where you could still charge &#x27;per seat&#x27;, and have a subscription-like model where people get cheaper mayor upgrades and maybe support if they pay annually.<p>As I said, I can understand choosing a pure subscription based model.

So the coffee analogy can wake you up that $5&#x2F;mo or $10&#x2F;mo is an almost ridiculously low price for a piece of software that solves any sort of problem.<p>It&#x27;s worth pondering why SaaS founders are so inclined toward underpricing. I think this is because SaaS founders, especially if they are developers, tend to be really frugal in their SaaS and PaaS spending. For example, they&#x27;ll use things like their DigitalOcean Droplet cost or their GitHub Pro subscription as a point of comparison. They&#x27;ll think, &quot;Those services are <i>so<\/i> valuable, and so cheap, so why would anyone buy my thing for more? I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>But what they tend to forget or ignore is that, especially in B2B, it&#x27;s not your buyer&#x27;s wallet or money at stake. It&#x27;s your buyer&#x27;s (or your buyer&#x27;s department&#x27;s) allocated budget. And budget allocations for businesses in mid-market and enterprise are always measured in thousands of dollars, and sometimes in millions.<p>All they care about is spending the money wisely -- that is, appropriately trading money for revenue, for cost reduction, for time savings, for company cultural impact, or, ideally, for all of the above. At that point, pricing too low can be counterproductive: many enterprises will, consciously or subconsciously, worry that your pricing being that low means you are a counterparty risk and thus not even worth hiring as a vendor.<p>In the B2C space or in the &quot;B2B tools for individual employees&quot; space, to understand your pricing power requires understanding your buyer demographics. If you are selling productivity software to executives, they will think in terms cost relative to their time and the time of their assistants and subordinates. If you are selling hosting software to entrepreneurs, they will want low starting pricing but be OK with pricing that scales quickly with growth. If you are selling a video streaming or premium content service to consumers, they will anchor you against Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and cable. Selecting your price is a very important part of your strategy and how your service is perceived. Picking the lowest price you can afford at reasonable margins, which is a kind of obvious default, is often a terrible strategy."],"time":["2020-02-02 16:35:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jmnicolas"],"id":[22217284],"kids":[22218913,22217464],"parent":[22216255],"text":["The problem with &quot;cup-of-coffee pricing&quot; is that if I trust everybody that has a subscription to sell to me, at the end of the month I will be broke.<p>Too much subscriptions is death by a thousand cuts."],"time":["2020-02-02 16:21:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gnicholas"],"id":[22219277],"kids":[22219540,22219989,22219386,22219755,22220740,22242986,22219499],"parent":[22216255],"text":["This article frames the cup-of-coffee pricing comparison as: &quot;$100&#x2F;mo is less than a cup of coffee every day&quot;.

Just going to share my take.<p>Growth cannot go forever due to these factors I observed:<p>1. More and more wealth seems to be captured and locked away somewhere while the rest of the populace is left to having to cope with globally dwindling redistributable capital.<p>2. Population isn&#x27;t even declining everywhere but I&#x27;ve read several times here in HN that white people in first-world countries procreate less and less. Reasons can be a lot and my anecdotal evidence is that the cost of a basic life and some small extra affordances goes up every year. Families get more and more conservative on their spends and&#x2F;or jobs. Many people here in Eastern Europe just decide to live on welfare and half-day crappy jobs somewhere but at least these jobs aren&#x27;t stressful and don&#x27;t require 2-3 hours in traffic every day. When you do the math such a way of life nets them 70-80% of what they would otherwise make so their choice is really quite logical. In these conditions the economy stagnates and companies get desperate for good staff while the government couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>3. The population declines at places because people view raising kids as a huge financial and stress investment and not as the life-fulfilling purpose that raising kids is usually viewed as. This is mostly related to how much time is needed for a young person these days to actually start contributing to their raising (or new) family. Many people are just scared if they are going to be able to be financially stable for 25-30 years in the future. Others like myself are just burned out.<p>4. The economy gradually seems to be taken over by the very classic breed of venture investors that don&#x27;t give a hoot about organically growing your customer base or actually taking care of your employees. Even in a presumably more conservative market like Europe, I see this more and more. Can we even discuss growth if, even against all odds, your company becomes hugely successful BUT has to return the investments tenfold? Again, this is a captured wealth going to somebody else&#x27;s pocket (and they don&#x27;t seem to be interested in redistributing it).<p>---<p>I could be gravely mistaken and be a victim of living in a filter bubble. Of course.<p>But it&#x27;s what I am seeing periodically and it worries me. People just don&#x27;t care that much for making kids or looking for jobs since it all just guarantees suffering and sacrifices and nothing much else.<p>Many elderly people tell me that they regularly chat with their kids (now 30-45) and are convinced that having a fulfilling life was easier even as back as 20-30 years ago.

Perfect replication of the information required to sustain the current cumulative knowledge level doesn&#x27;t happen because there is no guarantee that any one person that knows a thing can successfully communicate it to someone else in a way that can be understood, and that in the process of doing so, that that information isn&#x27;t mutated in such a manner that something important isn&#x27;t lost. Children amuse themselves with this phenomena all the time. It&#x27;s called a game of &quot;Telephone&quot;.\nGiven an acknowledgement of this, the tendency for population decline to result in problems for a world that has been architected around the guarantee of population and economic growth is immediately intuitive.<p>As death removes older generations, the knowledge they had and failed to clearly replicate dies with them. Each new member of the population birthed in is a new crank on the slot machine of information propagation. Their life circumstances might allow them to understand that bit of arcane knowledge that no one else was able to do anything with because it didn&#x27;t make sense to them because the constellation of shared lived experience between communicator and communicated necessary for comprehension wasn&#x27;t there. New idea formulation, or old idea reformulation and propagation becomes reliable and less likely to snowball out of control to irrevocable loss as long as you keep throwing new blood at it.<p>If there is no new blood though, the numbers quickly begin to favor the life experiences required to underpin all the minutiae to sustain the corpus of knowledge as is not reoccurring in total across the entire breadth of the population, and you start to find your smaller remaining population further and further isolated from the practical experiences that made the linguistic representations of knowledge written down understandable. The knowledge then becomes useless, a dependency in the infrastructure that enables efficient physical completion of labor is lost, thus your population&#x27;s output of tasks done per unit time drops, thus more work must be done just to keep things running, and so on and so forth until basic principles are again reformulated, and efficiencies from a chance rediscovery of the necessary experience underpinning a lynchpin technology can be realized again.<p>Just as information transfer is lossy, so is physical labor. If you have 1 million tasks that must be done in a day to maintain a stable level of output, and you decrease the number of agents available to do the tasks, the math simply works out that more work has to be done per agent to maintain output in a steady state, and we all know that the work output of a human being isn&#x27;t trivially scaled up without ballooning the prerequisite knowledge required to do the task (I.e. skills at using tools, skills to teach the skills to use the tools, the tools to make the tools, the skills to operate the tools to make the tools, etc...) all of which themselves become tasks added on to the overall workload of your dwindling population who are working harder and harder to maintain the highest level of output possible.<p>The other issue not even touched on is the desirability of continued high growth regimes in the presence of a near tipping-point constraint violation to which a remediary measure has not been formulated. I.e. Excess carbon footprint. If you stay in your high growth regime in a wager to get that innovation faster from a new member, you&#x27;re still templating your current footprint of resource use, and accelerating reaching your tipping point, with no guarantee you&#x27;ll find it in time. Decline is a natural outcome in an organism facing this type of environmental dynamic constraint to buy time for other (in this paper, unrepresented, but which one can represent as decreased demand to output more of the destabilizing factor by your population, or natural processes operating to free up buffer space by things like carbon recapture and sequestration) processes time to shift the dynamics back in favor of supporting a new high growth regime.<p>I have the utmost respect for those that can trivially converse in the higher maths; I&#x27;ll admit I had to crack open some books to understand what the heck they were getting at and whether it even made sense. I draw the line though where doing your analysis as they did takes you right out of reality into the atrophied realm of post-facto narrativization.<p>Those equations are meaningless to most readers, whereas putting things in terms of tasks to be completed, and characterizing overall knowledge level management as what it is, a bunch of overhead tasks draws the same Senate picture that it took them mucking around in control theory to even tangentially articulate. It started a conversation yes, but by constraining it to the realm of finance and economics, and leaving out the <i>rest of the world<\/i> you run afoul of that great aphorism that &quot;problems cannot be solved with the same level of thinking that created them in the first place&quot;, which is exactly what this paper appears to be an example of doing.<p>Gah!"],"time":["2020-02-02 23:18:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacques_chester"],"id":[22219809],"kids":{},"parent":[22201340],"text":["At Pivotal (now part of VMware, but it&#x27;s easier to explain this way) we have an increasing number of teams that track &quot;vulnerability budgets&quot; and &quot;legacy budgets&quot;, by way of analogy to &quot;error budgets&quot; from SRE approaches.[0]<p>Essentially, a vulnerability budget tracks days since last release for a dependency or system; a legacy budget tracks time left until a dependency or system falls out of support.

A lot of people hate to hear this, but get over it.<p>Let&#x27;s take something that&#x27;s very controversy in the tech world, white boarding.  Why do many programmers hate it and are not good at it?   Sure, you can claim it&#x27;s lack of practice.  No problem.   But guess what?  Does that can do it and do it well are more than 1x programmers.  For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s call them a mere 2x.   What does it take to whiteboard code?  It means you need to be able to understand the problem, clarify requirement, understand the constraint, solve the problem a bit mentally before writing code, write the code, explain your thought process, improve the code, consider multiple solutions, perform algorithm analysis in terms of performance, and you do all this in 15-40 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s not that most programmer&#x27;s won&#x27;t, most programmers can&#x27;t with their current skill sets.  Perhaps they can learn how to, but they refuse to.   Doing the necessary drills to be able to do those shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated, it makes you an all around better programmer.<p>With that said, there&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;programming&quot; and &quot;application development&quot;   A great programmer could be a terrible application developer, a mediocre programmer could be a great app developer.   Application development and shipping software is more than code artifact it&#x27;s about collaboration with teams, writing great documentations, user documentation, installation documents, operation docs.  It&#x27;s about great UI, great UX, designing the code to be easily extensible and readable.  There&#x27;s a lot to it.   So you might be a 1x programmer, but make up for it in other areas.  This also explains why some 10x programmers don&#x27;t produce 10x the output because they are not solving algorithm challenge everyday, but having to deal with the vague human oriented requirements.<p>There are 10x programmers, they can make a team much better if they understand their strengths and weaknesses and don&#x27;t think they are gods.   There are 10x programmers who are also very strong in design and other areas and it&#x27;s amazing to watch them work.<p>It&#x27;s no myth, they are out there.   The very thought of them makes some of us feel less capable, get over it.  You can increase your output if you consciously work to be better, and this is not about being a specialist in a specific domain area.<p>A good test of such thing is take a 10x programmer, a 1x programmer, give them a language they have never worked in, put them in a new domain.  The difference is clear.   Have you ever seen such folks?  Yup, we have, they are folks they moved to new domains, they were writing C code yesterday and now writing go lang and contributing to k8s, or they were writing java code yesterday and today writing C++ code and contributing heavily in the field of ML.<p>We have been been fortunate to know some of them due to this very site.  I&#x27;m not going to name them, it&#x27;s been done multiple times.  But I&#x27;m sure HN can name at least 50 such individuals."],"time":["2020-02-02 18:22:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yason"],"id":[22216212],"kids":[22216389],"parent":[22215060],"text":["The article isn&#x27;t what I thought it might be.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t really challenge the existence of the 10x programmers but merely puts it in perspective from project management&#x27;s view.<p>It is mostly about not relying on the superprogrammers when it comes managing software projects because they are so rare and need highly complex free-form work field to execute their magic. Just merely hiring the best programmers and subjecting them to a working schedule and distribution of tasks designed to accommodate average programmers doesn&#x27;t improve overall productivity much and certainly doesn&#x27;t give you 10x or even 2x productivity improvements. This all makes sense and is probably known to people who manage software engineers and software projects.<p>The article does mention the high differences between the worst and the best programmers and says that it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to compare the best to the worst. But the 10x has always been used to underline the whole scale itself, or that order-of-magnitude differences exist in the first place. The best-to-worst can even be higher, from 10x to 50x, but 10x is the illustrative reference point. But that&#x27;s not the shocking property.<p>What&#x27;s really unsettling in this phenomenon is that if you take a seriously good programmer and compare him&#x2F;her to the near-magical best programmers, there&#x27;s still easily a 2-3x difference and that&#x27;s just unbelievable. For example, take the best programmer at your workplace and compare how much better people like Fabrice Bellard are? In other words, what&#x27;s the Bellard ratio of your co-worker? 2x? 3x? Are five fingers enough or do you need another hand?<p>Then take an established, skilled professional of any other more traditional field and make a comparison to the very best individuals on the same field: what&#x27;s the max skill factor you can find? The best race car driver to a good race car driver? The best golf player to a good, successful golf player? One point...what?<p>Higher multiples can be seen in fields that tie together more dimensions of skills into a more complex domain, such as stem fields. The best mathematicians or the best physicists are likely to be a lot, lot better than just good mathematicians or physicists. But in my experience the differences in programming are even greater. I tend to think that it&#x27;s because of the field of domains computing appears in the sweetspot where it is both bound by practical, physical limitations of hardware and unbounded, abstract theory and imagination together form a huge <i>complexity rabbit hole<\/i>. If computer science could proceed without the limits of processing capability and the speed of electrical circuits it would converge with mathematics to a closer degree, and things would be less complex. And if computer science would only focus on few simple things at a time like early relay computers it would resonate more with electronics and physics. But throw in a few million lines of code that has to do something useful instead of just being highly theoretical or something complex enough that a simple, practical approach is out of the question, and you&#x27;ve got the essence of programming.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s very easy to have things get very complex in computing and because we&#x27;re still bound by the limitations of cpu and i&#x2F;o we can&#x27;t allow ourselves to go too deep in that complexity just to be able to even run any of our programs within a meaningful time, it becomes a jungle of tradeoffs and to navigate that jungle you basically have to be able to considered everything that&#x27;s involved in it. That gets complex. And because handling complexity is <i>hard<\/i> it only makes sense that the very skill of handling behaves very exponentially: if the best decile is close to ~10x better than the worst decile, the best in that the best decile are likely to be close to ~10 better than the worst in the best decile."],"time":["2020-02-02 11:14:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Abnq9103k"],"id":[22217276],"kids":{},"parent":[22215060],"text":["Does Bill Nichols have any significant programming output?

We have certain objects that live on the JavaScript heap (which is garbage collected), or are directly owned by objects on the JS heap, and then we have system objects involved in basic I&#x2F;O that aren&#x27;t necessarily tied to a particular JS isolate and are not garbage collected, but are often tied to specific OS threads. JS objects and system objects are allowed to own instances of each other, but the ownership must be handled in a special way. E.g., when a system object holds a reference to a JS object, the destructor must ensure the JS isolate lock is held before releasing that reference. Conversely when a JS object holds ownership of a system object, and the JS object is garbage collected, we need to queue the system object&#x27;s destructor to run in the thread where it was created.<p>Conceptually, it ought to be easy to write rules where each type is declared as being a system type or a JS type, and then the compiler could trivially enforce that the correct sort of references are used between them.

If the information isn&#x27;t a factor in any decision, its value of information [3] is zero.<p>Perhaps I haven&#x27;t paid close enough attention to this, but in AI safety I never got a sense for what people would do with the forecasts.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;schema.org&#x2F;Claim\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;schema.org&#x2F;Claim<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22127537\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22127537<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictionbook.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictionbook.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Value_of_information\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Value_of_information<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-03 06:10:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scribu"],"id":[22220577],"kids":[22220823],"parent":[22219753],"text":["Seems to be an ad for their platform for creating notebooks that mix plain text with specific forecasting questions.<p>Looks cool, but what I&#x27;d be interested in would be a rigorous method of combining the outputs from multiple questions."],"time":["2020-02-03 01:56:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ra5"],"id":[22214977],"kids":[22215044,22224253,22215034],"parent":[22214346],"text":["As a huge basketball fan I think this is great.

Coal miners who are no longer able to work because the coal mine shut down and they have no other skills get this &quot;disability&quot; income, and in Ghettoside the author describes former gang members also qualifying under the rationale that they are unsuited to the formal workforce and are therefore &quot;disabled&quot; as well.  But what it can serve to do is break the cycle of criminal behavior:  when the former drug dealer gets out of jail, absent other opportunities or a safety net source of funding to cover life&#x27;s basics, they quickly fall into the path of least resistance and return to their criminal behavior.  The social security disability payments give them another option to turn things around.  Now, if they transform themselves into a legal entrepreneur or productive employee, they sure don&#x27;t seem disabled any longer, which is part of the problem with this being a non-universal BI.  It is akin to the downsides of a negative income tax:  it gives only to some, and when you do that you have opportunities to abuse the system, and you have more process costs&#x2F;friction and barriers to entry which keep some who should get it from getting it.<p>Social security disability is an abused program, with attorneys advertising their ability to get you qualified, which is the irksome aspect of this being a non-universal basic income:  it is only available to the savvy or those willing to engage an unscrupulous attorney to qualify.

As Schumpeter pointed out many decades ago the idea that &#x27;small is beautiful&#x27; is not really true.<p>The equilibrium for innovative ecosystems is not small-scale but rather monopolistic competition, because complex production processes require scale and knowledge that can only be managed by sufficiently large institutions. In mature industries, the competition happens between monopolistic players who for a while earn surplus profit through the collection of economic rent and are then replaced through creative destruction by another player (think Myspace and Facebook), rather than the bazaar economy that this article seems to advocate in which profits are constantly burned away by competition, it is surplus capital of monopolistic firms that enables innovation.<p>This also shows in productivity statistics, wages and so on, where large firms simply win out.

That will tell you the base calories you need to maintain current body weight by measuring the amount of oxygen your body burns while breathing. I think I paid less than $100 for this.<p>You can also get a Dexta scan that tells you your body body composition, how much fat, how much muscle mass. I think I pay $70  every scan and get one a couple of times a year. You can use this data also to calculate estimated required calories, body composition, are you loosing fat&#x2F;muscle and gives data to change diet accordingly.<p>You only need to be in a small 300 cal deficit to loose weight. If you want to maintain muscle mass and drop body fat it&#x27;s better to be in the smallest deficit possible and this will also reduce hunger.<p>If you want to loose body weight quickly and maintain muscle that&#x27;s hard! That does require a bigger calorie deficit by reducing food, and increasing activity (cardio) to burn more while getting macros exactly right to hold on to as much muscle as possible although you will loose muscle. Bodybuilders are experts at this, they pile on weight during the off season so they are in a calorie surplus so they can gain muscle then diet down to single digit body fat percentages trying to hold as much muscle as possible.<p>Everyone talks about loosing weight but you can not weigh much and be fat aka skinny fat and unfit.

The worst bugs I see in production systems are almost never caused by typos or by comparing incompatible types; usually they&#x27;re caused by issues in the flow and manipulation of data; for example the same instance is being modified in two different parts of the code without the other part of the code being aware of it; or in the case of pure FP a function is using outdated instances because a change in the underlying data source did not propagate through correctly, etc...<p>TypeScript is to a software developer what a spell checker is to a book author; it&#x27;s convenient but once you run the final product past your editor-in-chief (whose analogy in the software world are unit&#x2F;integration tests), the spell checking didn&#x27;t actually add any value; at best it saved your editor-in-chief some time. It has no bearing at all on whether or not you&#x27;ll get a Pulitzer Prize or a top ranking on Amazon.<p>The downside to TypeScript is compile time and this is a significant drawback IMO because it slows down iteration time significantly. Time spent waiting for the build to finish is time that was not used to add new tests and new features.<p>If you add up all the time that all developers on a project spent on waiting for the build (or lost their focus&#x2F;train of thought as a result of waiting for the build to complete), how many extra unit or integration tests could have been written using that lost time? I think if you do the math, you will find that TypeScript is a net liability to the project."],"time":["2020-02-01 12:45:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["austincheney"],"id":[22209423],"kids":{},"parent":[22205652],"text":["There are problems in their approach:<p>In the first case the behavior is quirky because they are passing an untyped object into a function.

And it&#x27;s a single value that -- ha ha ha ha -- that if only that wasn&#x27;t there, imagine all the problems we wouldn&#x27;t have, right? If type systems were designed that way. And some type systems are, and some type systems are getting there, but boy, trying to retrofit that on top of a type system that has null in the first place is quite an undertaking.&quot; -Anders Hejlsberg<p>&gt;Andrew Hejlsberg:<p>&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll just add, with language design, you know one of the things that&#x27;s interesting, you look at all of us old geezers sitting up here, and we&#x27;re proof positive that languages move slowly.<p>&gt;A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that languages move at the same speed as hardware or all of the other technologies that we live with.<p>&gt;But languages are much more like math and much more like the human brain, and they all have evolved slowly. And we&#x27;re still programming in languages that were invented 50 years ago. All the the principles of functional programming were though of more than 50 years ago.<p>&gt;I do think one of the things that is luckily happening is that, like as Larry says, everyone&#x27;s borrowing from everyone, languages are becoming more multi-paradigm.<p>&gt;I think it&#x27;s wrong to talk about &quot;Oh, I only like object oriented programming languages, or I only like imperative programming, or functional programming&quot;.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s important to look at where is the research, and where is the new thinking, and where are new paradigms that are interesting, and then try to incorporate them, but do so tastefully in a sense, and work them into whatever is there already.<p>&gt;And I think we&#x27;re all learning a lot from functional programming languages these days. I certainly feel like I am. Because a lot of interesting research has happened there. But functional programming is imperfect. And no one writes pure functional programs. I mean, because they don&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s all about how can you tastefully sneak in mutation in ways that you can better reason about.

You don&#x27;t dare get sloppy with your gear when you&#x27;re mountain climbing, because it has a clear price.&quot; -James Gosling<p>&gt;&quot;I have a feature that I am sort of jealous of because it&#x27;s appearing in more and more other languages: pattern matching.

So this 3 points from article might be improved in future.<p>About the point the article makes:<p>1) I remember when excess property check was introduces I was really happy! Because I remembered bug that would be caught with it. I had some interface with optional properties in common library and I renamed property name. Of course when I updated this library in another project I didn&#x27;t get any compile errors because this was optional property and now I was just passing some extra property which was ignored. Excess property check would have found it because I was passing object literal.<p>Structural typing is great choice in Typescript because it&#x27;s basically type-safe duck-typing which is used everywhere in Javascript projects. It&#x27;s not uncommon to have one component that accept objects with some properties but this object contains many extra properties because it came from different component and these properties are used elsewhere. It&#x27;s standard pattern in Javascript world. But when your function requires some object of given shape and you are <i>creating this object right now<\/i> using literal syntax, then it&#x27;s <i>really<\/i> likely that you made a mistake. Why create extra properties for <i>just created<\/i> object when you clearly see they are additional? And I read that Typescript teams is very happy with this feature[0].<p>However, excess properties check is great but useful only on call side. I cannot say that my function doesn&#x27;t accept extra parameters. I would really love to get Exact types[1]. Which would allow me to force not having extra parameter in passed object.<p>2) As mentioned in article, Flow decided to have classes nominally typed. In Typescript everything is structurally typed so it&#x27;s actually more consistent ;) \nI really hope we&#x27;ll get nominal typing and opaque types sometime in future. I read TS team was thinking a lot how to do this. I don&#x27;t remember what is the current status of this.<p>3) For me it&#x27;s more problematic that Typescript doesn&#x27;t narrow types of an union when you do conditional check. The reason is that in general it is unsound (but I think it would not be if you had only union of Exact types, that&#x27;s another reason why I would love to have Exact types!).<p>Example in article doesn&#x27;t have this problem so I guess this could have been improved. Sound like minor issue for me but maybe author could create suggestion on github to improve it and allow discriminator to be nested?<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12936#issuecomment-284590083\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12936#issueco...<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12936\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12936<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-02 01:14:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Slashbot"],"id":[22206032],"kids":{},"parent":[22205652],"text":["C#:\nint x<p>Java:\nint x<p>Cpp:\nint x<p>C:\nint x<p>Some fucking retards at MS derp corp...\nTypeScrap:<p>x: int"],"time":["2020-01-31 22:33:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["kjtekn"],"id":[22210110],"kids":[22210603],"parent":[22205652],"text":["I like how nobody has realized that typescript is classic Microsoft embrace, extend, extinguish.

If you are inclined to be paranoid, there is indeed a way to hide a real attack in what looks like a simple ntohl() bug here.<p>&gt; This &quot;sometimes&quot;connection behavior is often seen in tagging attacks, where the adversary abuses Tor&#x27;s AES-CTR mode stream-cipher-style properties to XOR a tag at one end of a circuit, and undo that tag only if the other endpoint is present. In this way, only the connections that actually succeed are those that the adversary is <i>certain<\/i> that they are in both positions in the circuit (to perform Guard discovery, or if they are the Guard relay, to confirm deanonymization).<p>&gt; If you want to hide your tagging attack as what looks like a simple ntohl() bug here, you send your intro2 with the reverse IP address. Then, when your middle node suspects a candidate rend cell (via timing + circuit setup fingerprinting, to have a guess), it can confirm this guess by undoing the tag by XORing the cipherstream with ntohl(ip) XOR ip.<p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<p>&gt; Aka a correctly performing rend cell tag hidden in what looks like a very common networking bug.<p>&gt; This cipherstream tagging weakness has had a few proposals to fix, most recently: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitweb.torproject.org&#x2F;torspec.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;295-relay-crypto-with-adl.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitweb.torproject.org&#x2F;torspec.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;295...<\/a><p>&gt; BUT DON&#x27;T PANIC: There is also an alternate explanation for the &quot;sometimes succeed&quot; red flag in this particular case, other than a tagging attack.<p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<p>&gt; So most likely, this is just a poorly written Tor client, <i>but<\/i> there still is the possibility that it is an attack cleverly disguised as a poorly written Tor client.. :&#x2F;<p>&gt; It may be a good idea for Neal&#x27;s&#x2F;our monitoring infrastructure to keep an eye on this behavior too, for this reason, to test for the side channel usage + rend XOR &quot;correction&quot; vs just dumb bug that is sometimes connecting by getting lucky (and thus never properly reverses the rend IP address). If this is indeed just a bug, when these rends do succeed, the IP address should never be correct.<p>&gt; The way to do that would be to build rend circuits using 3rd hops that you (the service operator) control, so that that 3rd hop can check if the rend succeeds because the TLS connection happened to be open (benign behavior) or because the reversed ntohl() got corrected somehow (attack).<p>0) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.torproject.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;tor-dev&#x2F;2020-February&#x2F;014146.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.torproject.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;tor-dev&#x2F;2020-February...<\/a><p>1) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.torproject.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;tor-dev&#x2F;2020-February&#x2F;014154.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.torproject.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;tor-dev&#x2F;2020-February...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-06 04:22:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimbo1qaz"],"id":[22214369],"kids":[22214531],"parent":[22212001],"text":["The embedded images are ugly because of the downscaling (the URL contains &amp;size=600)."],"time":["2020-02-02 01:51:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chx"],"id":[22208000],"kids":[22208175,22208172],"parent":[22207614],"text":["This needs a 2019 in the title.<p>This is a little more than USB 3.2 2x2 + TB3 but there&#x27;s one crucial difference: the new, still optional USB 4 Gen 3 (what TB3 was) now carries USB packets as well.

I do however have some comments:<p>- The &quot;appstore&quot;-like experience already exists in the ecosystem, in a sense. You have package managers with post-install and configuration scripts (Installing slapd for example yields a perfectly functioning instance within 2 minutes), or maybe Ansible playbooks that run the instance with a simple file configuration and one command.\nFor package managers, it all depends on the packaging.<p>- Again the ecosystem somewhat already exists in a way if you consider Docker for example. All the dependencies are neatly packaged, and if you think kubernetes, then you you have helm as the appstore. It even solves the possible problems with ports and schenanigans that the user mentions. (But again, post-install triggers in debconf for ufw on ubuntu for example already do this. It all depends on the packaging.)<p>But as the author points out, not everyone is keen on hitting the terminal, but that has been a problem (or rather a business opportunity) for long enough that there are solid, uncomplicated and perhaps way more convenient (and eco-friendly) ways to achieve what the author is thinking of accomplishing.<p>One thing that comes to mind is the amazing Synology products. In fact, they implement the exact vision of the author: Run your software on your NAS, and have a dynamic DNS graciously provided by synology to access it. E-mail server, file sharing, photos app, even photo recognition, and a plethora of other stuff. You can even run VMs or Docker on it ! And all within the synology appstore (with some magic nat traversal I presume because it does not need any port forwarding)<p>And that is just one example of something I&#x27;ve seen and witnessed to work very well and reliably too.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, the author&#x27;s vision is shared amongst a lot of people and there may even be commercial solutions out there that implement it.
