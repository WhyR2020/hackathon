There are a lot of BIPAP and CPAP machines which can be used for that sort of thing.<p>There is a consistent reference to a PEEP of 5cm which is too low for the desired use case. I know the design is adjustable but the fact that this is not acknowledged is again a sign that they may not have understood what is needed.<p>There is no blending arrangement for running on an O2&#x2F;air mix. I don&#x27;t understand why they did not add that.<p>I don&#x27;t object to this stuff, it&#x27;s all a bit of fun, but the ventilator shortage is going to be fixed if it is by combining the resources of idled factories with mass production capabilities with the knowledge of ventilator manufacturers.<p>When we did this in WWII, we did not ask Ford and GM, &quot;Could you build us a bomber, please?&quot;. They collaborated with plane manufacturers to convert their factories to produce existing designs.<p>If I was in charge of this effort, here is what I would do:<p>First, in the near terms, make sure that existing manufacturers have what they need to boost their own production.<p>-People who work in aerospace (or F1 racing, of a few other things) for instance have experience in hand assembly of critical components following procedures precisely. This is a better resource to draw on than other manufacturing workers such as auto workers. You could bulk out the assembly teams in existing manufacturers with these people.<p>-What parts will they soon run out of? If their supply chain can&#x27;t deliver, what alternatives can be rapidly qualified for use? Valves and sensors could be sourced from non-medical-grade manufacturers, preferably aviation or other safety critical because again - they live in a similar world as far as traceability and quality goes.<p>In parallel you work on a basic design that meets the requirements of treating ARDS. You do that using the engineers who design ventilators anyway, together with supply chain and manufacturing experts from your other industries so that you design something that the supply chain can either produce or more likely they can produce sub-assemblies and&#x2F;or parts."],"time":["2020-03-25 10:49:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BooneJS"],"id":[22681562],"kids":{},"parent":[22680643],"text":["I understand these devices take 2-3 years not reach market.

Really?<p>These are life critical systems designed with serious fault tolerance in mind.  Home Depot parts, randomly sourced solenoids, valves and fucking Arduino&#x27;s?  Has everyone gone insane?<p>Here, go read the Wikipedia page on ventilators:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ventilator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ventilator<\/a><p>Let me highlight a few sections.  Like this one:<p>&quot;Because failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as life-critical systems, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their power-supply.&quot;<p>&quot;Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no single point of failure can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an anaesthetic machine). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.&quot;<p>I mean, seriously, read that again right now.  If you have zero experience in fault-tolerant design of electronics, mechanics, pneumatic, hydraulic and software systems, please recognize the dangers of the Dunning-Kruger effect and stop.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t enough, there&#x27;s this:<p>&quot;In Canada and the United States, respiratory therapists are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance. In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient&#x27;s interaction with the ventilator is done by critical care nurses.&quot;<p>In case the point isn&#x27;t obvious, what this means is that certified professionals have to operate these devices.  They are not going to get anywhere close to a pile of parts from Home Depot and the local auto repair shop.  They are trained to operate reasonably standardized equipment and expect form, function and reliability that comes with time-tested, certified and well proven professionally manufactured equipment.<p>Want to build something to help?  Maybe figure out how to make hospital beds.  My guess is there&#x27;s far less likelihood of killing people with a frame and a matress than with a pile of Home Depot parts and an Arduino pretending to be a ventilator.<p>Why are these posts even permitted on HN?

They developed a way to make in-copyright books available for free to anyone who wants to read them online: by keeping a physical copy of each book they scan, they can justify &quot;lending&quot; it to one person at a time online for a limited period. Their collection of scanned in-copyright books has been growing rapidly. Try searching at the Open Library for some popular book you enjoyed reading when you were younger—mystery, Western, young adult, science fiction—and they&#x27;re likely to have a copy that you can &quot;check out&quot; and read in your browser. You even get to enjoy the yellowing of old paperback pages without the stench of the decaying paper.<p>The new initiative is bold both because it meets an urgent, unprecedented need—providing books to millions of people who are locked down and cannot go to libraries—and because it seems to be taking significant legal risks for the greater good. The announcement at archive.org links to a document [1] that in turn links to some attempts at legal justifications for the move. I&#x27;ll let others weigh the merits of those arguments.

So by changing the reset vector to point to an arbitrary address in flash, then resetting the CPU under the debugger, you can get it to load your desired word from memory into the PC.<p>Pretty clever."],"time":["2020-03-26 00:28:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22689121],"kids":{},"parent":[22688731],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-25 23:37:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["rollulus"],"id":[22691952],"kids":{},"parent":[22688731],"text":["I&#x27;m curious how they managed to get in contact with STM.

I talked to almost every single PM who had a booth there (and at MS, PMs are also developers). I learned that if you push MS PMs hard enough and ask the right questions, most will drop the marketing facade and give you the insider&#x27;s view. (after all, developers -- by personality trait -- generally hate two-faced marketing talk and would genuinely rather talk about the tech)<p>This unfiltered insider&#x27;s view is decidedly quite different from Microsoft&#x27;s enterprise marketing&#x27;s messaging. Attending Microsoft Build and talking to PMs helped us avoid investing our efforts in Azure services that turned out to be dead-ends. (many of Azure&#x27;s GA stuff are feature complete but not truly production-ready) Short of running POCs, there exist few other low-effort means of procuring this intelligence other than by talking to (honest) Azure consultants at Meetups who have to deal with this stuff in daily production.<p>My conclusion from the conference (corroborated with my own dev experience) was that the parts of Azure that were built on pre-existing Microsoft technology (like VMs and SQL Servers) were generally solid and could be relied upon.<p>Whereas many new-fangled PaaS&#x2F;SaaS cloud-only offerings tend not to be as battle-tested and would often fail on corner cases, so one would be prudent to think twice about putting mission-critical workloads on them. Also, one learns that despite the glossy marketing material, some Azure offerings turned to not have had any dev activity on them due to low uptake. There are still maturity issues in Azure today, and my gut feel is that most enterprises that do run on Azure mostly use their IaaS (VMs, SQL) offerings -- these are the most mature -- rather than their PaaS and SaaS offerings.<p>The common refrain from marketing folks is that cloud development is a moving target, and what was true a week ago might not be true now (a trivially true statement but of no practical use)."],"time":["2020-03-26 01:39:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["frost_knight"],"id":[22689867],"kids":{},"parent":[22684965],"text":["This past February I had the honor of giving my first ever keynote presentation.

I&#x27;ve personally used a product from each of these categories at some time in the past:<p>- The kind that measure brain activity, like as Dreem or Philips SmartSleep - these, in my experience are by far the most accurate and useful devices you can buy. Dreem even has a self-run study comparing the devices to a proper sleep study setup. They are however, quite expensive.<p>- The kind that lays under&#x2F;on top of the bed and indirectly measures heart-rate, breathing rate and body movements. These are <i><\/i>okay<i><\/i> as far as accuracy goes. They can&#x27;t directly tell you how your sleep is but they capture enough indirect information that they can make a decent guess, at least regarding how much sleeo you get. They&#x27;re differentiated from the wrist-based trackers in that they can detect any kind of body movement and they can measure your breathing rate as well. They also don&#x27;t require you to have a potentially uncomfortable device strapped to your wrist.<p>- The kind that you wear on your wrist like Apple Watch and fitness bands - these, in my experience, are garbage. Like the under&#x2F;over-bed devices, they measure your sleep indirectly but unlike those devices, they capture less useful information and require wearing a potentially uncomfortable device when you&#x27;re trying to sleep.<p>- Smartphone apps - these, in my experience, are absolute garbage. They&#x27;re not sensitive enough to pick up any useful information about your sleep state. All they can really do is tell you if you&#x27;re moving or not. Maybe they can pick up snoring.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in accurately measuring your sleep state and catching things like short periods of wakefulness or the precise amount of time it takes you to get to sleep and wake up, I can&#x27;t recommend Dreem enough. I&#x27;ve owned one for over a year now and it&#x27;s been spot-on every time. Since it&#x27;s attached to your head it takes a little bit of getting used to but I don&#x27;t even feel it anymore.<p>Since you say you&#x27;re interested specifically in tracking your leg movements, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that the on&#x2F;under-bed trackers are appropriate for you. Personally, I use an Emfit QS for the insane amount of data and analysis it gives you but there are a number of other products like Withings. There are also mattresses that come with the technology built-in.<p>I would never rely on a smartphone app or fitness band. They&#x27;re better than nothing so might be good if you happen to have one on-hand but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of your way to buy one for the purpose of tracking sleep."],"time":["2020-03-25 18:15:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Brakenshire"],"id":[22686482],"kids":{},"parent":[22685537],"text":["I don’t think there’s any indication that heart rate and movement monitoring can provide any robust insight into sleep cycles, and in my experience struggle to even understand sleep start and end points.

The problem is, lots of UI state isn&#x27;t handsome, core data like in this example. What about storing the width of a resizable panel? Or the state of a dropdown that can be open or closed? Do you create a dozen little flags in your store for these? Or do you put a flag on each domain object (todo list item, for example) that&#x27;s not actually relevant to your business logic (you don&#x27;t want dropdown state getting stored in your database)? Typically you&#x27;d make this a local flag internal to each component instance, but what happens when something else in your UI cares about it and has to respond to it? And any of these answers will bind it to your UI concerns, in all different ways. In fact, this state is <i>directly<\/i> UI-pertinent.

Often, very uncomfortable ones. It is my opinion that the most intrinsically hard thing about building and maintaining UIs is managing state. Unlike most software where &quot;state&quot; is really just either data or an implementation detail along the way to producing output, UIs have real, irregular, messy state baked into their bones.

Then most data is often available with a single hash lookup. Though this makes updates difficult and mistakes can and often do lead to inconsistent data.<p>A normalized data-structure which use ids to refer to related elements makes it easy to add, update, and delete entities; but reads might require multiple joins which in turn makes the code complex.<p>We can choose between the two by listing out the possible operations and deciding which cases are more frequent.

I will not link to Yaron Minsky and Richard Feldman&#x27;s excellent talks on this here. This principle often results in elegant data structures that would&#x27;ve eluded me otherwise.<p>The second addition that is necessary is to use a statically typed language. Elm, Reason, and PureScript are the only choices in front-end at the moment because of soundness, sum&#x2F;union types, and exhaustive pattern matching.

In pure js, when you want project.tasks, you just:<p><pre><code>  class Project {\n    get tasks() {\n      return db.tasks.filter(x =&gt; x.project_id == this.id &amp;&amp; !x.deleted)\n    }\n  }\n\n  class Task {\n    get project() {\n      return db.projects.find(x =&gt; x.id == this.project_id)\n    }\n    del() {this.deleted=true}\n  }\n\n  db.tasks = [].map(Task)\n  db.projects = [].map(Project)\n\n  ... in a view:\n  h(button, {bind:[cr, &#x27;add_task&#x27;]}, &#x27;+&#x27;)\n  cr.project.tasks.map(task =&gt;\n    ...\n    h(check, {bind:[task, &#x27;done&#x27;]})\n    h(button, {bind:[task, &#x27;del&#x27;]}, &#x27;x&#x27;)\n\n  ... in a controller:\n  add_task(project) {\n    db.tasks.push(new Task({project}))\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn “immutable functional state transformer based on async-dispatched store”, which these re-whatever buzzwords are, you cannot have neither smart data items, nor a good controller that could join unrelated objects together, nor recombinable data sources, nor nice testable api boundaries. And when someone whispers MVC, you think about web 1.0 patterns, with it’s “MC in MVC is backend roundtrip” meaning.<p>This particular example is a set of five dead-simple classes (DB, Project, Task, TaskListController and TaskListView), almost all orthogonal and useful&#x2F;testable on their own. Easy for imperative thinking and managing^, cause UI is suddenly imperative. You constantly <i>battle<\/i> with immutability, lack of control, state copy-transfer and tons of boilerplate for a simple action, can’t you see? You’re doing a monad bind operation by hand, because there is no do-notation in your language, and where there is, it exists and is called “do” for a reason. How did they miss that completely? &#x2F;rant<p>^ e.g. want to see deleted tasks? Write a getter in a controller or a db (depending on locality requirements) and use it in a view as if it was a pojo array.

We are very lucky that such work has been preserved for the benefit of future generations.<p>Design is a deeply collaborative process, with each designer standing on the shoulder of giants. Great design needs to be studied and preserved so that it is accessible in the long-run. So far that has been easy to do. The designs have been on paper, and can be viewed in physical products. But now, with the advent of design tools made entirely for the web, I am worried that many great works will slip through the cracks of history.<p>In the future, we&#x27;ll no longer be able to benefit from hindsight. The groundbreaking designs whose impact doesn&#x27;t become obvious or important until decades into the future might evaporate with time, with little to show for it. After all, will Figma keep all designs, permanently in their archives, even when companies go bust and stop paying their bills? No matter how influential or interesting their design was? Will we be able to do autopsies of work from this era when Figma&#x27;s servers are down?<p>Data ownership doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option in Figma&#x27;s paradigm. You do not have a copy of the tool, you only execute a part of it. You do not possess the data, they store it for you. Should there be an event where Figma is acquired or goes out of business, then (in all likelihood) every user of this platform will lack the ability and the choice to preserve their work for future generations (and for their business).<p>What are the odds of Figma staying as it is, in the control of founders, chugging along as a profitable business a year from now? 5 year from now? A decade? Two decades?<p>This timeline may seem to be long, but the average startup takes 7 years to IPO. Consequently, if you choose Figma as your tool of choice now, then it will be a marriage that lasts a decade or more.<p>I prefer Sketch and other tools because they store files natively. I know who is in control of my data. And, if need be, I can archive these files and the latest version of the program so that they can be spun up in the future, decades from now, for future generations to view.<p>Or, in the business context, there is data portability and ownership, when you control your data, you can control how it is inherited by future iterations of your product teams."],"time":["2020-03-25 18:17:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["phaedryx"],"id":[22684694],"kids":[22687132,22685499],"parent":[22682479],"text":["Interesting.

(collectively “Telegram”) from engaging in a plan to distribute “Grams,” a new cryptocurrency, in what it considers to be an unregistered offering of securities.  In early 2018, Telegram received $1.7 billion from 175 sophisticated entities and high net-worth individuals in exchange for a promise to deliver 2.9 billion Grams.  Telegram contends that the agreements to sell the 2.9 billion Grams are lawful private placements of securities covered by an exemption from the registration requirement. In Telegram’s view, only the agreements with the individual purchasers are securities. Currently, the Grams will not be delivered to these purchasers until the launch of Telegram’s new blockchain, the Telegram Open Network (“TON”)Blockchain.  Telegram views the anticipated resales of Grams by the 175 purchasers into a secondary public market via the TON Blockchain as wholly-unrelated transactions and argues they would not be the offering of securities. The SEC sees things differently.  The 175 initial purchasers are, in its view, “underwriters” who, unless Telegram is enjoined from providing them Grams, will soon engage in a distribution of Grams in the public market, whose participants would have been deprived of the information that a registration statement would reveal.<\/i><p>Telegram tried to split a security offering into two parts, neither of which, by itself, had all the components of a security offering. This did not fool anybody.<p>It&#x27;s also a crap deal for buyers. If Telegram did an ordinary IPO, you&#x27;d get stock, a share in the profits of the company, and voting rights. &quot;Grams&quot; give you none of those things.<p>Attempts to frame a securities offering as something else are not new. The original <i>Howey<\/i> case, which defined the law in this area, involved a sale and lease back arrangement of Florida orange groves, with the rights to harvest the oranges being tradeable. Others have tried to pull this stunt with warehouse receipts, chinchillas, minks, diamonds, bullion, pay phones, and condos.

The authors naively multiply the infection rate among evacuees by the population of Wuhan to conclude that Wuhan must have had 178,000 infections at the end of January. By comparison, epidemiological models have estimated there were around ~20,000 infections at that time [1][2][3]. What conclusion should we draw here? If you use sloppy, back of the napkin math to over-inflate the infection count by 10x then you can correspondingly deflate the mortality rate?<p>2) Speculating about the mortality rate of Covid-19 based on several gigantic assumptions (&quot;If our surmise of six million cases is accurate, that’s a mortality rate of 0.01%&quot;) seems borderline irresponsible. Numerous researchers have been modeling this virus and have generally arrived at numbers in the range of 0.5% to 1.6% [4][5][6][7][8][9]. The authors don&#x27;t present any compelling reason why we should doubt those numbers.<p>3) Ultimately the mortality rate is not as important a number as the hospitalization rate. The authors would have you believe this virus is no worse than the flu, but this is not congruent with the number of reports coming out of places like Italy and New York saying they&#x27;re about to run out of ICU beds, or China rushing to build temporary hospitals to house all of the patients that need critical care. What the mortality rate might be under ideal circumstances where every patient receives adequate medical care might be significantly different compared to a scenario where you&#x27;ve run out of ICU beds and have to start rationing ventilators.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2077-0383&#x2F;9&#x2F;2&#x2F;419&#x2F;htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2077-0383&#x2F;9&#x2F;2&#x2F;419&#x2F;htm<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.01.23.20018549v2.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.01.23.20018549v...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2077-0383&#x2F;9&#x2F;2&#x2F;523&#x2F;htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2077-0383&#x2F;9&#x2F;2&#x2F;523&#x2F;htm<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperial.ac.uk&#x2F;media&#x2F;imperial-college&#x2F;medicine&#x2F;sph&#x2F;ide&#x2F;gida-fellowships&#x2F;Imperial-College-COVID19-severity-10-02-2020.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperial.ac.uk&#x2F;media&#x2F;imperial-college&#x2F;medicine&#x2F;s...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io&#x2F;nCoV-public&#x2F;analyses&#x2F;first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment&#x2F;2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io&#x2F;nCoV-public&#x2F;an...<\/a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmmid.github.io&#x2F;topics&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;severity&#x2F;diamond_cruise_cfr_estimates.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmmid.github.io&#x2F;topics&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;severity&#x2F;diamond_crui...<\/a><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.04.20031104v1.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.04.20031104v...<\/a><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.09.20033357v1.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.09.20033357v...<\/a><p>[9] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-020-0822-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-020-0822-7<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-25 13:44:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ekidd"],"id":[22683566],"kids":[22688903,22683972,22689000,22690087,22689026,22696787],"parent":[22683324],"text":["They have a good point about missing data, but they&#x27;re glossing over the fact the fatality rate goes up drastically if the medical system fails.<p>I 100% agree that we should be running antibody tests to see how many people have caught COVID-19 and recovered.

However, it is very possible that the vast majority of Covid-19 cases never become patients.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that the quarantine is pointless.

It is a subtle but serious error for folks in set B to believe they can understand models by set C e.g. John Katz of Yale who is a doctor focusing on diets and wrote a woefully misguided article in the NY Times.<p>Roughly, I find the confounding factors about models about the current epidemic seem to the following:<p>1- 1% of the population severely affected etc. (see: Diamond Princess). What they fail to appreciate is that the Diamond Princess was an enclosed environment and the outbreak was controlled and <i>limited<\/i> to the population on board. In the general population, a virus with an R0 of 3 will infect 50,000+ people in 10 infection steps.<p>2- What most people miss is the collision of the 1% severity with the capacity of the medical system. This second-order effect is something hard to understand. 1% of the US is 3.6 million. Even if 10% of those cases turn up at the ER in the same year and occupy the beds for 2 weeks each it will be a disaster.<p>3- #1 and #2 interacts with life as usual demands on the health care system – accidents, heart attacks, strokes, etc. to create third order effects – more deaths as there are no beds and no personnel to deal with them.<p>4- PPE running short and causing infections amongst medical personnel leading to their quarantine, hospitalization or death (Wuhan, Italy, Spain) decimates their ranks and accentuates the stress on the health care system……. 20% of lost capacity translates to some fraction more deaths and more stress on the rest of the medical population.<p>I am sure there are factors I have missed.<p>We have seen many contrarian viewpoints. None of these contrarian thinkers make any concrete suggestions (Ionnadis, Katz, Friedman, Gillespie, Hanson) except making ominous predictions to how wrong we are and we need more data. Meanwhile ER doctors say this is the worst they have ever seen and bodies keep piling up. These contrarian thinkers provide no simulations of how saving the economy will lead to lesser deaths. Just hand waving and finger jabbing.<p>The contrarians seem to think that the playbook to deal with the epidemic has been improvised. Or that this is something modelers are thinking up on the fly. These playbooks have existed for decades with very good understanding of the dynamics and were used during SARs, Ebola and heck even back during the Spanish Flu. What seems to be lacking was parameters specific to Covid-19. Its R0, CFR, co-morbidities, etc.<p>The reason Taiwan, Korea and Singapore were able to act so decisively and fast was that they just dusted of the SARs playbook and knew almost exactly what to do. Taiwan enforced the first measures in early Jan.<p>I will take the word of the viral epidemiologists over the contrarian&#x27;s armchair speculations and continue to overreact.

But over the last four years basically we&#x27;ve seen a rapid deterioration of trust in the international system. The country which was the leader previously, both in the 2008 financial crisis and also in the last big epidemic, the Ebola epidemic in 2014 — and that country is the United States — now it is not taking any kind of leadership position. Actually since 2016, the current administration has made it very clear that the US has resigned its role as world leader, it made it very clear that the US has no longer any friends in the world, it has only interests. And even if now, the US — which is not doing so far — but even if it will try to assume a leadership position, nobody would follow a leader who&#x27;s motto is “Me first.” ¶ So what really frightens me is the lack of leadership and cooperation, and what people should realize, is that the spread of the epidemic in any one country threatens the entire world because of the danger that if we don&#x27;t contain this in time, the virus will evolve — that is maybe one of the worse problems with this kind of epidemic — is actually a rapid evolution of the virus. We saw it before with the 2014 Ebola epidemic. It actually started, the Ebola epidemic started, with one genetic mutation in one virus in one person in West Africa, which turned Ebola from a relatively rare disease into a raging epidemic, because this single mutation increased the contagiousness of the virus four times. ¶ Now this could be happening right now, somewhere in Iran, or in Italy, or in anywhere else, and wherever it happens, it endangers the entire world. ¶ Humanity needs to close ranks against the viruses.<p>Yuval Harari then goes on to describe the second thing that scares him the most: The rise of authoritarianism through governments taking advantage of peoples’ fear about the virus.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EwusbaOFr2Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EwusbaOFr2Y<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-25 18:43:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Scoundreller"],"id":[22689173],"kids":{},"parent":[22684414],"text":["Jokes on them.<p>Rogers struggles to make&#x2F;receive phone calls during peak hours for the past week."],"time":["2020-03-25 23:45:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xenospn"],"id":[22689660],"kids":{},"parent":[22684414],"text":["As does Israel, as does Norway."],"time":["2020-03-26 01:00:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GoatThompson"],"id":[22688944],"kids":[22688977,22689104,22689023,22689500,22689345],"parent":[22688564],"text":["Hey, this happened to me today at 9:30AM.
