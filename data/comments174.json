Consultants won&#x27;t mind additional free leads, but good ones will do just fine without. So, the unit economics just don&#x27;t work out as well for savvy founders or consultants, so you end up creating a market for lemons.<p>The problem with this model is that consultants will want to be paid in liquid cash, companies will want to pay in illiquid equity, and someone would have to step into the middle and establish valuations and liquidity. This is the bigger problem with the increasing illiquidity associated with VC funded startups. Savvier would-be employees or consultants risk adjusting shares even further towards the direction of worthlessness and insisting on cash.<p>With that said, perhaps the main silver lining I see here is of VCs playing a role in creating some kind of liquidity for shares.

Almost everyone is engaging in not-so-best practices with password storage if they are using any 3rd party vendors. Only the institutions with the resources to rebuild in-house systems with modern security standards are the exception to this rule. There are only a handful of these. Ultimately, it&#x27;s not some malicious intent or incompetence, but simply the acknowledgement that the legacy systems will not enjoy PBKDF hash+salt+iterations columns being added 30 years after the fact.<p>The risk analysis and mitigation discussion for these institutions goes something like this:<p>1) We cant have good password storage so we will require a 2nd factor and attempt to ensure these systems reside in our most secure network.<p>2) There is nothing we can do, so we will simply rely on the fact that if someone logs into an account illegally, we send in the men with guns.

How much ripping would HN impose on one of these institutions if they attempted a 100% best practices secure password upgrade and then subsequently had a complete IT disaster unfold (I can certainly link articles). For many banks and other financial institutions, going down for even 1 hour is a complete catastrophe. If people can&#x27;t get their money out right away, they are leaving for the competition and you will likely get dinged by regulators. Bad people will continue to do bad things until the end of time. Killing your business to handle every edge case, even if it seems obvious, is not a good path to go down.<p>I would also consider this: These banks&#x27; IT systems are storing things that many of us would argue are much more valuable than your passwords. A bank&#x27;s core system also represents the actual monetary value of every customer&#x27;s account.

Super interesting. Congratulations.<p>How do I manage my API integrations, you ask?<p>Global Accelerator (GLA) is a key infrastructure piece for a HA service I&#x27;m building but for the data-plane. It is such a hassle-free but slightly expensive way to vend anycast IPs (no need to purchase ASNs and&#x2F;or announce routes from colos across the globe) and have the traffic load-balanced to 25+ AWS regions, that I recommend it instantly to anyone architecting HA services. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io<\/a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpath.com&#x2F;edge-computing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpath.com&#x2F;edge-computing<\/a> are viable alternatives. Cloudflare announced MagicTransit which isn&#x27;t as smooth as AWS GLA in terms of developer experience, whilst Azure and Google offer global-load-balancers, too, and may be even before AWS announced it in 2018? So, really, I think utilizing GLA is something folks should do if they run global HA services. The only issue with using NLB behind AWS GLA is the client-IP is not preserved. In our case, we needed it, so we had to get creative with sticky routing and port assignment (listeners) to do load-balancing &#x2F; traffic-shaping.<p>Another HA trick I plan to employ is to use Cloudflare-Workers (200+ PoPs) to front https-traffic to our control-plane endpoints. It lacks observability, monitoring, and alerting unless you&#x27;re on Cloudflare&#x27;s enterprise plans. The rate-limiting option is expensive ($0.05 per 10k good requests). I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no way to queue requests out-of-the-box, so I can very much see a need for what you&#x27;ve built, and where you guys fit in.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;d be surprised if firebase or API Gateway or KongHQ don&#x27;t already do what you do, as well.

The number of lines of code in a given binary is much less than 1.4 million, which is the total for all the architectures that QEMU supports (actually it&#x27;s closer to 2 million). It is also possible to configure out a lot of the code and libraries. A default build is around 6-700.000 lines of code, and it is possible to build reduced versions that tally less than 300.000 lines just by tweaking a configuration file with the list of included devices (which was done for the experiments in the paper). The NEMU project mentioned in the paper is inactive exactly because it was a dead end: it was possible to achieve all their goals directly in QEMU without the need for a fork.<p>Likewise, the number of syscalls in QEMU (270) is quoted from another paper but likely refers not to QEMU used as a VMM, but rather to the so called &quot;user-mode emulation&quot; that runs foreign Linux binaries (and which, by its very nature, invokes pretty much all Linux syscalls including quite a few obsolete ones).<p>It would be interesting to have more information on the configuration they use for QEMU, especially whether they are enabling PCI and ACPI. Version 4.2 of QEMU (the version they used) has a trimmed virtual machine type that was admittedly inspired by Firecracker and actually boots even faster than Firecracker, or at least in the noise. [1] The code specific to this machine type is only 500 lines. Also since that release QEMU and qboot _are_ actually able to boot uncompressed kernels using the PVH entry point, contrarily to what the paper states. This could explain the difference in boot time performance.<p>Memory consumption is tricky, QEMU uses green threads and has to allocate stacks for them. This can show up as large mmaps but they do not correspond to actual memory usage. But again without redoing the experiments it&#x27;s hard to say if that is the cause. I have no doubt Firecracker is leaner in this respect, anyway, and it&#x27;s an important metric for Amazon.<p>That said, I am all for competition, and some of the measurements in the paper are certainly worth a look to see if there is more low hanging fruit to pick, especially with respect to memory consumption. QEMU is a complex program, as demonstrated by the complexity of measuring it accurately, and Firecracker is a very interesting project. I am very happy to collaborate with the authors of the paper on rust-vmm.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.redhat.com&#x2F;pbonzini&#x2F;microvm&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.redhat.com&#x2F;pbonzini&#x2F;microvm&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-18 23:19:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["srmatto"],"id":[22359417],"kids":[22361299],"parent":[22358252],"text":["I&#x27;m really excited to see where this goes in the community.

We had meetings about it.<p>At the time, I and pretty much all of my peers thought the internal reaction was kind of absurd.  WalMart was, in the late 1990s, ascendant in many ways, and Amazon was just some &#x27;west coast dot com selling CDs and books in the mail&#x27;.<p>Funny story: in 1997, we were deploying routers to over 2000 WalMart stores worldwide, and they were made by a company called &quot;Advanced Computer Communications&quot;.  We didn&#x27;t switch over to Cisco routers for a couple of years, because the ACC routers properly supported SNA protocol encapsulation and Cisco didn&#x27;t.  Anyway, the name of the ACC routers we were buying was &#x27;Amazon&#x27;, which, I was told later, momentarily caused some panic and confusion in senior leadership."],"time":["2020-02-18 16:51:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["whyenot"],"id":[22353975],"kids":[22354258],"parent":[22352654],"text":["I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this.

These days 2-way data binding is widely acknowledged as a poor design as it makes it hard to keep track of how data is flowing through your application. For more on that see [1].<p>React was originally introduced as the &quot;V in MVC&quot; [2]. Since then it drifted away from MVC in an ad-hoc manner. In part this is because of ReactRouter, which made router a view component (!), and in part this is because of Flux&#x2F;Redux. The facebook engineer who came up with Flux famously declared that MVC doesn&#x27;t scale (!!). This assertion was widely challenged, and later she acknowledged that it is bidirectional data flow that doesn&#x27;t scale [3]. She had assumed that MVC automatically implies 2-way data binding. Redux, an implementation of the Flux architecture then became popular, and became closely associated to React, so much so that many developers believe using React implies using Redux. This is unfortunate because Redux requires tons of boilerplate (&quot;so much throat clearing&quot;, as one developer put it), which MVC does not require.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;131&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;131&#x2F;<\/a> (starting around 0:43)<p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;react&#x2F;tree&#x2F;015833e5942ce55cf31aefd0a5c2be8a65ec2daa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;react&#x2F;tree&#x2F;015833e5942ce55cf31ae...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;facebook-mvc-flux&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;facebook-mvc-flux&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-18 19:56:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bilekas"],"id":[22357681],"kids":{},"parent":[22357456],"text":["Maybe at 2012 to the title..

The one primary issue I have with event driven systems is that it is very difficult to look at code and intuitively know what&#x27;s going on.<p>If you&#x27;re having to search your entire code base to see what happens when a user logs in, and then what happens if that user is marked as &quot;blocked&quot;, it can get very complicated quickly.<p>Even worse, trying to backtrack events can be more complicated. What caused the &quot;add to cart&quot; event that added this special product type that is actually a digital download, but that wasn&#x27;t a UI event? It could have happened in one of 10 places, debugging is difficult because you have to start somewhere in the middle and work your way backwards.<p>This is the issue I&#x27;ve had with wordpress development, actions and filters can make intuitively understanding what&#x27;s going on under the hood very very difficult. Of course they give a lot of flexibility with plugins, extension points, etc, but when multiple plugins are interacting it can get very confusing.<p>Compare that with a more imperative controller where you branch based on conditions and you can generally follow the logic flow. Of course, there are ways to make that complex too like Form classes, validation, ORMs, etc. But I still find the more imperative paradigm of MVC easier to follow, such as in a Django case.<p>Where I say this can get interesting is in a use case like React. In a way, events are propagated through a tree and can be kicked off by data changes, such as in redux. If you design it right, there might be more promise in an event-based system, but introducing both server side and client side tends to complicate things."],"time":["2020-02-19 05:23:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arbuge"],"id":[22358093],"kids":[22358959],"parent":[22357456],"text":["&gt; MVC is a phenomenal idea.

There is significant overlap between the people involved and BAASS even has an odd habit of bringing up Skinwalker Ranch repeatedly despite a lack of a clear connection.<p>This is significant when you look at the history of NIDSci&#x27;s investigation of Skinwalker Ranch, which was a fairly high profile and well-funded investigation run by essentially all the same people which, after years, produced some popular media but few or no actual results.<p>To a cynical eye, it looks very much like Bigelow ran out of funding for his ongoing Skinwalker Ranch work (thus the undiscussed decline in actual NIDSci activity at the site despite it supposedly being an active project) and then, through some combination of wheeling and dealing and good fortune, connected with Sen. Reid to obtain a significant source of new funding to do similar work. Despite this funding being directed at UFOs generally and not Skinwalker Ranch specifically, BAASS still shows a desire to funnel that money towards Skinwalker Ranch.<p>So, is this a case of the US Gov&#x27;t working towards disclosure, or a case of Bigelow finding a new source of funding for his ongoing hobby project at Skinwalker Ranch, and the DoD and the taxpayer being taken along for the ride? The involvement of DeLonge is an interesting twist not present for the Skinwalker Ranch saga, but unsurprising considering DeLonge&#x27;s longstanding interest in UFOs and apparent similarity to Bigelow (wealthy, eccentric, and interested in paranormal phenomena). DeLonge, as well as Bigelow, seems fully prepared to play the whole matter for personal benefit through TTSA.<p>I do not question that there are interesting phenomena under the heading of UAP and that that Nimitz incident might be one of the most compelling pieces of open evidence. However, given the history of Bigelow and and almost everyone else heavily involved in BAASS, I have a very hard time beliving that the AATIP is going to take us in the direction of better understanding.<p>I feel that it takes very little background in federal contracting, especially in the intelligence space, to fully believe that the DoD has invested tens of millions of dollars into a total flight of fancy. This has happened many times and will happen many more. Confusion and opacity in discussing the matter is completely unsurprising as a result of both the complicated confidentiality matters involved and the DoD&#x27;s inherent lack of interest in being clear that it has spent tens of millions on Bigelow&#x27;s hobby.<p>I sound very critical, and I am. But I think the important point is that a lot of the popular reporting on the issue, perhaps all of it, fails to discuss the possibility that &quot;there is no there there&quot; and that this is quite possibly just another story of DoD inefficacy with an unusual, Blink-182 twist."],"time":["2020-02-18 06:09:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Animats"],"id":[22353382],"kids":[22356645],"parent":[22349363],"text":["Why don&#x27;t we have more cell phone videos of this stuff?\nPreferably from multiple cell phones from different angles.<p>As for &quot;lights in the sky&quot;, see [1].

Since the BJP&#x27;s pedigree was one of Hindu nationalism (aka Hindutva), this was a change welcomed by many. He had a good track record of development as Chief Minister (equivalent of Governor in America).<p>- After a couple of major missteps (invalidating all high value currency notes, tax changes), growth started to slow. While it had been 7-9% between 2004 and 2014, it was now 5% or less.<p>- The BJP started to capture and subvert institutions that make India function as a democracy including the Courts[1] and the Election Commission[2]. They intimidated and coerced the media into toeing the BJP line [3].<p>- In 2019, the BJP won re-election. In this campaign, there was no talk of development (because there was precious little of it), no discussion of rampant unemployment. The BJP tried to convince us that the main issue was Pakistan (it wasn&#x27;t) and how they were an existential threat to the nation (they weren&#x27;t) and how Modi had &quot;taught them a lesson&quot; (he hadn&#x27;t).<p>- Since then, Hindutva has made a big comeback. It is now priority #1, above unemployment, above low growth.<p>- The BJP is staking everything on killing the separatist movement in Kashmir and removing all special privileges of Kashmiris, building a temple over a destroyed mosque, and removing illegal Muslim immigrants. Though seemingly disparate, all of these facilitate the broader goal of establishing a Hindu Rashtra - a nation of Hindus, by Hindus, for Hindus. One where the secular Constitution of India is no longer valid.<p>- To enforce this, the BJP has resorted to totalitarian tactics, including the effective house arrest of millions of Kashmiris, coupled with an internet blackout. Thanks to the aforementioned capture of the Courts, the Supreme Court has done nothing to right this injustice [4].<p>That&#x27;s where we are now.<p>On a personal note, writing this down broke my heart. I love my country and I grieve to see what is being done to it.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraphindia.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;judging-the-judges&#x2F;cid&#x2F;1438565\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraphindia.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;judging-the-judges&#x2F;ci...<\/a><p>[2] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;cover-story&#x2F;article29618205.ece\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;cover-story&#x2F;article29618205.e...<\/a><p>[3] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewire.in&#x2F;media&#x2F;punya-prasun-bajpai-bjp-media\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewire.in&#x2F;media&#x2F;punya-prasun-bajpai-bjp-media<\/a><p>[4] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scroll.in&#x2F;article&#x2F;935432&#x2F;analysis-supreme-court-orders-in-kashmir-petitions-undermine-the-spirit-of-habeas-corpus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scroll.in&#x2F;article&#x2F;935432&#x2F;analysis-supreme-court-orde...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-19 00:53:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0xFFFE"],"id":[22361729],"kids":{},"parent":[22360559],"text":["These discussions quickly devolve into political mudslinging , I wish there was way to filter out such posts."],"time":["2020-02-19 00:57:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lousken"],"id":[22360902],"kids":{},"parent":[22360559],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Gf3Pg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Gf3Pg<\/a> if anyone blocks guce.advertising.com"],"time":["2020-02-18 23:08:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amriksohata"],"id":[22361656],"kids":{},"parent":[22360559],"text":["If Pakistan had just listened to the UN and actioned first step of the security councils resolution 47, we would not be in this position."],"time":["2020-02-19 00:48:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rabbitsfoot8"],"id":[22361135],"kids":{},"parent":[22360559],"text":["This is very sad to see.

Physical problems solvable by FEM are symmetric and linearly independent, or some tricks are done to make them so. They also end up being quite Sparse. Those Sparse solvers from LAPACK and BLAS, as well as all of the past optimizations that are probably made for dealing with cache size (I&#x27;m speculating here, I really don&#x27;t know), really make a huge difference in the problem.<p>Last I touched the Rust libraries to make a simple code, I just stuck with non-sparse solvers.

For three main reasons:<p>1) It kills muscle memory by changing the size and location of the buttons depending on the window size. And not just the size, but also their shape, appearance and place in dropdown hierarchies (i.e. top level versus behind a dropdown). So even after years of using MS Office with the ribbon I still hunt for commands.<p>2) It encourages multiple copies of the same command. So instead of learning the one place font-size (e.g.) shows up, you end up hunting every time through 3 or 4 tabs for the place you saw it last.<p>3) The UI features it was meant to replace was left in the program further increasing the number of areas you have to search through. Looking at Powerpoint as an example, it has the ribbon, formatting panes, traditional formatting dialogs, and the right click quick options menu. There are features available on all of them, but there are also options missing on some but not others. Sometimes I find myself hunting through 3 or 4 of these places for some obscure (e.g. table padding) option.<p>This opinion is based on using the ribbon in MS Office, which was the first and (I would hope, based on the team&#x27;s resources) best implementation. Maybe somebody uses the ribbon to its fullest.<p>I buy their pitch that they studied beginner users and those people had an easier time with the ribbon.

Just hit the Alt key once, and every top level category&#x27;s hotkey showed up as a hover.  Hit that key, and the commands on the ribbon (or next level dropdown) were displayed.  &quot;Paste Special&quot;, a very common action, became Alt+H+V+S.  And you didn&#x27;t have to do finger twisters like Ctrl+Alt+V (all held down together) to achieve it.<p>And again, almost EVERY command was available in this way.<p>Sure, you could create your own hotkeys in versions of Office before this, but the Ribbon brought almost every command within easy reach of those that hate removing their fingers from the keyboard.  It wasn&#x27;t quite VIM (no command mode), but it was a far sight better than anything than had existed before in Office, where most of the advanced UI had been buried away in difficult-to-automate AND navigate (either by keyboard or mouse) modal dialogs.<p>And by exposing most of the UI to the keyboard, it also enabled easier automation via utilities like AutoHotkey.<p>All-in-all, it was a power user&#x27;s dream, but I definitely see how it was harder for a mouse user to develop the muscle memory on the Ribbon vs an icon bar.  That, however, I believe is simply a matter of having nearly 100% of the UI be available via the Ribbon, vs. the 20% (or less) of icon bars.

I can write an app for an audience of one - me. Getting an app ready for an App Store easily adds 50% of development time.<p>A home-cooked app can have hard coded values (oh yeah!), doesn&#x27;t have to be pretty (although it&#x27;s more fun), doesn&#x27;t have to support all platforms (no, I won&#x27;t add Apple Watch support!), it just has to work for me.<p>My latest project: a little iOS app that I can use at a bookstore to scan the book&#x27;s barcode and then checks if that book is available at my local public library.<p>When I showed that to my SO she was amazed and said: &quot;And you just made THAT?&quot;. Well, yes. My secret superpower is that I can make these little computers that we all keep in our pockets these days make anything I want them to.<p>A few other projects that I made for myself over the years:<p>- App that generates PDF invoices from my App Store financial reports (I simply paste in the plain text from the website)<p>- A break timer app (old one was 32bit-only, I didn&#x27;t bother to download a new one)<p>- Text snippet app: it scans an email for the senders name and pre-populates possible answers. I turned this into a tiny CRM that keeps track of feature requests and whom I sent an update. This is actually in the App Store, but was a huge commercial failure, but I use this myself e v e r y day.<p>- Quick click: it&#x27;s like a command line for my Mac. I type something I see on the screen (e.g. the title of a button), the app highlights possible matches, I press Return and the app sends a simulated mouse click. I can also use this as a window manager to resize the active app, because, why not?<p>For personal use:<p>- Portfolio simulator app that calculates every possible IRR for a given number of years (once I was done I discovered portfoliocharts.com, well...)<p>- Portfolio tracker app to track my retirement savings: this is like a tiny spreadsheet app only that it&#x27;s fed by 3 csv files (orders.csv, transactions.csv, asses prices.csv). &quot;editing&quot; is done in VIM. The app generates various reports that I use to check if I&#x27;m on track with my savings.<p>- Simple stock checker app (fetches the prices of a, yes, hard-coded list of ticker symbols).<p>- App to categorize my spendings. Input is a csv file (I like plain text). I wanted to learn now Naive Bayes filtering works and have to say, seeing the app do its thing is as close to magic as I ever got.<p>- Time lapse screen recorder: creates a screenshot every x seconds. I used this once to record a video of how I&#x27;m developing an app.<p>- Custom implementation of Unshaky (with more stats and settings) to fix the double-space keypress issue of my new MacBook Air<p>- Alarm clock app that uses the accelerometer to wake me when I&#x27;m not in a deep sleep phase.<p>And a few more that I don&#x27;t use anymore..."],"time":["2020-02-17

If you are trying to learn a language without a goal, you&#x27;ll probably never graduate from tutorials. Imposing your own requirements&#x2F;boundaries, just makes the learning part more engrossing and you&#x27;ll make connections which you won&#x27;t otherwise. Iterating as fast as possible is worthwile itself.<p>If you want to grow as a programmer even more, try to convert that side project into a paid one. It definitely changes your view of the world. As programmers, we want to see elegance in code but real life is messy. We want to separate the world of programming from the human life and sometimes for good reason. You might find satisfaction in writing pure code (and that&#x27;s great) but there&#x27;s an opposite world too which will humble the strong opinions within you. Haggling about microservices vs monoliths seems trivial in the grand scheme of things (the customer doesn&#x27;t care!). I still debate about this with fellow devs but at the end of the day, I really don&#x27;t get stressed about it. For me, programming is pretty much only about building solutions to existing problems which improves my or others lives. Everything else is just an opinion which will not be considered until its time is due.<p>&gt; Lesson 2: Organizing my thoughts is important, but tricky to figure out<p>Agree. Especially difficult if the software doesn&#x27;t structure the knowledge in the same way as we think. As a dev, I have never been satisfied with any specific solution. But don&#x27;t fret honestly. It&#x27;s unlikely that any given piece of software will work for all your cases. Always take the context into consideration. Plenty of times I work on paper if what I&#x27;m thinking doesn&#x27;t go into a specific tool. Don&#x27;t try to fit yourself into a box when your mind itself can&#x27;t. That said, a mindmap (big picture) + a task manager (big picture broken down into specific tasks) + a note taking app (learnings + thoughts derived from completing specific tasks) covers most of my bases.

This way of doing things is based upon a combination user platform, quantity of developers on the market with a particular skill, and a need to pretend to be busy even when you don&#x27;t actually accomplish anything.  In most of my experience the platform was the web and the language of choice was Java (even though Java is not a web technology).<p>When you are working on side projects there are only two goals: don&#x27;t waste your own time and produce something of value.  Nothing else matters.  And so you learn to become very productive and extremely focused on what you ship to production, because you would rather be playing games or drinking a beer than pretending to be busy.<p>The corporate world doesn&#x27;t work like this.  Everybody is paid a salary exchange for 45 hours of your life each week and your assignments are generally governed by an agile sprint cycle, so there is absolutely no motivation to be productive.  Maybe if you work twice as hard your bonus will be 5-10% bigger.  Maybe if you deliver code that is perfect in that it never requires maintenance and never churns defects you can spend more time reading about foreign places on Wikipedia.<p>Frustration sets in after watching the corporate approach continuously releasing defective code into production because its important to hurry instead of write things down or write the code correctly the first time.  You could always suggest a better way of doing things, but since there is no motivation to do things better all you are really accomplishing is frustrating other people.<p>* At work don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel (if somebody&#x2F;something is capable of doing your job then let them do your job)<p>When you are working on side projects there is nobody there to do the heavy lifting for you.  You can figure it out or it simply isn&#x27;t important enough to get done.  It&#x27;s the same way with risks and product performance.  People who haven&#x27;t spent time on personal projects or with equity at a start up have no motivation to try harder.  That is why there are giant frameworks and a couple 1000 open source packages in your corporate application to solve simple common problems developers are unwilling to solve themselves.  Nobody working on a public personal project will build around something like the 1000 ton hammer of the gods that is Angular or Sprint MVC, but you will certainly find these in public facing enterprise applications where developers have no care about punishing their users in exchange for easy.<p>* You are more productive not doing work<p>A tremendous part of writing software is the cognitive thinking that occurs away from the keyboard.  This could be planning, brainstorming a new feature, reflecting on a past feature, or putting things together in a new way to envision defects or refactoring opportunities.  That said, its more valuable to work really hard to accomplish a feature or solve for a defect and then back off from the computer.  You haven&#x27;t stopped thinking about the application, but now you are thinking about the experience or new ways of doing things that you would never think about purely looking at the code.  In the corporate world you are extremely lucky to find documentation much less anything like planning or feature engagement from the developers."],"time":["2020-02-17 05:57:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chapliboy"],"id":[22346659],"kids":[22346903,22348312,22348991,22346986,22346737],"parent":[22344771],"text":["I am stuck in the same loop of trying to find the best way to organise my thoughts.
