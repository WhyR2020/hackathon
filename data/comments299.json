Tell different reporters different locations to pick up the drives.  Do not tell any single news agency more than one location in the event they are compromised.  Ensure you are not seen hiding them.  Thumb USB drives are very cheap and disposable.<p>To stay connected to each other, set up your own self hosted email servers.  Email is old but is well designed for this.  It is also easier to set up than IRC and does not depend on real time communication.   Mail servers will queue messages and retry periodically.  Look for &quot;HOW-TO: Dovecot Postfix&quot;.   Set up self hosted mail servers inside your country and configure them to relay to external sites using HAM, Satellite, whatever you can get your hands on.  Even better, see if you can find obscure forms of internet that have not been blocked.  Dial-up for example. It isn&#x27;t fast, but will relay emails and small attachments just fine.  Mail servers will queue messages and retry periodically.  Adjust attachment limits on your email servers and let your friends know what that limit is.  Use your own domains.  Ensure that you configure your mail servers to enforce TLS, or at least enforce it for domains that you know use TLS.  Most important, increase the retention time of the mail spool so that the server will keep trying to send messages for a month instead of a week.  Get multiple accounts on mail servers hosted in other countries that your mail server can authenticated and relay through.  This eliminates the need for things like FCrDNS, DMARC, etc... on your server.  A dial-up will do just fine.  Read up on how to use postfix header checks to sanitized email headers so that your users IP addresses are not exposed.<p>One advantage of self hosted email servers is that anyone inside your country that can reach the server can communicate directly to each other through that server.  Nothing has to leave the country and can not be censored.  Be sure to encrypt the mail and spool folders.<p>For trusted circles of friends, especially those responsible for maintaining servers, ensure they create and share PGP keys.  There are how-to&#x27;s for this as well.

There are so many things wrong with it.<p>- Hyperloop is a vactrain, a century old idea, and to this day, despite numerous attempts, nothing came close to a working prototype, let alone something production-ready.<p>- By contrast, high-speed trains carries millions of passengers every day in many parts of the world. They are safe, comfortable, and commercially viable. And for hyperloop-like distances (500-1000km), you can expect a 3h trip. It is not 40 minutes, but considering that high speed trains typically go downtown to downtown and usually don&#x27;t require you to show up more than a few minutes in advance, it is often the fastest way to go in practice. Hyperloop doesn&#x27;t bring much to the table compared to high speed trains.<p>- The individual pods are tiny compared to a train. And because of the high speeds involved, they certainly require a lot of spacing to stay safe, it means low capacities.<p>- There is a long list of technical challenges, most of them require engineering feats that have never been done on a large scale. It is an Apollo-scale experimental project presented as a commercial venture.<p>- Progress so far has been laughable, none of the hard problems have been solved. What about thermal expansion, the ability to maintain a vacuum while allowing people in and out, safety systems, the civil engineering required... The experimental pods are scaled down with no space for passengers. They can go fast, which is nice, but at 460 km&#x2F;h they are still below conventional full scale high-speed train records.<p>Not really a technical challenge but it still ticks me off:<p>- Hyperloop is championed by Elon Musk, but he actually has very little involvement in it. He owns none of the hyperloop companies, it is all &quot;open-source&quot;, &quot;community&quot;, etc.. Basically, besides being a sponsor for &quot;competitions&quot;, it is all talk.<p>I know that Elon Musk is far from stupid, he is a world-class businessman and a competent engineer. I can&#x27;t believe he really sees Hyperloop as something viable.<p>So for me it just a daring publicity stunt (a borderline scam IMHO), something that Elon Musk is also known to be good at. After all, the story says that SpaceX started as a publicity stunt. He wanted to buy a Russian ICBM, repurposed to plant something on Mars. It didn&#x27;t work, and the fact that he couldn&#x27;t do it gave him the idea that he could be a market for a rocket company.<p>If you look at Hyperloop, it is essentially a battery powered electric car running inside a tunnel. And guess what, he makes battery powered electric cars, and now tunnels. I have a few doubts about Boring, but at least, it is concrete, and there is always a need for tunnels, even if it is just to dig sewer pipes."],"time":["2020-08-13 00:56:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["floppiplopp"],"id":[24146307],"kids":{},"parent":[24137127],"text":["A car salesman who talks the public into investing huge budgets into a mass transportation system that will never efficiently work and is basically a huge was of taxpayer money?

Meaning, one year I noticed them on strike every other week to protest some intended government plan, even though the company had nothing to do with that, plus they only went on strike during the night.<p>&gt; Initially, Swedish and Nordic clients will be mainly served from German warehouses — known as fulfillment centers in Amazon-speak — with trucks driving up to Sweden through Denmark, and a fulfillment center operated by local partner Kuehne + Nagel in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, near Stockholm.<p>So partly they question if they&#x27;ll operate a warehouse, but at the same time, there&#x27;s going to be a warehouses. Only difference is that someone else does the logistics for them.<p>What usually happens with different standards of living is that the companies raise their prices a bit. Not sure why the article does not go into that.<p>EU is planning some changes in the trucking cabotage laws, see e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;en&#x2F;headlines&#x2F;society&#x2F;20200630STO82385&#x2F;better-working-conditions-for-truck-drivers-across-the-eu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;en&#x2F;headlines&#x2F;society&#x2F;202...<\/a>. This might (according to articles) make it more difficult to only use truckers from certain countries (e.g. whomever has the lowest standard of living &#x2F; wage). Might also benefit the environment by ensuring companies might reduce the amount of trucking."],"time":["2020-08-12 10:12:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cs702"],"id":[24134101],"kids":[24134820],"parent":[24131290],"text":["From the folks at Magic Leap.

When you&#x27;re making your way in the industry, it&#x27;s really easy to notice the in-demand skills&#x2F;technologies that you don&#x27;t have, and to add them to your toolkit one at a time. It&#x27;s a nice, linear progression. Then, you reach a point where that approach doesn&#x27;t work anymore. If you&#x27;re a 10+ year developer who knows React and Vue and is strong with vanilla JS, adding Angular to your toolbox won&#x27;t raise your salary or your skills—you could probably pick it up on the fly if you really needed to.<p>I think at this point, you need a paradigm shift away from &quot;what is the market pulling me to do&quot; and &quot;what do I want to do.&quot; It sounds like you want to stay an IC, so that means it&#x27;s going probably going to be purely technical—so what technology do you find interesting?<p>For me it was machine learning, and then hardware-level stuff. That&#x27;s what lead me to take university classes and study higher math&#x2F;more fundamental CS. There wasn&#x27;t an obvious pull in that direction from the market—none of my bosses offered me a raise if I became an ML engineer—but I liked it, and because I had years of experience already, becoming proficient in the field opened up an entire new world of opportunities in terms of career and personal life. I wasn&#x27;t a new grad who studied ML. I was a career developer who&#x27;d built businesses, who now had a background in ML. \nYou could apply this same logic to any new field you study, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be technical. If you got really into design, you&#x27;d be a designer with 10 years of development experience. If you got really into sales, a salesperson with 10 years of dev experience is a hot prospect at any company that sells to engineers (in other words, some of the most valuable companies on Earth).<p>If you want to stay in web development and level up there, I&#x27;d recommend following the advice of many on this post. Pick a part of the stack you find interesting, and dig a thousand layers down.

I&#x27;m not going to say the &#x27;same&#x27; result because many calculations are stochastic in nature (e.g. random numbers) or because often the data changes.  (Let&#x27;s say I have somebody make a notebook that does April&#x27;s sales reports -- shouldn&#x27;t I just be able to point it to the may data to make May&#x27;s sales reports?)<p>Between the long time delays (longer than people can hold a context in their mind,  longer than they want to wait) for the system to settle down and the total complexity I find that many people involved with data science violently resist confronting the above issues.

The trouble with is that investment in particular technologies are of temporary value (maybe people will still be using R in 2030,  maybe they won&#x27;t be using Tensorflow,  almost certainly plotly gets bought by Google and shut down by then)<p>Years back I researched the problem of running Tensorflow models that we got off the pavement,  building a database that says TF version X depends on CUDA version Y, CNN version Z,  and being able to have multiple copies of the userspace GPU drivers installed simultaneously (e.g. just put &#x27;em in a directory and set the library path to point at &#x27;em -- don&#x27;t even need containers!)<p>I could have sworn Google looked at my source because they did the one thing that could have broke that strategy.

The first trip was booked for a month, but we got sick of ants, mice and lack of action after about a week and left early.

While Airbnb corrected the issues by letting us get out early, this was incredibly disruptive to our plans and not representative of what was promised.<p>The worst part came later, after our mutual reviews for that second place became public. My review and scores got removed with no notice, so that host continues to advertise as Superhost with Enhanced Clean and decent enough, if few, reviews.

Couple points in their favour:<p>1. Work from home becomes work from anywhere: The WFH trend is here to stay and will grow. If you have an option why not stay anywhere in world and work vs. close by home? I expect we will see a big % of WFH markets be global travelers. Proving this thesis would be Airbnb can show on S1 the % of guest who book outside their home location and for stays more then 2 weeks (to account that it is not simply vacation time).<p>2. Stays gravitating to Tier 2 or lower vs. Tier 1: People will not want to fly or be close to other folks so you will see travel go to Tier 2 or lower cities. This helps Airbnb in two ways.. less competition as these cities won&#x27;t have as much hotels...second allows them to increase their breadth of revenue based across many more cities then being dependant on just Tier 1 which have risk (regulation, disaster, etc.). Show this on S1 by % of travel that is now on Tier 2 and lower markets and how this has grown as a proportion of your overall revenue base.<p>3. Safety: Simple it&#x27;s getting close to accepted that the #1 way of covid transmission is via airborne. Based on this you as a traveler should want to minimize as much unnecessary humans interaction as possible thus hotels suck with all the traffic that is there. You may argue that hotels have policy that are more strict on cleaning but this doesn&#x27;t mean much when the way to catch covid is via airseol.<p>4.

Perhaps create a &quot;protocol&quot; to check in, where the guest can film entering the property for a few minutes, and even leave the video to be reviewed by other future guests. And so on.<p>2) There are two categories of hosts: the ones that simply do it for business (they buy multiple properties in a city and rent it out 100% of the time), the ones that do it to mingle with guests (a-la couchsurfing). Make it easy to distinguish between the two, and possibly offer a slightly different web experience for guests.<p>3) Training: help hosts (and maybe guests) learn what&#x27;s important and essential to provide a great experience; a &quot;udemy&quot; of sort, for AirBnB hosts.

The difference of the output voltages is an amplified version of the difference of the input voltages.

Firstly, it largely relies on what is eventually advertising revenue, in a time when users are increasingly using ad-blockers etc and privacy laws reduce the value of targeted ads.

Zuckerberg talks about it directly [0] and I think his approach is probably the most reasonable.<p>Social Media platforms do have some responsibility to moderate (and they have the legal Good Samaritan protection to do so in the US thanks to section 230). They have a particular responsibility since their &#x27;engagement&#x27; algorithms have often historically led to making things worse by elevating controversial content. When they&#x27;re using algorithms to elevate certain types of content they are employing some level of editorial control and have some responsibility as publishers in how they rank that content (what they choose to show more widely, what they choose to allow to fall into obscurity).<p>FB for their part has put a lot of effort into determining this kind of moderation standard and what they allow from users [1]. The recent political stuff is interesting in part because Zuckerberg is arguing that democratically elected politicians should be an exception to these rules, basically that citizens have a right to see the speech of their elected leaders (and lies should be corrected by a free press). While FB is legally able to moderate the speech of an elected politician on their platform, Zuckerberg argues it&#x27;s wrong for FB to decide what political speech is okay to block because they shouldn&#x27;t be in the position to make that call. I think he&#x27;s right to be concerned about that precedent.

This is why I treat activism as a tactic with skepticism, because people rarely organize and agitate to obtain more responsibility. I would argue a right without an associated  responsibility just means privilege. Freedom is separate.<p>When people demand rights, they beg the question of first from whom, and second of what responsibility they must  necessarily be taking on. When they demand freedom, they are rolling back the scope or domain of external authorities. Software freedom means using software without requiring permission. Freedom becomes an artifact of a private sphere of experience. This private sphere can be individual, it can be based on association, distance, or any number of other dimensions, but the existence of a private domain is the necessary condition for freedom. Rights on the other hand, are a public phenomenon, in that they are artifacts of an externally governed domain.<p>In this model, freedom is something outside the scope of governed rights, over which there is neither a guarantee or oversight. Freedom has a scope, and it can only exist within a perimeter that secures it from the external rights and privileges granted by authorities. All freedom is a limit on the sovereignty and dominion of external authorities, which is what makes it so provocative. It&#x27;s also why &quot;the rights of man,&quot; and &quot;human rights,&quot; were so controversial initially, because they require a universal authority to enforce them.<p>The question of whether my exercising freedom may infringe on someones rights or their privileges becomes clearer when we measure it against whether it interferes with their responsibilities. When rights collide, the law is the tool we use to reconcile them. When freedoms collide, typically we either resort to negotiating rights, or defer to the principle of freedom and move on. When freedom collides with rights, we tend to negotiate an exception or set a precedent. But when freedom collides with privilege, neither can bear co-existence with the other.<p>This models why some people think others&#x27; freedom is privilege (because it is not a function of prescribed  rights or responsibilities), and that rights and privileges for others breach their freedom (by expanding the domain of authority with imposed or without commensurate responsibilities). Hence playing loud music at 4am in a neighbourhood is a rights violation, and not an exercise of freedom, because it does not occur in a private domain, which is the necessary condition of freedom."],"time":["2020-08-12 18:09:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["esnard"],"id":[24132363],"kids":{},"parent":[24130963],"text":["I&#x27;m currently reading a manga named Attack on Titan, in which freedom (and its implications) takes a very important part, and I couldn&#x27;t emphasize  how good the writing is.<p>The anime is also available on Netflix in most countries, if you prefer that format."],"time":["2020-08-12 16:29:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vjvj"],"id":[24131544],"kids":[24131713,24131894],"parent":[24130963],"text":["I like the way the author has articulated this.<p>It can be built on by applying the economics concept of &quot;externalities&quot; - i.e. side effects (positive or negative) from a particular action such as the exercising of a right or freedom.<p>To get us closer to a perfect world, we need to start measuring the value of externalities (arguably not always easy to get right but possible to estimate) and to whom this gain or loss in value occurs so that they can be compensated by the externality creator(s).<p>I agree with the author that most people do not consider the negative externalities of a particular freedom being exercised.<p>We should require our legislators to more clearly articulate  and value externalities from a given policy and identify groups it creates negative externalities for, and how they should be compensated (or why they do not deserve to be compensated)."],"time":["2020-08-12 14:53:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["OliverJones"],"id":[24131466],"kids":[24131783],"parent":[24130963],"text":["There&#x27;s the Hunter S.

If I say that all Jews should be kicked in the face whenever you see one this limits Jewish people’s freedom live a life without fear of being kicked in the face.<p>No, no.

Once you acknowledge a right to be free from fear, you are able to justify any tradeoff. I say - no! There is no right to be free of fear. Everybody has the right to <i>be<\/i> safe, but nobody has the right to <i>feel<\/i> safe. Adjusting your feeling to reality is everyone&#x27;s own responsibility. We must not allow people to abdicate the responsibility for their own feelings and create a guilt of others not to cause upset. A free society cannot and must not take responsibility for fears - only for outcomes. Always for outcomes! No jew should ever be kicked in the face, we are completely agreed. But society&#x27;s obligation to protect Jewish rights ends at their cranium. What happens inside people&#x27;s heads is nobody&#x27;s business but their own - for good or for ill.<p>(Which is of course not to be understood as arguing against mental health services.

For anyone whose wellbeing improved, they likely have everything in place already. They have stable jobs, stable families, stable savings and income sources, people they are either able to see in their homes or regularly elsewhere, and are not affected by travel bans and other effects of the viral outbreak.<p>My wellbeing is at an all-time low and has continued to deteriorate since January. My family is split across the world due to unnecessary travel bans. Everyone in this thread is saying how the lockdowns were unnecessary long term but then everyone is seemingly okay with the government killing people&#x27;s jobs and splitting up families with travel bans that don&#x27;t take anything into consideration. There&#x27;s no reason why travel for family members and H1B workers and immigrants, especially those in extraneous situations, is still blocked when hotel quarantines could be put in place, just like they are for inter-country travel. Just in my circle alone, the U.S. has lost a dozen or so Chinese citizens who hold advanced degrees or who are doctors who were either forced back to China, wanted to go back (and get out of the U.S.), or can&#x27;t come back to the U.S. Good luck with the brain drain since these people were working for U.S. hospitals and companies. Not only are we losing people who were already here and wanted to be here, we&#x27;re going to lose countless more who would have come to the U.S. in the future. This will have consequences.<p>My fiancée is locked out of the country. We can&#x27;t sell her car because she&#x27;s not here and there are policies in place that protect against the situation. Online car selling websites have auto-locked our account since she logs in China, and I log in from the U.S., and they won&#x27;t re-open it as &quot;you can&#x27;t sell your car while on vacation&quot; (direct quote). The title transfer process is difficult if not impossible while she&#x27;s out of the country, and we need help, but the RMV is not responsive. If you can even find a phone number for the RMV, you call and then it states they have high call volume and then says to call back tomorrow and then automatically hangs up on you. We&#x27;re paying for a car, including insurance, that just sits around and can&#x27;t legally sell it without embarking on a process that could take months and capital to simply secure the title before even attempting to sell. People always support insurance companies as if they decide your premium based upon statistics and probability. So what&#x27;s the probability that our car that just sits parked and is driven once every week or two gets damaged and why haven&#x27;t our rates gone down to reflect this greatly reduced probability? Yet, if I got a ticket tomorrow, they&#x27;d have no problem raising the rates.<p>My rent actually was increased in March, and rent everywhere seems as high or higher than before as I try to move due to noise issues with my neighbors. Our marriage is getting delayed by years due to this. We can&#x27;t get through the travel bans or anything else because we&#x27;re not officially married (we had planned on doing it immediately after coming back from China), and we can&#x27;t get married unless we&#x27;re together, yet you can enter into all sorts of other legal agreements remotely.<p>Policies are not updating with the situations, if anything they&#x27;re regressing, and everything is moving in molasses. Everything is taking at least twice as long as it did before. Prices are actually increasing for things. All the predatory behavior on people has increased and now people have a new excuse (COVID) on why everything doesn&#x27;t work or is slow.<p>If your wellbeing has improved during this time, good for you. For those of us where it hasn&#x27;t, it has deteriorated exponentially. And my family is in the best of the worst cases. We still have our jobs, have places to stay, and have supportive families. I truly feel for those struggling. The narcissism of people to think that they&#x27;re happier because their commute is gone is mindboggling, when people are dying or living as death on a daily basis due to everything going on."],"time":["2020-08-12 19:21:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tempsy"],"id":[24133011],"kids":{},"parent":[24132412],"text":["Also reports of far fewer premature babies under lockdown...likely a result of <i>less<\/i> stress on the working mother."],"time":["2020-08-12 17:28:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SpicyLemonZest"],"id":[24132667],"kids":[24132879],"parent":[24132412],"text":["I think this is less informative than the authors are thinking.

Theoretically this is where your leverage always comes from because a good BATNA enables you to threaten to walk away.<p>Practical: in your post I understand what you want, but I don’t understand your BATNA. If your friend refuses, or worse let’s say he fires you right now, what would you do&#x2F;make instead?<p>The easiest way to get a win-win is the following:\n1) go find other gig offers - compare the price others are willing to pay you (recognizing there’s some risk the next client is not as friendly&#x2F;easy to work with)\n2) Let’s say you get 3 offers at $15,$16,$17. Show these offers openly to your friend and say “look I like working with you and want to continue but the market rate for my work is much higher than what I make right now”. This is actually a win-win because if you’ve done your research right, these are the same offers your friend would have to make to replace you. Now the conversation isn’t about what you want vs what he wants, but what each of you would do if you can’t get to an agreement.<p>3) Make your offer (say $18) and explain why it is higher&#x2F;lower than the market avg (you can trust me, you know I do good work, etc).<p>4) Truly be willing to walk away if it doesn’t work. Not everyone is rational, not everyone will believe your alternative, not everyone wants a quick resolution. Unfortunately this is the hard part with friends, but if it doesn’t work you just must be willing to walk away (try to keep it isolated to your business partnership and not your personal friendship).<p>Notice, throughout, the premise is: here’s what my alternative is.

The main issue we were battling was the amount of respirable crystalline silica in our new repair material ... and OSHA recently added it to their standards list. Therefore, we need to find a solution. Our main contenders were: 1) surgical mask, 2) N95 respirator, and 3) USAF gas mask.<p>After lots of laboratory testing and field testing, we determined the N95 respirator was the least intrusive method to meet the OSHA requirements. Yes, the USAF gas mask would work but placed considerable undue stress on the Airmen performing the repair work on the runway.<p>DETAILS:\nRespirators (ex. N95) are designed and engineered for distinctly different functions than surgical masks (and homemade cloth masks). And filters (respirators or surgical) do NOT act as sieves. Finally, the filter’s collection efficiency is a function of the size of the particles and is not dependent on whether they are bioaerosols or inert particles.<p>There is a particle size at which none of the “mechanical” collection mechanisms (interception, impaction, or diffusion) is most effective. This “most penetrating particle size” (MPPS) marks the best point at which to measure filter performance. Therefore, N95 respirators filter at least 95% of airborne particles and is not resistant to oil. (R is somewhat resistant to oil and P is strongly resistant to oil).<p>It is important to note that respirators must meet stringent certification tests established by NIOSH, whereas manufacturers of surgical masks get to choose from a variety of protocols (including ones that charge the particles) and only have to demonstrate their product is at least as good as a mask already on the market.\nWe looked at numerous studies comparing the performance of surgical masks using a standardized airflow, filter performance showed to be highly variable. Collection efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% for different manufacturers’ masks when measured using the test parameters respirators need for NIOSH certification. Therefore, surgical masks were out of the running.<p>N95 respirators were then compared to USAF gas masks. Both worked at filtering the silica, however, the USAF gas mask was bulkier, heavier, and more costly. Unfortunately, the most important aspect of a respirator’s performance is how well it fits the face and minimizes the degree of leakage around the facepiece. Therefore, we had to institute a fit test program for all engineers.<p>OSHA&#x27;s action level for silica is 50 µg&#x2F;m3 (micrograms of silica per cubic meter of air), averaged over an 8-hour day. While the size of silica varies significantly from .01 µm (micrometre or micron) to 100 µm in diameter, our median silica particle size was ~3 µm.\nSARS-CoV-2 is significantly smaller than our median silicon particle size (0.1 µm in size), SARS-CoV-2 always bonds to something larger. It could be respiratory droplets (&gt;5 µm) or aerosols (&lt;5 µm).<p>Therefore, if you want to be effective in stopping particles, you need a N95 respirator and it needs to be fit tested to the individual and is only good for one time use."],"time":["2020-08-12 21:28:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["p1mrx"],"id":[24135617],"kids":[24135755,24135705,24135648],"parent":[24135255],"text":["About time.
