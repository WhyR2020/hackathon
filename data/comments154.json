I jumped out of my bed and opened my laptop … yes, its hacked.\nIt was a nightmare, I didn’t know where to start and almost lost my job back then.<p>The short story is that a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the website to log into the admin panel and take control of the website.<p>I was devastated but I decided that I need to learn more about security .. being a developer without know how to secure your code is not enough.\nTwo years later I was in good shape and started to work as a security consultant for development companies especially to work for developers to strengthen their codes.<p>Here we come, in 2016 I decided to quit my job and start a cybersecurity company, my dream was and still to enable developers to write secure code, to not face a disaster as I faced before.\nAre you crazy? That what I heard from everyone at my friends, colleagues, starting a security company .. in the MENA region .. in Egypt! and not a security service, it’s a Product, a technical product.<p>I admit it was scary for me too, the economic situation and currency devaluation pushed a lot of talents to leave the country and work abroad. and the remaining is afraid to work for a startup.\nLuckily, I found 2 co-founders who were my colleagues from my last company. and we incorporated the company in Delaware, US. to implement credit card processing via Stripe. (Thank you Stripe Atlas.)<p>After days and days of a sleepless night, we have now a minimum product we can sell, we launched but no one came. \nOk, Let us discover channels to market the product. We listed the product in the beta testing website like beta list also submitted in Reddit, FB groups, Twitter .. everywhere\nAfter a lot of hassle to get the words out, we got some users, and one day I opened my email to find confirmation about the first paid user<p>From getting the first traction to first paid user, to be accepted in Cylon accelerator in London, yay  (after a lot of rejections from local accelerators).\nBut, we couldn’t get a UK visa (rejected two times) and the Cylon opportunity disappeared \nAnd if that wasn’t enough, my two co-founders decided to leave. There was not much money in the company back then, and churn was very high.\nThere weren’t any lights at the end of the tunnel.<p>But I felt the spark again inside me, I must not ever give up. I need to push it further.<p>We changed the core product to focus more on finding vulnerabilities inside the developer code.\nThat’s the original goal, help developers to write more secure code.<p>We also decided to focus on companies that have it’s own dev team in-house.\nBut i need money to continue ….<p>I pitched the company to 50+ VCs and angels and believe me that is a big number here in Egypt, especially if you know that the total number of active VCs in Egypt was lower than 20 VCs, and nearly no active angels.\nAnd the answer was No, We need some traction, We need a lot of traction, You are a solo founder now, Do you think you can build this technology?!!<p>My last pitch was to Arzan Capital, and I was very lucky because the venture partner is an entrepreneur, he co-founded Jeeran, one of the first internet portals in the MENA region.\nAnd guess what he is a developer by heart and he still writes code till now.<p>He was very interested in our product and after a couple of tough meetings they decided to invest. \nThat was it, I expanded my team to include some crazy developers and security engineers like me, who believe we can build that thing.<p>After a couple of months, we got more traction and we got into 500 startups accelerator program, the first in the MENA region. It was a life-changing experience interacting with well-experienced mentors coming from Silicon Valley.\nWe refined our Idea, our technology.<p>And now I’m happy to announce our product, Shieldfy — Your virtual security assistant.<p>That’s our story, I&#x27;m happy to answer any question regarding the product or our journey."],"time":["2020-03-04 17:15:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TACIXAT"],"id":[22487024],"kids":[22487133],"parent":[22484972],"text":["Which languages are supported?

So, their infected numbers are probably more accurate.  The death rate may still be higher, because we don&#x27;t know how many in the infected population as of today will recover.

The virus quickly binds to ACE2 and their adaptive immune systems did not have the time to start producing enough anti-bodies.

That ratio converges to twice the golden ratio, which means that since fib(n+1) ~= f * fib(n), then the number of calls in fib(n) is approximately 2 * fib(n+1). I scratched my head for a bit as to why this is and I gave up; the Lord works in mysterious ways.<p>We can model the number of calls with a doubly-recursive function, much like fib itself:<p><pre><code>  calls 0 = 1\n  calls 1 = 1\n  calls n = 1 + calls(n-1) + calls(n-2)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nHowever, it&#x27;s easier to work with this if we split into three parts: the base case of fib that adds 0, the base case that adds 1, and the recursive case. If you examine the number of each type of call, you get the following table:<p><pre><code>  add 0:   1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3,  5 ... = fib(n-1)\n  add 1:   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,  8 ... = fib(n)\n  recurse: 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12 ... = fib(n+1)-1\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSo the total number of calls is fib(n-1) + fib(n) + fib(n+1) - 1. Since fib(n+1) = fib(n) + fib(n-1), we can express the sum as 2 x fib(n+1)-1.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s an OEIS entry for this sequence: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;oeis.org&#x2F;A001595\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;oeis.org&#x2F;A001595<\/a>.

This wind, in turn, makes waves; while there is, in fact, a lot of energy in the waves of the deep ocean, there is very little nearer to shore.

Never before had I played a 3D\nDungeon Crawler (Wizardry type) game. It was a strange experience at first, and\nan especially frustrating one. This game is extremely unforgiving, trying to\npush that last bit of your party&#x27;s health to explore as much as possible. And\nthen you make a fatal mistake, get too greedy, or maybe a bit unlucky, and lose\nall your progress since you last entered the dungeon. Later iterations of the\ngame seem to be less difficult, though still challenging. Since playing Etrian\nOdyssey, I&#x27;ve started playing other games like the old Wizardry games and Legend\nof Grimrock.<p>Reading this is very inspiring. I&#x27;m also into game development and want to\ncreate an (online) RPG for &quot;tired veteran MMO players&quot;. I belong to the\ngeneration of highschoolers that spent their free time playing MMORPGs like\nFinal Fantasy XI, World of Warcraft, and Guild Wars, when they just came out. I\nhad so much free time back then, and the energy to stay up until 3AM on a school\nnight just to get that special item. Fast forward 15 years, I still love the\nfeeling of &quot;progress&quot; in games, but I just don&#x27;t have to time to spend. The\nextra time that I do have I try to spend on other things that are important to\nme. I&#x27;d love a game which would give me the feeling of progress (especially the\nfeeling of Final Fantasy XI), but doesn&#x27;t require me to go back to my highschool\npast.<p>Everything was thought out, from the core mechanics of the game to how the\nplayer should feel and use their imagination. I honestly think Kazuya Niinou did\na great job. Reading this diary really inspired me to continue my game\ndevelopment journey. I can spend time doing what I love, work to achieve my\ngoal, and also improve my programming skill &#x2F; knowledge.<p><i>When I talked to our marketing team, I told them I wanted to emphasize that Etrian is &quot;the renewal of the 3D dungeon RPG.&quot; What I mean by that is that I hope the genre will thrive again, not just attract the same Wizardry fans.<\/i><p>I think you achieved your goal, thanks you!"],"time":["2020-03-04 11:00:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ningen"],"id":[22482921],"kids":{},"parent":[22472244],"text":["Etrian Odyssey has some of the most satisfying &quot;progress&quot; feelings in RPGs I&#x27;ve ever experienced - getting to a new floor, building your parties skills, finally beating a tough boss.<p>Very interesting diaries, you can tell the director was very ambitious and the final product shows the amount of work put into the game"],"time":["2020-03-04 12:42:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["JohnBooty"],"id":[22483294],"kids":{},"parent":[22472244],"text":["This is a good read for all software developers - it really transcends the particular game.<p>This man has put a <i>tremendous<\/i> amount of effort into user empathy, thinking deeply about how the user will interact with his game.<p>Imagine if we could put this amount of care into all the software we write.

However, because I always read by topic (e.g. I&#x27;d type &quot;SICP ycombinator&quot; in Google and read the top pages), I think one approach is to let the user enter a <i><\/i>topic<i><\/i>, say &quot;SICP&quot;, as well as number of top-level stories to return, say 25, and invoke the API to return stories. The app will then dump the stories and their comments into a database with data modelling that suits for a forum.<p>2 - Offline access of data: Essentially what I mentioned above. The app should also allow user to remove a story (and its children), modify topics, favorite a story and create new topics. I think those are the barebone requirements. The backend would interact with the database and do updates.<p>3 - Query data via SQL: I think it might be too much work to parse queries, and the easiest thing to do is to just access a string as query and pass that to the database engine. Or maybe only allow user certain actions and let the backend assemble the queries.<p>4 - Full text search of stories and comments: Not sure what to do as my programming knowledge is very limited. I saw the second link you provided and it is very interesting.<p>5 - Notification of replies to comments: Maybe give user a button to update all his favorite stories.<p>TBH I really want to see what other people&#x27;s implementations will be."],"time":["2020-03-04 05:55:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geoah"],"id":[22482237],"kids":[22482548,22492531,22482262],"parent":[22481199],"text":["I&#x27;d be very interested in something that can cache the actual article&#x2F;page from the main HN link as well as a reading list.<p>There are times when I add HN articles to mobile chrome&#x27;s &quot;read later&quot; list, and when I have time go through them.

I, personally, have become convinced that looking for signals this way is actually pointless.<p>The argument is basically this:<p>1. Within 1000 years (and maybe a lot less) we will have the engineering capability to build space habitats, powered by solar power. This last part is important because this thought experiment isn&#x27;t gated on commercial viability of nuclear fusion power, which I&#x27;m not yet convinced is possible.<p>2. These space habitats are far more efficient at creating living area than planets. I forget the exact numbers but something like 1% of the mass of Mercury is enough to create enough living area for something like 10^16 to 10^18 people.<p>3. Space habitats are more convenient and cheaper to move between than leaving or even entering a gravity well like Earth&#x27;s.<p>4. Roughly one billionth of the Sun&#x27;s energy hits the Earth.<p>5. Once you have the ability to create one of these things, each becomes progressively easier.<p>This, of course, is the classic Dyson Swarm. Originally this was called a Dyson Sphere but this has led some to think it&#x27;s a solid shell around a star. That was never the intent. Even if it was, no known or currently theorized material could support this.<p>Dyson Swarms are not subtle. Even a partial Dyson Swarm should be detectable as a large IR source compared to how much visible light is produced. This is because the only way for something in space to cool down is to radiate that heat away and physics determines the wavelength of that based on the temperature of the object.<p>Standard objection: what if you can recycle that heat? Well, you can&#x27;t do that perfectly (as this would violate Thermodynamics) and even if you reduce IR emissions by 90%, you&#x27;ve simply reduced the IR emissions by one order of magnitude. For comparison, the Sun produces roughly 4x10^26 Watts of power.<p>So if you accept the above premises the gap between stabbing each other with swords and having this technology, at least for us, is 1000-2000 years, a cosmic blink of an eye to produce signals without the above IR signature. Those are long odds.<p>Personally I subscribe to the view that technological life is, at least within a billion light years of us, is likely quite rare.<p>The above is a very superficial summary of a topic that Isaac Arthur&#x27;s channel goes into great depth about.

A lot of times the spaces between words could be as large as the spaces between columns, so the statistical &quot;grouping&quot; of characters to try to identify the &quot;macro rectangle&quot; shape could get tricky without severely special-casing for this.

Imagine hearing &quot;This copy belongs to address at example dot com: one one three a f six nine c c&quot; at the end of every page. Of course the hex string is usually much longer, about 32 chars long or so.<p>* Some tests I had to take included automatically generated alt texts for their images. The alt text contained full paths to the JPG files on the designer&#x27;s hard drive. For example, there was one exercise where we were supposed to identify a building. Normally, it would be completely inaccessible, but the alt was something like &quot;C:\\Documents and Settings\\Aneczka\\Confidential\\tests 20xx\\history\\colosseum.jpg&quot;.<p>* My German textbook had a few conversations between authors or editors in random places. They weren&#x27;t visible, but my screen reader still could read them. I guess they used the PDF or Indesign project files themselves as a dirty workaround for the lack of a chat &#x2F; notetaking app, kind of like programmers sometimes do with comments. They probably thought they were the only ones that will ever read them. They were mostly right, as the file was meant for printing, and I was probably the only one who managed to get an electronic copy.<p>* Some big companies, mostly carriers, sometimes give you contract templates. They let you familiarize yourself with the terms before you decide to sign, in which case they ask you for all the necessary personal info and give you a real contract. Sometimes though, they&#x27;re quite lazy, and the template contracts are actually real contracts. The personal data of people that they were meant for is all there, just visually covered, usually by making it white on white, or by putting a rectangle object that covers them. Of course, for a screen reader, this makes no difference, and the data are still there.<p>Similar issues happen on websites, mostly with cookie banners, which are supposed to cover the whole site and make it impossible to use before closing.

But since you’d be working on the final rendering you could be sure everything you covered would be covered in the final output. The biggest challenges after that were related to text extraction, since we wanted a nice UI where you could select text and the redaction would auto cover text and use a uniform width based on the heights of all characters in the redaction. I think more often than we were happy with a user would need to simply use a bounding box since extracting all the pertinent data related to the text was so hard.<p>I walked away from the product over a decade ago since it always seemed like it’d be trivial for adobe to implement the feature in reader.

That’s much stronger authentication than many other schemes and if it was linked to some sort of payment method and potential even identity service then you could not only pay with your biometric but you could also pay for age restricted goods such as alcohol since it would be physically impossible for someone else to use your hand to buy stuff.<p>It’s possible for a kid to use your card and pin or phone and passcode though.

He was very friendly and discussed specifics for how the mobile phone anonymous token works and how it’s supposedly a secure, anonymous arrangement.<p>I discussed with this gentleman the concerns from this article and he wasn’t too happy, naturally, given my disagreement with the practice of sharing such data due to such deanonymization concerns.<p>As I’m a bit of an activist regarding E2EE and voyeuristically supportive of certain disliked politicians, and against the described data sharing, I have to wonder if someone chose my number to play a prank.

I called their support and pointed out that, at least conceptually, it should be trivial to build a security feature to prevent this. And presumably shaken&#x2F;stirred ss7 cert authentication for did’s should already cover in-network did authentication and prevent in-network spoofing. Is this a reasonable assumption?

There are now actually a lot of symbols in unicode for Byzantine music, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to handle the typesetting necessary for combining neumes in the various possible ways yet (think of how Korean works)... but I haven&#x27;t looked into this for a few years.<p>I love this music, not only for the beauty of its sound but also the incredible richness of the hymns. There are teachers in the United States working on developing good methods for teaching all of this to people without such a cultural background, and critically, singing it in English so that the meaning can be understood by those who don&#x27;t know Greek or Arabic. Chanting with my choir is one of my greatest joys in life. Glory to God for all things."],"time":["2020-03-03 22:27:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tdumitrescu"],"id":[22481908],"kids":{},"parent":[22472779],"text":["I sang on this CD. The NPR piece linked here appears to be based on a segment we did a few years later for Pop-Up Magazine in Oakland. An interesting technological tidbit that they didn&#x27;t mention is the use of contact mics for recreating the Hagia Sophia acoustic in live performances (and the CD recording). The Stanford crew would tape these tiny mics to the middle of our foreheads (with wires running down to portable wireless transmitters on the belt) to get a good mixable channel for each singer, which would go through their signal processing gear to produce an acoustic backing mixed with the live singing. This is totally unusual for performances of this repertory; you normally do concerts entirely &quot;acoustic&quot; with no mics or monitors, and good recordings typically involve either a single pair of crossed mics in front of the whole ensemble or a few strategically placed mics in the space, but no per-singer channels and pop-style mixing tech."],"time":["2020-03-04 08:48:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["beloch"],"id":[22478562],"kids":[22480107,22478810,22484157,22482030,22481082,22480732,22479802],"parent":[22472779],"text":["The next step (that will probably never happen) would be to refurnish the Hagia Sophia, as it would have been before it was plundered in the fourth crusade, and seat an audience in it, as if for a mass.

Now those standard library functions operate on things like the Foldable type class which is must follow some laws defined in terms of endomorphisms.

One of the prime examples of this is tar: whenever someone says &quot;extract this tarball&quot;, they usually give the command as this:<p><pre><code>   tar xfvz my-source-code.1.2.3.tar.gz\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhat does those flags mean? Who knows! I mean, I know because I&#x27;ve used it enough, but for many people those are just a mysterious incantation (there&#x27;s even an xkcd about it! [0])<p>The reason is arguably that tar has too many responsibilities here. Tar should only do two things: create tar streams and extract tar streams into files. You do that with &quot;tar c&quot; and &quot;tar x&quot;, and that&#x27;s everything you should need to remember (ok, fine, &quot;tar t&quot; for listing files is good to know as well).<p>Commands to create tarballs should look like this:<p><pre><code>    tar c directory | gzip &gt; directory.tar.gz\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd untar commands should look like this:<p><pre><code>    zcat directory.tar.gz | tar x\n<\/code><\/pre>\nor maybe<p><pre><code>    cat directory.tar.gz | gunzip | tar x\n<\/code><\/pre>\nor whatever version you prefer with &quot;tar x&quot; at the end. This is composable, super-easy to remember, and you can VERY easily swap out any parts for any other parts (for instance, changing the source from a file to a url with curl, or the destination for an ssh pipe or something).<p>One of the benefits of the &quot;swapping out&quot; parts are of course that you&#x27;re not restricted to what&#x27;s built into tar: you can use ANY compression utility you want. For instance, there&#x27;s a thing called pigz[1] which parallelizes gzip decompression for increased speed. It&#x27;s trivial to swap into the pipeline when you use tar that way:<p><pre><code>    cat directory.tar.gz | unpigz | tar x\n<\/code><\/pre>\nCongratulations, you now have much faster expansion of tarballs, without needing to recompile tar.<p>We&#x27;ve taught a generation of programmers that &quot;tar&quot; is hard to use and you have to look up a magic incantation every time you need it.

In my experience there are two ways:<p>1. You write reliable software from the start. It feels a lot like writing a mathematical proof, or at least sketching one. After a few dumb bugs are fixed the code continues to work without issue, year after year, and nobody ever looks at it again. (This isn&#x27;t as hard as it sounds! It&#x27;s not the right approach for everything, but it should be more widely used than it is.)<p>2. You write normal software, i.e. unreliable crap, but you look at the ways that it goes wrong and fix them. This requires that you put some work into detecting that things have gone wrong. A lot of software companies will trace all crashes, and aggregate stack traces and logs from them. In this kind of environment, you can improve software reliability by sticking a paranoid number of assertions in your code and obsessively checking to see what triggered them. After a while all the common problems will have been removed, and the remaining bugs will be less prevalent than hardware failures -- and then you can declare victory."],"time":["2020-03-04 06:08:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ssivark"],"id":[22479417],"kids":[22479906],"parent":[22478585],"text":["&gt; <i>How did software get so reliable without proof?<\/i><p>Simple, software started shipping with more bugs in backlogs :-P<p>—\nMore seriously, software today is endemically crappy, and often poorly designed.

My team use git on Github. For versioning we use design names and version numbers in sequence within git, which may seem an antipattern but it is the approach we have evolved over time, as it allows us to identify a design with a short version number for mechanical engineering and integration purposes, work more effectively with outside people and processes, and sidestep more cleanly the built in RCS&#x2F;VCS system in our CAM program.<p>We also do a lot of 3D design for mechanical parts, which is where I think this platform could really be useful. I would encourage you to consider expanding from electronics only to parts. There is definitely pain around BOMs, accounting, ordering timelines, ease of purchasing (external fabrication services as well as components), test processes (hardware equivalent CI&#x2F;CD) and so on. Part files are often large and good integration with <i>git-lfs<\/i>[1] could be a killer feature.<p>Also, you may find this recent comment[0] interesting.<p>Do you have plans to monetize? I guess one option is you could offer the platform for free and then onsell fabrication and component services, which solves the &#x27;how to get money&#x27; problem without SaaS sales challenges, as well as the &#x27;every damn fabricator has their own (often poorly or  undocumented) format preferences&#x27; (and tends to push the cost of mistakes on the customer) problem.<p>I believe there is a huge amount of value add possible in streamlining the learning process for new hardware designers who are as yet unfamiliar with available fabrication processes (applies mostly to parts, not PCBs) &#x2F; design approaches (PCBs also) and their relative costs, timelines, and limitations. I would make this the core USP &#x2F; selling point as it is unmatched globally. A flowchart like selection &#x2F; comparison process for a given part based on base requirements (part volume, part material limitations, part material property targets, part cost limitations, target production speed, overall equipment budget, timeline, part lifetime and deployment environment, etc.), try to go deep and get extreme clarity on trends here, I strongly suspect it will pay dividends with new users.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22370210\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22370210<\/a> [1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-lfs.github.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-lfs.github.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-03 21:12:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alufers"],"id":[22478057],"kids":[22478193,22478213],"parent":[22476514],"text":["Hey!<p>The core features work great (albeit the schematic and board preview are a bit sluggish compared to the rest of the website).

Previously, I founded DIY Geeks in my home country, developing maker kits locally and creating a community of makers from the ground up. However, for the past year now, I&#x27;ve been working on InventHub. It is essentially a visual version control platform with a focus on real time collaboration for electronics development.<p>For most of my adult life, I&#x27;ve either been building a hardware product or helping others build their product. From what I&#x27;ve seen, time and time again, most people run into the same challenges:<p>Time-consuming research: finding parts&#x2F;data-sheets, reference designs for components in consideration, and running into issues someone else already ran into but just to find the possible solution after hours of searching the internet.\nNo effective way to collaborate: most time is wasted in sync meetings, writing reports and discussing changes...all hard to do remotely. \nContinuous hassle: saving files for each iteration and naming them, etc. and then sharing screenshots in reports as to what has changed.<p>And so, I thought to make a process oriented product just like GitHub with the following two goals:\nBuild a connected community of hardware developers and give them a space to share and collaborate on hardware projects, which in turn will be a vast collection of hardware designs, increasing discovery and reusability while making resources accessible to everyone at one place.\nMake a more effective process of collaboration for engineering teams - one that allows them to focus more on product and to enable effective remote team management, revision management, issue tracking and document generation without juggling through multiple platforms.<p>The product features I have set out to build are:\nVisual Version Control for better collaboration among engineering teams, with an ability to view design files in browser, visual diffing, visual annotations, and chiefly, maintain accurate revisions. \nLibrary Management tool to help teams view, diff and manage revisions of symbols and footprints. \nAutomated BOM generator that can detect parts in a project and give you a cost estimation of how much the parts will cost.\nAutomated design rule checks to help with industry compliance.\nGerber Generator - For generating gerbers in compliance with the drill specs of your prefered fabrication facility and get estimates.\nA connected marketplace of manufacturers so the developers can get cost estimation for different batch sizes and place order right from the platform.<p>We just came out of private beta and we are now in public beta. I am actively looking for feedback on the product. Currently we have built the first feature from the list above and we will release features 2 through 5 within the next two months.<p>It would be great if you could try out the product and share your feedback to help us improve the platform; if you could add to these ideas regarding product features, it would help us prioritize features in development and we would be especially grateful."],"time":["2020-03-03 18:20:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["seba_dos1"],"id":[22479312],"kids":[22479531],"parent":[22476514],"text":["For KiCad users, there&#x27;s Eeshow: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kicad-pcb.org&#x2F;external-tools&#x2F;eeshow&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kicad-pcb.org&#x2F;external-tools&#x2F;eeshow&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-03 23:24:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bananaeater"],"id":[22483885],"kids":[22484177],"parent":[22476514],"text":["When I tried out the annotate function on the home page, the finished comment had my first name as the username associated with the annotation.

Different economists have described this via various terms- &quot;savings glut&quot; is the one I like the most (even though I don&#x27;t like Krugman). Right now there is so much saved cash out there looking to be lent out that any project looking for financing can find it for cheap.<p>The Fed does not keep interest rates low in a vacuum. There is an auction system that determines real rates. If the Fed is not able to sell all their bonds at the target rate, they have to adjust.<p>In the long run, I think we will see:<p>1. (at risk of calling this bull market a &quot;new normal&quot;) P&#x2F;E ratios for stock will continue to climb in a secular fashion. Low returns from the alternative investment of bonds will dictate high P&#x2F;E ratios.<p>2. Debt financing will remain cheap. Low interest rates signal cash that is desperate to find a place to park it.<p>3. Government debt will remain popular and affordable. This is a win for Keynesians.<p>4. Secular low interest rates are an indicator of a stable and mature economy, which is good. The bad part is that they signal a world where obvious available capital investment projects are missing- we seem to have picked the low hanging fruit.<p>5. Next recession the U.S. will hit the zero lower bound, and we will see lots of QE and&#x2F;or nominal negative interest rates through some institutional mechanism.<p>6. Increasing government deficits look better when interest rates are low.<p>7. Speculative: Deficit spending can increase indefinitely if real interest rates are below 0 (aka nominal rates are below inflation).

This is most important for organisation.<p>I prefer handwritten notes, and I only take notes on things I don&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;m not writing a textbook - I don&#x27;t need my notes to be a complete reference manual on the subject. Moreover, notest that explain how you went from &#x27;eh?&#x27; to &#x27;oh, yeah...&#x27; are so much more useful, and if you already understand something you don&#x27;t have that moment to talk about. It&#x27;s also a waste of time.<p>I use hardback notebooks. If I&#x27;m studying 3 things simultaneously, I have 3 notebooks running. When I finish one subject, I start the next a few pages later. I write the subjects on the spine (normally need a sticky label). The growth of my &#x27;notebook library&#x27; has been quite satisfying!<p>My method of note-taking has varied a bit, I generally use the so-called &#x27;Feynman technique&#x27;. I write the subject, leave a few blank lines, then go through the steps needed to understand the subject. I then write the &#x27;summary&#x27; that I now understand in the blank space.<p>I might write a few exercises underneath, or reference a textbook, or something. Basically anything that will help me when I inevitably forget.<p>Often my notes are rewritten - my lecture notes are borderline unintelligable. After a while (at university) I gave up taking comprehensive notes, preferring to remain active in the class and then deliberately rewrite my notes using other sources later. This fuelled a powerful cycle - my other sources put me about half a lecture ahead, which helped me stay engaged in the lectures themselves, so I got more out of the lectures, and needed less study after.

In this setting, I found what worked for me was to write down literally everything the professor said in shorthand but comprehensible sentences. This helped my recall immensely and then my studying involved reading the notes i had written (takes about 15-30 minutes total) and seeing if they answered the review questions at the end of chapters.<p>This worked for most classes except for Discrete Structures and Automata which was such a novel and abstract concept for me at the time that I had to intently listen and scramble to draw the automata and write notes about my thought processes and &quot;aha!&quot; moments that happened on the fly. This is usually great for me still today when I want to remember the revelations that occur in my head as I&#x27;m pondering a concept or solution in real-time with a meeting."],"time":["2020-03-03 15:25:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["evo_9"],"id":[22477363],"kids":{},"parent":[22473209],"text":["From the Havard PDF on NoteTaking [1]:<p><U+25CF> Avoid transcribing notes (writing every word the instructor says) in favor of writing condensed notes in your own words.<p><U+25CF> Review your notes on the same day you created them and then on a regular basis, rather of cramming your review into one long study session prior to an exam.<p><U+25CF> Test yourself on the content of your notes either by using flashcards or using methodology from Cornell Notes[2].

Otherwise you&#x27;re spending a ton of money for nothing. Appeal to as many modes of learning as possible and give yourself multiple tiers of notes.<p>When in a lecture, see if you can record it and revisit it to create more notes. Look for visual cues and if there&#x27;s something you can touch or do, feel it or try out whatever you&#x27;re learning, whether in class or on your own time. Keep asking yourself questions about what&#x27;s being discussed to stay engaged.<p>In class, do an outline so you can record everything as quickly as possible. If you can do written, it&#x27;s better because it activates your spatial memory and forces you to put things in your own words. Only take notes about what matters. Dates, names, formulas, historical significance, pros and cons, theories, arguments, pictures, and questions you have.<p>Once you have an outline, come back to it and create a mind map so you have an overall picture of what you learned that day. Extra credit if you cultivate a separate mind map of the entire course over the semester.<p>For study, you could use the Cornell system to make it easy to quiz yourself and use Anki for rote memorization on the go. Review any time you&#x27;re waiting like for class, an elevator, in line, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re studying with a textbook, highlight, write your thoughts in the margin or on post-its in the book, and use color coded tabs in the best way YOU see fit. Group by theme or topic, or whatever suits you.<p>If you&#x27;ve pretty much rehashed notes in as many ways as possible, you&#x27;ll retain a whole ton of it already just by activating all kinds of memory, not just one. You won&#x27;t have to study as much later if you put more time up front right when you were exposed to it. The longer you wait, the more it fades.<p>But next comes review and this is the MOST important step when it comes to note-taking and retention. If you want to remember something long-term, look at your notes daily for a month. You don&#x27;t need to quiz yourself or check that you&#x27;ve got it committed to memory. Just read through your notes once per day and be done with it. You can quiz yourself a little later into it by covering the notes and recalling as many facts as you can before looking at them. Also you can practice whatever it is you learned or listen to the lecture again any time you&#x27;d listen to music. To make it even more effective, choose different places to review your notes so your brain doesn&#x27;t only recall information in your primary study location. Don&#x27;t be hard on yourself here, patience is a virtue.<p>Once you&#x27;ve reviewed your notes daily for a month, you only have to review them once a month to retain it for years and years to come. Choose one day a month to read through all the notes you&#x27;ve accumulated up to this point over all your classes and go have fun with all the free time you have now.<p>Hope that helps!"],"time":["2020-03-03 17:24:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["benrbray"],"id":[22480357],"kids":[22480381,22481239,22481084,22480805,22480885],"parent":[22478806],"text":["I recognize that my position is uncommon, but I am in favor of what I call &quot;2-DST&quot; (two minus DST), a position which recognizes that DST is fundamentally <i>backwards<\/i>.

Of course those versions of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; exist, but there is a vast and lengthy history of the world chock full of evidence that conspiracies of various types and degrees have been sucessfully (and sometimes not) executed regularly. I have taken to Michael Parenti&#x27;s labeling of those who constantly take this approach as &quot;coincidence theorists&quot;, and in particular his criticism that incompetence theories distract from proper understanding and analysis of malice.<p>&gt;In retrospect, the entire story starts to look like a classic conspiracy theory, attributing complex, multi-layered events to the secret machinations of shadowy behind-the-scenes operators deploying cutting-edge technology.<p>As if this is so far fetched. I can name countless cases where this is exactly what has happened!<p>&gt; “technical delusion” — a term that may encompass any and all delusions about technology, but usually designates a belief in machines that can control, surveil, harass, and deceive humans.<p>Machines and technology enable and empower the humans with the desire to do these things. The technology of the authors over-abused reference of James Matthews may have been fanciful then, but the things that concern those with &quot;technical delusion&quot; today exist in reality.<p>The author even later admits that there is a basis in reality of &quot;elites were secretly manipulating political events behind the scenes&quot;.<p>&gt;Suspicions regarding the hyper-concentration of wealth and power have attained broad bipartisan currency — in part because they are grounded in reality.<p>I&#x27;ve been down so many rabbit holes and have read so many conspiracy theories I will admit some of them border on psychosis manifesting, but I have also found the ones that aren&#x27;t, and the constant attempt to label all or almost all of them under the label of psychosis or some variant itself reeks of conspiracy. The irony being that the oft-abused term itself was largely pushed into modern parlance by the CIA seeking to discredit critics of the Warren commission[1], or for example the 2008 Cass Sunstein paper [2] prior to his appointment as the head of White House Information affairs that called for cognitive infiltration of discussion boards et al.<p>I could blather on about this kind of out in the open subversion for a while, but that&#x27;s not the point. The real point is that it is a fact that conspiracies are real and that they happen rather frequently, even if not always on the scale or level of impact often purported by those in that realm of discussion. Another note that I have tried to emphasize is that it is important to distinguish the type of logic used to reach conclusions. We generally should always prefer deductive logic, which is evidence based, but in many of the topics discussed there simply is no or is a dearth of evidence to be had, which is where the importance of inductive logic comes into place.<p>Unlike the authors proposition that those who think some conspiracies to be true must be rooted in anything but truth, my anecdotal experience has been from starting with only one maxim. That I would rather know the truth than the lie, in particular the ugly truth over the beautiful lie. What started out for me just as the meager attempts of a USMC Iraq combat vet to understand his own place in what could truly be called a vast conspiracy (the war), became a lifelong journey of transformation in understanding the bigger picture of the realities of this world. Let me tell you, it is so much more conspiratorial than most would ever want to know (and I base this upon good, strong evidence, and where that is lacking, good inductive logic). I think most people honestly would prefer the beautiful lie. My problem always has been and probably always will be when those who prefer the lie try to tell me the lie is truth, and then attack when incredulity inevitably rises as a reaction.<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikispooks.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Document:Countering_Criticism_of_the_Warren_Report\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikispooks.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Document:Countering_Criticism_of...<\/a><p>[2]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084585\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084585<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-03 12:43:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Barrin92"],"id":[22481075],"kids":{},"parent":[22472790],"text":["Very strange article for several reasons, predominantly on the politics of it all.<p>The first problem I have with it is comparing CA manipulation to schizophrenic delusions. fact of the matter is that <i>there was a conspiracy<\/i>.

They even manage to quote Foucault on the process of labelling people as delusional in order to exclude them from politics.<p>I hate to bring the big hammer of logical positivism down on someone who is having fun with a literature review, but the difference between delusional and non-delusional thinking is important because figuring out the truth and maintaining the ability to operate as a rational society making decisions based on evidence is important.<p>&gt; Under present conditions, is “paranoia” — a term Sconce deploys frequently but does not interrogate at length — still a recognizably distinct phenomenon?

You could argue that the later lessons are harder so it was unreasonable, but then you just confessed that the learning rate metric is not linear so your regression models doesn&#x27;t work since it assumes that going from .5 to .6 is equal to going from 1.5 to 1.6! Even though as we can see from the plot many of the best learners got stuck at lesson 16 for an entire session without making progress, while the slowest learners took 10 sessions to reach roughly the level these fast learners reached after the first.
