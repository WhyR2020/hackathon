However those “billions” include damage from storms, and suggesting that damage from storms is because of human caused climate change is very disingenuous— that’s suggesting that “stopping” climate change will also stop expensive storms, which is completely denying that destructive storms existed for as long as there has been an earth. So which storms are CO2 caused, and which aren’t? Which highly destructive storms would have occurred anyway but their dollar costs are high  because of where people choose to live as opposed to the actual intensity of the storm.<p>My point is that attributing storm costs to human-caused climate change is simplistic and misleading because we would need some baseline to determine which storms would not have existed if it weren’t for human CO2. That delta is what the real savings would be, not just the raw number.

I suspect they are concerned about non-public data hoarding and the resulting centralization on an otherwise public and distributed platform.<p>If my assumption is correct here are some potential alternative approaches:<p>* Private platform reliant upon anonymity and public data. The value is the application delivering the best decision(s) returned from a consideration of available data, what some people might think of as AI. The better AI is more valuable than holding data.<p>* Private platform fully divorced from both data and anonymity. The data is what a person or organization already holds and what they are willing to expose in a private relationship to somebody they know and trust. The relationship is more valuable than the data or the application. This is something like WhatsApp mixed with a tiny operating system that works more like Bit Torrent than using a central service. I am working on something like this.<p>* Public platform reliant upon mixins of various public data. This is the semantic web of the prior decade. It never took off because nobody wanted to expose their data. Data is king, especially when the corresponding automation isn’t a valued portable commercial product.<p>* Tiny portable data driven application architecture. Applications need only enough data to perform their functional task at any given moment. The value is purely driven by the application’s output regardless of where data on the fly comes from. This is something like Siri, but more specific to a given task.<p>In order for ideas like these to be commercially viable data must become a commodity or at least less valued than almost everything else. This is hard because there are very real fears (such as lost privacy) around treating data as a traded commodity and because in many cases software, as a business practice, is still in the dark ages."],"time":["2020-02-23 13:54:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FreeHugs"],"id":[22398713],"kids":[22398840,22399125,22399252],"parent":[22395358],"text":["<p><pre><code>    Everyone&#x27;s pod would be on a computer they own\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhy?

Appreciate the encouragement and constructive criticisms equally. We understand and share the shortcomings you mentioned as well. As one of the co-founders and the key person to take the blame, I wanted to answer some of the common concerns and admit our weaknesses as well.<p>Why build your own platform instead of Woocommerce&#x2F;Shopify?<p>The countries we were targeting in south Asia were countries like Nepal and Bangladesh where debit card purchases aren&#x27;t really a thing. Most of the transactions are still in cash, bank transfers that require using local payment gateways or locally popular app-based transfers (which resemble Venmo and Square Cash in the US). And also, we needed to use a combination of shipping services since worldwide shippers like UPS and FedEx don&#x27;t ship to the doorsteps in these countries since home addresses aren&#x27;t easily GPS-able due to organization issues. Some of us grew up in these countries, so we&#x27;ve experienced this personally. These were just some of the custom situations which wouldn&#x27;t have been addressed while using Woocommerce or Shopify. So we decided to build our own platform to customize it as per our unique needs as we go.<p>Licensing<p>We would appreciate feedback on this very much. We went with MIT License since that seemed to be the only one that allowed people to use it without much restrictions. I admit I didn&#x27;t spend much time on this, but now looking at all the forks and engagement, it is something that needs refinement for sure.<p>Shortcomings in the tech and tests<p>There is a fair share of shortcomings which we are aware of - like missing tests and antipatterns. We wanted to get the initial version to the market quick, so a good portion of the work was rushed. We&#x27;re working towards addressing these issues now, since we never thought someday Veniqa would be open-sourced and others might end up adopting it. Also, the engineering team for 80% of the build was just two of us, and we had a third member join us after. With regular full time engineering jobs during the day, the only way to finish building Veniqa was through caffeine powered insanity of 15 hr coding marathons during nights, weekends and vacations.<p>Future Plans, Contributions and Developer Documentation<p>We are currently in the process of building test suites, docker images and writing extensive documentation to speed up startup time. Hopefully, so we can encourage code contribution from other smart fellow engineers like yourselves.

But this is deeply flawed. Because it requires assigning each sample to a specific natural number, effectively reducing the solution space by an order of magnitude, n!. In practice, believe me, I have tried - the network never converges because the mapping is entirely arbitrary and has nothing to do with the samples.<p>To remedy this, we need an innovation in loss functions &#x2F; mathematics. The loss function for the output of the net needs to be a set function [1]. This set function should measure the distance between the <i>Set<\/i> of outputs of the net and the Set {1,2,...,n-1,n}. This is different from KL and all the other standard loss metrics, because we do not care about the point to point mappings, and have no ability to histogram or compute the probability distribution since those are non differentiable operations.<p>On sorting: tensorflow has a differentiable sort but it is a hack and simply propagates the loss backwards to the position the original data was in before it ended up in its sorted position. This loss of dist(sort(Y_pred),[1,n]) provides better results but still fails for large data sets due to the fakeness of the sort derivative.<p>I have a hunch that there is a mathematical way to uniquely measure some arithmetic quality to optimize for, that is maximum when the output set is the discrete uniform distribution.<p>The mean, standard deviation and other statistical measures are terrible identifiers and actually, via statistical theory, we would need n moments for a dataset of size n, to uniquely identify the distribution..so scratch those off the list [2].<p>So there are two ways to achieve this milestone in ML:<p>1) a truly differentiable distance metric between two sets d(S,T)<p>2) a differentiable measure of ideal dispersion &#x2F; density that forces the output set S to converge to the discrete uniform distribution (this is more problem specific to perfect hashes.)<p>Perhaps this sort is the key to doing #1 generically so we can have a new type of NN based on the output Set instead of the specific points.

When wind hits a wall (or obstacle) there is a period of space behind the wall where the shelter is actually higher than the wall. I think this is called the Law of the wall[0] in fluid dynamics. If you place your fruit trees the optimal distance from the wall you can provide maximum shelter, and if you place the 2nd tree an optimal distance from the 1st tree then the 1st can shelter the 2nd, and so on.

I&#x27;m mostly interested in 3D sculpting and animation, but I&#x27;ve played around with most of the tools. Here&#x27;s my impression.<p>It basically attempts to boil down video game behaviors to a fairly small number of simple &quot;gadgets&quot; (&quot;mover&quot;, &quot;rotator&quot;, various sensors, connectors, cameras, etc, plus the usual logic and programming pieces) that fit together into a pretty general engine. There are also higher level features you can use, such as a flexible human &quot;puppet&quot; with algorithmic movements.<p>It all runs in a graphics engine that is itself pretty inventive. It does not use polygons, but instead models consist of basic positive or negative 3D shapes blended together, and their surfaces consist of particles that can be configured in various ways.<p>I can&#x27;t really compare it with other game engines since I haven&#x27;t used them, but I think it&#x27;s much closer to something like Unity than to Minecraft. It&#x27;s obviously simplified a bit, but fundamentally I think it&#x27;s all there. You can (in principle) make games in any genre, but really any kind of interactive or non interactive stuff. And then there&#x27;s the sculpting and animating bit. Oh, and there&#x27;s a sound and music production environment in there. So it actually contains something like Blender and a DAW too. Plus it&#x27;s a collaborative platform where people can share, use and remix each others stuff.<p>I&#x27;m very impressed with Dreams. Media Molecule have managed to compress an entire creative suite into a PS4 and made it actually nice to use with a single game controller. All the tools are way deeper than they have any right to be. The presentation is obviously aimed at a younger audience, but if you can stand that it&#x27;s a lot of fun even to just explore the functionality.<p>It&#x27;s not a great programming environment though, at least when you&#x27;re used to working with normal tooling. You can make reusable components but it&#x27;s fairly clumsy. The thing I can most compare it to would be LabVIEW.<p>In the end, to me it&#x27;s not really about making AAA games or &quot;being productive&quot;, but just a general outlet for creativity.

You can thank&#x2F;blame me for the if-else bytecodes. They are indeed, a form of compression, as they don&#x27;t add expressive power. I measured carefully and they make a big difference in code size. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re there!<p>The structured control flow requirement is to benefit <i>all consumers<\/i>. It is only a burden on producers that come from CFGs, not from ASTs and other tree-like IRs. If you have a dominator tree, then you can generate structured control flow in linear time. LLVM does this a particular way, but there are straightforward algorithms.<p>No, this wasn&#x27;t Google throwing around its veto power or something like that. There is a good reason why control flow is structured, as hinted in comments here.<p>1. Structured control flow rules out irreducible loops. Irreducible loops cause problems for <i>all<\/i> JIT compilers in all browser engines, not just V8, and even in JVMs. Things get really complicated, particularly in register allocation. [1]<p>2. Structured control flow guarantees a stack discipline for the use of labels, mirroring the stack discipline for values. This is not only a nice symmetry, it means that a consumer that needs to allocate space per label can reuse that space as soon as a control construct is closed. That is essentially optimal for use of consumer space resources.<p>[1] No kidding. If you have an irreducible loop in Java bytecode, which is possible, you will never be JITed and will get stuck running 100x slower in the interpreter. We thought this through very carefully in V8. If you allow irreducible loops in Wasm, you force all engines to either stick to their lowest execution tier and run 2-100x slower, do relooping themselves, or handle the general case of irreducible loops spending multiple person-years complicating their optimizing tiers&#x27; backends for a case that is <i>incredibly rare<\/i> (and probably introducing lots of bugs). In V8 we would have probably gone for the relooper option because the other two options are bad. So that&#x27;s a lose, because now the engine is more complicated, doing a rewrite of the code that could as well be done better and more efficiently offline by a producer. And there is no benefit because the engine&#x27;s code would be no better than what the producer would have come up with. So we&#x27;d choose the lesser of the complexity options, but get no performance benefit, in order to avoid the absurdly bad performance hit of not being able to use the optimizing tier.

The problem I have with Go is when you need to do anything non-trivial the intent of the code quickly becomes lost in lots of for loops. You can try to abstract that away so that your program reads better, but in my experience that has always been a poor decision. I get the impression Go wants me to write big for loops that do lots of work and have lots of scope and that it doesn&#x27;t want me to break my problems up into steps (like I might in a functional style by separating each stage of the computation). Go wants me to have mutable variables and mutable references. State management in Go is questionable and really left up to the programmer (mutable references and data hiding are too easy compared to functional languages where immutability generally forces you to think harder about your data&#x27;s structure). Sure, this is usually going to lead to a more performant end-result, but it&#x27;s not going to lead to the &quot;simpler&quot; result (in my eyes)<p>There&#x27;s a lot about Go that I do like - the toolchain and docs are particularly good, and the standard libs are modern yet succinct. It is low-level enough when I want it to be and relatively high-level (nits above aside). The support for concurrency and distributed systems is also good. I can see how &quot;simple&quot; is exhibited there<p>If I had to guess at what &quot;simple&quot; means to Gophers (well, the Golang team at least) it would be using the fewest number of language primitives&#x2F;features to get done what you want to get done. There are a lot of peculiar ways channels are used for example where other languages might prefer things like condition variables. The range keyword is overloaded and used different in several contexts but it does keep the number of keywords low. Most Go tends to look the same (low-to-the-ground, verbose)<p>Go is great until it isn&#x27;t and when it isn&#x27;t you have little choice but to brute force around some of Go&#x27;s clunky pieces. Extracting high-level meaning out of Go source can be difficult because of how verbose it can be. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s around and it&#x27;s a good choice for a lot of projects, but I really wish we could have simple things like generics so we can write cleaner code<p>In short, Go as a language may be simple (and I think it is) but I need to solve complex problems - either Go helps me with that complexity or it leaves me on my own.

It&#x27;s the computing equivalent of the blue-collar anti-intellectualism that is rampant in politics these days.<p>Yes, Go the language is simple - it pushes complexity off to your programs instead! Instead of functional expressions, Go programs are pages and pages of iterative loops and variable manipulation. Without generics, you can&#x27;t use even the most basic functional constructs like map and reduce. The most boring mainstream languages like Java and Javascript are adopting functional paradigms, whereas Go is actively hostile to functional programming.<p>Nothing is more tiresome than the continuous prattle about exceptions. &quot;How can you possibly write code that is robust in the presence of errors when you don’t know which statements could throw an exception?&quot; <i>Easily<\/i>. That&#x27;s the great thing about exceptions, you don&#x27;t need to know about them to write robust code.<p>In general business processing, an exception thrown across a transaction boundary rolls back the transaction. In most cases that&#x27;s pretty much all you need to know. In the case where you need to explicitly rollback a state change (extraordinarily rare in business processing), you add a try&#x2F;catch&#x2F;throw, and you don&#x27;t even need to look at the exception!<p>The fact is, 99% of programs need only one exception handler. In webapps, it&#x27;s the http processor that returns a 500 error. In GUI apps, it&#x27;s the main execution loop that shows an error dialog.<p>Go&#x27;s error handling not only requires endless tedious &quot;if err != nil return err&quot;, but each one of those statements <i>destroys stack information<\/i>. Folks like to berate Java for long stacktraces, but those stack frames are valuable for debugging. By comparison, Go&#x27;s errors are an opaque bit of text. Third-party libraries can help by wrapping errors in other errors (hand-building stacktraces), but this won&#x27;t help you when using third-party libraries that don&#x27;t use these wrappers.<p>I&#x27;ll say something positive about Go, and why I still use it: It&#x27;s a better C. For low-level-ish code that needs performance and fast startup time (CLIs, simple GAE services that scale to 0 and need immediate startup), Go fits the bill.

If you just bring two atoms together, the total energy is simply the sum of their individual energies. This state is typically referred to as an excited state. However, the stable bonded form of the two atoms actually has a lower energy. So to go from two separate atoms to two bonded atoms, the atoms have to first collide and form the excited state and then lose some amount of energy to go to the stable state. If they don’t lose that energy, then they can and will break apart again. One way to lose that energy is via collision with the third atom.<p>&gt; In normal systems where you have tons of atoms flying around, collisions happen very frequently, so you can typically assume that the stabilization will happen immediately following the reaction. This is why the idea that stabilization is an important step in a chemical reaction is typically not covered in intro chemistry. However, it’s not uncommon to have conditions where that assumption does not hold. This then gets into the concept of pressure dependent reaction kinetics, which studies the effect of having slow stabilization.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;science&#x2F;comments&#x2F;f7mqwl&#x2F;physicists_captured_individual_atoms_and_observed&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;science&#x2F;comments&#x2F;f7mqwl&#x2F;physicists_...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-23 02:30:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["martonlanga"],"id":[22390564],"kids":[22394655,22394510],"parent":[22390546],"text":["Interesting discussion on reddit:<p>&gt; It appears you need the energy from 3 in order for the 2 to make a bond.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the other way around.

Just as the Arabic words in Ottoman Turkish were originally adopted via Persian (and not directly from Arabic), most of the Latin-origin words in English were adopted via French, Italian, and other European languages.<p><i>As in most other Turkic and other foreign languages of Islamic communities, the Arabic borrowings were not originally the result of a direct exposure of Ottoman Turkish to Arabic, a fact that is evidenced by the typically Persian phonological mutation of the words of Arabic origin.<\/i><p>Funnily enough, Ottoman Turkish was also written with an alphabet woefully unsuited to express its sounds and grammar, just like English.<p><i>The Ottoman Turkish alphabet is a Turkish form of the Perso-Arabic script. Well suited to writing Arabic and Persian borrowings, it was poorly suited to native Turkish words. When it came to consonants, Arabic has several consonants that do not exist in Turkish, making several Arabic letters superfluous except for Arabic loanwords; conversely, a few letters had to be invented to write letters in Persian and Turkish that Arabic did not have (such as g or p). In the case of vowels, Turkish contains eight different short vowels and no long ones, whereas Arabic (and Persian) have three short and three long vowels; further complicating matters was that in the Arabic script, only long vowels are usually expressed.<\/i><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ottoman_Turkish_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ottoman_Turkish_language<\/a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Foreign_language_influences_in_English\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Foreign_language_influences_in...<\/a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ottoman_Turkish_alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ottoman_Turkish_alphabet<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-23 06:30:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cenkozan"],"id":[22396230],"kids":[22397008],"parent":[22390407],"text":["Well, we are taking about an empire that gave birth to 60 countries.

The only real difference between these is the users who have access. Normal production allows all expected users. &quot;Pre&quot; production allows only 2-3 specific users who understand the intent of this environment and the potential damage they might cause. In these ideal cases, we go: local development -&gt; internal QA -&gt; pre production -&gt; production actual. These customers do not actually have a dedicated testing or staging environment. Everyone loves this process who has seen it in action. The level of confidence in an update going from pre production to production is pretty much absolute at this point.<p>The amount of frustration this has eliminated is staggering. At least in cases where we were allowed by our customers the ability to practice it. For many there is still that ancient fear that if we haven&#x27;t tested for a few hours in staging that the world will end. For others, weeks of bullshit ceremony can be summarily dismissed in favor of actually meeting the business needs directly and with courage. Hiding in staging is ultimately cowardice. You don&#x27;t want to deal with the bugs you know will be found in production, so you keep it there as long as possible.

Most of the time, production is hooked up to real-world consequences that can never be fully replicated in a staging or test environment.
