Eventually I&#x27;ve uncovered a piece of a product that not only didn&#x27;t yield correct results, but was unrescuable in principle.

It wasn&#x27;t seen as a major priority - however, past a certain load time for each page, you start losing users. We started off way past that certain load time and managed to end up at something between 1 and 3-second loads in most cases.<p>- This wasn&#x27;t my idea, but a marketing manager I respect a lot once mentioned that people were spending a huge amount of time filling their date of birth while signing up. Something like 30 seconds or more. The reason was that we had been using a date picker that defaulted to the current year, so people would have to click back i.e. 30 times to select their year of birth. On his request, I replaced it with 3 lined-up fields of selects, and the time spent on average went down to 2 seconds.<p>- I had the chance to do a major rewrite of some legacy systems that worked fine, but weren&#x27;t built to scale and lacked standardization - the company had a few hundred users in one country when they were made, and when I worked on it there was a locally-modified copy of the system for each country we were in.<p>The reason for it was that some of our integrations would cease to work due to third parties, and we had to implement a major upgrade, so I built a service to handle requests and standardized the old servers to only make requests to the service without being smart about how they&#x27;re processed.<p>In the process, since everything was liable to break anyway if I didn&#x27;t get it right, I updated every dependency (whether it was for the code or the server) that I could find. Not fixing what wasn&#x27;t broken was a value that had served us up to that point, but we were racking on technical debt and it was a good chance to get rid of it. Sure, lots of things -did- break, but solutions were found. Technically, it&#x27;ll help both me and future devs entering the project, and practically, since the integration chiefly targeted contract processing for our customers, the fact that we can still do contracts and nothing broke on the surface is a success.<p>- I implemented log aggregation across all our servers (using ELK) and it&#x27;s been helping us track errors and server states a lot. We could have used something like Sentry, but we have millions of events going through on a regular basis, so it&#x27;s cost-effective.<p>- We use an internal time tracker that works based on office card access events. I was always curious about racked up overtime, so I added in a calculation for it in the API and returned it in the response when loading a user&#x27;s info without adding it to the frontend. I mostly used it for myself and told a few colleagues about where to look if they wanted to check.

Op. 33 is magical, and Op 11 is just plain difficult."],"time":["2020-02-01 18:51:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["antognini"],"id":[22209298],"kids":[22209890,22214349,22211590,22211739],"parent":[22208225],"text":["Schoenberg&#x27;s music is admittedly hard to get into.  But it is well worth spending some time with it because there is nothing quite like it.<p>For a bit of context, Schoenberg&#x27;s atonal style was the culmination of centuries of development of Western harmony.  From the Baroque&#x2F;Classical era onward, the direction of Western music was towards greater chromaticism extending harmonies further and further away from the simple major and minor chords.  Some composers came very close to complete atonality, particularly Scriabin and Stravinsky, but Schoenberg was the first to dive into completely atonal music.<p>While it may sound like someone randomly plonking on the keyboard, he had to work quite hard to get the atonal sound he wanted since harmonies are so ingrained in the way we hear music (especially for composers!).  He developed the &quot;twelve-tone system&quot; in which each note had to be played exactly once in a theme so as to guarantee that no tonality was accidentally introduced by stressing particular notes.<p>The result is a style that is very cerebral, but enjoyable once you let go of the idea that music should contain traditional harmonies.  Personally, I think the music world got a little obsessed about the idea and continued to develop it for maybe four decades longer than it should have.  (His twelve tone technique was later extended to &quot;serialism&quot; which generalized the process to rhythms, dynamics, and instruments, and wasn&#x27;t really abandoned by &quot;serious&quot; composers until maybe the 1980s.)<p>Incidentally, Schoenberg may have scared himself to death.  He was intensely superstitious, particularly of the number 13.  When he was 76 he was contacted by an astrologer who told him that this was a dangerous year since the digits of his age added up to 13.  Later in the year, on Friday, July 13th, he spent the day extraordinarily anxious and died shortly before midnight."],"time":["2020-02-01 08:50:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zengid"],"id":[22211777],"kids":[22214093],"parent":[22208225],"text":["As a music student, I was always amazed at the irony of Schoenberg&#x27;s thesis about the &quot;Liberation of the Dissonance&quot;, when 12 tone Equal Temperament is an arbitrary intonation system that limits the actual potential for freedom when creating harmony.<p>Ben Johnston, an American composer who studied with Harry Partch, used extended Just Intonation, which is a system of unlimited harmonic capabilities, for several serialist pieces [1][2].

What has happened of late (a matter of decades) is that quotidian political squabbling has turned into a full-scale war because of the Left’s vicious and total attack on Western tradition and the very foundations of Western culture (in most cases, in profound ignorance of the depths of that culture). In turn, many on the Right have overcompensated by moving away from the  cautious, principled pragmatism of conservatism. If you want a more measured atmosphere, where exchanges of views can take place without the strident nonsense that dominates today, then the Left has to stop its total,  emotionalist, destructive, oikophobic siege on “the West”, especially as it offers no better alternatives. Nature abhors a vacuum and it will be filled with all manner of demons far exceeding the boogeymen haunting the Left’s  imagination."],"time":["2020-02-01 01:57:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Hnrobert42"],"id":[22208060],"kids":{},"parent":[22206533],"text":["This article fails to provide facts to support the use of the term hardwired."],"time":["2020-02-01 03:06:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jffhn"],"id":[22212803],"kids":{},"parent":[22206533],"text":["&gt;dismiss facts that don’t fit their worldview<p>I find this disconnect from reality especially fascinating\nin the software field, where nature&#x27;s answers are just at our fingertips, and where we just have to open an editor or launch our program to be able to verify our expectations.<p>I once told one of our architects that we were creating a lot of (Java) garbage, and he stared at me incredulously before saying: &quot;but... no, we are using factories!&quot; (the code was bloated with factories indeed, but no object was ever returned to them since noone knew when instances could be released)<p>In the less verifiable and more nebulous matters of human psyche and philosophy, all hell breaks loose, which is unfortunate since they are also the most essential.

Then, of course, people forget and don&#x27;t buy the item at all, or maybe their size is now unavailable, trends shift, etc.<p>It&#x27;s going to backlash in other ways, too: since you can now get luxury goods for far cheaper, it&#x27;s not as much a status symbol, so there&#x27;s even less reason for buying it.<p>This is also why people go nuts for limited releases, but these luxury houses prioritize growth more than a sustainable business.

Many Soviet bioweapons scientists defected to the US toward the end of the Cold War.  One of those scientists — Ken Alibekov — shared his experiences in a thrilling autobiography called Biohazard [0].  According to Ken’s claim in the book, he actually uncovered the Sverdlovsk anthrax incident through an epidemiological research project while in medical school.  While it’s likely many of the stories in Biohazard were embellished or altogether fabricated (vested interests in promoting biowarfare threats), anecdotes from US scientists working at USAMRIID at the time support many of the Soviet claims.  It’s interesting to ponder how differently the world might have turned if both sides had access to our modern understanding of genetics, precise editing tools, and inexpensive sequencing.  Biowarfare is insidious for other reasons as well: lack of damage on physical infrastructure, relatively low development costs, ability to mimic a natural pandemic, and potential for mass transmission to name a few.  And perhaps that latter one is a saving grace — the possibility of losing control over a biological weapon makes it a very risky asset indeed.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Biohazard_(book)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Biohazard_(book)<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-01 04:26:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gHosts"],"id":[22220663],"kids":{},"parent":[22207915],"text":["My brain couldn&#x27;t tell me where Sverdlovsk was.... so I look it up....<p>Then my brain went &quot;Wut!?

You could probably talk to business owners with problems, launch an (appropriately priced; hundreds to thousands of dollars per year) product against those problems, build contingent on getting 10  commits to buy, and be at +&#x2F;- $100k in 12 to 18 months. Many people with less technical and writing ability have done this in e.g. the MicroConf community. If you want the best paint-by-numbers approach to it I&#x27;ve seen, c.f. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw&amp;t=2s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw&amp;t=2s<\/a><p>(I&#x27;ll note that What Got Done is probably a viable boutique SaaS business if you somehow figured out distribution for it, at price points between $50 and $200 per month. My confidence on this approaches total. HNers skeptical because it is technically trivial should probably reflect for a moment on how much time is spent on standups at a company with 20 or 200 engineers, what one hour of their time is worth, and how likely that company is to put an engineer on this project specifically.)<p>If you run an API-based business in the future: Usage-based billing is a really tricky business model for a solo developer. Note that you can say &quot;Usage-based billing but we have a minimum commitment&quot;, and probably should prior to doing speculative integration engineering work. Your minimum commitment should be north of $1,000 per month; practically nobody can integrate with your API for cheaper than a thousand dollars of engineering time, right.<p>This also counsels aiming at problems amenable to solutions with APIs which are trivially worth $1,000++ a month to many businesses which can hire engineers. Parsing recipe ingredients seems like a very constrained problem space. Consider e.g. parsing W-2s or bank statements or similar; many more businesses naturally care about intake of those documents, getting accurate data from them, and introducing that data into a lucrative business process that they have.<p>I would encourage you, to the maximum extent compatible with your sanity, to prioritize &quot;Will this get me more customers?&quot; over behind-the-scenes investments like CI&#x2F;CD which are very appropriate to Google but will under no circumstance show up in next year&#x27;s report as One Of The Most Important Things I Did This Year.<p>For similar reasons, I would suggest devoting approximately zero cycles to cost control. You don&#x27;t have a cost problem and no amount of cost control will bend the curve of your current businesses to sustainability. You have a revenue problem. Your desired state in the medium term will make it economically irrational for you to think for more than a minute about a $50 a month SaaS expense; marketing and sales gets you to that desired state, not cost control."],"time":["2020-01-31 16:16:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rickitan"],"id":[22204564],"kids":[22205359,22207295,22206216],"parent":[22201337],"text":["I see a lot of comments criticizing your path and progress.

It might make you wish you didn&#x27;t ever realize it. So.. spoiler in the next sentence. When you start talking in your head, pay attention to your vocal cords and the area around them... Notice anything? They&#x27;re probably moving like they would if you were actually talking out loud. Have you ever noticed how you tried to talk really fast in your head but seem to always get limited and it feels weirdly physical that you can&#x27;t talk even faster? It&#x27;s because you can&#x27;t actually speak that fast in real life - thus you&#x27;re limited because your mechanisms for talking are actually moving at the rate you&#x27;re speaking - but if you can&#x27;t speak fast then you can&#x27;t think fast either really. It&#x27;s usually something you&#x27;ll casually notice but ignore... and then later you&#x27;ll really notice it every time you think.

The best example I can give is playing chess. I can play blind chess (no board or physical chess set needed). It is much faster to think visually.

Before the words form, there&#x27;s a construct - slightly out of reach, an uncontrollable yet influenceable bubbling. That voice in your head is not your brain - it&#x27;s not your thoughts, it more like a second mouth and your brain pulling the strings.<p>I presume.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not in your head, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you for sure.<p>I&#x27;ve never realised that there was this divide between people, but it actually makes a lot of sense to me. Some people have a barrier, a pre-speech-speech, other people don&#x27;t. Some have more neurons or less neurons in this half-way house. I have a vague recollection of people reporting losing their internal monologue after a lobotomy, but I may be wrong on that.<p>If I had to guess, with my programmer-with-very-little-neuro-science background, it seems like a natural way that our brains form. Sometimes all the neurons specialise for speech directly connected to your mouth, other times a cluster of neurons specialise for speech with a disconnect. I suspect like most things, it isn&#x27;t fully genetic - though it probably plays a part.<p>Personally, I find myself monologuing the first few words that I&#x27;m typing, and from then on I&#x27;m reading it off the screen. I have an idea of where I want the sentence to go, then I re-read it and decide better of it.<p>It does mean that writing emails especially, takes me an absolute age to say something remarkably simple. Speech is unaffected, though I&#x27;m never the loudest voice in the room and am particularly hesitant to butt in (and feel really bad when I try)<p>When I replay arguments with a particularly frustrating person, I often find myself quietly vocalising as the emotion rises.<p>And when I have a mental block on a word (which happened a couple of times writing this - &quot;construct&quot; is still not the right word above, but I can&#x27;t find a better one), often the voice in my head will still keep playing with words to try and prompt the rest of my brain to do its job.

Or the effect the divide has on meditation.<p>Also, possibly related, I find it very very difficult to visualise pictures in my head.

It was never in an &quot;official&quot; capacity (student at best) but this &quot;result&quot; turns out in interviews, discussions, in social sciences (cognitive psychology first of all, but certainly anthropology as well, philosophy too, it&#x27;s a cross-domain topic). You just have to listen carefully and someday you hit this weird fact.<p>It&#x27;s too long to explain here, but there&#x27;s another realization that somehow helps describing such discrepancies between human beings. The question is that of &#x27;normalcy&#x27;, versus the &#x27;abnormal&#x27;, the notion of &#x27;deviance&#x27;, which leads to &#x27;pathological&#x27;, &#x27;syndroms&#x27; and other supposedly &#x27;undesirable&#x27; mutations.<p>Well, the history of evolution itself is that, among a population of &quot;normal&quot; beings, the next stage for any species always begins with 1 mutation, 1 &quot;freak&quot; who has a new thing, and will eventually spread to the whole species if that trait is worth it for survival and better adaptation.<p>There are enough accounts of historical psychology research to affirm that biologically, cognitively, psychologically speaking, there&#x27;s virtually no difference between human beings 4,000 years ago and today; a baby from then raised now or vice versa would grow up just normal in context — we know this because every witness from the past said so, there&#x27;s a recurring chain of normalcy if you will, and reading Ancient texts yields fairly &quot;normal&quot; psychological profiles. (Also think that 1,000 years is but 30 generations or so.)<p>And yet there are tests measuring dramatically changing cognitive abilities over just a century — take attention span in the last 40 years, it&#x27;s appaling.<p>This means, IMHO, that minute change keeps occurring much more than we might suspect, continuously, but over long enough periods that human history is dwarfed by meaningful special (species) evolution. It also means that right now, a minority among us have evolved to what is the next stage for all of us, but it will only be obvious in hindsight.<p>The 18 over 91 quoted by OP has having no spoken dialectic (rather through other forms of encoding than language&#x2F;speech) may be a dying breed, an artefact from the past (the animal in us who hasn&#x27;t fully integrated speech maybe); they might as well be the future, how human brains would evolve as they adapt (&quot;beyond-speech humans&quot; in that case). Maybe the real path is people who have the ability for both, a switch.<p>A fair point was made in a previous to-level comment about the &quot;speed limit&quot; of speech, in terms of bandwidth or information density, and this is echoing how e.g. the math genius in us tends to think, when notation becomes object beyond than abstraction in and of itself and there are no words anymore but concepts, often impossible to visualize anyway (e.g. it&#x27;s not a &quot;function&quot; or &quot;f&quot; anymore, in context it&#x27;s become a &quot;...&quot; — no word but a feeling of what it <i>is<\/i> and what it <i>does<\/i> and how we could manipulate this specific thing).<p>I guess the take away is there are many discrepancies that we would never suspect had we never talked to others, and a lot of what we take for &quot;granted&quot; about human nature is typically a strong hint for something that&#x27;s very subjective. At least in perception, if not in value. And that while we are entitled to our own hierarchy of values in the present, we simply cannot possibly judge the endgame, we can&#x27;t tell today who&#x27;s embodying the shape of things to come — just that some of us are, some of us must, if we are indeed evolving."],"time":["2020-01-31 00:17:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["daedalus2027"],"id":[22198136],"kids":{},"parent":[22193451],"text":["Bicameral mind"],"time":["2020-01-31 02:33:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22198449],"kids":{},"parent":[22193451],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-31 03:30:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["budami"],"id":[22198459],"kids":{},"parent":[22193451],"text":["funny no one mentioned Broca&#x27;s area. looks like some brains under-utilize phonetic perception to boost some other hot business."],"time":["2020-01-31 03:32:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dboreham"],"id":[22198916],"kids":{},"parent":[22193451],"text":["Psychopaths?

You can set defaults for that popup according to your own preferences, for instance to block by domain name instead of hostname so that &quot;server432.example.com&quot; and &quot;server592.example.com&quot; don&#x27;t have to be managed separately.<p>When you first run Little Snitch, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming.
