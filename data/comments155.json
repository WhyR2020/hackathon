With journalling, it is very tempting to go off on a rant. Feels good at the time but its usefulness declines rapidly with time. Short notes that encompass your state of mind or emotions or feelings with some context and timestamps go up in personal value with passage of time. I keep details and rants in my separate running log files.<p>* Summarize regularly. Every once a few months when you have down time, summarize your notes and make observations. My favorite bit is to find an old note with a sidenote&#x2F;annotation and see how I look at the same things differently or still have the same mindset.<p>* Use timestamps. I have settled for a yyyymmdd-topic-title.txt for filenames. Contents in each file are stamped [yyyy-mm-dd] with optional time of the day. I have under 50 such files and they seem to encompass all facets of my life that I journal.<p>* Use plain text. Everything else will go away. I now use notational velocity&#x2F;nvAlt with simplenotes sync for my topic wise notes (I also check in these files into a separate git repo folder for backup). I keep Deep insights and running lists in that git repo&#x27;s wiki. I&#x27;ve recently also started keeping and checking in monthly yyyy-MMM.md files for a running log of thoughts. Helps maintaining a timeline to find recurring patterns. If some topic becomes worthy enough for sharing via a blog post, it gets its own markdown file that I can edit and customize for publishing.<p>* Reduce friction. I think this was the big one to overcome. By the time I would get to writing, I&#x27;d lose perspective or details to write. I now use a throwaway app (google keep) to write down my reaction, emotions or interesting facts as close to encountering them as possible.

You can do convex collision detection in O(sqrt(m)+sqrt(n)) the first time, and close to O(1) if the objects just moved a little and you have the result from the previous time. See the GJK algorithm. It&#x27;s basically hill-climbing to find the closest points.<p>The author glosses over many real-world problems. Some algorithms work badly in 32-bit floating point because they depend on small differences between large numbers. (I ran into that in the days before everybody had good 64-bit FPUs.) Convex meshes should not be triangulated, because that results in coplanar faces, and hill-climbing can get stuck on the wrong face. It&#x27;s necessary to clean up convex objects a bit - require a minimum break angle of one or two degrees at each edge to make sure that they&#x27;re strictly convex, not just non-concave. The author writes &quot;One important class of objects are convex polytopes, which have the property that between any pair of points in the shape the straight line segment connecting them is also contained in the shape.&quot; That&#x27;s a necessary property, but not a sufficient one; it allows coplanar faces.<p>Broad phase collision detection usually involves three lists of the bounding boxes of the objects, ordered by X, Y, and Z. Only if there&#x27;s overlap in all three axes do you need to do the narrow-phase test.  The author writes &quot;Using output sensitive analysis, there is also a lower bound of O(n log(n) + k) (for comparison based algorithms) by reduction to the element uniqueness problem.&quot; That&#x27;s also the lower bound for sorting by comparison, of course. But that&#x27;s a price you only pay at cold start, when you initially sort all your objects. Thereafter, you update the ordered lists as the objects move, which, if most things are not moving at high speed, is cheap.<p>Large-area collision detection, for big MMOs, has an even coarser phase of binning by large areas. Just divide the world into squares and only look at your square and the neighboring squares. This parallelizes nicely."],"time":["2020-03-03 09:38:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aliswe"],"id":[22472703],"kids":[22473566],"parent":[22470629],"text":["Actually a collision is an overlap with only one initial event.

That is an object collides initially but will perhaps continue to overlap the other object.<p>In 2D games programming, at least in the old days, the detection effectively consisted of detecting whether NOT two objects were overlapping.<p>Consider this pseudocode formula:<p><pre><code>    function isOverlapping(a, b){\n      return a.x &lt; b.x + b.w &#x2F;&#x2F; a&#x27;s left is to the left of b&#x27;s right\n        &amp;&amp; &#x2F;&#x2F; And\n        a.x + a.w &gt; b.x &#x2F;&#x2F; a&#x27;s right is to the right of b&#x27;s left\n<\/code><\/pre>\n...

This is tricky, because in my experience most children books are not great.  The biggest problem is usually the lack of a story.  Many books are supposedly educational or teach kids good values, but they are poor at story telling.  If there is no good story, kids are not interested.  Many books also don&#x27;t have a good balance between text and pictures.  Too little text and there&#x27;s not much for you to read, they&#x27;ll flip through the book in seconds.

As a kid my parents were far from rich, so i didn&#x27;t have a lot of toys and the one i had were often handed down to me.<p>On my Do-list:<p>- overwhelm my kids with all toys appropriate for the age (+1 year) but supervise him when playing with them. I keep giving him things until we don&#x27;t have any more room for toys and then force him to pick out stuff he no longer want, which we give to less fortunate kids. Teaching him empathy at a early stage seems appropriate to me.<p>- Teach him that everything can be modified. I bought him a ride-on car that we progressively have modified with proper tires, disc-brakes, carbon fiber spoilers and details, wrapping. He loves his car, and have developed a love for vehicles. He can now name most common and some exclusive cars as we walk down the streets. He can also spot the difference between steel, aluminum, brass and his interest in powertools have caused me to buy kid versions of many of the tools we commonly use when we rebuild his car.<p>- I got him Duplo that he loves (trains, cars and generic blocks). People will downvote me for this but I reached out on facebook for Lego a month ago and we received a lot. I&#x27;ve explained that if i ever see a piece in or near his mouth i suspend his right to play with it for the duration of the weekend, and since he is with me only on the weekend i keep an eye on him every second. So far, so good. At this point he is building and adding to stuff we build together and i see clear improvements in his ability to place even the smaller parts every week. Initially he kept asking me to put pieces together as soon as it didn&#x27;t work the first time but now he tries 6-7 times before i have to pry it out of his hands to do it for him :)<p>- i tried to explain our solarsystem and he is showing extreme interest in videos about space, rockets, moon&#x2F;space walks so it&#x27;s become a small tradition that i replay SpaceX latest achievements and failures when there is any news.<p>- I have avoided only selecting toys&#x2F;areas of interest&#x2F;gender-based toys and try to give him everything from musical instruments, balls, frisbees, toy-kitchen, dolls. Whatever he chooses to play with and show interest in, he gets to do.<p>- music-wise i expose him to everything from classical music, rock, hiphop, children music to break-core and classic EBM&#x2F;EDM. Lucky for me he sidetracked into EDM, so to sponsor this interest in dance music i got some vintage synths, sequencers and drum-machines he loves to play with next to his acoustic instruments.<p>My Don&#x27;t-list is short and basically just contains stuff i don&#x27;t want him to see when he has screen-time:<p>- i try to avoid the most brain-dead stuff, like repetitive viewing of the same videos. Videos about counting and colors are all good stuff but at the point when he knows it, it makes little sense to show it to him again, and i try to find interesting videos that drives a conversation about what we are watching, as we are watching. I avoid endless playlists and allow him to tell me what he wants to see, as i help him search for appropriate videos."],"time":["2020-03-04 13:00:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["typescriptfan1"],"id":[22478931],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Rokenbok"],"time":["2020-03-03 22:36:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["D13Fd"],"id":[22474487],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["I have 1, 3, and 4 year olds. The best directly STEM-related activity we&#x27;ve done so far is a soap making &quot;science experiment&quot; kit. The 3 and 4 year olds absolutely loved it.<p>It was super simple. The kit comes with soap cubes, dyes, fragrances, and glitter. You follow the instructions to melt the cubes, add the dyes and fragrances, pour them into a mold, then let it set. Then you&#x27;ve got a bar of soap.<p>I was surprised at just how many useful things they got out of it:<p>- Basic lab safety: Wearing gloves, goggles (if you have a set that fit), wafting to smell the fragrances, staying away from a heat source (the stove), etc.<p>- Basic mechanical skills and techniques: using a scale to measure the ingredients, using using a butter knife to cut the soap, double boiling, using graduated pipettes to measure the colors and fragrances<p>- Understanding of colors: The kit comes with a chart about how to mix the dyes to get different colors. The kids got excited to try out different combinations. If you have a mixing palette they can try out different things.<p>- Phase transitions and heat: You can explain how heat and phase transitions work when the soap melts. Plus they love to watch it melt (safely, using goggles and staying away from the heat). I encouraged them try different things to make the soap bars solidify faster - a small electric fan, putting it in the freezer (very carefully), etc.<p>All told it was super rewarding for me and they really enjoyed and got excited by it. They are still using the soap bars and asking to do it again weeks later. I&#x27;m sure my little discussions about things like heat and phase transitions won&#x27;t stick, but I&#x27;m hoping if we do it a few times having the terms and techniques bouncing around in their heads may help them a bit in the future.<p>The 4 year old got the most out of it, but the 3 year old was right there with her in the mix. The 3 year old couldn&#x27;t handle things like reading the scale and pipettes, but I felt like she still got a lot out of it.<p>Other recommendations:<p>- Marble games and legos. Get sets with directions and encourage them to follow the directions. My 4 year old can now build pretty complex marble games and lego sets by carefully following the directions. She started when she was about 3.5 yrs old. Personally I think they get more out of the small legos (not duplos) once they hit about 3 and aren&#x27;t going to just eat them.<p>- I agree with the magnet tiles, those are nice.<p>- They never seem to get much out of puzzles. They require too much self-direction, it&#x27;s too easy to fail, and they just don&#x27;t hold their interest. Maybe when they are older.<p>- Hydroponics kits like AeroGarden. Make them do all the work (plug it in, add water, add plant food, add seed pods). Explain what&#x27;s going on. My 3-4 yr olds got very excited to watch the plants grow day-by-day and enjoyed adding water&#x2F;plant food when needed. I would use an aerogarden type thing because at this age failure = no interest, and you basically can&#x27;t screw up an aerogarden absent adding too much plant food."],"time":["2020-03-03 15:05:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gameswithgo"],"id":[22474057],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["lego"],"time":["2020-03-03 13:59:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tomerbd"],"id":[22473863],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Cat."],"time":["2020-03-03 13:27:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["abraCadabstrax"],"id":[22473787],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Lego."],"time":["2020-03-03 13:18:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryanmercer"],"id":[22474120],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Lincoln Logs and Duplo."],"time":["2020-03-03 14:09:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cvaidya1986"],"id":[22474915],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Macbook and XCode."],"time":["2020-03-03 15:59:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["deepakhj"],"id":[22476543],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Nintendo switch"],"time":["2020-03-03 18:21:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["textread"],"id":[22481769],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["Clay modeling"],"time":["2020-03-04 08:05:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dwnvoted2hell"],"id":[22478324],"kids":{},"parent":[22473578],"text":["I think this is really an impossible question to answer.

It will take a while before the virus really spreads in the US&#x2F;Europe but it seems pretty clear that it&#x27;s not contained anymore. Remarks about the fatality rate cut both ways: if it&#x27;s lower than reported it means that the virus is spreading faster than we think (more mild cases), if it&#x27;s higher than reported there are going to be many more fatalities still. There are arguments to be made for both (lower: many mild cases go undetected, higher: reported fatality rates often seem to be calculated from active cases, not complete cases).

Much worse, data is likely to reflect human biases, conscious and unconscious both. Racist or sexist data lead to racist or sexist algorithms.<p>- Algorithms in the space are highly susceptible to learn stereotypes (even from apparently-unbiased data). We can expect tons of noise in most features of an applicant, while more reliable signal would come from very generic features like what college someone attended or other factors closely tied to race or socioeconomic background.<p>- Feedback loops can be a problem if the algorithm is fed data that is produced by the algorithm.

They also likely can’t furnish any signed documentation of credit pending payment unless you signed up for margin trading.<p>&gt; If the funds haven’t been deducted from your bank account or are in a pending state, you may also be able to just issue a stop payment.

More of a surprise, and this is something we still don’t understand, is how little virus there was in the much broader community. Everywhere we went, we tried to find and understand how many tests had been done, how many people were tested, and who were they.<p>&gt; In Guangdong province, for example, there were 320,000 tests done in people coming to fever clinics, outpatient clinics. And at the peak of the outbreak, 0.47 percent of those tests were positive. People keep saying [the cases are the] tip of the iceberg. But we couldn’t find that. We found there’s a lot of people who are cases, a lot of close contacts — but not a lot of asymptomatic circulation of this virus in the bigger population. And that’s different from flu. In flu, you’ll find this virus right through the child population, right through blood samples of 20 to 40 percent of the population.<p>&gt; Julia Belluz: If you didn’t find the “iceberg” of mild cases in China, what does it say about how deadly the virus is — the case fatality rate?<p>&gt; Bruce Aylward: It says you’re probably not way off. The average case fatality rate is 3.8 percent in China, but a lot of that is driven by the early epidemic in Wuhan where numbers were higher. ... This suggests the Chinese are really good at keeping people alive with this disease, and just because it’s 1 percent in the general population outside of Wuhan doesn’t mean it [will be the same in other countries].<\/i><p>I find Aylward&#x27;s arguments cogent and backed with evidence from the ground.

Also, just the idea that there would be 40+ qualified prospects to begin with.<p>My feeling is that a pretty big chunk of YC companies get a whole stream of invitations to corpdev meetings equivalent to the ones Hunt went through here. And that a big part of YC&#x27;s founder education is convincing founders <i>never to go to these meetings<\/i>, because they&#x27;re so unlikely to have good outcomes, and because the counterparties in those meetings are basically trained and selected to efficiently screw founders over. Here, it seems like Hunt paid for the privilege of experiencing this.<p>Then there&#x27;s the deck itself; the one detailed slide of which we get to see is an exquisitely detailed rationale for why Hunt&#x27;s presence is vital for the continued success of HIBP. &quot;This is what the organisations bidding on HIBP were buying: trust in me.&quot; That&#x27;s a description of a job interview, not a company sale.
