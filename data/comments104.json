In all fairness, though, HMM-based frameworks like Kaldi are notoriously complex and take significant effort to wrap your head around.

I tried it and discarded the whole work. If you find 20 rings, you can assume that the fish would have 10 years (one opaque ring in summer and other hyaline ring for winter), but unfortunately there are also bifurcated rings, disease&#x27;s rings, fused and duplicated rings so your animal could have several false duplicated rings, and have only 7 years. In 200 thin rings your error can be awful.<p>To know the sex of the animals is also important, because females will produce extra hyaline spawn rings starting somewhere in their adult phase. And males... well, nobody nows. They obviously do not get pregnant but do the male whale sharks fight and stop eating?. Not to mention than some fishes can change its sex perfectly.<p>This with bony fishes, that have true bones. Big sharks are cartilaginous fishes. Cartilaginous tissue dyes badly and rings in its vertebra are less clearly marked. This animals migrate (vertically and horizontally). This means that would probably starve for long periods and then feast and that their vertebras would be subject to a wide range of pressure that could erase rings.<p>&gt; So any animal that was alive then incorporated that spike in Carbon-14 into their hard parts<p>The key of the phrase is <i>hard<\/i> parts.

The only hard part in whale sharks is the tooth (1-5 milimeters long if I remember correctly). Those teeth are lost and replaced continuously so can&#x27;t be used to age the animal. Even more, they are releasing carbon-14 at a unknown rate.

Therefore, they have experimented with existing drugs, developed for other diseases.<p>Most commonly mentioned is the malaria drug chloroquine. A smaller French study that has shown positive results has spread like wildfire on social media and among others Donald Trump has declared that &quot;Chloroquine will change the history of medicine&quot;.<p>Swedish doctors also began to give malaria medication to severely ill patients, despite the lack of controlled studies.\nANNONS<p>- We did like everyone else and gave chloroquine to the patients in the beginning. There were test tube studies that showed that it had an effect on coronavirus and it was a drug we knew from the treatment of malaria, says Magnus Gisslén, professor and chief physician at the infection clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital &#x2F; Östra.<p>But now he has made a complete reversal. Last week, all treatment with chloroquine was stopped against covid-19 in Sahlgrenska.<p>- There were reports of suspected more serious side effects than we first thought. We cannot rule out serious side effects, especially from the heart, and it is a hard-dosed drug. In addition, we have no strong evidence that chloroquine has an effect on covid-19.<p>The fact that some seriously ill covid-19 patients have acute heart problems has raised concerns that chloroquine may be harmful to some patients.<p>Have you had cases with severe side effects?<p>- Not as I know in Gothenburg, but suspected cases from other clinics have been reported.\nThe hospitals in Stockholm continue to provide chloroquine<p>The risk of serious side effects, combined with the fact that there is still no evidence, ie controlled studies that show that the medicine is effective, is the basis for the decision. The French study that has become so mentioned does not give much to Gisslén.<p>- It does not meet any requirements that we place on how a study should be done. It has very low evidence value.<p>All hospitals in the Västra Götaland region follow Sahlgrenska&#x27;s example. But they are still quite lonely so far. Chloroquine is still given at the major hospitals in Stockholm.<p>How do you see that you receive different care in different places in Sweden?<p>- We are receiving signals that several regions are about to stop giving chloroquine. I am very confident in what I have come up with and think that is how you should handle it. We cannot do experimental medicine. At least we need to know that we do no harm.<p>Several major studies in the world have been initiated on drugs that may help covid-19 patients. Magnus Gisslén believes that the first answers may come within a month.<p>- If it then turns out that chloroquine is good, then of course we should use it. But before that, we will not risk patients&#x27; health by giving it.<p>READ MORE: Rumor or facts about the new corona virus\nPoison Information Center: Very unpleasant side effects<p>Anna Myrnäs, chief medical officer at the Poison Information Center, has seen an increase in the number of questions from the health service regarding serious side effects of chloroquine.<p>&quot;The risk we see from our side is that it is a preparation that has very unpleasant side effects, including sudden cardiac death,&quot; she says.<p>She confirms that there are signs that covid-19 patients have been harmed by the drug.<p>- We do not think that everyone who now prescribes this in the intensive care units is fully aware of how severe the side effects can be, especially in already seriously ill patients.<p>At Sahlgrenska, patients currently receive classic IVA treatment with oxygen, but no antiviral drugs.<p>- We might have made another assessment if covid-19 was a disease with very high mortality, for example 80 per cent dead, but now we can manage most people who are intensive care anyway, says Magnus Gisslén.<p>He is self-critical that he let himself be drawn into the chloroquine.<p>- In retrospect, I can regret that we did. We were a bit naive and thought the side effect profile was much nicer. I have changed my mind and hope that the rest of the country does too.<p>In Stockholm, the Södersjukhuset has also stopped giving chloroquine, this confirms chief physician Anders Håkansson in an e-mail:<p>&quot;It depends on the combination of factors:<p>1. We have not seen any obvious positive clinical effects.<p>2. Potential risk of side effects.<p>3.

This is not ARDS in the early phase of the illness.<p>- Avoid spontaneous ventilation early in ICU admission as also may be harmful.<p>- There is clear microvascular thrombosis happening in the pulmonary circulation, which leads to an increased dead space.<p>- Also some evidence of early pulmonary fibrosis reported from Italy, possibly oxygen related, possibly inflammation related.<p>- Not many patients have reached extubation yet in London, re-intubation seems to be common. I highlighted our experiences of airway swelling &#x2F; stridor &#x2F; reintubation.<p>- Brompton are seeing wedge infarcts in the lungs on imaging, along with pulmonary thrombosis without DVT.<p>- Proning is essential and should be done early. Don’t just do it once. Threshold for many centres is a PF ratio of 13, but all agreed, do it even earlier.<p>- Early on in the disease, the benefit of proning lasts &lt; 4 hours when turned back to supine, as the disease progresses into a more ARDS type picture, the effect is more long lasting.<p>- Many centres using inhaled nitric oxide and prostacyclin with good effect. Tachyphylaxis with NO after 4-5 days.<p>- Generally people are using humidified circuits with HMEs.<p>-  A very interesting thing they are doing at Georges is cohorting by phase of disease i.e. early, late, extubation &#x2F; trachy. It involves more moving of patients but helps each team to focus on things more easily.<p>- Leak test before extubation is crucial, others are also seeing airway swelling.<p>- Wait longer than usual before extubating, high reintubation rates reported.

With the coronavirus, most jobs were frozen into place with a government unemployment plan (ERTE).<p>This administrative tool existed before where the company could put your job on pause for a specified amount of time. This way you get full unemployment benefits from the government, and after said period finishes you keep your job as it was before. In practice it is commonly used to try different jobs meanwhile or to take some time off after working for a while in a company.<p>So in the current covid-19 situation, the government has mandated that most (all?) of the people who cannot work during this time to be on this program. They have also frozen mortgages and rent payments. This is amazing for the society at large, since it means most people will be able to not go bankrupt during this time. The two big worries right now are what will happen to the companies (and those frozen jobs) and where will the govt get the money if the situation gets too long.<p>So a basic income program would not be <i>such<\/i> a large change here as it would be e.g. in the US.

So many syntheses have horrible yields just like this one.  You’d start with grams of material to end up with micrograms.  I loved solving these problems as an undergrad in books, but reality was far different.  You don’t think much about side products until you start doing novel chemistry.<p>2). So much trial and error.  There were happy go lucky chemists that fell into projects that were smooth as butter, while brilliant chemists would toil 12 hour days to try and something to write up as a thesis.  I was neither brilliant nor lucky and took 4 different projects over two years before finally landing on something marginally MS worthy.  They need a journal of failed chemistry because only the working stuff gets published.  So many failures could be logged so I didn’t waste my time doing non-working or poor yielding reactions.<p>3). Suspicious results in journals.  I would read about a reaction and someone would put a 75% yield as their result and I could barely get 20.  I always thought I was just bad, but a really smart chemist challenged me one day and tried to do it himself and couldn’t do much better.  He tried it 30 different ways over the year as he did other stuff.  He never could get a good yield.  We talked to our advisor and we wanted to challenge the result, but the advisor didn’t want to start trouble.  It was past the time I decided to leave with a masters, but made me feel a little better about my lousy abilities.

As an example, this doesn&#x27;t happen to be in the shell.  I&#x27;ll happily take any textual output I&#x27;m given and process it through one or more tools to manipulate it, or if it comes to it, write a Perl one liner (or even convert that to a small Perl program with better syntax if it gets more complex) to manipulate and massage data, even if the purpose it to throw it back into the same program.<p>That may or may not be the most efficient way to tackle the problem, but it&#x27;s a known solution, as opposed to not only not knowing how to to it in the tool I was using initially, but not knowing how to efficiently determine <i>if it can even be done in that tool<\/i>.<p>In this case, he&#x27;s using pen and paper.

Spending 4 years, full time from what it seems, on a book with a (let&#x27;s face it) niche audience. While having (again, it seems from the post) a family with children, living in a first world country, flying regularly (I&#x27;m using this as a shortcut for &#x27;getting out of the house for things more expensive than a hike in the woods&#x27;). So that&#x27;s an opportunity cost of 200k for a book that would a runaway success if it made... 50k over its lifetime?
