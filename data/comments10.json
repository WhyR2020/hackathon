Ultimately I believe the outcome of this case will depend on two questions:<p>1. Can Epic establish that iOS app distribution is in fact a valid antitrust market that Apple has monopoly control over?<p>Epic argues that Apple is abusing its &quot;monopoly&quot; over the iOS app distribution market. However, in an antitrust case you cannot simply declare an arbitrarily narrow market where the defendant is the only participant and expect the court to accept it. iOS app distribution is an &quot;aftermarket&quot; of the smartphone market, and as a general rule, US courts do not permit antitrust markets to be based on a single brand&#x27;s product unless specific exceptions are met.<p><i>&gt; &quot;In general, a manufacturer&#x27;s own products do not themselves comprise a relevant product market..... [A] company does not violate the Sherman Act by virtue of the natural monopoly it holds over its own product.&quot; Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i><p>The circumstances in which the courts have allowed a single brand&#x27;s product to be treated as a valid antitrust market have usually involved situations where the customer purchased a product <i>not knowing<\/i> they would be locked into some aftermarket restriction, for example due to a change in contract or company policy. If, on the other hand, customers knew about the restriction ahead of time, could have purchased an alternative product without restrictions, and went ahead and purchased anyway, the market power deriving from that restriction is generally not considered a valid basis for an antitrust claim.<p>Of particular note is that courts routinely reject market definitions based on restrictions stipulated in EULAs that customers voluntarily agreed to when purchasing the original product. For example, in <i>Blizzard Entertainment Inc. v. Ceiling Fan Software LLC<\/i>, the court rejected the defendant&#x27;s claim that Blizzard held monopoly power in the &quot;WoW add-on software&quot; aftermarket, because WoW customers explicitly agreed to WoW&#x27;s EULA stipulating they would only used Blizzard authorized WoW add-ons when they purchased the game. Similarly, in <i>Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i>, the court rejected Psystar&#x27;s claim that Apple held monopoly power in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket because customers <i>&quot;knowingly agreed to the challenged restraint&quot;<\/i> when they purchaed Mac OS.<p>Interestingly enough, I double checked and surprisingly the iPhone EULA does not appear to have language restricting app installation to the &quot;App Store and other authorized sources only&quot;. If it did, I believe Epic would have trouble getting past here. However, even in absence of an explicit contractual restriction, the court permits an analysis of <i>&quot;whether a consumer&#x27;s selection of a particular brand in the competitive market is the functional equivalent of a contractual commitment&quot;<\/i>. This analysis is explained in <i>Newcal Industries, Inc. v. IKON Office Solution<\/i> which describes four relevant aspects to consider:<p>a) The existence of two separate but related markets. Epic alleges these are &quot;smartphone OSes&quot; and &quot;app distribution&quot;. It&#x27;s not clear to me whether these two markets need to be economically distinct (more on the meaning of this below), but it could be problematic for Epic if they do.<p>b) The allegations of illegal monopolization relate only to the aftermarket. (This is a given.)<p>c) Whether the source of the company&#x27;s market power is based on contractual provisions obtained in the initial market or based on the company&#x27;s relationship with its customers. Epic argues that in the absence of a EULA there is no contractual relationship, while Apple will presumably argue that there is a quasi-contractual agreement in place because they made the app installation policy very clear at the launch of the App Store and it has never changed.<p>d) Whether market imperfections prevent customers from realizing their choice in the initial market will impact their freedom to shop in the aftermarket. In other words, did customers <i>&quot;make a knowing choice to restrict their aftermarket options&quot;<\/i> when they decided to buy an iPhone instead of a different phone that allowed side-loading?<p>I think Epic is going to have a particularly tough time establishing (c) and (d). If the court concludes that customers purchased iPhones knowing that they would be restricted to installing apps from the App Store, then Apple&#x27;s &quot;monopoly&quot; over iOS app distribution is based on the customer&#x27;s knowing consent, and therefore will not be a valid basis for an antitrust claim.<p>We&#x27;ll see what the court decides. But in any event, even if Epic succeeds in proving that Apple has a monopoly over iOS app distribution, the job is not done. They then need to prove that Apple used that monopoly to illegally restrain competition in another market, which brings us to question 2.<p>2. Can Epic establish that iOS app payment processing is a separate and distinct product from iOS app distribution?<p>In order to prove Apple illegally tied app distribution and payment processing together, Epic will need to show that the two are actually economically distinct products.<p><i>&gt; &quot;[T]here must be a coherent economic basis for treating the tying and tied products as distinct. All but the simplest products can be broken down into two or more components that are &quot;tied together&quot; in the final sale. Unless it is to be illegal to sell cars with engines or cameras with lenses, this analysis must be guided by some limiting principle. For products to be treated as distinct, the tied product must, at a minimum, be one that some consumers might wish to purchase separately without also purchasing the tying product. When the tied product has no use other than in conjunction with the tying product, a seller of the tying product can acquire no additional market power by selling the two products together.&quot; Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde<\/i><p>In <i>Jefferson Parish<\/i>, the Supreme Court ruled anesthesiological services were <i>not<\/i> economically distinct from hospital services because anesthesiological services were always sold in conjunction with other hospital services, and therefore tying the two together was not illegal. In <i>Rick-Mik Enterprises, Inc. v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC<\/i>, credit card processing was considered an essential component of a gas station franchise and therefore was not economically distinct from the sale of the franchise itself. The legal test for whether two tied products are economically distinct has historically depended on whether consumer demand exists for the tied product separate from the tying product, but it&#x27;s not clear whether that test is appropriate here.<p>For the case of paid apps, there clearly <i>aren&#x27;t<\/i> economically distinct products. If Apple distributes a paid app on behalf of a developer and collects a fee in exchange, the fee is the cost of using Apple&#x27;s distribution service. Distribution and payment happen simultaneously, they are not separate services, therefore there is no tie between them.<p>Now, what happens if Apple initially distributes the app without a fee and (later) takes a fee when an in-app purchase is made? Does the act of deferring the payment from the download create two economically distinct products when before there was only one? Apple argues that it does not, and similar to <i>Rick-Mik<\/i>, in-app payment processing is simply a component of its app distribution service.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this argument will hold up in court but it&#x27;s certainly very interesting and probably venturing into uncharted territory as far as existing precedent is concerned. But if the court does decide that in-app payment processing services are not economically distinct from app distribution services, then Epic is going to have difficulties with their tying claim.<p>Overall these are very tough questions and as the judge said, it&#x27;s not a slam dunk for either side. I tend to think Epic is fighting the uphill battle here, as existing US antitrust law seems like it favors the defendant in cases like this. If Epic does win, it&#x27;s certainly going to open up a lot of similar questions for other companies that sell tightly controlled hardware and software.

I doubt this time will be different, though the brief renaissance will doubtless be appreciated.<p>Charles Perrow wrote of this in the mid-1980s:<p><i>After the critical period from about 1956 to 1960, when tastes were unfrozen, competition was intense, and demand soared, consolidation appeared. The number of firms stabilized at about forty. New corporate entries appeared, such as MGM and Warner Brothers, sensing, one supposes, the opportunity that vastly expanding sales indicated. Some independents grew large. The eight-firm concentration ratio also stabilized (though not yet the four-firm ratio). The market became sluggish, however, as the early stars died, were forced into retirement because of legal problems, or in the notable case of Elvis Presley, were drafted by an impinging environment. Near the end of this period the majors decided that the new sounds were not a fad and began to buy up the contracts of established artists and successfully picked and promoted new ones, notably The Beach Boys and Bob Dylan. A new generation (e.g., The Beatles) appeared from 1964 to 1969, and sales again soared.<\/i><p><i>But now the concentration ratios soared also. From 1962 to 1973, the four-firm ratio went from 25 to 51 percent; the eight-firm ratio from 46 to 81 percent, almost back to the pre-1955 levels. The number of different firms having hits declined from forty-six to only sixteen. Six of the eight giants were diversified conglomerates, some of which led in the earlier period; one was a new independent, the other a product of of mergers.<\/i><p><i>How did they do it? The major companies asserted “increasing central control over the creative process”[352] through deliberate creation and extensive promotion of new groups, long-range contracts for groups, and reduced autonomy for producers. In addition, legal and illegal promotion costs (drug payola to disc jockeys, for example) rose in the competitive race and now exceeded the resources of small independents. Finally, the majors “have also moved to regain a controlling position in record distribution by buying chains of retail stores.”[353] The diversity is still greater than it had been in the past, and may remain high, but it is ominous that the majors have all the segments covered. As an executive said, “Columbia Records will have a major entry into whatever new area is broached by the vagaries of public tastes.” But for a concentrated industry, the “vagaries of public tastes” are not economical; it is preferable to stabilize and consolidate them. This would be possible through further control over the creative process and marketing.<\/i><p>Charles Perrow, <i>Complex organizations : a critical essay,<\/i> 1972, 1985. pp. 186--187.<p>The dynamics, actors, and economics remind me strongly of the software &#x2F; high-tech industry, though with much weaker coupling  and different lock-in mechanics."],"time":["2020-09-08 09:17:07"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["vmception"],"id":[24404755],"kids":{},"parent":[24396681],"text":["Perfect"],"time":["2020-09-08 04:37:24"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["gregjw"],"id":[24406229],"kids":{},"parent":[24396681],"text":["Betteridge&#x27;s law of Hacker News headlines"],"time":["2020-09-08 10:08:40"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["charliebrownau"],"id":[24406355],"kids":{},"parent":[24396681],"text":["Mainstream killed itself<p>Let the American&#x2F;Western top 40 die ,<p>the same with TV , News, Movies, Comics and scifi"],"time":["2020-09-08 10:28:14"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["peter_l_downs"],"id":[24404221],"kids":[24404229,24404430,24404286],"parent":[24396681],"text":["No (Betteridge&#x27;s law)"],"time":["2020-09-08 02:53:50"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["roughly"],"id":[24412109],"kids":[24414305,24415143,24414678],"parent":[24408077],"text":["The amount of computational power in biological systems is simply staggering.<p>In extremely simple organisms like roundworms, there are on the order of hundreds of neurons; for most insects you&#x27;re in the 10k-1M range.<p>A honeybee contains one million neurons, which are computational devices that we have a hard time fully and accurately mapping, and something like a billion connections between them.<p>Each of those neurons contains the entire genome for that honeybee, around 250 million base pairs.

Also, don’t allow leaves etc to gather under porches, gutters. Make sure vents are well screened.<p>The forest becomes more wilderness but we’ve been doing a bunch there as well: limbing trees up to reduce the risk of “ladder fires”, getting rid of brush, cleaning up old access trails in case a fire crew needs to come through.<p>Fires are pretty awesome events — experiencing them first-hand gives you a sense of scale that’s impossible to convey through pictures alone.

The vaccine might have a small likelihood of triggering reactions or otherwise having adverse effects, and spread over the entire population these edge cases can add up to do more damage than the disease itself.<p>Again, that is for typical vaccine situations.  A pandemic is totally different--the number of cases is exponentially increasing and ripping through the entire population.  So our options are:<p>1. Wait the additional 6-12 months it would take (even accounting for the immense investments that have been made) to get a vaccine to go through all the normal regulatory hoops we would demand of vaccine development outside of a pandemic. During which time COVID-19 rips through the population leaving potentially millions dead and hundreds of millions of recovered with disease-related tissue damage.<p>2. Wait, but stay in lockdown to keep the disease at bay, but in the process massively drive up suicide, domestic violence, and divorce rates, wreck the economy, and force people to spend their savings and&#x2F;or trigger massive inflation through pandemic relief.<p>3. Some horrible compromise between the above two extremes.<p>4. Roll out the vaccines as quickly as they can be manufactured, starting now. Don&#x27;t wait for Phase III results.<p>The Phase I and Phase II trials tell us that the vaccine successfully generates antibodies.  The group sizes so far have been large enough to know that the risk of fatal interactions is less than the risk of dying from COVID-19 itself--indeed, for the most part there haven&#x27;t been ANY severe reactions, at least in the major vaccines.<p>This &quot;wait until the vaccine is proven safe!&quot; is politically generated nonsense. There is no data-driven argument supporting it.  Ideologues on the left assume that Trump wants a vaccine ASAP to win reelection, don&#x27;t trust is understanding of the science, and therefore assume that early administration of a vaccine would be some sort of unsafe political compromise.  Ideologues on the right believe COVID-19 is a hoax anyway.

Various administrations have touted these investments as a solution to the city&#x27;s high crime levels, notoriously poor performance of APD (in terms of both crime reduction and compliance with a Department of Justice consent decree), and chronic understaffing of many area police organizations but especially APD.<p>There has, of course, been no real evidence of success. A promising change in local crime trends seems to be more a result of significant reform of the DA&#x27;s office than anything APD has done. APD&#x27;s main contribution to the effort has been harassing anyone who happens to be near downtown at night, including people who live and work there. That and shooting someone on occasion.<p>What is perhaps most surprising about these programs is how little attention they have received from the public. While APD&#x27;s abuse of force and corruption problems are widely known and one of the area&#x27;s foremost political issues, there is almost no discussion of APD&#x27;s mass surveillance programs even among police abolition groups. It seems to reflect the general trend that mass surveillance is a much great topic of discussion in the tech community than outside of it.<p>All that said, my real comment is that this program seems unsurprising and of little import compared to the real-time crime center, its privacy implications, and ongoing internal problems including chronic high turnover and sudden dismissals (which tends to suggest problems that were not publicized), hiring a director with a history of internal affairs problems, etc. And then even that seems like a small matter in the context that APD has been under a department of justice consent decree resulting from a pattern of excessive force for six years now and has only just in the last few months finished making the policy changes required by DoJ, with the independent monitor reporting that compliance with those new policies is extremely poor.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just hard to get too fired up about APD being run by major retailers when it&#x27;s been clear for years that APD does not answer to the people, the city government, or the federal government. Being in the pocket of Target is downright wholesome compared to what we expect from APD.<p>Look on the bright side: APD has it together compared to BCSO. Sheriff Gonzales resisted implementation of body cameras for years until the state legislature took the matter into their own hands and mandated cameras for all law enforcement agencies. After a series of gaffs including Sheriff Gonzales announcing that he thought officers owning smart phones was sufficient to meet the mandate, the media has enjoyed discussing what will happen when they blow through the deadline and BCSO no longer meets statutory requirements to exercise law enforcement authority."],"time":["2020-09-08 06:49:52"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["rshnotsecure"],"id":[24407199],"kids":[24408238],"parent":[24402937],"text":["The City of Albuquerque&#x27;s site was maintained by Netsential, who in turn used &quot;Data Foundry&quot; in central Texas as their colo &#x2F; cloud provider.<p>It appears that the specific colo being used was also a major NSA bulk intel collection point.

In the aughts, a number of startups tried to take on that space (notably Odeo, which incubated and then pivoted into Twitter) and all of them failed. Apple has been largely an absentee steward, which has worked out well for podcasting. It wasn’t until Google decided to take podcasts seriously about five years ago and launched its own podcast directory. Spotify’s podcast directory started about five years ago too, though took longer to build momentum.<p>All three are largely copies of one another — although Spotify has exclusives in its directory that can only be played in its app — and most major podcasts choose to submit their RSS feed to those directories, with some also choosing to share with other services (Stitcher, Luminary, etc.) that can do some fucked up stuff with the audio. It’s all a game of reach for a podcast publisher, unless you choose you don’t want Luminary or Stitcher to insert their own ads into your content — or you have an exclusive with some service or another.<p>So now there is ostensibly yet another podcast directory, except it can’t offer a good value prop for existing except that it is “open” — which sounds good if you’re Alex Jones or you make content that has been kicked out of the other directories — but will realistically impact only a small number of podcasters.<p>The target audience, I assume is podcatching apps. Right now, most of them scrape the Apple or Google podcasts directory to save the insanity of trying to maintain their own directory.<p>So what value is there for this “open” directory to someone who has a podcatching app? Well, nothing unless there is a critical mass of podcasts submitted. Moreover, the service says it’s free, but is also asking for donations, which makes me worry about the viability of the index longterm. Given how difficult the market is for creating a third-party podcasting client when Google, Apple, and Spotify exist with their own apps and established indies (Overcast), I would strongly discourage anyone from building their own podcatcher as anything more than a hobby project.<p>So what’s the point? Podcasters will still have to submit to the major indexes anyway and podcatchers or client apps already have enough problems without having to worry about a little-used alternative that doesn’t have a business plan associated with it.<p>I’m all for open and I’m not mad this exists — but I certainly wouldn’t build my app off its API."],"time":["2020-09-08 15:28:06"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["css"],"id":[24407956],"kids":[24408177],"parent":[24407674],"text":["I wonder how The Podcast Index will handle fraud.

No - given my age, I was thinking about single-programming doing code and graphics and sounds on a C64 kind of games. To me, it was incomprehensible how one person alone could manage to do a machine, especially with the hardware limitations, do all <i>that<\/i>.<p>And then one day it struck me.

But then one day, a freshman asked me a question about a programming assignment in their class, and it was completely trivial to me. Yet, when I was a freshman, I would have probably asked the same question to someone else.<p>And yet, that was not my aha moment. It still took many years for me to realize that my idolization of game programmers was perhaps a bit much. Mind you, I do realize of course that someone specialized in <i>any<\/i> area will be able to produce better code than someone who&#x27;s not - for any definition of &quot;better&quot;. I&#x27;m still not a game programmer and never will be, so I still have the highest respect for their profession.

That programming and making stuff people want are two entirely different things, although programmers always assume that whatever you&#x27;re building, it&#x27;s the right thing. You can spend your entire career in programming, learning all sorts of goodness about things like Erlang innards, and never really understand what your job is.<p>3. That all of that mousing around, learning a new IDE every two or three years when I started was a complete waste of time. I automatically assumed that the more cool and shiny the programming environment, the easier it would be to code and the better my code would be. But no. grep and awk work (mostly) the same way now as they did 30 years ago, and any time I spent learning which hotkeys did that work in some long-lost dev stack was a complete waste of time.<p>4. Conversely, that UX beats internal architecture, every time. If folks are having a blast using your app, you win, even if it crashes every five minutes (How they could have fun if it crashed every five minutes is a good question. You might want to ask them)<p>5. The more smart people you throw at a programming project, the bigger mess you end up with. I know when I say that people are thinking of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, but it goes deeper than that. Even if you somehow manage to stay on-schedule, human communication around innovation stops working at a certain scale, and that looks like a hard limit. There are ways around it, using things like Code Budgets, following CCL, layers and DSLs, but nobody does that, so it doesn&#x27;t matter.

Learning how to learn, in my case, by writing down stuff in my own words as if I were teaching someone else was probably the most important thing.

Don’t try to learn all the niche technologies you see in job listings expecting you need to know those things in order to qualify for the position.

I got started with programming via BASIC (various forms), none of which supported recursion. I didn&#x27;t really <i>know<\/i> what it was, but knew that I just wanted to call into the same routine again from itself or via mutual recursion (again, didn&#x27;t know the term). This didn&#x27;t work as expected, however. Either the program wouldn&#x27;t compile&#x2F;execute (threw an error at the recursion) or the recursion just corrupted the data (each call shared the same local data, so they&#x27;d clobber each others&#x27; work). While playing around on a TI calculator I programmed (something, can&#x27;t remember the details) but created a stack using the list data structure. I then looped (versus recursed) but pushed a data element onto the stack or popped elements off of it. The program quit when the stack was empty.<p>Later, in college, we were learning lower level programming details (like what C translated to in assembly and how it managed calls and the stack frame). Despite this being my third CS course in college, I hadn&#x27;t really <i>grokked<\/i> recursion yet. But I had a flashback during one of the classes to the TI-BASIC programs I&#x27;d written using a stack, and realized I&#x27;d recreated recursion (but manually). After that recursion and loops were synonymous in my mind (as they should be, at least in many cases) since I knew how to translate between them. Whenever I saw someone managing a stack and looping until it was empty, I knew both that it could be and how it could be translated into recursion (and vice versa).<p>It seems to be one of the hardest topics for many of my colleagues (especially those without a CS degree, so lacking practice with recursion) to understand or ever use. But I can usually get them to understand it once I draw a few things out on paper and show the two solutions to a problem (recursive or iterative). This doesn&#x27;t mean they like recursion, most still avoided it, but they started to understand that it wasn&#x27;t magic, it was just the computer managing the same data structure they were manually managing."],"time":["2020-09-08 19:21:11"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["animesh"],"id":[24402044],"kids":[24402131],"parent":[24397272],"text":["1.

See [1]. Newer language wars center of safety and bug creation, so maybe this point is dating me.<p>- Programming languages are more about human psychology than about some mathematical proof of correctness. Programming languages are designed as a compromise between how a computer needs to be told to operate and how humans communicate. All the theoretical and mathematical infrastructure around language design are there to justify decisions once the language has passed the &quot;psychology&quot; test. This is the same idea between JPEG, MP3, etc. compression. Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms don&#x27;t inherently create a saving, it&#x27;s only when we can throw away higher order coefficients because the human perceptual system isn&#x27;t as sensitive to them as lower order coefficients, does it give benefit. That is, JPEG and MP3 are specifically tailored to the human perceptual system. The math is there as the building block but which bits&#x2F;coefficients to throw away are determined empirically. To belabor this point a bit more, programming language discussions arguing over functional vs. imperative, type safety, etc. that don&#x27;t try to determine measurable metrics of success, preferably through testing their hypothesis with data collected on actual usage, are expressing an opinion only.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200407014302&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gmarceau.qc.ca&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;speed-size-and-dependability-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200407014302&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gmarc...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 11:34:39"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["kangnkodos"],"id":[24409253],"kids":{},"parent":[24397272],"text":["When I first started compiling code, there were often pages and pages of compiler errors.

Clean is when you don&#x27;t have to make many decisions to get things done.<p>Example decisions, I&#x27;d say I spend at least 90% of my time developing on these decisions:<p>- What feature would be good to have?<p>- Is the feature worth the effort to build?<p>- Is the feature worth the compute costs?<p>- What language&#x2F;framework should we use for this feature?<p>- How should we structure persistent data related to this feature?<p>- Where should the code for this feature live?<p>- How should we test this feature?<p>- How performant should this feature be?<p>- What name should this helper function&#x2F;variable have?<p>The more of those you have to think about when developing the slower you will make progress. Therefore the main productivity hack is to write down guidelines or roadmaps or design documents for all of those so you don&#x27;t have to think much about it when developing. This means don&#x27;t be a manager when coding, let someone else do that work or do it before you start programming.<p>Things you can do to reduce mental cost of above decisions:<p>- Product roadmap with features that would be good to have.<p>- Discussions in the roadmap related to how much value said feature will provide and the effort to produce it.<p>- Discussions in the roadmap related to how expensive the feature will be to run.<p>- General guidelines on what language&#x2F;framework you use.<p>- Have a very good architectural document describing how you structure persistent data.<p>- Have list of example commits showing where to put code for different features.<p>- Have a well documented testing strategy with examples pointing to commits with good integration and unit tests.<p>- Have guidelines on how much typical actions are allowed to take, like &quot;page update should take 100ms at most&quot;.<p>- Try to write code where you don&#x27;t need a lot of long superfluous names, namespaces and anonymous functions are your friends.<p>- Lastly, as much as possible try to make reasonable defaults for shared code. If you have to make 20 configuration decisions in order to use a library then you wont save a lot of time using it, and likely people will just copy the configuration from other places anyway since making 20 decisions is too much work. For example, lets say your library have a flag that can speed up processing 2x in some cases but with extra overhead most of the time. You could think that forcing the developer to decide in each case to ensure we aren&#x27;t missing any performance improvements would be a good thing, but in reality a 2x performance improvement rarely matters. So the cost of having every developer making this decision outweighs the performance benefit. Instead have it as an optional config that they can set when they actually need the performance."],"time":["2020-09-08 14:00:47"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["throw0101a"],"id":[24414952],"kids":[24417270,24416565],"parent":[24399236],"text":["A good book on how the automobile came to (the American) city streets:<p>&gt; <i>Before the advent of the automobile, users of city streets were diverse and included children at play and pedestrians at large. By 1930, most streets were primarily a motor thoroughfares where children did not belong and where pedestrians were condemned as &quot;jaywalkers.&quot; In Fighting Traffic, Peter Norton argues that to accommodate automobiles, the American city required not only a physical change but also a social one: before the city could be reconstructed for the sake of motorists, its streets had to be socially reconstructed as places where motorists belonged. It was not an evolution, he writes, but a bloody and sometimes violent revolution. Norton describes how street users struggled to define and redefine what streets were for. He examines developments in the crucial transitional years from the 1910s to the 1930s, uncovering a broad anti-automobile campaign that reviled motorists as &quot;road hogs&quot; or &quot;speed demons&quot; and cars as &quot;juggernauts&quot; or &quot;death cars.&quot; He considers the perspectives of all users--pedestrians, police (who had to become &quot;traffic cops&quot;), street railways, downtown businesses, traffic engineers (who often saw cars as the problem, not the solution), and automobile promoters.

I have two. Children ages 2 and 3 are a strong counter-example to this &quot;inmate human goodness&quot; hypothesis and Rousseau&#x27;s thinking in general. My kids at that age would often be about to trip over the last nerve with some sort of interruption only to say, &quot;Mommy and daddy, I love you.&quot; In some ways, I think the goodness that kids these ages show must be some sort of evolutionary mechanism to remain &quot;cute&quot; and keep the parents from harming them (i.e. self-interested). Thomas Sowell (whose work I submit is likely far superior to either Bregman&#x27;s or the Lancet reviewer Marmot&#x27;s) has a wonderful quote illustrating it: &quot;Each new generation born is in effect an invasion of civilization by little barbarians, who must be civilized before it is too late.&quot;<p>Bergman appears to be arguing against a straw man. I don&#x27;t think anyone would say that human beings are completely, innately and irredeemably evil. I doubt even John Calvin would have argued such a thing. People want to be loved and they want to feel they are doing good. But we are good at lying to ourselves about our motivations, letting our emotions lead us into bad decisions and generally reacting in ways that preserve our own interests, status and livelihoods regardless of the cost (which we are adept at rationalizing away).<p>Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;unconstrained vision&quot;[1] has a fundamental error: if humans are good, then human-created institutions should by and large also be good; if humans are good and human-created institutions are for whatever reason corrupting, then humans should be resilient to the corruption. I&#x27;d argue that neither seems to be true, but the latter seems particularly false and fatal for the unconstrained vision. The existence of even a few unchecked malevolent attributes is sufficient to create mass suffering. This is doubly true if the person believes herself to be innately good in all ways.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Conflict-Visions-Thomas-Sowell&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0688079512\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Conflict-Visions-Thomas-Sowell&#x2F;dp&#x2F;068...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 17:14:05"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["diego"],"id":[24409421],"kids":{},"parent":[24403070],"text":["There is no contradiction.

So you’ll get these fixes as soon as they’re available, without having to wait for a full OS update.<p>8 seems like a rather wise and user friendly privacy concern (which might be annoying to power-users who set things up proactively and don&#x27;t want their configurations messed with, yet overall a great improvement).<p>9 has me worried about variants of android like Lineage or ParanoidAndroid where the play store isn&#x27;t included automatically. This forced reliance upon the play store for security sensitive updates is devastating for de-googled device feasibility.

He then argues that the real problem designers and devs are trying to solve is the loss of control - that the browser controls loading, and the blank screen is &quot;bad.&quot;<p>He then says that the solution is using an iframe (called a portal.) which looks to be a proposed API. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;hands-on-portals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;hands-on-portals&#x2F;<\/a> - this is available as an origin trial in Chrome 85.<p>So, he&#x27;s saying that SPAs are bad and we should invest in a Chrome-only feature or future feature that might make it through standards?

The back button was never a fully solved problem and POST-redirect-GET is essentially an insufficient hack.<p>If someone wants to talk about making server side rendering for web applications a viable experience, we are likely going to need changes to the standards and we will need to build up a great set of tooling to solve the problem.

When a React implementation of his example gets new content, it doesn&#x27;t invalidate or even necessarily &quot;redraw&quot; the ToC, and it tells the browser what to do by invalidating certain DOM elements (or even just one DOM element).<p>I think he misses this as a key reason for the movement towards frameworks.<p>But ... notice that the browser will probably (I&#x27;m not 100% sure about this, would appreciate comment from someone who knows), re-render the entire rectangle the contains the page.<p>Desktop applications don&#x27;t work this way. If you turn on Quartz debugging on macOS you can actually see the rects on screen that are re-rendered to reflect invalidation by the application (e.g. after new content needs to be displayed).<p>Maybe I have this wrong, and React and similar frameworks have leveraged a subtle capability in the browser to invalidate a DOM element as a way to only re-render part of the on-screen rect.<p>But assuming that I&#x27;ve have this roughly correct, this model in which the &quot;atomic, indivisible rendering unit&quot; for browser apps is the page rect seems fundamentally disadvantaged and mis-designed compared to desktop apps."],"time":["2020-09-08 19:38:42"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["hardwaresofton"],"id":[24409906],"kids":[24409959],"parent":[24407849],"text":["I am definitely one that loves a good &quot;get off my lawn&quot; moment, but it seems like we rehash this point every few weeks (and I don&#x27;t even read frontend twitter).

If you can withstand the increase in complexity, you can mostly have your cake and eat it too -- server-side rendered robust client applications.<p>Even for the most stalwart monolith enthusiast, isn&#x27;t it nice to make it relatively difficult for your View code to call some Model&#x2F;Controller&#x2F;util method&#x2F;function that it shouldn&#x27;t be calling?

It makes the website feel slow. It&#x27;s very hard to beat that latency if you&#x27;re going to update everything from the server.<p>So you really do need JavaScript to create that snappiness. If you&#x27;re filtering in the browser with the data that you already received, it&#x27;s going to feel instant.<p>I purposefully chose the filtering example because it&#x27;s something that you can do server-side or client-side. But the server side is always going to feel slower if you&#x27;re sending all the data in each request and simply changing the rendering.<p>So where do you draw the line? I think you should only let the server re-render the UI if there&#x27;s new data being queried and sent. I&#x27;m of the opinion that JavaScript should only manage the interactivity of what receives and should be fetching very few data.<p>Of course this only makes sense if you&#x27;re using something like Laravel or Rails.

Amazing to launch after years of work.<p>Computers are fantastic things because they allow you to leverage much more evidence when making decisions than would otherwise be possible. It is possible to write computer programs that automate the ingestion and analysis of unimaginably large quantities of data.<p>If the data is well chosen, it is almost always the case that computational analysis reveals new and surprising insights simply because it incorporates more evidence than could possibly be captured by a human brain.<p>And because the universe is chaotic and there are combinatorial explosions of possibilities all over the place, evidence is always better than intuition when seeking insight.<p>As anybody who has grappled with computers and large quantities of data will know, it’s not as simple as that. The joy of analysis and insight is often crushed beneath a mountain of tedious data sourcing, preparation, management and cleaning tasks - ugly ETL scripts that are a horror to maintain and the double horror of trying to extract data with unknown character encodings from undocumented legacy systems - CP-1252 and its friends.<p>It shouldn’t be like this; it doesn’t have to be like this. Computers should be able to do most of this for us. It makes no sense that we are still writing the same simple and tedious data validation and transformation programs over and over ad infinitum. There must be a better way.<p>This is the problem that we set out to solve with TerminusDB. We identified two absolutely indispensable characteristics that were currently sorely lacking in data management tools.<p>The first one was a rich and universally machine-interpretable modeling language. If we want computers to be able to transform data between different representations automatically, they need to be able to describe their data models to one another.<p>The second major missing requirement is effective revision control. Revision control technologies have been instrumental in turning software production from a craft to an engineering discipline because they make collaboration and coordination between large groups much more fault tolerant - and boy humans produce faults. The need for such capabilities is screamingly obvious when dealing with data - where the existence of multiple versions of the same underlying dataset is almost ubiquitous and with only the most primitive tool support.<p>In October 2019, we released version 1.0 of TerminusDB - it contained the culmination of 4 years of building out the data modeling capacity that we needed - the W3Cs web ontology language with a closed world interpretation.<p>We chose this solution firstly because OWL is by far the best thing humanity has yet produced in terms of a rich, machine-interpretable data modeling interchange format. It is essentially first-order logic with set operations - when it comes to platform interoperability nothing beats mathematics! And adding a closed world interpretation to OWL turns out to be surprisingly easy and semantically unproblematic (closed worlds are contained within open worlds).<p>In January 2020 with version 1.1. we released the first version of our immutable revision control storage layer - with many of the ideas shamelessly borrowed from git, but expanded significantly because when dealing with data, you need to distinguish between things like schema and instance data and keep them aligned. It turns out to require a significantly more complex structure of internal pointers, but it can be done!<p>In June 2020, we release version 2.0 - this included the revision control API - push, pull, branch and merge fully integrated with the database, query, and modeling engine. At this stage the database itself was more or less complete in terms of features, but there was one more critical and important point before we could say we had managed to deliver on our vision.<p>With distributed collaboration technology there is always a bootstrapping problem - it’s no use having technology that allows you to collaborate on data in a peer-to-peer decentralized way unless there are other people out there to connect to and collaborate with. To overcome that problem, we needed to deliver an infrastructure that would allow people to get started, to share and find data and collaborators.<p>Today we release TerminusDB version 3.0 and at the same time we open the doors of TerminusHub. The database is now fully integrated with the hub, allowing all TerminusDB users to share, store, publish and collaborate on databases with other users and do so at the grand price of free. With this release, I think we can say that we have a product that delivers on our vision.<p>The product itself is only a means to an end. We built TerminusDB to take away the pain of building amazing evidence bases for computational analysis. Although we will relentlessly continue to focus on product and remove every pain point that shows up, we now have the type of tool that we wanted. Now we are going to build some truly wonderful data resources."],"time":["2020-09-08 17:26:48"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Naac"],"id":[24412863],"kids":[24413093,24417884],"parent":[24409334],"text":["Are you using a self-signed cert?<p>I&#x27;m getting a &quot;Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead&quot; from Firefox."],"time":["2020-09-08 22:25:54"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["pfdietz"],"id":[24404652],"kids":[24419739],"parent":[24398048],"text":["This reminds me a bit of quadrupole ion (Paul) traps.<p>These confine charged particles using just electric fields.
