THAT pissed me off because I paid for my Kaspersky license.<p>I spoke to a colleague about it and he asked my why I didn&#x27;t just use windows defender. I said that it was not good enough and he asked why. These were the days before most people started using it. His argument was that Windows Defender was not advertised at all, nobody paid an army of bloggers to defend it an big it up but that did not make it an inferior product. Why would Microsoft make an anti-virus any less effective than a paid anti virus? I really had no decent argument against it. I guess we just feel better about something if we pay for it.

She claims that the new arrangements which replaced Labour&#x27;s IPPs failed, but they didn&#x27;t apply here - he was sentenced under the old rules which still had IPPs rather than their replacements. She claimed that the Appeal Court said that his release should be left to the Parole Board and blamed the Tories for the fact that it wasn&#x27;t. They didn&#x27;t say that, and it was a law passed by her party in 2008 which meant the Parole Board had no say. She implied the Tory replacement for IPPs allowed serious criminals to be released early without parole board assessment, when in reality it reinstated the parole board involvment Labour had removed. There&#x27;s a good summary here which backs up all of these facts: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesecretbarrister.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;10-thing-you-should-know-about-the-london-bridge-attacker-and-early-release&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesecretbarrister.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;10-thing-you-shoul...<\/a><p>So naturally, some Tories went after those claims - and the legal blogger who wrote the summary I&#x27;ve linked above promptly attacked their debunkings <i>and not the original Labour claims<\/i>, and that went viral too: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BarristerSecret&#x2F;status&#x2F;1200808767820046337\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BarristerSecret&#x2F;status&#x2F;12008087678200463...<\/a> In fact, that blog post above was written to specifically back up his claim that the Tories were liars. (He&#x27;s technically right - that tweet is a little misleading, since the courts could avoid automatic release by imposing the IPP sentence that Yvette Cooper had falsely claimed the Tories had stopped them imposing - but it&#x27;s pedantry. The claim being debunked was about what the Parole Board could have done after that sentence was handed down. That omission mostly just means the Labour claims were even more false than suggested.)<p>It gets better. Tory PM Boris Johnson wrote a 16-tweet thread so pedantically accurate and in line with his own claims that he couldn&#x27;t discredit it as inaccurate anymore - so instead he accused Boris of stealing that blogpost which he&#x27;d written to debunk the Tory lies, implying this made the Tories the dishonest ones falsely claiming those facts supported their side: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BarristerSecret&#x2F;status&#x2F;1201076439250087936\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BarristerSecret&#x2F;status&#x2F;12010764392500879...<\/a> (Note he never technically said Boris was lying, just that it was &quot;weapons grade shithousery&quot;).  He even used the fact that they both debunked that false claim about the Appeal Court - one which Yvette Cooper had made but the Tory debunkings had not - to back up this argument. Along with the fact they both linked to literally first answer you find when searching for information on parole for extended sentences. It turns out that thanks to inattentiveness and partisanship, you can not only convince people of the exact opposite of what your own evidence shows without technically lying, you can make them believe that the people who don&#x27;t believe that are the ones who&#x27;ve been suckered.<p>Meanwhile, the BBC&#x27;s coverage was vague he-said she-said stuff which didn&#x27;t check anything, and the Guardian was (and still is) repeating the debunked claims. (I think they did eventually write an explainer which debunked most of the claims whilst carefully avoiding tying them to any party, but I can&#x27;t find it lately.) Also, the more recent BBC headlines all insist that Boris Johnson is the one who politicised this act of terrorism.<p>* Technically there are no MPs since Parliament is dissolved for the election, but that&#x27;s pedantry."],"time":["2019-12-10 16:12:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["deogeo"],"id":[21752440],"kids":{},"parent":[21751944],"text":["&gt; Last week, Reddit said the document had links to a Russian disinformation campaign, raising fresh questions about foreign interference in the campaign, though the document itself seemed to be accurate.<p>Informing people about what their government is planning in trade talks is &quot;foreign interference&quot;, but pressuring that government to compromise healthcare so they can profit from it is... what?"],"time":["2019-12-10 14:59:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kstrauser"],"id":[21755086],"kids":[21755286,21755192],"parent":[21754589],"text":["I don&#x27;t like retailers storing my credit card info in dodgy databases that end up on the dark web.

I always kept enjoying being with other people, it has never been about the alcohol going out.  When going out for drinks, in the first couple of months I would simply order non alcoholic beverages. After a while I realized that it was unnecessarily expensive and I simply stopped ordering drinks. On this the author is right, this led to huge savings. I just got out for the fun of being with other people. As the author himself explains, the drinks are just an excuse to go out and do stuff.

But even that I think is something I did very differently from the author.

That&#x27;s a pretty short answer and mostly no one investigates that.<p>So in the end in my experience my social life was not affected in any negative way by not drinking. To be honest, if anything, I think it increased my social skills, as I was more focused and &quot;awake&quot; by not drinking. And this is a experience that still has positive impacts on my personality. The only reason I started to drink again is because I actually like the taste of most alcoholic beverages (wine, beer etc), so I was missing a good glass of wine with my dinner.<p>On the contrary, the experience of the author reminds me of someone that has made alcohol a requirement of his&#x2F;her social life. Which is looking troublesome because it denotes a poor relationship with alcohol. The author should focus on what&#x27;s funny in going out without alcohol, which is what matters. Alcohol should not be what makes going out funny.<p>I would suggest to everyone to go at least 1 year without alcohol while still going out and having a very active social life in a context where everyone else is drinking.

If you doubt this, watch how much this comment is downvoted.<p>One thing we know, based on over a century of data around the world: increasing density of housing has little effect on affordability, in the long run. More often than not, it has the <i>opposite<\/i> effect. More simply, we do it backwards: we claim--based on in-migration &#x27;projections&#x27; that are nearly always overestimates--that there&#x27;s a shortage and we must build our way out of it. Example: 20 years ago, Portland estimated a million new residents by 2025. Growth in that period: 105,000, in large part due to annexation.<p>This leaves out the realities of how things get built. Private developers do the work, for profit, most often for investment groups. If it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;pencil out&#x27;, nobody will build it. And this is why &#x27;affordable housing&#x27; demands, codes, agreements all get bargained down in the end.

There are a LOT of empty apartments in this city. There are also a LOT of &quot;short term rentals&quot; in the city that sit vacant.<p>Here are the concerns that I do not see addressed with this:<p>1. Will the City of Portland make the required infrastructure improvements to support more density? For example, will the storm sewers, which currently overflow poo into the river, support all the extra.. poo.<p>1a. Will the city invest in roads and public transit? Walking and biking are both great, but Portland is cold, dark and wet for 7 months a year. No matter how easy and safe you make it, people won&#x27;t want to ride in those conditions.<p>1b. Portland 911 systems are currently stressed beyond reason. I waited on hold for 4 minutes on 911 (not non-emergency) a few weeks ago. This isn&#x27;t a rare occurrence.<p>1c. Will Portland address the tent in the room? Homelessness is endemic in the city, and it isn&#x27;t _only_ due to lack of housing. The city has very few options for mental health and drug treatment. Will the city invest in that? If not, livability will be negatively impacted by this.<p>1d. Assuming COVID ever ends, will Portland be business friendly enough to attract employers to employ the expected glut of people? Right now, large business are leaving Portland (Google has halted its expansion plans for example).<p>1e. Will Oregon fund schools in a way that can account for the new residents? Schools are already over-crowded and Oregon has one of the worst graduation rates in the country. Will the city&#x2F;state commit to building schools to support new students? If so, where? They are in-filling in neighborhoods with few plots available<p>2. This will disadvantage low-income workers who won&#x27;t be able to afford the new houses. Though more density does lower prices, it normally lowers prices in the less desirable neighborhoods. People of means buy the new condos&#x2F;townhomes that are built, leaving the poor to take the less nice houses or continue to live further out.<p>2a. The Utopian dream of a urban playground where everyone is walking and birds are chirping and there is Trek in every garage doesn&#x27;t play for a majority of people. People rarely live where they work. This is not normally a personal choice. Other factors play into it. Being around their family, kids&#x27; friends, better schools, new job on the other side of town etc. I understand the myopia of the crowd on this site is to picture everyone has a well-connected and well-heeled tech worker, but reality is far different.<p>3. Tongue in cheek-isg: this is all celebrated within the same week as another story claiming people are abandoned the density of SFO, NYC, SEA to work remotely in towns like BOI, AUS, Bend etc. There is obviously a _desire_ to have land and space and privacy.

Current Supreme Court jurisprudence is very clear that businesses — including monopolies — have no duty to deal with third parties, and if they do choose to deal with them (or are even compelled to), that they can choose the terms on which to do so. The only exceptions are if the monopoly in question changes the rules in an unprofitable way with the express purpose of driving out a competitor, or if any company — not even a monopoly — changes access to after-market parts and services.<\/i><p>Current US antitrust law does not favor Epic in this matter. Of Epic&#x27;s ten claims, their strongest claim is probably the one tying in-app payment processing to app distribution services, but even that one is far from a slam dunk.

I think there is near universal agreement here, including from SpaceX.<p>However, there is no way to become a space faring civilization without putting lots of things in space, period. I want to see 1,000,000x more objects in space, including much larger ones.<p>If we truly become space faring, we have the matter and resources to have a quadrillion humans living in comfort (likely in large rotating space habitats like&quot;O Neil Cylinders&quot;). This is the kind of dream we could have, imagine over 100,000x the humans, artists, friendship, science, and love. We can simultaneously make earth an ecological paradise, with most of the planet reserved for nature.<p>This &quot;anti-satellite&quot; movement seems to generally have 4 kinds of attacks against the satellites:\n1) The satellites &quot;impede my rights to view the sky&quot;. The implication is that anyone who attempts to build in their &quot;view to infinity&quot; violates their rights. This seems like an extremely presumptuous statement, like they own trillions of miles. This also doesn&#x27;t match the current legal framework of any country (nobody needs your permission to fly over your house in aircraft or space).\n2) The usecase of these satellites is bad because they are &quot;like cell towers&quot;. Getting low cost internet access for the planet is IMO an extremely good thing, one of the best things for the poor.\n3) The satellites will kill astronomy. This is absurd, we will have much better astronomy if we are a space fairing species with cheap space access and many things&#x2F;expertise in space and giant telescopes outside our atmosphere. It may kill amateur astronomy from earth eventually, but I just don&#x27;t think that as society a relatively fringe hobby should stop the progress of humanity. Many hobbies have been killed over time. I personally think this will inspire more people to look to space, and have the opposite effect.\n4) We should not put things into space, and we should look to reduce our impact on the universe. This also manifests itself in those that want to see population reduction on Earth. I believe consciousness is better than lifeless rock. I say this as a human and a parent who has brought consciousness into the world.<p>Lets upgrade our dreams, take to the stars, and make the universe a more interesting place."],"time":["2020-08-26 18:41:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dvaun"],"id":[24283550],"kids":[24283676],"parent":[24283229],"text":["The technical report is quite large (105MB).

I am too lazy to write a blog post w&#x2F; illustration, but for audio signals, which I am more familiar with, the intuition behind DCT (and MDCT, used e.g. for mp3) is straightforward.<p>Assuming you understand that a Fourier transform is an operation to go from from time domain to the frequency domain, the problem solved by DCT, DST, etc. is related to the fact that <i>digital<\/i> signal processing are finite, and without any care, you introduce &#x27;irregularities&#x27; if you use a &#x27;normal&#x27; Fourier transform.<p>So the main idea of DCT&#x2F;DST&#x2F;etc. is to implicitly &#x27;copy&#x27; and&#x2F;or mirror the signal, to reduce the artefacts&#x2F;irregularities introduced by Fourier Transform. Reducing irregularities intuitively leads to more regular signals, and the more regular your signal, the quicker the high frequencies decrease, which is the compression effect of DCT.<p>More mathematically, but still very informally: DCT&#x2F;DST is about boundary conditions. Using DFT (the &#x27;normal&#x27; Fourier transform for digital signals) will imply discontinuities at the boundaries. For continuous time signals, an intuitive way to define regularities is to measure the decay of successive derivative of a function f(t), by looking at convergence convergence of t^n f(t) as t -&gt; inf for n. That implies that regular functions have bounded Fourier transforms, and the more regular, the faster the Fourier transform decays.<p>The DST&#x2F;DCT, by mirroring&#x2F;copying the signal, reduce irregularities, and hence their coefficients decrease faster."],"time":["2020-08-26 16:53:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Diti"],"id":[24281964],"kids":[24282078,24282070,24282131],"parent":[24281857],"text":["This is DEFINITELY NOT explained like I’m five.

One would think that Lisp&#x2F;Haskell&#x2F;Scala&#x2F;Julia&#x2F;Clojure&#x2F;Erlang would be concise. But in practice, I&#x27;ve found them to generally be write-only languages that are quite difficult to grok. The only thing that comes close is spreadsheets, but due to their 2D nature, they can&#x27;t really scale beyond a certain level of complexity. Honestly, I think that the lack of adoption of functional programming languages (due to their own obstinance) is one of the great problems of our time.<p>Anyway, for the past 5-10 years or so, I solve most problems in my head in a data-driven way that looks like a hybrid between MATLAB and spreadsheets, piping data between classes written in an Actor model style (I learned this from a very good teacher during a contract at HP). I use rules of thumb like no mutable data (stored state), mostly higher-order functions, and framing concepts in terms of transformations rather than class inheritance. Then I translate that to whatever language I have to use for the client, which is probably PHP, JavaScript or C# (Unity).<p>I highly recommend this sort of approach for keeping abstractions separate from implementations. Unfortunately since nobody else seems to follow this method, it makes for some friction in the workplace. People talk past me all of the time because they don&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;m coming from this place of experience. They don&#x27;t see the need for this clean separation when they are &quot;trying to get things done&quot;. They may get things done faster, but if you want bug-free implementations, this is the way to go IMHO.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m on the fence about TensorFlow. It&#x27;s arguably more advanced than MATLAB, but vastly more opaque. So I&#x27;m not sold on any advantage it provides, other than perhaps better performance or usefulness in certain domains like machine learning.

So now exoplanets are &quot;validated&quot; by calculating the probability of a false positive.  I am not in this field, but it seems that the most common algorithm to do this is called VESPA [2].  The contribution these authors make is to use a machine learning system for the <i>validation<\/i> process, i.e., calculating the probability that the candidate is a false positive.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1712.05044\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1712.05044<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timothydmorton&#x2F;VESPA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timothydmorton&#x2F;VESPA<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-27 00:44:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cp_mlreef"],"id":[24291959],"kids":{},"parent":[24281247],"text":["That is nice to see that ML can be used for expanding our knowlede of space!"],"time":["2020-08-27 12:05:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwawaynothx"],"id":[24289558],"kids":{},"parent":[24281247],"text":["what was the data provided? if 50 were confirmed how many were false"],"time":["2020-08-27 04:21:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arkanciscan"],"id":[24287655],"kids":[24288726,24288053],"parent":[24281247],"text":["*exoplanets"],"time":["2020-08-26 23:46:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["iav"],"id":[24277850],"kids":[24282408],"parent":[24256748],"text":["SPACs traditionally don’t have any guaranteed primary capital. 100% of their investors can redeem.

This actually decreases the certainty to the company of any deal.  See the case of Far Point, where COVID hurt the company and the SPAC was able to get out of the deal (in fact, management urged shareholders to vote against the deal they had put together!).<p>Recently, however, SPACs are tending to have small amounts of capital (or at least, few investors), and rely on the PIPEs to make up the difference.  As the article points out, the PIPE process isn&#x27;t too far off from the typical IPO process: your bankers (SPAC management in this case), market the deal to potential investors, and build orders.<p>In my view, as this approaches its limit, SPACs become very similar to IPOs, with one key difference: regulations.  They&#x27;re not required to file S1s and many other restrictions around marketing to investors no longer exist.

The results of the Norwegian Polar Expedition conducted from 1899 to 1900 contained the first determination of the global pattern of electric currents in the polar region from ground magnetic field measurements. The discovery of X-rays inspired Birkeland to develop vacuum chambers to study the influence of magnets on cathode rays. Birkeland noticed that an electron beam directed toward a magnetised terrella was guided toward the magnetic poles and produced rings of light around the poles and concluded that the aurora could be produced in a similar way. He developed a theory in which energetic electrons were ejected from sunspots on the solar surface, directed to the Earth, and guided to the Earth&#x27;s polar regions by the geomagnetic field where they produced the visible aurora. This is essentially the theory of the aurora today.&quot;<p>&quot;In 1913, Birkeland may have been the first to predict that plasma was ubiquitous in space. He wrote: &quot;It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or nebulae, but in &#x27;empty&#x27; space.&quot;[7]&quot;<p>&quot;In 1916, Birkeland was probably the first person to successfully predict that the solar wind behaves as do all charged particles in an electric field: &quot;From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds&quot;.[12][13] In other words, the Solar Wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions.&quot;&quot;<p>Without him, the modern study of cosmology and planetary science would be a mess."],"time":["2020-08-26 20:50:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["krnsll"],"id":[24285106],"kids":[24286778],"parent":[24283018],"text":["Freeman Dyson is a glaring miss here.<p>Feynman and Schwinger shared the 1965 Nobel in Physics for their respective perspectives on Quantum Electrodynamics.

The most impressive gains in AI in the 2010s (Computer Vision &amp; Natural Language Processing) were made thanks to DL. There&#x27;s a famous post by AI researcher Rich Sutton, which summarises this fairly neatly [1].<p>Now, this connection between DL and fast chips would tie the progress of AI pretty tightly to the progress of Moore&#x27;s Law [2]. There&#x27;s some compelling evidence that Moore&#x27;s Law is at least slowing down [3]. On the other hand, there are industry experts like Jim Keller who pretty strongly disagree with these assessments [4] and even TSMC seems to be bullish on being able to keep up with Moore&#x27;s Law [5].<p>Some estimates of GPT-3s training cost put it in the range of ~5-10 million dollars [6]. It&#x27;s hard to say how big of an impact on the economy GPT-3 will have. It&#x27;s probably safe to assume though, that OpenAI is already working on GPT-4. The jump in parameter sizes from GPT-2 to 3 was roughly 100x (1.5 billion vs. 175 billion) and I&#x27;m assuming the price of training the model increased in roughly the same proportion (I might be wrong here and if anyone can point me to evidence on this, it would be much appreciated). With these assumptions, and provided that GPT-4 won&#x27;t be affected by diminishing returns of adding more parameters (big if), the price for it would be somewhere between 500 million and a billion dollars.

About to be married, going to finish school, going on a trip... fear is part of all of these experiences, at least until you’ve done it. But I think the fear is made worse because of the stories we’ve told, and heard, about it. Modern movies are a prime example where we can watch what might happen if we die and what we might miss, etc. The more tragic a story the greater the fear that that might overwhelm us. The poems, tales, and stories highlight the effects of death.<p>But in a similar vein, I find comfort in the more positive stories too, such as the ones about Jesus in the Bible. How death came as a result of sin, and how, for some reason, a sacrifice was required to pay the penalty of sin - something else had to die in your stead, like a pigeon or sheep. But of course, how could that really pay that price? No wonder sacrifices were needed regularly. That is until Jesus’ death - an eternal life could pay for an eternal death, for good and forever. All I need to do is believe in Jesus and share that payment. This is a good story, preferable to the ending of say, 300, or Gladiator, for me at least.<p>I’m not sure the eternal life to come will eventually be boring either. The story suggests we remain basically the same, and what has been true is that we grow. True, what interested me as a kid doesn’t hold the same power over me now, nor could I as a child really get into fonts or NLP or traveling!

One moment you&#x27;re there, the next moment you&#x27;re coming back from not being there.  (Give me some leeway on the sleep thing - I know that when you&#x27;re actively dreaming or tossing and turning it&#x27;s not quite a jump cut).<p>So in that moment when you&#x27;re coming back to consciousness from a state of previous unconsciousness, what&#x27;s to say you&#x27;re the same &quot;you&quot; that was beforehand?  Sure, you remember a whole life, but then there&#x27;s this gap in continuity.  Maybe you were someone else and then all of a sudden, you&#x27;re now &quot;you&quot; with all those memories in that mushy brain of yours.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case, why is the gap of consciousness needed to separate &quot;you&quot;?  What&#x27;s to say that from any given instant to any other given instant the &quot;you&quot; is continuous, other than for this stream of memories coming from your meat brain.  Maybe &quot;you&quot; jumps around all the time.<p>But then - what is &quot;you&quot; anyway?  If we&#x27;re just a collection of meat brain memories, maybe there&#x27;s no core identifying &quot;you&quot; in the first place, and we&#x27;re all just part of a big collective pool?  Like a piece of code running in an overall shared memory space.  The complexity forms (your program &#x2F; you), and then the function exits and the memory goes back to the collective pool.<p>So then - what if life and existence is all about perspective?  I&#x27;m me because, well, I&#x27;m me.  I expeierience this life and remember these memories.  And you&#x27;re you because you experience your life and remember your memories.  Is there really a difference from a third-party observer?<p>Maybe life is simply in the eye of the beholder.  As long as there is ANY conscious life, then life is being experienced.  And so maybe death really is nothing to worry about -- you&#x27;ll get a chance to experience another life as someone else.<p>But then - why does it even need to be linear? Maybe we ARE experiencing life as someone else -- as evidenced by all the someone elses experiencing life right now :). Just because we can&#x27;t experience it (hardware limitations - sorry.  Brain can&#x27;t handle multiple sets of inputs ;) doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not happening.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re all experiencing consciousness in our own ways as part of one big system.  That leopard in the zoo is experiencing it.  I&#x27;m experiencing it. You reading this are experiencing it.  Maybe our meat brains and linear single-track memories are just a nice little lie, and we&#x27;re really just all temporary functions running as part of a bigger computing system.  Function runs, exits, memory goes back to the shared pool.  New function runs, exits, memory goes back to the shared pool.  Many functions run simultaneously - each doing only what it was programmed to do, then each exits and the memory gets released again....<p>This really gets wild when you start thinking about clone experiments (or teleportation).  Make a perfect clone of yourself right now, down to the neuron, and assemble it in across the room.  You&#x27;ll experience nothing other than to see a clone appear 10 feet away from you.  Your clone will have the experience of being you one instant, and then waking up across the room looking at you &quot;Holy cow!  Cloning and teleportation worked!  They&#x27;re real!&quot;  Then your clone will go on with life, doing the same things you want to do, remembering the same things you remember.<p>Then think about whether there&#x27;s REALLY any difference between that clone of you and any other person on earth...."],"time":["2020-08-27 00:39:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter303"],"id":[24288314],"kids":{},"parent":[24275882],"text":["In an infinite universe you will repeat exactly an infinite number of times.

If this is in a community with low immunization rates, the vaccine-derived virus can survive much longer than intended. This can actually provide a benefit to others, because they will achieve some level of immunity from the weakened virus. However, if the weakened virus is allowed to circulate for a long time (&gt;1 year), it has the (unlikely) chance to mutate and become less weak.<p>Of course, the number of severe polio cases that have been avoided by the vaccine vastly outweighs the number of vaccine-derived cases. But I thought this was an interesting concept!<p>&gt; ...more than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived polio virus) outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.<p>More here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;westernpacific&#x2F;news&#x2F;q-a-detail&#x2F;what-is-vaccine-derived-polio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;westernpacific&#x2F;news&#x2F;q-a-detail&#x2F;what-is-v...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-26 01:11:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["microcolonel"],"id":[24276062],"kids":[24277319],"parent":[24273602],"text":["Massive congratulations!

The caveat &quot;wild&quot; is doing a lot of work that isn&#x27;t properly explained. What this means is that for the last several years, all the cases of polio in Africa have been from circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus - basically, a version of the weakened virus used in the vaccine which has circulated for long enough to reverse the mutations that weaken it. It spreads like wild virus and paralyzes like wild virus, but technically it&#x27;s not wild-type virus. (As I understand it, the only practical difference is that we can tell from genetic sequencing that it came from the vaccine rather than being wild-type.) And this can&#x27;t be fixed by stopping the vaccination program - in fact, that actually makes things worse, since it gives the deadly vaccine-derived poliovirus more people who don&#x27;t have immunity to infect.<p>Some of the other news coverage like the Reuters article is a little better at correctly pointing this caveat out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-health-polio-africa&#x2F;wild-polio-sufferers-reflect-as-africa-declared-free-of-the-disease-idUKKBN25L14I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-health-polio-africa&#x2F;wild-p...<\/a><p>It&#x27;s not even clear that it&#x27;s poasible to actually eliminate polio in developing countries with this vaccine or any existing vaccines. The developed countries managed it but they had far better infrastructure to roll out first the oral vaccine and then the inactivated vaccine to everyone, and also far better sanitation, and it&#x27;s likely both of these things mattered - under-vaccination makes this problem a lot worse, and whilst the inactivsted vaccine protects people from polio there&#x27;s some doubt as to whether it can stop them spreading it via the oral-fecal route due to poor immunity in the gut.

I think this needs further exploration. What are the incentives of the different actors? TL;DR CYA<p>Clearly, the reader just wants to get the information that is relevant for them personally, with the least cognitive effort. Then move on with their day or to the next step in their workflow.<p>The company&#x2F;government can have various incentives on various levels of the hierarchy&#x2F;bureaucracy.<p>The boss&#x2F;owner may want the company to communicate in a snappy, hip, youthful way, in a friendly and clear tone with no bullshit.<p>However, the person&#x2F;department actually writing the text may want to deflect responsibility, avoid possibilities for blame, keep things vague enough so the onus is on the customer&#x2F;citizen to make sure everything will work out. They don&#x27;t want to deviate from process. The customers&#x2F;citizens should be uniform with no exceptions, because exceptions cause work. If you write too friendly, people will assume they can get favors, that we can start bargaining because they are talking to a real person. Text written in a cold, dispassionate, bureaucratic style will not invite such answers. It signals that things are set in stone, that there is a process in place and we won&#x27;t say A or B, they will have to figure our A vs. B themselves.<p>For example, I&#x27;m a teaching assistant at a university. If I&#x27;m buried under too much work with research and get lots of complicated questions from students, I give vague answers so I can&#x27;t get blamed (&quot;But XY said it would work out this way!&quot;). Also if I use a bunch of official words and formal sentence structure, the student gets the message that I won&#x27;t do the work instead of them: there can be tons of different rules interacting, different study programs have different rule books etc. In the end it&#x27;s their responsibility. I cannot give definitive answers, but experience shows, that writing things plainly often invites more haggling than writing in an official tone.<p>The same thing happens when people talk about medical, legal and other potentially dangerous topics. Even if the actual answer is straightforward and will apply in 99% of the cases, nobody gets fired for being too cautious. &quot;Nah don&#x27;t do that&quot; is the easiest thing to say. Ask your doctor. Ask an attorney. Check the laws of your region.<p>To write plain and clear text, you need to leave all these caveats out. But people will jump at every opportunity to try to shift the blame, and if you weren&#x27;t careful, it will accumulate on <i>your<\/i> desk. To avoid this, orgs and lawmakers should make sure to reduce the legal responsibility for saying things.<p>For example I know a(n underpaid) lawyer working for a governmental institution in Hungary. They are in the communications department and give advice on certain legal things to ordinary citizens phoning in or over email.

Law enforcement agencies functioned like criminal gangs. Officers demanded bribes, trafficked narcotics and weapons, and worked for political and business elites as a mercenary security force. Georgia was a textbook example of “predatory policing”: Police did not perform the basic responsibilities of ensuring public safety, instead enriching themselves and their patrons by extorting citizens. A 2003 survey found that just 2.3 percent of Georgians held a positive view of police.<p>&gt; Given that reality, police reform was not only a matter of restructuring institutions or implementing better policies. We had to change the mentality of a broken, cynical, and fearful society.<p>&gt; Before people could begin to trust the police, we—the new political elites—had to earn their trust. Challenging the status quo was not enough. We had to destroy it and build something better.<p>&gt; We replaced them with an entirely new force of Patrol Police, who had no background in law enforcement and thus no ties to old, corrupted elites. Recruits had to pass a competitive examination and complete a course in criminal procedure code. They were trained in persuasion, negotiation, and mediation skills to minimize the use of force.<p>&gt; In 2005 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili fired &quot;the entire traffic police force&quot; of the Georgian National Police due to corruption, numbering around 30,000 police officers. ...

If your position is that your opinion is absolutely correct and there&#x27;s no room for discussion, why post at all? It&#x27;s just ideological battle.<p>With that said, I am naturally inclined to believe that businesses should have a lot of control over the products they create. My baseline is that I want to be as unencumbered as possible in my product vision and the experience I offer my users, and I&#x27;d like minimal government restrictions on my desired UX unless consumers&#x27; physical health or safety is on the line.<p>I see the choice of how third parties should be able to create and sell code that runs on a platform I have created as sacrosanct, from the drawing board, up to the day the first unit is shipped, the developer gets to decide. As my code is my own written word, it is akin to my First Amendment right to free speech. However, I&#x27;m willing to accept that somewhere along the journey from that very first prototype, to the 1,000,000,000th unit shipped, the equation shifts.<p>Most products, that is to say non-open source software, by their very nature, are non-trivially anti-competitive in some way. It is the same thing to say that the product is <i>differentiated<\/i>. I have a BA in Economics, but I&#x27;m a long time out of school, so I may be clobbering this definition, but &quot;a product is differentiated in the marketplace to the extend that a product has a feature or benefit or functionality that is not equivalently provided by every other substitute in that market.&quot; In order for a product to remain differentiated, it therefore <i>must<\/i> be non-trivially &quot;anti-competitive&quot;. Maybe it makes sense to dive into the definition of that word more deeply, but I don&#x27;t want to waste your time. My point is simply that &quot;anti-competitive&quot; is synonymous with any market that is not perfectly commoditized. Hopefully it&#x27;s uncontroversial to claim that &quot;anti-competitive&quot; is <i>not<\/i> fundamentally bad per se.<p>It&#x27;s well recognized that anti-competitive behavior which at one scale is fundamental to a diverse marketplace of products and services which drives innovation, value, and consumer choice, at another scale is used to lock-out potential new market entrants, and enable excessive profitability or rent-seeking behavior. The words &quot;monopoly&quot; and &quot;duopoly&quot; usefully describes the ultimate&#x2F;penultimate theoretical states of such a market, but they don&#x27;t adequately describe that various ways we can approach such a limit in the real world. Apple is not a monopoly, but that does not mean that there should not perhaps be elevated limits on acceptable anti-competitive behavior on their part based on the specific facts of their market position.<p>I think it is also self-evident that it is an extraordinary remedy to judicially limit anti-competitive behavior targeted at a specific company in a competitive market. Indeed when we enjoin a company from making their products function in ways that are quite central to that product&#x27;s highly differentiated user experience, yes it may grant choice to some customers of that product to operate it in new ways, it is also taking choice <i>away<\/i> from customers who may have chosen the product for exactly the functionality being target. This to me is an extremely heavy handed remedy, and should only be deployed against a company if it is absolutely warranted based on <i>unlawful conduct<\/i> by that company.<p>While the case before the judge today was simply a preliminary hearing on a injunction, and therefore not by any means a ruling on the fundamental issue, we can see this balancing act being employed in the current case. The contract that Epic willingly entered into with Apple and willingly violated is placed in one corner (blocking Fortnite) while the separate contract(s) of developers using Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine is placed in another corner. All we know today is that this judge was not willing to allow Apple to retaliate against the violating of one contract by withdrawing from the others, and that the judge was not willing to stop Apple from terminating the first contract after it was willfully violated by Epic. The larger discussion will likely take years to play out."],"time":["2020-08-25 17:36:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["627467"],"id":[24272559],"kids":[24275270],"parent":[24268822],"text":["If Apple wanted (and they probably are doing it) they could heavily delay the approval of any apps that make use of an engine they seem &quot;risky&quot;...
