Based on the current market share and failure of many Mozilla subprojects, I think she is important to Mozilla for legal&#x2F;governance&#x2F;continuity&#x2F;Google negotiation projects, but other people should be doing the business&#x2F;marketing and tech leadership, if available.<p>- what killed Netscape was a failure of imagination in the end.

He says that in our modern culture it&#x27;s common for 1) men to be taught to deny their feelings and 2) women to be taught to deny their needs.<p>By listening to his talks and his audiobooks and using the definitions, frameworks and spiritual ideas behind NVC, I started to become more aware of the strategies I came to use, and the potential for evolving those.<p>Rosenberg believes that the adoption of NVC comes in three steps that we can all go through once we start applying his ideas. It starts with 1) &#x27;emotional slavery&#x27; - where we are unaware of how we blame everything on others and make them wrong for what <i>they<\/i> do. Second we go through the &#x27;obnoxious phase&#x27; where we feel angry when we become aware of our slavery ways, and where we realize that we might have been stuck in various strategies where we also thought we were responsible for others&#x27; feelings and needs. We are angry because we want that to change. Lastly comes &#x27;emotional liberation&#x27;, where we are learning to better understand our feelings and unmet needs and where we can start asking for what we want.<p>I practiced NVC together with my ex-partner, and in my eyes we both grew our self-awareness enourmously."],"time":["2020-09-23 10:22:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["olivermarks"],"id":[24563338],"kids":{},"parent":[24562850],"text":["NPR seems to be veering off into a sort of Oprah self help area."],"time":["2020-09-23 07:35:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["semicolonandson"],"id":[24563230],"kids":{},"parent":[24553085],"text":["I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to be independent for 10 years thanks to a web-app (Oxbridge Notes)<p>Along the way, I learned a lot concerning both system design (e.g. dependencies, CI testing, monitoring) and also the marketing side required to channel enough customers into the business to generate revenue.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve recorded 25 or so videos about these topics — basically a day in the life in small tech.

We all deploy plain JavaScript, no browser supports any other language.<p>Improving parsing and execution (at language level) bring very little improvement with Svelte over (for example) React. On the other hand, the absence of library functions to call may indeed flatten the call stack and give the perf boost promised by Svelte, but this requires Svelte to not being a library at all (more on that later).<p>This is also wording issue. It should have started with «the browser, mostly built around imperative structures, loves direct imperative changes to the DOM, and that’s how you MUST build the most efficient app interactions».<p>&gt; At deployment, you get vanilla JS, that running in your browser. Fast and plain JavaScript<p>Again, wording!<p>&gt; Apps developed are highly compatible.

Take a look at No. 1 it is VanillaJS.<p>(Point n. 1 being the previous quote)<p>This is not correct, or at least misleading. Every `.svelte` does indeed export an autonomous class that can be instantiated directly and mounted to a `target` DOM node, but that’s because Svelte is “embedded” inside the class.<p>In React you _can_ export a function which given a target DOM node mounts the app through `ReactDOM.render()` without the caller needing to have access to ReactDOM, it’s just not how you use components.<p>I have to admit that having that approach baked-in can be useful.<p>&gt; The maintainers are free in their choice of the features they want to include in the framework.

He doesn’t have any strong political agenda or affiliating with certain groups. He’s a regular dude just curious about other people’s life and views, and really gave his quests enough room to express themselves. This is important to many of us, that we want a platform where we can see the real, the human side of the guests, letting them explain themselves, rather than just snippets of soundbites clipped with different intentions by different groups, or 2-minute quick debates that’s often confusing than informative. That’s what makes the show more trustworthy to some people than some big networks.<p>There are warts that I frown upon as well. I disagree with some of this diets and views on intravenous supplements and stem cell treatment. And I never listen to his shows about aliens. But I have come to acceptance that aren’t and will not be a perfect show. The balance between informative and entertainment and eye-opening is quite a compromise. I think an educated person should treat the platform as a source of information, rather than THE source of information.<p>I guess what I really appreciate about the show is that people with vastly different views can still chat, drink and have a good time. For example, as someone outside US, I nevered had a good impression of Bernie Sanders until I watched the show seeing him talk and reason.  I never imagined Richard Dawkins’s response about consuming weed and mushroom. I have learned a lot from Joe about being an interviewer on how to get along with people you don’t fully agree with, especially on how to handles some of his consipiracy-loaded friend. Many of the TV interviews are too “heated” and “confrontational” for my liking. Sometimes I just enjoy listening to some silly and relaxing conversations. Bullshit from the guests can be distinguished without the interviewer actually calling them out on the show.<p>In the age of chaos and cancelling, I really appreciate such a platform. I hope the deal with Spotify will not direct the show to a narrower road. As his popularity rises and being closer to the political war zone, I wish him and the show good luck."],"time":["2020-09-23 06:34:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ffggvv"],"id":[24562869],"kids":[24563300,24563235],"parent":[24561534],"text":["notice everyone started attacking him first when he endorsed bernie and now even more when he made fun of biden?"],"time":["2020-09-23 06:07:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unityByFreedom"],"id":[24563496],"kids":{},"parent":[24561534],"text":["The opening sentence is rather exaggerated,<p>&gt; one of the largest and most influential media platforms in U.S. politics, if not the single most influential"],"time":["2020-09-23 08:02:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unityByFreedom"],"id":[24563471],"kids":[24563490],"parent":[24561534],"text":["Lol what a loaded title.

Ctrl+a, ctrl+c:<p>---<p>America is now under siege by climate change in ways that scientists have warned about for years. But there is a second part to their admonition: Decades of growing crisis are already locked into the global ecosystem and cannot be reversed.<p>This means the kinds of cascading disasters occurring today — drought in the West fueling historic wildfires that send smoke all the way to the East Coast, or parades of tropical storms lining up across the Atlantic to march destructively toward North America — are no longer features of some dystopian future. They are the here and now, worsening for the next generation and perhaps longer, depending on humanity’s willingness to take action.<p>“I’ve been labeled an alarmist,” said Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist in Los Angeles, where he and millions of others have inhaled dangerously high levels of smoke for weeks. “And I think it’s a lot harder for people to say that I’m being alarmist now.”<p>Last month, before the skies over San Francisco turned a surreal orange, Death Valley reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest temperature ever measured on the planet. Dozens of people have perished from the heat in Phoenix, which in July suffered its hottest month on record, only to surpass that milestone in August.<p>Conversations about climate change have broken into everyday life, to the top of the headlines and to center stage in the presidential campaign. The questions are profound and urgent. Can this be reversed? What can be done to minimize the looming dangers for the decades ahead? Will the destruction of recent weeks become a moment of reckoning, or just a blip in the news cycle?<p>The Times spoke with two dozen climate experts, including scientists, economists, sociologists and policymakers, and their answers were by turns alarming, cynical and hopeful.<p>“It’s as if we’ve been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for decades” and the world is now feeling the effects, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. But, she said, “we’re not dead yet.”<p>Their most sobering message was that the world still hasn’t seen the worst of it. Gone is the climate of yesteryear, and there’s no going back.<p>The effects of climate change evident today are the results of choices that countries made decades ago to keep pumping heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at ever-increasing rates despite warnings from scientists about the price to be paid.<p>That price — more vicious heat waves, longer wildfire seasons, rising sea levels — is now irretrievably baked in. Nations, including the United States, have dithered so long in cutting emissions that progressively more global warming is assured for decades to come, even if efforts to shift away from fossil fuels were accelerated tomorrow.<p>‘Twice as Bad’\n“What we’re seeing today, this year, is just a small harbinger of what we are likely to get,” said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan. Things are on track to get “twice as bad” as they are now, he said, “if not worse.”<p>Earth has already warmed roughly 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, since the 19th century. The most optimistic proposals made by world governments to zero out emissions envision holding warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Nations remain far from achieving those goals.<p>Usually, each passing year’s records are framed by the past — the hottest temperatures ever observed, the biggest wildfires in decades. However, as Cristian Proistosescu, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, noted on Twitter, it may be time to flip that chronological framing, and consider today the new starting point.<p>“Don’t think of it as the warmest month of August in California in the last century,” he wrote. “Think of it as one of the coolest months of August in California in the next century.”<p>Climate change is more a slope than a cliff, experts agreed. We’re still far from any sort of “game over” moment where it’s too late to act. There remains much that can be done to limit the damage to come, to brace against the coming megafires and superstorms and save lives and hold onto a thriving civilization.<p>“We can certainly move in a direction that serves us a lot better,” said Stephen Pyne, an environmental historian and professor emeritus at Arizona State University. “It’s not that it’s out of our control. The whole thing is in our control.”<p>It won’t be easy, particularly if past is prologue.<p>..."],"time":["2020-09-23 13:23:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ilaksh"],"id":[24565697],"kids":[24565892],"parent":[24565271],"text":["I feel like they oversimplified a bit.<p>There is plenty of evidence of global warming without making it seem mainly about the wildfires.

This is what Australia has. The argument against this has always been about uninformed people voting and &quot;fraud&quot;. I used to be sympathetic to this argument until I saw the massive scale of voter suppression that occurs in the US.<p>Mandatory voting immediately changes the conversation from &quot;How do we get our side to vote and the other side note to?&quot; to the legal obligation officials have to ensuring everyone can vote.<p>Voting also happens on the weekend in Australia. This greatly simplifies finding polling places. Most of them are schools.<p>The other thing that Australia has that the US needs (which will never happen) is preferential voting.<p>A big mistake the US makes (IMHO) is how the election process itself is politicized. I mean who thought it was a good idea that election supervisors are an elected position?<p>In Australia, we have the Australian Electoral Commission, who is responsible for organizing elections, tallying and reporting the results and determining district boundaries. Somehow this manages to function without it being a partisan battleground.<p>The real problem here seems to be cultural. You have a conservative once-majority now-minority that seems to feel that the ends justify the means. I mean the level of hypocrisy here is truly jaw-dropping. Four years ago it was too contentious to hold hearings on a nominee 10 months before an election. Now? We may have a Supreme Court confirmation in a lame duck session.<p>Remember the outrage around Hilary&#x27;s emails? Yet on Russian interference in the election? Nothing. No, that&#x27;s &quot;fake news&quot;.<p>And by any objective measure, Trump himself is a reprehensible human being, whether you agree with his politics or not.<p>How self-described &quot;moral voters&quot; can turn a blind eye to all this, basically &quot;because abortion&quot;, is almost incomprehensible. I have to wonder if overturning Roe v. Wade might not be the best thing at this point. Two-thirds of the population live in states that will legalize it anyway and then this issue can stop being a rallying cry.<p>As for this effort, I don&#x27;t actually believe it was organized this way from the top (ie White House, RNC). It&#x27;s the sort of thing that really smells like some mid-level functionary and state politics wannabe acting on their own with something that ultimately probably won&#x27;t matter but is great virtue signaling (for someone who wants endorsements and support for some later election).<p>Or it could be some partisan mid-level manager who acted on their own.<p>To anyone saying &quot;no maintenance takes a day&quot;, I guarantee you it can. This could easily be a database server that is being replaced. It needs to be set up and the database copied over. Not everyone runs EC2 instances.

What I think has happened instead is that the wealthiest, most autocratic families have seen competition tighten, but the overall wealth concentrated at the top has increased dramatically.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the long-term effects will be on Indian society but it&#x27;s going to become an existential problem if not addressed at some point."],"time":["2020-09-23 00:24:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dschuetz"],"id":[24552485],"kids":[24560732,24560665],"parent":[24552047],"text":["Isn&#x27;t such cast system a violation of basic human rights regardless if it&#x27;s institutionalized or not?"],"time":["2020-09-22 11:17:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anu7df"],"id":[24552859],"kids":[24554323],"parent":[24552047],"text":["Ok.. I am going to be brave and not going to use a throwaway. I find it perplexing that HN crowd who is usually arguing for a balanced analysis and seeing both viewpoints is suddenly behaving as if this data proves some injustice is currently happening in India as well as US (in the context of Indian caste system). To be clear, India has&#x2F;had a caste system that was extremely oppressive. Currently though, the social aspects aside, economically and crucially educationally, the &quot;lower castes&quot;, have an advantage due to a system of reservations - affirmative action on steroids. I am not going to argue one way or the other as to whether the idea or the implementation of such an affirmative action policy is fair or net positive. It probably still is in principle, but in practice the people who seem to benefit from this, in my experience, are very rich &quot;lower caste&quot; families. More things to say here, but I don&#x27;t want to digress.\nThe law suit in the story has to do with IIT. So let&#x27;s take that specifically. IIT is extremely competitive to get into. It is even more competitive once you are in. It is common for affirmative action students to not do very well there. Call it a difference grit&#x2F;talent&#x2F;smartness whatever. This causes a some of them to disengage from studies altogether. Then it is not a stretch to imagine that some of them may not be very good at their job either.  The  lawsuit and the accusations of casteism has to be now taken with a huge pinch of salt. To be clear, I don&#x27;t know if any of the accusations in that lawsuit are true or not. But I do know that every middle class parent (including mine) drills into their kids the idea that you have to work freaking hard at studies to &quot;get some where&quot;. Everything about that 90 percent statistic can be explained through economics (already rich with all its advantages) or through desperation (high caste+ poor =&gt; no chance except if you work really hard). Of course I knew a few so called &quot;lower caste&quot; people in IIT who got in through the &quot;general category&quot; ie purely on merit. They were just as good as anybody there and are also doing well in the tech scene in US.\nedit:\nAdded the below sentence.<p>The cynic in me thinks this guy accuser in the lawsuit is trying to hide his incompetence by taking advantage of the BLM and current sentiments."],"time":["2020-09-22 12:24:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nirav72"],"id":[24562718],"kids":{},"parent":[24552047],"text":["I never really thought this was an issue here in the U.S.  I was born here in the U.S. But based on my very common Gujarati lastnamre, my lower caste  status is obvious.

It&#x27;s very difficult and time consuming to onboard yourself as an extension author with just the MS docs, since they don&#x27;t cover the entire API and the vast majority of data structures are undocumented entirely. This is really annoying when functions take structures as arguments and have optional fields. Descriptive naming isn&#x27;t descriptive if it describes how the argument is used by the callee, not what it means to the intent of the caller.<p>VSC also inherits the core weaknesses of Electron. Not overall performance&#x2F;memory so much as startup time (just a second ago I had to wait 3 minutes for VS Code to boot because I had too many workspaces open when my laptop&#x27;s battery died on me). It can&#x27;t open multiple windows in the same workspace (this is actually a fundamental flaw when debugging any kind of extension that needs to open its own workspace). It&#x27;s possible to build an extension that uses compiled node modules, which is great for performance and usability, but it&#x27;s officially unsupported because those modules are only compatible with the node version of a client&#x27;s VSCode.<p>But when all is said and done, VSC has shown that it&#x27;s a great platform and easy to target as an extension author (or easier than others), LSP and DAP are huge milestones, and the architecture itself is just so friendly to extension that it&#x27;s created a fantastic and lively ecosystem.<p>But petty gripe: please kill the git username&#x2F;password fields when I git clone a private repo over HTTPS in the console. I don&#x27;t like being aggro towards what other devs find cool, but I think hijacking a CLI with an extension incredibly annoying.

With languages like C, C++ or D, a lot of code isn&#x27;t known until compile time, so IDE cannot do any predictive magic. Same with refactoring, in C you can create new identifiers by preprocessor. In Java, you can ask the IDE to rename all usages of printStuff functions to printMoreStuff and you can be certain it will modify all the usages of this specific printStuff function, not the printStuff function from a different module. In dynamic typed languages the types aren&#x27;t known until runtime so it&#x27;s another struggle for IDEs.<p>That&#x27;s why VSCode is so appealing for languages other than Java&#x2F;C#.

It&#x27;s really hard to be effective in any IDE without memorizing dozens of keyboard shortcuts, which isn&#x27;t a problem for software people, because we either like this, or have grown accustomed to it. I guess that&#x27;s why the Touchbar is wildly popular outside of software engineering and related disciplines – for apps that support it, it exposes functionality directly and in a context-sensitive manner.<p>Hundreds of millions of people around the world will start programming in this decade as the world is rushing into a future where code is the stuff that most of anything outside pristine wilderness that we ever experience, is at least partially made of or faciliated by, that all social, economic, political activity rests upon.<p>There is no tooling that would be appropriate for this kind of use case – whatever will end up filling that niche, the casual programmer who doesn&#x27;t want to get deeply involved with software engineering, but get their semi-complex problems solved without tasking a team of SWEs, whatever will do this will have to be a lot cleverer, easier to use, more discoverable, more intuitive – make collaboration feel much more seamless – and still be very powerful. VS Code with its laser focus on the current developer crowd is probably not very well-suited for this."],"time":["2020-09-22 22:29:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TYPE_FASTER"],"id":[24559175],"kids":[24559293],"parent":[24558788],"text":["I pay for a personal subscription to the JetBrains suite, use IntelliJ and PyCharm all day, and have also used Visual Studio all day in the recent past.

She was our favorite that decades later I still name one of my soldiers with the same moniker in her honor. The pure joy we got out of her ability to make seemingly impossible shots stayed with me.

Connectivity became intermittent and then finally I had no internet for almost a week. Comcast wouldn&#x27;t be able to send anyone out for a month. So I started digging around for the problem.
