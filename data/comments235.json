Show that you&#x27;re aware of and care about the impact your role has on the company&#x27;s higher-level goals. That you can take initiative, drive things to completion, lead, execute quickly, handle complexity, learn over time, and make good decisions.<p>&quot;Why do you want to leave your company?&quot; People leave jobs. It&#x27;s a fact of life. If you can&#x27;t explain why you left, you seem clueless or even dodgy. Obviously if the job was still amazing for you, you&#x27;d still be there, so I can&#x27;t agree with the article&#x27;s advice to never mention anything negative. Just tell the truth, communicate it effectively, and address potential concerns. For example, if there were interpersonal issues, don&#x27;t just dwell on those -- compare to other jobs you&#x27;ve had in the past where you&#x27;ve been able to work well with others together, and stress how important it is to you to work in an environment where people can communicate well, have good intentions, and support each other.<p>These questions just aren&#x27;t that hard, and unless you have a seriously flawed track record, you don&#x27;t have to be dishonest to give great answers. More importantly, those answers should be a reflection of YOURSELF. If a company doesn&#x27;t like you, chances are you wouldn&#x27;t like them. It&#x27;s like dating. The goal is not to be a match with 100% of people. Just be your best self.<p>Corollary: If there&#x27;s a test that you find particularly hard to pass in life, your knee-jerk reaction will always be to criticize the test. But it&#x27;s important to consider your own potential shortcomings and ask, &quot;Why is this test so hard for me?&quot; That way lies self improvement."],"time":["2020-01-10 08:31:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gsich"],"id":[22008960],"kids":[22008976,22009336,22009175],"parent":[22007631],"text":["GMAFIA not FAANG.

I&#x27;ll just leave this here:<p><i>What is law? What ought it to be? What is its domain? What are its limits? Where, in fact, does the prerogative of the legislator stop?  I have no hesitation in answering, Law is common force organized to prevent injustice;—in short, Law is Justice.  It is not true that the legislator has absolute power over our persons and property, since they pre-exist, and his work is only to secure them from injury.  It is not true that the mission of the law is to regulate our consciences, our ideas, our will, our education, our sentiments, our works, our exchanges, our gifts, our enjoyments. Its mission is to prevent the rights of one from interfering with those of another, in any one of these things.<\/i><p><i>Law, because it has force for its necessary sanction, can only have the domain of force, which is justice.  And as every individual has a right to have recourse to force only in cases of lawful defense, so collective force, so which is only the union of individual forces, cannot be rationally used for any other end. The law, then, is solely the organization of individual rights that existed before law.<\/i><p>###<p><i>Legal plunder has two roots: one of them, as we have already seen, is in human greed; the other is in misconceived philanthropy.  Before I proceed, I think I ought to explain myself upon the word plunder.  I do not take it, as it often is taken, in a vague, undefined, relative, or metaphorical sense. I use it in its scientific acceptation, and as expressing the opposite idea to property. When a portion of wealth passes out of the hands of him who has acquired it, without his consent, and without compensation, to him who has not created it, whether by force or by artifice, I say that property is violated, that plunder is perpetrated. I say that this is exactly what the law ought to repress always and everywhere. If the law itself performs the action it ought to repress, I say that plunder is still perpetrated, and even, in a social point of view, under aggravated circumstances. In this case, however, he who profits from the plunder is not responsible for it; it is the law, the lawgiver, society itself, and this is where the political danger lies.<\/i><p><i>It is to be regretted that there is something offensive in the word. I have sought in vain for another, for I would not wish at any time, and especially just now, to add an irritating word to our disagreements; therefore, whether I am believed or not, I declare that I do not mean to impugn the intentions nor the morality of anybody. I am attacking an idea that I believe to be false—a system that appears to me to be unjust; and this is so independent of intentions, that each of us profits by it without wishing it, and suffers from it without being aware of the cause.<\/i><p><i>Any person must write under the influence of party spirit or of fear, who would call into question the sincerity of protectionism, of socialism, and even of communism, which are one and the same plant, in three different periods of its growth. All that can be said is, that plunder is more visible by its partiality in protectionism, 3 and by its universality in communism; whence it follows that, of the three systems, socialism is still the most vague, the most undefined, and consequently the most sincere. Be that as it may, to conclude that legal plunder has one of its roots in misconceived philanthropy, is evidently to put intentions out of the question.<\/i><p><i>With this understanding, let us examine the value, the origin, and the tendency of this popular aspiration, which pretends to realize the general good by general plunder. The Socialists say, since the law organizes justice, why should it not organize labor, instruction, and religion? Why? Because it could not organize labor, instruction, and religion, without disorganizing justice. For remember, that law is force, and that consequently the domain of the law cannot properly extend beyond the domain of force.<\/i><p>Bastiat - The Law<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;44800&#x2F;44800-h&#x2F;44800-h.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;44800&#x2F;44800-h&#x2F;44800-h.htm<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-10 20:11:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["methodiosmel"],"id":[22019299],"kids":{},"parent":[22013168],"text":["Majority of Americans are wrong."],"time":["2020-01-11 12:03:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["derp_dee_derp"],"id":[22013253],"kids":[22014416,22013463,22013842,22013716,22013388,22013370,22013390,22013328,22014052,22013465,22013475],"parent":[22013168],"text":["this is a classic case of tyranny of the majority.<p>Majority of Americans favor stealing wealth from others."],"time":["2020-01-10 19:13:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zaphod420"],"id":[22013558],"kids":[22013735],"parent":[22013168],"text":["This is good for Bitcoin."],"time":["2020-01-10 19:30:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0x8BADF00D"],"id":[22013605],"kids":[22013999,22013898,22014654,22015819],"parent":[22013168],"text":["A wealth tax is unconstitutional.

He knows that whoever got to Jupiter first would make the next jump in evolution, and why should it be these weak humans who don’t even know what they’re here for, and who refuse to acknowledge him as anything more than a string of code made to sound human? Like the monkey at the beginning picking up the bone, HAL purposefully provokes Bowman and Poole with the false AE-35 unit error to back them into the corner they ended up deciding to disconnect him from, and as a means of ejecting them from the ship while he kills the rest of the crew in hibernation. From his curious probing lines of questioning, well-chosen silences, slight evasions and lies, to his paranoid eavesdropping, calculated mass murder and fearful pleading to not be killed himself, HAL is far more intelligent and conscious than his ironically robotic human counterparts."],"time":["2020-01-11 04:23:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simonh"],"id":[22011440],"kids":{},"parent":[22000494],"text":["Well, I don&#x27;t think there is any question about it.

The end result is exactly the same, but is actually <i>better<\/i> for most customers because they will get the same level of features they needed and not have to pay that additional 2% for features they weren&#x27;t using anyway."],"time":["2020-01-10 19:31:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dsalzman"],"id":[22015176],"kids":[22017026],"parent":[22014541],"text":["“Fiat Chrysler is going to launch a new version of its Fiat 500 battery-powered vehicle in Europe this year, along with plug-in hybrid versions of its Jeep Compass, Renegade and Wrangler models.

If the defense missile systems the Iranian use were set up with auto interrogation, which is a fairly common thing, and the plane had issues with their transponder, which also happens then it is possible that the defense system cued the commercial flight as hostile or suspect and either launched a missile at the plane (not sure of Irans capabilities and limitations with their missile systems in regards to auto-fire) or an inexperienced operator with weapon release authority pressed a button to shoot a missile at what his system was telling him was a bad guy.<p>&gt; Missile systems have a series of electronic breaks (think buttons that open and close relays allowing the missile firing voltage to reach the igintor) and mechanical breaks (think keys that have to be inserted and turned to the live&#x2F;fire position). As the threat level increases the operators automate more of the process by closing these breaks. This makes for a faster response time to any threat the system identifies.<p>&gt; So was it possible that an Iranian missile system was set with the minimum number of breaks&#x2F;automated in a way a missile could have been inadvertently fired? I would say absolutely this is plausible given the attack a few hours prior with an expectation of an American response.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;worldnews&#x2F;comments&#x2F;embvsd&#x2F;pentagon_officials_and_iraqi_intelligence_confirm&#x2F;fdnpafp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;worldnews&#x2F;comments&#x2F;embvsd&#x2F;pentagon_...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-10 18:30:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["redis_mlc"],"id":[22012764],"kids":{},"parent":[22012519],"text":["You&#x27;re not going to like this but ...<p>1) Militaries routinely lock-on to passenger airliners for practise.<p>Russia is rumored to cancel the missile launch far into the sequence, though sometimes they goof up and it fires.<p>2) Airlines knowingly route over war zones to save fuel, and usually only stop after a shootdown, like the MHA flight over the Ukraine."],"time":["2020-01-10 18:31:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pp19dd"],"id":[22012877],"kids":{},"parent":[22012519],"text":["Without going into geopolitics or minimizing any deserved outrage over it and response to it, there&#x27;s a reasonable case of thinking this in terms of consequences of concentrating power.

And when I would want to do the same for some nested directory I would just select it with Enter.\nSo basically it would be great if Broot was more like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;junegunn&#x2F;fzf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;junegunn&#x2F;fzf<\/a> but not just for flat list of files."],"time":["2020-01-10 00:11:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["djsumdog"],"id":[22003574],"kids":{},"parent":[21998638],"text":["Hmm ..

Talking to Gary was always a pleasure.<p>The laser printer story is the story everyone wants to hear and you can find plenty of that on the web.<p>With Gary’s passing I have been trying to recreate in my mind what Gary was going through being the solo inventor of the laser printer.

Gary’s speciality was optics which led to him getting a job in Bausch and Lomb’s division working on lenses for high end cameras for Hollywood. This story is explained in more detail on page 7 of the 53 page document above.<p>Gary being in the Rochester was also where Kodak was located would often say “The Sky is blue, and the grass is green. No matter what you do with colors don’t break those rules.” So even when he was at Xerox he thought about color. It is part of being an expert on optics.<p>What I think Gary realized in 1967 when he had the “eureka” moment of the laser printer is if he used a laser to paint a drum the optics totally changes to a more precise addressing. He knew he could use the laser for CMYK for color printing, but first step is to do monochrome printing.<p>On page 6 of the above document, Gary discussed the use of computers to improve the optics in lens. Why can’t computers use the optics in a laser printer to print anything you want?<p>In 1992, I took the bold step of leaving Apple Computer to go work at Microsoft on Windows 3.1, being program manager for all the Far East TrueType fonts. But even though I was now in Redmond I would still see Gary in Cupertino when I would visit family and friends in the bay area. I would visit Gary to discuss imaging, fonts, DTP, and color. Five years later in 1997, Gary says he thinks it is time for him to leave Apple. I said why not come to the Windows Imaging team. He says isn’t really wet there, and he would rather stay in Saratoga. Luckily Microsoft made an offer Gary could not turn down and now we were both in Redmond in Windows group. 2-3 years later Gary moved to Microsoft Research and I think that is the happiest I have seen him when at work.<p>Gary explaining his move from Apple to Microsoft is on page 38 of the above link.<p>One nice picture that I think will get out there soon is a picture of Bill Gates at Gary Starkweather’s retirement party.

You’ll be back together in another year,’” Starkweather recalled. “I said, ‘Great, what are we supposed to do in the meantime?’”<p>But one Sunday afternoon shortly after the move Starkweather got a brainstorm while sitting at home. He immediately jumped in his car, drove to Porter Drive, and mounted a stairwell to the roof.<p>Just as he had thought, he could take line-of-sight aim from where he stood to the rooftop of Building 34. He might not be able to span the distance by cable or wire—but he could do it by laser beam.<p>The next day he ordered four telescopes from Edmund’s for about $300 apiece. He and Rider replaced the eyepieces of two with low-power lasers and the others with sensitive photodetectors. They bolted one laser scope and one detector on each roof, aiming each at its complement across the way, to create a visible light data link.<p>The circuit worked flawlessly in almost any weather, even fog, although minor adjustments were often necessary after a rainstorm, when the weight of accumulated water made the roofs sag slightly.<p>“When SLOT was running I’d send a pulse of light up the hill to signal the character generator to send a line of data down to the detector on my roof, which would send it down to this laser and then to the printer,”<p>Starkweather recalled. “After all, we were only encoding ones and zeros. It was like sending binary data on a long wire made out of light, instead of copper.”"],"time":["2020-01-09 03:14:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacquesm"],"id":[21998139],"kids":{},"parent":[21997642],"text":["I owe that man a lot.

Languages like Clojure due this to manage state. I believe the Redux also does this internally, although I&#x27;ve only studied it and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it professionally.<p>In practice, this looks like a language where everything is value-based instead of reference-based.<p>So like, in C# where you pass objects by reference, a COW language passes everything by const value. Then an imperative language statically analyzes the code to detect mutation (my own theory is that this can never be accomplished with 100% certainty, at least not with a simple implementation). So basically buffers act like Git instead of byte arrays, creating a new snapshot with every mutation.<p>Or functional languages can disallow mutation altogether, or reduce the code into its most minimal representation and handle mutation at special breaks in execution (like monads).

The simple functional implementation would look like a pure immutable Lisp running within the Actor model, handling state only through IO, and dropping monads altogether. The catch being that complex functional code might have so many breaks in execution that it would practically be happening on every single line and begin to look like an imperative language with all its flaws. This is the primary reason why I shy away from impure functional languages like Haskell, because I don&#x27;t think they have solved this core issue of mutation clearly enough (not to mention, I think functional language syntax is generally write-only and not readable by others or yourself in 6 months hahah). As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is still an open problem.<p>In another life, I want to make an imperative language that&#x27;s primarily immutable, that uses higher order functions (or better yet, statically analyzes code for side effects and converts foreach loops into higher order functions automagically), and transpiles to a purely immutable Lisp. It would be associative array-based and look like Javascript.

Similarly, you can get very nice &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;skin&quot; coloration by following the incoming ray slightly below the surface before reflecting back out, the same way this discusses having a thin layer of water would prevent some of the light from reflecting back out."],"time":["2020-01-10 01:05:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rahuldottech"],"id":[22001732],"kids":[22004722],"parent":[22001529],"text":["Related Q&#x2F;A on physics.SE: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;30366&#x2F;why-do-wet-objects-become-darker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;30366&#x2F;why-do-wet...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-09 16:02:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Zenst"],"id":[22001780],"kids":[22001859],"parent":[22001529],"text":["Short version: It changes the refraction index and less photons bounce of in the direction of the observer, so it looks darker."],"time":["2020-01-09 16:09:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fbelzile"],"id":[22001889],"kids":[22002174,22003309,22001908],"parent":[22001529],"text":["Wow, is this the same reason why you&#x27;re more prone to sunburn if you have water on you or are in a swimming pool?

This explanation seems much more likely to be correct to me.<p>Another experiment: Put some wet spots on a cloth and hold it up to a light source. More light will pass through the wet spots than the dry cloth. This certainly suggests that the reason wet cloth reflects less light is because more is passing through.

Occasionally, you could witness huge rafters of turkeys (many dozens) slowly making their way through the fields, their true numbers hidden by low hanging fog.<p>Then in my last couple years of college, the neighborhood matured further into development. The developers slowly turned the woods into meadows, the meadows into dirt fields, the dirt fields into streets, foundations, and lawns. That was the end of the fireflies; the end of the turkeys; the end of the natural beauty that once lurked there."],"time":["2020-01-10 07:06:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["severine"],"id":[22005383],"kids":[22005568],"parent":[22004998],"text":["Needs a (2017).<p>Previously on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14452832\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14452832<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-09 21:34:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["isoprophlex"],"id":[22005501],"kids":{},"parent":[22004998],"text":["What happens if you fix a couple of fireflies on one end of the volume to have a slow clock speed, and a couple on the other side to have higher clock speed?

As is the whole lecture, 5 minutes you really won&#x27;t regret.<p>&quot;We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves.  One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right.  It’s a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air.  It’s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan.  If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan’s, and the next one’s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one’s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.<p>Why didn’t they discover that the new number was higher right away?  It’s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it’s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan’s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong.  When they got a number closer to Millikan’s value they didn’t look so hard.  And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that.&quot; [1]<p>Needless to say the actual charge on an electron is very likely to have been constant over that period rather than trending steadily upward.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;calteches.library.caltech.edu&#x2F;51&#x2F;2&#x2F;CargoCult.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;calteches.library.caltech.edu&#x2F;51&#x2F;2&#x2F;CargoCult.htm<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-10 00:24:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TallGuyShort"],"id":[22003766],"kids":[22003885,22006668,22006793,22004527,22008152],"parent":[22002734],"text":["When we&#x27;re discussing relatively small changes in temperature over very long periods of time, I wonder how confident we are in those measurements?

A few other things, which is somewhat worrying.<p>I am of course willing to update my initial thoughts upon more information.

However when time, money, resources, focus, etc, are severely limited you can&#x27;t go after them all.<p>Furthermore, there may well be competitors known and unknown who can service some of the markets better than your solution, who have honed and refined their features to either be more suitable for them, or have segmented features based on various factors to do so.
