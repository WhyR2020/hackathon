Let me start from the beginning…<p>I don’t have an exact date, but within the last week I realized that I was unable to ssh into my primary web server – the one that runs my business website, activation server, etc. It’s sort of the linchpin for my tiny software company. When it goes down, I get worried.<p>At first I thought maybe the server was down? I hadn’t received any alerts, so I did a quick check. And, yes, it was still up and running and serving web traffic. Ok, did sshd somehow become unresponsive? I login through the Linode control panel and restart the service. Still can’t login.<p>It’s odd. I don’t get a connection refused. Not even a timeout. It just…hangs.<p>That’s the ssh output with the verbose flag. Nothing. I waited 10+ minutes and it never timed out or produced any other output.<p>I reboot the server itself and the problem persists.<p>Then, I notice some more oddities. I’m able to connect using ForkLift – my FTP client, which connects via SFTP. Also, SequelPro is able to connect to MySQL via ssh as well.<p>And then things get even stranger. This is all happening on my iMac. I try connecting from my laptop, and it works. My MacBook Pro is at home right next to my iMac, which is refusing to login. They’re both on the same wifi and thus the same IP. So, it can’t be that my home IP address got mistakenly banned somehow.<p>Next, I ssh into a different server and then hop to the problematic one. It connects without any trouble. At this point I’m thinking maybe the permissions on my local private key got screwed up. So, I blow away ~&#x2F;.ssh and recreate all of my keys from a backup. Still can’t login.<p>Ok. I think about it for a few minutes and then – aha! – I have an Ubuntu virtual machine running on this iMac inside Parallels. I’ll ssh into it and then try and connect. That will rule out if there’s just something odd about my iMac’s LAN IP. (To be clear, my home network is perfectly ordinary. Just a cable modem and a router.) So, I login to the VM, try and connect, and it works fine.<p>At this point here’s what I’ve found:<p>My iMac is the only machine that cannot login.\nI’ve connected successfully from behind the same public IP using a laptop, a virtual machine, and my iPhone and iPad.\nI’ve verified my ssh keys are correct and have the appropriate permissions.\nI can connect to other servers from the problematic machine – both at the same hosting provider (Linode) and others (AWS and DigitalOcean).\nI can connect from my iMac if I jump through any other server, first.\nI start trying to think what could possibly be different about this one machine. And then it dawns on me. This all started around the time I updated my iMac to 10.15.4. My laptop is still on 10.15.3 – and, of course, the virtual machine isn’t macOS at all.<p>Totally grasping for straws I google for “10.15.4 ssh” and find this top result on the Apple discussion forums:<p>Catalina 10.15.4 SSH port &gt; 8192 does not work when using server name instead of IP<p>This issue started just after upgrading to macOS Catalina 10.15.4.<p>After that update I am no longer able to open a SSH connection to a port greater than 8192 using server name (instead of IP). Yes, I do change the port on the server side prior to every test.<p>That can’t possibly be real?<p>Up until this point, I was connecting via a saved hostname defined in my ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config, which let me login simply by tying ssh some-server. So, I tried ssh ip-address -p9944 and it worked! (That server runs on an alternate ssh port.)<p>Ok. Time to narrow this down a bit further. I changed the server to listen on standard port 22 and tried connecting via the hostname once again.<p>Holy crap, it worked.<p>The user in the Apple forums was right. At least in my case, my one server that happened to be running on a non-standard ssh port above 8192 will not connect from Catalina 10.15.4 when using the hostname instead of the IP address.<p>Just to verify, I boot up a Mojave and Catalina (10.15.3) VM on the same iMac. They both connect fine, while the host machine continues to fail.<p>The internals of this is all so incredibly above my head I have no idea what the underlying problem might be. Am I and this one other forum poster just doing something totally bizarre yet the same? This ssh setup has been working for years for me until just the last week. I would love to be proven wrong and told I’m an idiot. But I don’t know what difference connecting via the hostname versus the IP address would make when specifically using a non-standard port above a certain threshold.<p>It just….sigh.<p>I’m not even going to go into it. I don’t want to end up on Hacker News again bitching about Catalina. I just hope I’ve stuffed this post with enough keywords so that anyone else searching on Google might come across the answer."],"time":["2020-03-31 18:02:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sgehly"],"id":[22738788],"kids":{},"parent":[22738590],"text":["&gt;&gt;I don’t want to end up on Hacker News again bitching about Catalina.<p>Hahaha"],"time":["2020-03-31 17:55:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["AdmiralAsshat"],"id":[22738769],"kids":[22738852],"parent":[22738590],"text":["Mental note for future blog post:  the secret to getting onto the front page of HN is to publicly state that I <i>do not<\/i> want this blog post getting onto the front page of HN."],"time":["2020-03-31 17:54:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["deeblering4"],"id":[22739056],"kids":[22739185,22739329,22739158],"parent":[22738590],"text":["&gt; I changed the server to listen on standard port 22 and tried connecting via the hostname once again.

When your company is larger and you want to be able to share knowledge using shared libraries, have a streamlined CI setup with GitLab includes from multiple departments, GitLab gets tough.<p>How could one be confident to use for example their 1-click deployment (autodevops) Feature if the implementation of CI basics like collecting test results and coverage reports have this weird taste to it?<p>I wish these features will get better and please don’t take this too harsh.

They&#x27;ve been screaming and whinging over being supposedly hard done by with respect to copyright royalties even before that arch villain, bully and saint to copyright owners, Victor Hugo, bulldozed unfair changes to copyright through the 1886 Berne Copyright Convention.<p>…And &#x27;bulldozed&#x27; is the right word; for in the early days of the 1880s consumers and end-users of copyright material essentially had no representation at the Berne Convention (as obviously one would expect), thus the power imbalance between authors&#x2F;copyright holders and consumers&#x2F;users of copyright material was so one-sided in favor of the former group that if the Berne Convention had been convened today with the same terms of reference as those in 1886 then its deliberations and decisions would likely be deemed to have arrived from corrupt processes.<p>For starters, Berne essentially never touched on matters such as the fact that authors get their ideas, life experience and knowledge mostly from the public domain and that many were even educated or gained their knowledge at public expense, and thus they should have some reciprocal if not moral obligation to the return at least some of their output back into the public domain. Instead, the Berne Convention so favored authors that they had nothing to do to justify or prove their right over the copyright of a work other than the existence of the work itself.  That means that the onus always falls on consumers&#x2F;users of copyrighted works to determine their status (Berne essentially encourages authors to &#x27;double-dip&#x27; or take from both sides, it absolves them of having any obligation to anyone but tothemselves).<p>In effect, Hugo and his cronies used shrewdness and cunning to get every damn thing they wished for out of the Berne Convention—they had carte blanche, as there was no effective opposition to their proposals.  <i>&#x27;Unfairness&#x27;<\/i> was the order of the day.<p>Trouble is, this mob was so successful at Berne that ever since they&#x27;ve assumed that they&#x27;ve a god-given right to take umbrage and raise utter hell whenever anyone takes the slightest liberties with copyright—even if those actions are lawful.<p>You&#x27;ll note there&#x27;s always one theme that perennially underpins their complaints and that&#x27;s how little the mean income that authors receive from royalties actually is.  Well my response to that is if writing etc. brings in so little income then why do they have it as their occupation?  Of course, we all know that being an author (with some exceptions) is often more a case of self-aggrandizement and wanting to be immortalized in print forever than it is to inform the world of new ideas through new works.<p>As Cory Doctorow has pointed out, one of the major problems in trying to achieve equitable copyright reform for everyone is—with the exception of authors and rights holders—that so few people are actually interested in the subject.  Despite the fact that copyright is an important issue, the lack of widespread expertise in the subject together with the fact that little serious public debate on the matter is taking place are both significant impediments to copyright reform.<p>In the meantime, the whiners will continue to bitch and whinge.

I expect this issue to be significantly worse for aircraft, with the speed they are moving at, the safety distances needed to avoid crashes, and the volume of air they are disturbing around them.

First the physical distance between the sensors and the brain Means the signals you pick up aren’t localized. Second the skin and skull are great low pass filters and filter out really interesting signals at higher frequencies, 100-2KHZ.

Sure, but the big distinction is that speech transcription must operate on an infinite number of sentences, even sentences that have never been said before. This method only has to distinguish between 30-50 sentences, and the same sentences must exist at least twice in the training set and once in the test set. Decoding word-by-word is really a roundabout way of doing a 50-way classification here.<p>It&#x27;s an invasive technique, so they need electrodes on a human cortex. This means data collection is costly, so their operating in very low data regime compared to most other seq2seq applications.

Today the equivalent would probably be having a functional language on your CV. It&#x27;s a costly signal in that you need to make a non-trivial investment in learning it to be able to claim it. It also says that what you perceive to be power is esoteric knowledge with intelligence, and you are looking for people who meet that level. Signals are also tells.<p>What fashion companies did is recognized powerful people, and watched how they signalled to one another, and then sold that to everyone else, while flattering the powerful ones enough to adopt them. Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger made billions on that.<p>Luxury goods like say, a handbag or a BMW 3-Series, are things you can pay enough for to show that you have money, or in the latter case, credit.

A function parameter that is &quot;register volatile _Atomic int&quot; is completely legal and also makes absolutely no sense if you want C to be a &quot;thin&quot; abstraction over assembly.<p>* There&#x27;s no &quot;bitcast&quot; operator that changes the type of a value without affecting the value. The most common workaround involves going through memory and praying the compiler will optimize that away (while violating strict aliasing semantics to boot).<p>* No support for multiple return values (in registers). There&#x27;s structs, but that means returning via memory because, well, see point 1.<p>* Missing machine state in the form of vector support (which is where the lack of the bitcast becomes particularly annoying). The floating-point environment is also commonly poorly supported.<p>* Missing operations such as popcount, cttz, simultaneous div&#x2F;rem, or rotates.<p>* Traps are UB instead of having more predictable semantics.<p>* No support for various kinds of coroutines. setjmp&#x2F;longjmp is the limit.

It can&#x27;t run a lot of cells at once, but at least it&#x27;s slow enough to watch it compute.

Signal crossing is difficult with this rule, which doesn&#x27;t directly support it, so you have to &quot;emulate it in software&quot; with multi-celled machines or &quot;organs&quot;. Here are a few different ways of dealing with signal crossing, each with their own problems and limitations.<p>Buckley&#x27;s paper about these gadgets is called &quot;Signal crossing solutions in von Neumann self-replicating cellular automata&quot;. The Wikipedia page discusses some of it and links to the paper, but the link is broken. So here is the paper about it on archive.org, on page 453:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20081209155223&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncomp.uwe.ac.uk&#x2F;free-books&#x2F;automata2008reducedsize.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20081209155223&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncomp.uw...<\/a><p>or (faster download):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;documents&#x2F;automata2008reducedsize.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;documents&#x2F;automata2008reducedsiz...<\/a><p>The Real Time Crossing (Buckley, p. 457, The real-time crossing organ) is like a road intersection that splits the two crossing lanes, then uses traffic lights to give cars in each pair of lanes alternating turns to cross, and then merges the lanes back together (since each intersection works at 50% throughput, you need to split, use two of them, and merge -- Factorio and Satisfactory players will get what I mean, in terms of conveyor belts, splitters and mergers, and conveyor belt throughput).<p>The description of the real time crossing, &quot;This real time crossing is not easily constructible, but nonetheless here it is&quot;, is a reference to the fact that you can only construct non-excited cells (you&#x27;d get electrocuted if you tried to construct machines with the power on, so to speak -- it may be possible to kludge it with some simple machines, but in general it&#x27;s extremely impractical if not impossible -- see Buckley p. 470).<p>And after you&#x27;ve constructed a machine in a powered-down state, then you have to excite just the right cells at just the right time, to get the machine to work. But that&#x27;s impossible with this real time signal crossing machine! So it&#x27;s like a beautiful tiny crystal alien artifact with perfectly blinking lights, that the laws of physics practically prohibit from ever being constructed, but there it is.<p>The Real Time Crossing depends on having a certain synchronized configuration of excited cells in it, acting as synchronized clocks or traffic lights that start and stop all the traffic at just the right time so the cars don&#x27;t collide.<p>It&#x27;s not actually possible for a universal constructor to construct a real time crossing, because it can&#x27;t reach in through existing cells and excite internal cells from outside. It&#x27;s essentially like a &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; configuration, that had to have been constructed by the Hand of God, and can&#x27;t be copied or constructed, or used as part of a reproducible machine. Essentially it has a &quot;spark of life&quot; that is beyond the ability of creatures living in the world to ignite.

You can use these to solve the signal crossing problem, without needing the intervention of a benevolent God to power up all your traffic lights with the right synchronization. It actually has a &quot;boot up&quot; sequence: you first send it a &quot;reset&quot; signal, and part of it is used to initialize all the clocks the first time it&#x27;s run, then it fires a bunch of &quot;explosive bolts&quot; that cut off the auto-initialization circuitry, and start up the exclusive or gate, after all its clocks have been initialized. It&#x27;s literally self modifying code, that pokes itself after it boots, to switch into run mode!

Mechanisms used are signal sampling, portal closure, clock\nsynchronisation, and staged initialisation. Our implementation uses three separate start signals; a staged initialisation. Each clock of the rtco has a separate\nauto-initialisation circuit. Signal to a stage is intercepted from a suitable path of\nchannel A, by an interposing confluent state, or portal, and directed to the pulser\nof the adjacent auto-initialisation circuit by an auxiliary path. Pulser output is\ndirected to clock input; and to a special transmission path constructor, which\nis addressed shortly. Clock signal for the entire organ is suitably synchronised,\nas initialisation of the first clock pair occurs simultaneously upon input of the\nfirst start pulse. All subsequent initialisations occur given knowledge of timing\nfor the first two clocks. In this way, synchronisation becomes a trivial concern.\nFigure 17 shows the auto-initialisable rtco.<p>&gt;Fig. 17. The rtco, configured for auto-initialisation. The minimum start signal for this organ is 10^13 10^32 1, which is applied once to Ai. The organ begins crossing\nsignal 30 clock ticks later. This organ can be started at the time of construction; there is no start signal propagation. All signal crossing paths impose equal delay.\nThe organ has 18×18 dimensions. This configuration can be marginally reduced in area."],"time":["2020-03-31 15:04:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mtm7"],"id":[22733783],"kids":[22733951],"parent":[22729860],"text":["I&#x27;ve been following your site for a few weeks, and I just love it.

Once you also add sounds, you might hit several problems you might have not thought of:<p>1. the tab is opened in the background and the user is trying to find the one that&#x27;s using the speaker,\n2. the volume is mismanaged because some other tab is playing their sounds too silently and yours will make the user&#x27;s ears explode,\n3.

Next I clipped some leaves from the plants and we went down to the garden shop a few blocks away and, sure enough, the guy behind the counter (kicking myself I can&#x27;t remember his name, probably 85 or so with crystal white hair) gave the diagnosis and recommended cutting off all the affected leaves and burning them.

I took the time to get to know a few of my favorite writers.. here are their stories...<p>- Several are working in countries where they cannot get a work permit (cannot support themselves via legal means)<p>- I&#x27;m almost certain several of my writers have criminal convictions, which blocks you from most white collar jobs.<p>- Many of the rest are the victims of age discrimination, where hiring managers &quot;just prefer&quot; to hire younger people or decided that anyone &quot;out of the workforce&quot; a few years must surely be damaged goods.<p>If you can write passable text, Textbroker really doesn&#x27;t care who you are. That&#x27;s huge benefit, in terms of getting access to work and being able to put a gig on your resume.<p>By the way, they&#x27;re not the only game in town. Another good option for US writers is Constant Content, which allows you to publish &amp; market pieces in a &quot;catalog&quot; at higher rates. I&#x27;m a writer on that platform.<p>But since people are agitated about the money side, let&#x27;s talk about that topic.<p>Are there higher paying freelance writer opportunities? Certainly. Take a look at Problogger or Media bistro. However, get ready to spend unpaid time pitching... and chasing people for payment. (so a bunch of unpaid hours and social stress from pitching, plus the risk of unpaid work)<p>Upwork is another option, although the competition can get pretty brutal. I&#x27;ve found I can buy content for less on Upwork than Textbroker. Too many people want the same gig. I tried applying to a few gigs as a specialist contractor and was blown out of the water on rates (50% - 80% below what I was asking for). I will say a few folks have found a way to make it work, usually for high end specialty roles.<p>Where TextBroker excels is as a dumping ground for unused time. Go chase higher paying gigs... and if you can&#x27;t sell a full book of work, Textbroker gives you a way to recover some of the value of that time.<p>Also... there are some highly productive ($$&#x2F;hour) writers on Textbroker. I worked with a few of them to assemble an article on how to level up your earnings at a content mill.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highestpayinggigs.com&#x2F;freelance-writing&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highestpayinggigs.com&#x2F;freelance-writing&#x2F;<\/a><p>It walks through how to go from making minimum wage (as a entry level writer) to about $40 - $50 per hour (between productivity hacking, direct orders, and leveling up the quality rate). And shows you how to recycle your work to build your own websites as a longer term investment.<p>Is it my life plan? Nah, I&#x27;d rather go write software and do data science. But in case of emergency, that is most definitely something on my to-do list....<p>The part I really admire about TextBroker is the relative openness of their market for people who are otherwise not able to participate in the regular labor market. This includes:<p>- Unable to work a traditional 8 hour shift in person<p>- Travel &#x2F; Visa restrictions<p>- Criminal Record<p>- Lack of &quot;credentials&quot;<p>- Socially Awkward &#x2F; Interview Challenges<p>- Ageism &#x2F; Lifestyle Discrimination<p>The latter is significant to me personally, since it became very apparent a few years ago that I was an &quot;increasingly undesirable candidate&quot; to many employers due to my age.<p>It may be illegal, but nobody is enforcing it...."],"time":["2020-04-01 01:49:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wgx"],"id":[22745933],"kids":[22746494],"parent":[22734447],"text":["Textbroker appears to only allow signups from authors in the US."],"time":["2020-04-01 07:19:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["z3t4"],"id":[22746262],"kids":{},"parent":[22734447],"text":["The only ones earning money on gig works are the platforms."],"time":["2020-04-01 08:31:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pryelluw"],"id":[22743775],"kids":[22743805],"parent":[22734447],"text":["I appreciate this piece as it&#x27;s another option that some acquaintances can look into to help weather the current economic storm."],"time":["2020-04-01 01:11:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Veen"],"id":[22742958],"kids":[22743142],"parent":[22734447],"text":["Textbroker is content mill on the same model as hundreds of content mills before it.

It is basically mathematical modeling and optimization of real world operational and logistics problems. It&#x27;s so mathematically oriented that it typically is in the mathematics or science departments in universities, as opposed to management. But it is very much an applied specialization of math, directly applicable to supply chain management and other business&#x2F;logistics areas.<p>Interestingly, the bullwhip effect is extremely similar to another problem that a lot of people here have a casual interest in: the traveling wave phenomenon of traffic. The requisite similarities are the same. In order for the pattern to appear, there have to be independent actors with cascading delays in the aquisition of information about the future, and a mismatch in the ability to stop production (decelerate) and start production (accelerate). The severity of those traveling waves may change with changes in the severity of the required conditions, but as long as those conditions exist, the traveling waves will always occur.<p>Interesting consequences also apply. It is mathematically provable that autonomously controlled vehicles cannot get rid of traveling traffic waves. There will always be a delay in information about what lies ahead, whether it is via the limitations of line of sight, or the latency of radio-based communication. And production cars will always stop faster than they accelerate, because stopping has a safety necessity that doesn&#x27;t exist for acceleration.<p>Autonomous cars may have faster reaction times than humans, but at highway speeds reaction times are typically 20% or less of stopping times. Therefore they can slightly mitigate the problem. However, notice how everybody talks about how autonomous cars can travel closer together. What this effectively means is that cars can travel closer to the extent that their reaction times are better. This improves unperterbed throughput slightly, but it would actually make the shock-induced traveling waves worse. All it takes is for a stray plastic bag to wander into the roadway and a car to think it&#x27;s a dog and brake for it.

You optimize to &quot;cut the fat&quot; regularly, stay with the trends and try to be the front-runner in everything.

First, the interviewer had a bad internet connection which made it hard to understand her (I asked her to turn off her video to help, which she did), 2nd she jumped immediately to the problem without introducing herself or anything which made it feel like she was in a rush, 3rd she simply started reciting her problem statement, which was hard to make sense of because of her bad internet connection. I asked her if we could write it down in the shared google doc, so she proceeded to copy&#x2F;paste a blob of text that seemed to be taken from the _middle of a problem statement_. It had no context and no actual instruction like “write a function that will calculate x and y”. My NDA unfortunately prevents me from sharing the actual thing. Because of this, I did not know what I was supposed to do. I asked her multiple times “so, should I write a function to do this and this?” and she kept reciting the ambiguous problem statement over and over in an impatient and dismissive manner. I felt completely out of place. Then when I finally started making a little bit of progress on guessing what she actually wanted me to do, I started hearing background noise of someone chopping vegetables, and moving things around: extremely distracting. I would ask her specific questions and from her lag in answering and her short 2 words answers I just know she wasn’t paying attention. It took all the strength in me to not tell her how disrespectful it felt to be interviewing with someone that clearly did not want to be here and wasn’t paying attention. At the end of the interview I thanked her a lot, smiled big and swallowed my pride.<p>I left for our 1 hour break and took a walk to reset my emotions and tell myself that the interview could still go well and that I still had my chances.<p>The 3rd interview went well. The interviewer had a good connection, a good mic, was understandable, introduced himself and even said “before we start, I want to remind you that if one of your interviews went bad, don’t sweat it, it’s all fine. We’re here to have a conversation. I’m not looking for a right or wrong answer, I just want to see your thought process”. It took him literally 2 minutes to set me up for success. He then proceeded to give me a problem statement, with some context around it, and we started proceeding to _have a real conversation_. I wrote code that, according to my interviewer, compiled correctly and was close to the actual code it was based off of. I left this interview feeling good<p>4th  interview went bad. Interviewer was 10 minutes late and had a bad connection, but aside from that introduced himself correctly, gave me a clear problem statement and although did not talked much at all during the interview, he did give me a few hints here and there. The reason I failed is that  I couldn’t solve a simple algorithm and started panicking internally. All on me. I left the interview hoping the next one would go better.<p>5th (and last) interview went meh. It was a system design interview. I was hoping to be having a conversation with the interviewer but he just was speaking much at all.<p>I hung up and cried a little. It’s really hard emotionally to accept this.<p>Before my Google interviewed I got rejected by AirBnB, Twitter told me they don’t think a senior role is adequate and will see if they have “mid-level” roles (which is totally fine, but I’m left wondering if that’s not just a way of rejecting my candidacy), and I cancelled Facebook because what Airbnb taught me is that I’m just not ready. That’s not a lot of interviews you’ll tell me, but I spent _months_ preparing.<p>Because I know my algorithm and problem solving skills are lesser, I spent hours studying on leetcode, reading an operating systems book, reviewed “cracking the coding interview”, reviewed “introduction to algorithms”, re-read some chapters of “TCP&#x2F;IP illustrated”, spent hours watching system design videos, hours watching algorithm videos. I spent $5000 on an interviewing&#x2F;algorithm bootcamp.<p>I know that I am not a bad engineer. I started programming at 10 years old (I’m 33), taught myself VB, C and C++ (though I haven’t coded in these for many years now). Computers have been my life’s passion. I designed my former’s company infrastructure and made it scalable and resilient. I was a major influencer in my team and my coworkers trusted me. I know I’m a good system administrator; I might be less good a developer but I know how to code well; I know how to influence my coworker into following best practices, reading&#x2F;writing documentation, being security conscious; I stay informed on the latest trends, I try new technologies, learn new languages, not even out of necessity but because that’s what I love.<p>But none of this seems to be enough.<p>And maybe it really isn’t for a company like Google. And maybe I wouldn’t be successful at Google if they hired me.<p>What I know is that these past 3 months have left me with little confidence about my skills and just wondering if I’m cut out for this. I’m trying hard to not feel defeated, but damn, that hiring bar in FAANG interviews can really make you feel like crap."],"time":["2020-03-31 21:24:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["drewcoo"],"id":[22745327],"kids":[22745504],"parent":[22739605],"text":["Actual professional engineers don&#x27;t have strange, gamified interviews to guess someone&#x27;s skill level.<p>Is all of this modelling the problem of the hiring bar or training to beat it really solving the right problem?\nDo any of the solutions to this constructed problem actually work reliably or are they just elevator close buttons, frobs that may not really function but provide a sense of control?"],"time":["2020-04-01 05:23:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bdcravens"],"id":[22740804],"kids":{},"parent":[22739605],"text":["The best kind of practice is the kind you get paid for.

Lol I can totally relate. And I believe a lot of people on cscareerquestions subreddit and people at Leetcode forum can relate. 100%? Accurate.<p>Also, just to give a context of the hiring bar these days. The FAANG companies coding question is no longer on Easy even on phone interview. Expect at minimum 2 Medium difficulty questions in a phone interview that need to be able to be solved in optimal space time complexity in under 45 mins (or more precisely, under 20 mins each because if the first question is not solvable under 20 mins then they will skip that and you already failed).<p>So for those FAANG engineers that were able to get in early, whether by acquihire, by diversity hire, by luck, by normal hire. Stay there as long as you can especially in today’s times. Because once you quit you’ll experience a rude awakening for getting right back in, unless those companies waive you in because you’ve been in before.<p>And yea, I’m talking for both fresh graduates as well. There are instances where a fresh graduate get 4 out of 5 hard leetcode questions in an onsite. Yea, its that crazy.<p>I&#x27;m strictly speaking from personal experience and by reading subreddit cscareerquestions and Leetcode forum on people&#x27;s experiences.<p>So at this point, a lot of people (including me) already solved hundreds of Leetcode questions, and still got rejected. So this is now a luck of the draw game, apply to those companies every year (because once you get rejected then you are not allowed to apply within a year), one day you will get your lucky strike.<p>One way to maximize your luck if you really want to get in, assuming that you are not lucky, not part of diversity hire, not part of acquihire:\n- internship\n- contract work<p>Damn I have to EDIT so many times lol. But due to this Leetcode style training that a lot of us are going through, we literally have less time to learn anything else, for example, learning new libraries, new frameworks. I personally think learning new frameworks or libraries are kinda dumb because it is easy to pick up on the job anyway, but nevertheless when you want to look for a job you need these on your resume. Say you only know REST but now companies want gRPC and Protobuf then you gotta learn those on the side. Assuming that you are a normal working person with hobbies, families, responsibilities, activities on the side you need to pick your choices carefully.<p>So this has an interesting result. The more you prepare for FAANG and doing Leetcode style questions, the less time you prepare for mid-tier companies and the lesser the chance you will get a better offer from them.

What interests me is more the pessimist. Pessimism is certainly the minority but it has been found that the pessimist view point is more in line with reality.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting excerpt about the topic from a book called &quot;Learned optimism&quot;:<p><i>Overall, then, there is clear evidence that nondepressed people distort \nreality in a self-serving direction and depressed people tend to see reality \naccurately. How does this evidence, which is about depression, tie into \noptimism and pessimism? Statistically, most depressed people score in the \npessimistic range of explanatory style, and most nondepressed people score \noptimistically. This means that, on average, optimistic people will distort \nreality and pessimists, as Ambrose Bierce defined them, will “see the world \naright.” The pessimist seems to be at the mercy of reality, whereas the \noptimist has a massive defense against reality that maintains good cheer \nin the face of a relentlessly indifferent universe. It is important to remember, however that this relationship is statistical, and that pessimists do not \nhave a lock on reality. Some realists, the minority, are optimists, and some \ndistorters, also the minority, are pessimists.<p>Is depressive accuracy just a laboratory curiosity? I don’t think so. Rather \nit leads us to the very heart of what pessimism is really about. It is our \nfirst solid clue about why we have depression at all, the closest we’ve come \nto an answer to the question asked earlier: why evolution has allowed \npessimism and depression to survive and prosper. If pessimism is at the \nbase of depression and suicide, if it results in lower achievement, and as \nwe will see, in poor immune function and in ill health, why didn’t it die \nout epochs ago? What counterweighting function does pessimism serve for \nthe human species?<p>The benefits of pessimism may have arisen during our recent evolutionary \nhistory. We are animals of the Pleistocene, the epoch of the ice ages. Our \nemotional makeup has most recently been shaped by one hundred thousand \nyears of climactic catastrophe: waves of cold and heat; drought and flood; \nplenty and sudden famine. Those of our ancestors who survived the Pleistocene may have done so because they had the capacity to worry incessantly \nabout the future, to see sunny days as mere prelude to a harsh winter, to \nbrood. We have inherited these ancestors’ brains and therefore their capacity to see the cloud rather than the silver lining.<p>Sometimes and in some niches in modern life, this deep-seated pessimism \nworks. Think about a successful large business. It has a diverse set of \npersonalities serving different roles. First, there are the optimists. The \nresearchers and developers, the planners, the marketers—all these need \nto be visionaries. They have to dream things that don’t yet exist, to explore \nboundaries beyond the company’s present reach. If they don’t, the competition will.

After breathing in a mask for a while, the outside is now &quot;potentially contaminated&quot; with COVID19. Treat the outside of a mask as if it were infected.<p>Do NOT touch the mask while using it. Do NOT rub your eyes, etc. etc. Do NOT put on the mask backwards. It is recommended to color-code the inside and outside to make it easier to see.<p>2. There are a ton of discussions about how to disinfect a cloth mask. Kitchen equipment is commonly recommended. Boiling the mask, letting it sit in the oven for some time, etc. etc. You only need to raise the temperature to ~212F or so (boiling) to disinfect. (maybe lower, but boiling is easy because the bubbling water serves as a temperature gauge).<p>There may be easier chemical treatments, such as bleach when you&#x27;re washing the cloth mask. But boiling is obviously safe.<p>----------<p>Note that &quot;N95&quot; masks are only 95% effective against viruses (even if you did everything correctly). Homemade masks will probably only reach 70% or maybe as low as 50%. You aren&#x27;t invulnerable, you just have a layer of protection on.<p>I think this &quot;home made mask&quot; idea is very good.
