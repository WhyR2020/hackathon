However Wikipedia[1] tells me the average USA &quot;consumer&quot; is watching 4 hours <i>a day<\/i>! Yikes.<p>To a layman like me this seems like great research. A lot of effort was put in to draw a rigorous conclusion about the effects of TV watching on some aspect of mental performance. I just read <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death<\/i> though, and I find myself compelled to be a lot more dramatic about the negatives of TV watching, on the late author&#x27;s behalf.<p>Yes it&#x27;s pretty bad that (excessive) TV watching literally damages your cognitive ability to some degree, but I would say (and please point me to research) that before that damage starts to show it&#x27;s already near devastated your personal &#x27;knowledge-base&#x27;. To try and paraphrase Postman, the content on TV is either trivial or non-trivial but delivered in such a way as to keep you from holding onto any significance, meaning, or theory. TV as a medium is terribly fractured (commercial breaks, &#x27;Now..This&#x27; segues) and fundamentally visual (rather than typographic). Human minds thrive in connectivity, interrelation, and continuity. Our minds thrive in the typographic world. At his most polemic, Postman argues that TV at is worst is totally incoherent, conferring basically no knowledge whatsoever. A person&#x27;s mind might still performance just fine in tests, but having been starved of knowledge it is practically unintelligent.<p>Think also of the opportunity cost. At an average of 4 hours a day, as USA &#x27;consumer&#x27; watches 1460 hours of TV a year. An average person reads 200-250 words per minute. Taking the upper bound, and the average non-fiction book as 50,000 words. They could finish that average non-fiction book in 4.16 hours. So, they could be reading <i>almost 1 book a day for a whole year instead<\/i>. Now, that napkin-math result seems implausible to me, but imagine if I was off by an order of magnitude. Say this person could read 35 non-fiction books in a year if that wholesale swapped TV for reading non-fiction. 35 non-fiction books at ~42 hours per book. They would be enormously enriched by this alternative behaviour.<p>As an extreme (but unfortunately not uncommon) example, instead of getting all red in the face hearing about Socialism coming to the USA from Fox news, our dear average USA &#x27;consumer&#x27; could have read <i>Das Kapital<\/i>, and <i>The Soul of Man Under Socialism<\/i>, and <i>The Road to Wigan Pier<\/i>, and <i>Capitalism and Freedom<\/i>, and <i>On Liberty<\/i>, and... etc etc. You get the point.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m really onboard with the thesis of <i>Amusing Ourselves To Death<\/i>.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Television_consumption\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Television_consumption<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-05 09:45:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gingerlime"],"id":[21961082],"kids":[21961292],"parent":[21960001],"text":["Interesting that the threshold is at 3.5. 3 hours or less is fine.<p>I wonder if there’s a way to have TVs with watch timers.

For example, the series I&#x27;m in the middle of is on LiveView and the next in my queue is on Absinthe&#x2F;GraphQL. I knew <i>nothing<\/i> about LiveView a year ago and spent a good amount of time last spring struggling with various Absinthe-related tasks. A year from now there will be even more &quot;must-learn&quot; libraries.<p>2) The intersection of development and marketing: as a developer, there are marketing systems I can build by myself that would be very difficult for most smaller online businesses to do, but also highly valuable. I&#x27;ve been taking some of Brennan Dunn&#x27;s courses (working on his ConvertKit course at the moment) and it&#x27;s been one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made.<p>3) Rust: I don&#x27;t have any business reason to learn Rust at the moment. However, it&#x27;s a particularly good complement to Elixir. Elixir&#x27;s strengths are stability and productivity, but it&#x27;s a bit weak in brute force number crunching. Compiling natively invoked functions in C&#x2F;C++ has been a thing for a long time, but at a terrible cost. If those functions trigger an exception, they can take down the entire EVM, negating the famous stability of Erlang&#x2F;Elixir. Rust, on the other hand, is very good at making the most of the CPU and memory available in a manner that guarantees safety. So NIFs written in Rust can be used in Elixir projects without fear!<p>I&#x27;m also interested in using Rust with WASM, so there are multiple ways I can see learning it paying off down the road.<p>For anyone out there learning Elixir: You might want to check out Alchemist Camp.

Fastly released their wasm compiler and VM, Lucet, last year; it can spawn new evaluation contexts about an order of magnitude faster than Linux can spawn processes.  For security, that&#x27;s potentially a big deal, because it means you don&#x27;t have to reuse those evaluation contexts.<p>Golang is very practical for building systems.  But it&#x27;s worthless for building libraries except for Golang.  Rust seems poised to displace C and C++ as the standard language to write libraries you can invoke from any language, and you&#x27;ll be able to get better performance with Rust than with Golang.  Maybe it&#x27;s going to be as practical as Golang for writing systems too, I don&#x27;t know.  Parametric polymorphism is definitely a point on Rust&#x27;s side.<p>Computer security in general is a really big deal.  Unfortunately, 95% of the market is fake, like, 19th-century patent-medicine fake.  Sooner or later the people who are doing real security instead of fake security will come out on top, but possibly only after the next major war.<p>Observable (d3.express) looks like it&#x27;s probably going to be the way people write software in ten years.  But probably not on ObservableHQ&#x27;s SaaS offering, which may mean not in Observable&#x27;s language.<p>If you&#x27;re writing stuff on the JVM, use Kotlin or Clojure, not Java.  There is literally no reason to use Java rather than Kotlin except if your cow-orkers don&#x27;t know Kotlin yet.  Despite its heavy costs, the JVM is a really useful skill to have in your utility belt, because of Android and because of all the libraries already available on the JVM.<p>Embedded development is really hot, and getting more so, as computers get smaller, cheaper, and lower power.  You can get a computer now for less money than a <i>transistor<\/i>, if the computer is one of those 4¢ Padauk OTP jobbies and the transistor is a common transistor like a 2N7000.  Right now this is all done in C, C++, and Arduino; Rust might get there soon, but the JVM won&#x27;t.<p>By default, for embedded development, you should probably be using a BluePill or an Espressif board (with the Arduino IDE, if that&#x27;s what you like) rather than an old AVR-based Arduino.  The STM32 line used on the BluePill has an amazing selection of chips; the GigaDevice GD32 line of STM32 clones looks really appealing, but I don&#x27;t have any yet.  It looks like GigaDevice is going to offer a RISC-V version.<p>That&#x27;s at the low end; at the high end, we have unprecedented computing power available, but generally no way to program it effectively, as in the days of the 1970s &quot;software crisis&quot;.  The things we know about that do get real benefits from this massive computing power include signal-processing algorithms, linear algebra, and artificial neural networks.  Probably learning about numerical methods and signal-processing algorithms would be a good idea.  The software tools (Numpy, Octave, Tensorflow, GLSL, CUDA) are important but secondary.<p>Provers got a lot better in the last decade; Lean, based on Coq&#x27;s CoC, is good enough that Kevin Buzzard is making real progress in formalizing mathematics with it.  People are also making real headway with HoTT-based systems.  It&#x27;s becoming practical to actually do machine-checked proofs for the first time, which means maybe we can automate a lot of the reasoning process involved in programming.<p>Speaking of which, Hypothesis can get you a significant amount of that extra reasoning power already, despite not attempting sound reasoning; if you&#x27;re not using Hypothesis or something similar for your testing, you should be.  It&#x27;s worth writing a Python binding for your C or C++ project so you can test it with Hypothesis.  (Alloy and TLA+ might be similarly useful as a way to verify higher-level models; Alloy, like Hypothesis, only looks for counterexamples, but it evidently finds them often enough to be very useful.)<p>SAT&#x2F;SMT solvers like Z3 can be applied to constraint satisfaction.  If you&#x27;re not familiar with constraint satisfaction, basically the idea is that instead of writing the implementation, you write the tests, and the solver figures out the implementation for you.  This is the way virtually all parametric 3-D CAD models are done, which is itself an increasingly interesting area, precisely because the cost of embedded computers is now low enough that we can surround ourselves with enchanted objects.<p>In terms of webdev, the most interesting thing I&#x27;ve seen lately (other than ObservableHQ) is Streamlit; it&#x27;s a lot like React or redo, but running on the server side to render a webpage.<p>Who knows what&#x27;s going to happen with cryptocurrencies, but you should at least play a bit with Bitcoin."],"time":["2020-01-06 02:36:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["timwaagh"],"id":[21962945],"kids":{},"parent":[21961214],"text":["For Java I think Enterprise application servers remain key.

I&#x27;ve always wanted to try this.  The only real complaint I have is that &quot;da&quot; is not actually a copula in the strictest sense.  It&#x27;s a contraction of &quot;de aru&quot;.  Similarly &quot;na&quot; is not a modifier.  It&#x27;s a contraction of &quot;ni aru&quot;.  &quot;aru&quot; is the verb which is the closest you get to a copula in Japanese - it means &quot;it exists&quot; for non-animate noun-phrases.<p>So if you say &quot;sakana da&quot;, it does mean &quot;It is fish&quot;, but so does just &quot;sakana&quot;.  The copula is implied.  The &quot;da&quot; is completely optional and is actually only added for emphasis -- the literal translation is kind of like &quot;That it is fish exists&quot;.  In literary Japanese you would say &quot;sakana de aru&quot;, &quot;de&quot; being the particle that links a verb the the means with which the verb is executed.  For example &quot;basu de iku&quot; means &quot;will go by bus&quot; -- bus is the means by which we will go.  In &quot;sakana de aru&quot; or &quot;sakana da&quot; we are basically saying that &quot;fish&quot; is the means of its existence.<p>The &quot;na&quot; modifier is also interesting.  It is really &quot;ni aru&quot; where &quot;ni&quot; is essentially the &quot;direction&quot; in which something exists.  &quot;Something like a fish&quot; would be &quot;sakana no you&quot;.  If you want to say &quot;It is a fragrance something like a fish&quot; you could say &quot;sakana no you na kaori&quot;.  Although I&#x27;m not aware of any modern Japanese that would express it like this, this is equivalent to &quot;sakana no you ni aru kaori&quot; -- &quot;It is a fragrance that exists in the direction like a fish&quot;.  Hopefully you can understand.<p>The interesting part of this is that adding &quot;ni aru&quot; to the end of a noun phrase just turns it into a verb phrase.  And the even more interesting bit is that the only thing that can modify a noun phrase is a verb phrase.<p>But, you may have heard of &quot;i-adjectives&quot; -- these are adjectives that end in i.  In actuality, these are not adjectives!  They are verb phrases!  So the word &quot;cute&quot; is &quot;kawaii&quot;.  However, the actual word is &quot;kawai&quot; and the <i>inflection<\/i> is &quot;i&quot;.  That&#x27;s why when you want to say &quot;not cute&quot; it becomes &quot;kawaiku nai&quot; -- the &quot;i&quot; turns into &quot;ku&quot; because you are inflecting a verb.<p>This in turn is why you modify nouns directly with &quot;i-adjectives&quot;.  &quot;kawai sakana&quot;, or &quot;cute fish&quot;.  Other adjectives are actually noun phrases in Japanese.  &quot;yumei na sakana&quot; or &quot;famous fish&quot;.  This is, again, exactly the same as &quot;yumei ni aru sakana&quot; -- &quot;The fish exists in the direction of fame&quot;.<p>So the rules are even simpler than presented in this blog post.<p>By the way, for anyone trying to learn Japanese and who wants to go beyond phrase-book level: learn plain form first and polite form later (if ever).  Japanese makes absolutely no sense if you learn polite form first.  It&#x27;s incredibly logical (even the polite form extensions) if you start with plain form."],"time":["2020-01-05 07:41:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ngcc_hk"],"id":[21960122],"kids":{},"parent":[21959115],"text":["Interesting.

But, as someone who knows both Japanese and a variety of programming languages, I&#x27;ve always seen the &quot;seams&quot; of Japanese a bit differently. I&#x27;ve always thought of Japanese as a stack-based language, like Forth.<p>A refresher on Forth: in Forth, you run a lexer over text input to get a stream of tokens; but you don&#x27;t run a parser (or at least not much of one) over the tokens to get an AST. Instead, each lexeme—each &quot;word&quot; in Forth—self-describes as either a literal or a symbol representing a function call. All words the lexer encounters are immediately &quot;run&quot; using the runtime. Structured programming (like defining functions and then later calling them) is enabled by having the runtime itself be a finite-state machine, that can be put in different states by the execution of certain words, such that all words that are executed in the new state are executed to different effect (e.g. the word `[` will make all words up to a matching `]` have the execution semantics of pushing their symbolic representation onto the stack, sort of like a Lisp quote; the `]` itself then captures what&#x27;s on the stack and builds a function, sort of like the `defmodule` macro does in Elixir.)<p>Analogously, in Japanese, most words are literals, that just push themselves onto the stack; while there are two types of &quot;active&quot; words: grammatical particles and verbs. Each particle is a construction function, which attempts to match and consume a certain shape of existing words on the stack, pushing back a tagged structure in its place; and then verbs consume a particular set of tagged structures from the stack (varying by verb), in any order, leaving on the stack anything they didn&#x27;t expect, and pushing back a representation of the structured meaning of the sentence-as-a-whole up to that point.<p>I think this is well-represented by showing how Japanese does quotation:<p><U+4E0A><U+53F8><U+306F><U+300C><U+79C1><U+306F><U+5F7C><U+304C><U+597D><U+304D><U+3058><U+3083><U+306A><U+3044>!<U+300D><U+3068><U+8A00><U+3063><U+305F><U+3002><p>To transliterate and rewrite this in a Forth-like grammar, with grammatical particles as lower-case keyword symbols, verbs as upper-case bare symbols, and everything else as quoted literal words:<p>&quot;Boss&quot; :subject [ &quot;I&quot; :subject &quot;him&quot; :referent DISLIKE NEGATION ] :cons SAID.<p>Note that, in this particular case, the brackets are sugar here: the sentence would have the same semantics without them. (They&#x27;re helpful to visually disambiguate where you should mentally backtrack to, but it&#x27;s clear by the fact that there&#x27;s two :subject-particles that the inner verb DISLIKE is only going to capture the last-pushed one, leaving the previously-pushed one on the stack for SAID to later consume.)<p>One could also describe this as what a shift-reduce parser does internally, but with the reduction edges triggered as explicit command-words in the input lexeme stream, rather than being triggered implicitly by non-conflicting pattern-matches.<p>And this is <i>also<\/i>, as it happens, the core of any pure-functional abstract-machine bytecode ISA (e.g. Erlang&#x27;s BEAM bytecode ISA.) You&#x27;ve got ops that push literals; ops that take patterns of stuff off the stack and push back new product-types containing those same things; and ops for calls to (maybe-built-in) functions named by a pushed symbol term."],"time":["2020-01-05 18:04:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21960081],"kids":{},"parent":[21959115],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-05 07:56:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["nekopa"],"id":[21960534],"kids":[21961274,21961930,21960768],"parent":[21954477],"text":["A very interesting article, with some great linked resources, thanks for posting.

I was never a tab completion person, but gopls changed my mind.  It&#x27;s fast and works really well.  Jump to definition and related functionality also works very well.  One keystroke to see the source code of any function you call is great.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t use gopls, then it will probably break in every corner case like previous tools did.  When modules first came out, you had to go like 3 forks deep in &quot;gocode&quot; (the previous completion provider) because the original author stopped caring at go 1.10, then the person who forked that didn&#x27;t support modules, then finally the author of gopls started maintaining it.  This maintenance overhead was exponential, given that gocode was not the only editor integration; syntax highlighting, godef, etc. all had to be tweaked for every editor and every go release.  Now gopls handles all of this and is maintained by the go team itself, so it will support new features in the go language at the same time as go.<p>(I believe even dedicated go IDEs like goland have always been a little behind go itself.  It simply doesn&#x27;t scale to have every editor implement their own go tooling.)<p>gopls also addresses interesting corner cases.  Say you build your project with Bazel, and you generated protocol buffers as part of your build so that developers don&#x27;t have to find the right version of the protobuf compiler, install it, and then debug why changing one name in the proto file caused a 600 line diff.  gopls and go itself can&#x27;t know that you are generating some Go files with a build tool, so Bazel projects will have squiggly missing import underlines below your proto imports, won&#x27;t be able to tab complete, and godoc won&#x27;t be able to show you documentation for the protos.  But, there is a solution; the &quot;package listing&quot; functionality is modular and can have a &quot;driver&quot; set at runtime, so all the go core tooling CAN find these generated files and treat them as though they were natively checked into your repository.  It is reasonable to write one plugin for your build system to support Go tools, but kind of insane if every Go editor had to do this.  gopls exists to make this work.<p>So with that in mind, every Go editor should be about the same.  If you want new features, add them to gopls.  If you are writing a new code editor today, just support the Language Server Protocol and you get great Go support, and support for every other language.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langserver.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langserver.org&#x2F;<\/a> contains a list of supported languages, and it&#x27;s pretty much everything.  Last I looked, even things like Arduino were moving to LSP.<p>So I think the age of editors-for-a-language are over.  Even if you restrict your focus to just one language, which isn&#x27;t that useful to begin with, you will always be behind for some reason, be it new build systems, polyglot apps, new language features... it&#x27;s not worth it.  Just use LSP and focus on core editing."],"time":["2020-01-05 23:20:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21967790],"kids":{},"parent":[21963708],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-06 10:25:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["Bishonen88"],"id":[21965073],"kids":{},"parent":[21963708],"text":["same name as an Amazon communicator: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;chime&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;chime&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-06 00:36:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gcatalfamo"],"id":[21964341],"kids":{},"parent":[21963708],"text":["it&#x27;s in closed beta."],"time":["2020-01-05 22:43:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fmakunbound"],"id":[21966984],"kids":[21968159],"parent":[21963708],"text":["This looks cool.

Of course you will sometimes get Trump’s gaudy excess, but that’s more of a comment on his lack of taste than an argument against the baroque in itself.<p>Edit: For an everyday example of what I&#x27;m referring to: compare the original Blade Runner (1982) to the sequel (2017). The first film is far more baroque, dusty, maximalist, and messy - and it lends the film a real sense of atmosphere and authenticity. This scene is a good example [1]: it&#x27;s raining, there are neon lights everywhere, the characters are speaking in a hodgepodge of numerous languages including Hungarian, Japanese, and German. Later in the movie, you have a variety of bizarre characters, androids, robot dolls, and city environments.<p>Then, compare a similar scene in the new film, 2049.[2] Its style and atmosphere are far more minimal, modernist, and simplified. It feels <i>a little too<\/i> sterile, too clean for a post-apocalyptic city with hundreds of millions of people. The rest of the film follows suit: the abandoned locations don&#x27;t seem that abandoned and the characters are all pretty straightforward.

The park owner do not need to explain to a judge how the child agreed to inject growth hormones by entering the ride. The requirement does not specify the way of how an individual may achieve compliance, only the measurable state which compliance may be determined.<p>The Vaccine License is no more complicated than licenses that specific that you can&#x27;t ship software to countries which the US has an export ban in regard to encryption. The export ban specific a target demographic which the software can not be sold and&#x2F;or use it. The Vaccine License specific a target demographic which may not copy it, and&#x2F;or use it.<p>The second argument brought up is that you can&#x27;t sue a citizen of sovereign countries for behavior that their governments do. Again we can look at US export bans. you don&#x27;t need to enforce the condition by suing people in those countries. It is generally enough that international companies has to follow the condition.<p>The third argument is that since none of these licenses routinely require any royalties, the likely damages by infringers would be zero. That is not how damages get calculated. Existing royalties can be used as a guideline, but the common argument is to claim damages based on &quot;industry standard&quot;. If a infringer publish unreleased work (say a copyrighted movie before release) it also has no existing royalties, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped judges from issuing rather high damages. Context matter in court cases.<p>The forth argument being that the term was illegal, improper or unenforceable. As someone who has been standing on that side of the fence in regard to EULAs and privacy policies I sincerely wish it was so.<p>That basically leaves the last argument that enforcing licenses are too costly. I fully agree. Its like shoplifting which has less than 1% clearing rate.

We can hope that someone has a breakthrough that unlocks a new era of high energy physics. Maybe the neutrino masses hold the key or new symmetries will be found. Maybe a small alteration will make an old idea viable. So many promising ideas have been shot down: Grand Unified Theories looked for proton decays, axions looked for light spontaneously going through solid walls and supersymmetry searched for new particles. Nothing was found.<p>As an ex-physicist with a more experimental background in condensed matters, the real discussions and theories are way beyond me though. Just look at this paragraph from the article:<p>&quot;Assume  we  consider  two-dimensional  Schwinger  model  with  one massless Dirac  fermion  of  charge  2 [18]. More exactly, in addition to the  dynamicalcharge-2 fermion, there is a heavy probe charge-1 fermion whose mass can be viewed as tending to infinity.  Next, assume that in this model we compactify the spatial dimension on a circle of circumference L, i.e.  impose either periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions on the fermion fields.  Then one can show that this model has two discrete Z2 symmetries – one 0-form and another 1-form.  These two global Z2 symmetries have generators which do not commute with each other [18].  Thus, only one of these symmetries can be implemented,the other one must be spontaneously broken.  Hence, the ground state is doubly degenerate.  In other words, we observe in this example (see Appendix on page 15 and also [17]) the power of the mixed anomalies – the prediction of the projective action of the symmetries and the ground state degeneracy.  This is a strong result at strong coupling.  Sorry for the pun...  After [12, 13, 14] a large number of non-trivial applications has been worked out.Many relevant references can be found in [18, 19].&quot;<p>My hope is that there will be a revolution in accelerator technology. The LHC is a triumph of collaborative engineering but maybe the next accelerator will be based upon different principles such as wakefield acceleration or miniaturized accelerators.

At one point I spoke to his sister, who said he was repeatedly thrown in jail when he couldn&#x27;t pay his assessed child support. He was 18 or 19 years old at the time, and had previously made $100k&#x2F;year (computer-something, in the 1990&#x27;s probably), then lost that job. The judge didn&#x27;t have the ability to reassess the child support amount. The sister said the law was later changed, but it was too late to prevent the destruction of my passenger&#x27;s pancreas.<p>Maricopa County Jail did a A1C test on him on intake, and decided this passenger needed a daily time-release insulin injection. If he tried to refuse the injection, he would be sent to solitary confinement.<p>When combined with the jail&#x27;s starvation diet, this forced use of insulin is a form of torture: I understand insulin without carbohydrates -&gt; low blood sugar -&gt; cortisol release -&gt; muscle wasting. When he got out he told me he&#x27;d developed an intestinal blockage that required surgery.<p>When he was locked up again 2 years ago (on account of missing a drug court hearing, 2.5 years before), I took pity on him and deposited some funds on his jail account so he could buy snacks to sort of keep himself out of stress-induced deterioration. I have a postcard that said it was incredibly helpful knowing someone on the outside cared about him. He supposedly sent me three postcards, but I only got one.<p>&quot;Do the most expensive thing possible&quot; seems to be the guiding philosophy for the American approach to Medicine. The doctors quoted in my recent submission [1] pointed out that they can do expensive things for their patients, but have no ability to provide what their patients actually need.<p>My step-sister&#x27;s husband is a type 1 diabetic. I just learned he had a bad case of the chicken pox just before he was diagnosed as a 3 year old child.

No matter how hard people try to ignore that very simple issue and constantly are in denial it has anything to do with politics… it is in direct correlation towards the change of the mentality of what is considered “politically correct” today! First the public shared oversimplfied reasoning… Mozilla-new removed most power user features (and they will also remove userchrome.css in the future) to be attractive to Chrome users, to make Chrome users switch away from Googles product. The point is that Chrome users or general simple users do not accept and like “bloat” – so it was decided that all the “conservative features” had to go to enable Firefox more compatible with their needs.<p>-----------------------------<p>Now here is where politics are kicking in, and things get a LOT MORE messier… Mozilla-new has turned into a fully customization&#x2F;choice and politically-moderates and conservatives hating “heavily left leaning developer” – as that would (at least also theoretically) appeal to the majority of Google Chrome users or general people with the same opinion – which have because of their ideology and believe much less tolerance and understanding for everything which provides choice&#x2F;which is more conservative aligned. Mozilla-new has fully turned into a company which just betrayed their own creation and origin user-base as it was not compatible with “leftist&#x2F;progressive visions&#x2F;ideas” and their world-view! But there is a major problem with Mozillas way of thinking… No matter how much they try to appeal to “leftist&#x2F;progressive” simple&#x2F;Chrome users with ongoing feature removals and morality adjustments – The majority of this user base will stay loyal to Google and Chrome – no matter how much Mozilla tries to persuade that kind of users to use Firefox instead. Mozilla-new will only be seen as an imitation facility who additionally got greedy and jealous – who tried to adopt Chromes simple add-on system, it’s development mentality and political mentality for the sake of broadening Mozillas shrinking user-base!<p>-----------------------------<p>Mozilla-new is humiliating everything which is true and honest FOSS with their actions. Real Open-Source developers have standards, morals, loyalty… all that what Mozilla-new is missing. They abuse the legacy of a real unique and once amazing past – which just was discarded for being “non-inclusive and non-liberal”<p>-----------------------------<p>What they forget is that a honest and real liberal and inclusive concept would mean also to keep features of users who have a different opinion, mentality and especially skill level! As i see it this is a common problem with this new kind of “leftist&#x2F;progressive” opinion of so many developers and it’s management today – which also affects the users they gain – they make use of concepts they do not at all understand and honor. While the users of such groups are wildly attacking people and organizations who go a different way – and not wanting to become simple and minimalist just for the majorities sake. If something is swimming into another direction it is seen as threat and danger seen as mortal enemy to the today established system what is seen as “the only correct and acceptable one” – this has direct influence on the vision how a product is developed!<p>-----------------------------<p>Nobody with a sane mind would want to support radical right-wing visions – but the issue is that today everything is getting attacked and in conclusion removed just because there is the chance that it could point to a very small degree towards a moderate middle-ground or even moderate conservative ground – all what is moving away from your typical “leftist&#x2F;progressive” concept. Mozilla is supporting an excluding concept – which may be nicely wrapped as “inclusive and socially correct” but in reality fully excluding a minority who also has rights – the group of users who are sitting in the already mentioned middle-ground&#x2F;moderate-conservative-ground and do not like that everything gets intentionally dumbed-down or removed to put everything out of the way for a less tolerating&#x2F;accepting and rather aggressive&#x2F;dismissive user group – which Mozilla wants on board.<p>-----------------------------<p>And that is in the end the ultimate reason why people and software which are sticking out from the crowd do get so much despised and demonized – or even receiving threats (Classic add-on archive) or getting in an active way monitored and even the smallest mistake is recorded and used in time to blacklist the projects or people which refuse to play the established and discriminating game of today."],"time":["2020-01-07 20:05:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["deith"],"id":[21962972],"kids":[21965441,21966650,21966349],"parent":[21961305],"text":["Author&#x27;s name states his pronouns, opinion discarded."],"time":["2020-01-05 19:37:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["rayiner"],"id":[21964116],"kids":{},"parent":[21963706],"text":["This criticism of Saez and Zucman is extremely important.

Saez and Zucman, for example, exclude transfer income like the earned income tax credit from income. Under their methodology, even a very redistributionist economy, such as one with a high guaranteed minimum income, would look unequal because those transfer payments aren’t included in income.<p>How you measure things changes the results. Measuring pre-tax income shows inequality growing. Measuring income after taxes and transfers shows it growing slower.

The rates listed in this article are much lower than I would recommend. I target 85% utilized in my personal model.

You can and will get let go before employees. That is not a bad thing. In fact, its a gift. You get to leave before morale and expectations get too far out of control.<p>-Do put rainy day money away into fungible assets. Savings accounts probably aren&#x27;t great for that.<p>-Do try to have multiple clients at once, if you can swing 2 full time gigs, most of the time this can be juggled in the short term.<p>-If you get told you are rolling off, don&#x27;t take it personal. I have the hardest time with this part of it. It is my nature to give my all when I am at a gig. When the let me go, I feel that it is an affront or personal. Its not, its business.

That’s because I subconsciously gave up on the idea of profiting from my business. If you stop and think about that for a moment, it means that I had internalized this idea that I would always be working linearly at my hourly rate. There would never be residual passive income from work that I had done, whether it was SAAS or building an app or frankly just reselling something that I had already made. That death of faith in a better future is one of the most toxic and detrimental blows to a maker’s psyche that I know of.<p>The full profit formula is:<p><pre><code>  profit = (price you charge) - (your cost as hourly rate * hours)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYour cost here is the time that you would have put in coding, as if it were any other job. On top of that, you have the periodic struggle to find more gigs, as well as the logistics of handling your own taxes, health insurance, etc. So if you don’t charge something above your own cost, you’ll burn the candle at both ends just getting by, and eventually burn out after 2-4 years just like at any other job (tech especially).<p>I’ve always said that I feel that consultants should charge at least their overtime rate to account for the overhead and headaches involved. So if you make $30 per hour as a developer, your overtime rate (time and a half) is $45 and I would recommend starting around there or round up to $50. That&#x27;s only part of the answer though, because an agency will charge between 1.5 and 4 times your hourly rate, so between $50 and $120 per hour, often more. So really you are competing with agencies. Which means that there is nothing wrong with charging the same as them, and probably more if you are experienced in your target market.<p>But there are also physical laws to consider. It’s hard to beat a pair of coders making something, so that limits an agency’s maximum value to a customer to just twice what a single consultant can provide. Keep in mind that this ignores an agency’s existing infrastructure, ability to absorb failure costs, and scalability. But if we’re just talking raw coding velocity, an agency is limited to about twice the velocity of a consultant, no matter how many people they through at a problem (see The Mythical Man Month). Knowing that, it makes sense to me that a consultant might typically charge about half the flat rate fee of an agency. And if they always deliver, why not charge the same amount!"],"time":["2020-01-06 02:22:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fao_"],"id":[21957407],"kids":{},"parent":[21954581],"text":["&gt; I couldn’t believe my ears. After regaining my composure, I answered: “I regard such behaviour as unethical, because our customer would suffer a substantial and unnecessary loss.” [...] In hindsight, I should have terminated the project at that point [...]. The example shows how ingrained hourly billing is. Customers accept it as God given, although they know that they are ripped off.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing.

In this decision the agency was better off as a company if the person took the deal. The client at all times had the choice of going to a different firm that was cheaper, the customer in this case opted not to bother with doing those things (which might have cost them more in the long run anyway), and therefore had already committed to the cost that they would be charged.<p>The job of the client company in this case is to extract as much value as it can from the consultants while paying them as little as it can.

In order to make customers contact you, you need to take a lot of risky bets on the acquisition-side of things.<p>Things you might do to build a strong brand, like writing books and having a presence at events come with a likelihood that they won&#x27;t be effective.  By sinking time into those things, they present a risk of derailing work that actually pays.  Doing a lot of PR &amp; media work is a double-edged sword from the pov of clients who see the work you do as a trade secret.  They want people on the job who know how to keep their mouths shut.<p>And the stream of project opportunities you get from that kind of project-acquisition is highly volatile and unpredictable.  Chances are, when an opportunity comes in, you will be engaged in another project, and when a project ends, you won&#x27;t have an opportunity waiting for you at that moment.<p>This only works, if you can scale it up enough so that the central limits theorem starts working in your favour and presents you with a constant stream of opportunities.  But as a solo-consultant you wouldn&#x27;t actually have the capacity to do anything with them, other than turn 99% of those opportunities down.  At which point the relationship between the costs behind those acquisition effforts, and the rate at which you monetize them make the whole economics of the strategy break down.  So you need to scale up your capacity and become a big agency, instead of a solo consultant, to make it work.<p>Element B: BARGAINING POWER<p>The other thing:  Value-based fee sounds great, but what do you do in a situation where other people who get paid by the hour compete for the work you want to charge a value-based fee on?  It&#x27;s a race to the bottom, and can only work in areas that are so niche and highly-specialized that you are basically without competition, or where it would be prohibitively expensive for your prospective customers to line up alternative offers to compete with yours.<p>CONCLUSION<p>But then, the requirement to have scale, and the requirement to serve highly specialized areas so that you can have a lot of bargaining power are difficult to reconcile.<p>...so, all of this is just not as easy as the author of this article is making it out to be.  If it were, everybody would be doing it, and nobody would allow themselves to get paid by the hour and do project acquisition by contacting the client rather than having the client contact them."],"time":["2020-01-05 11:35:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yellow_lead"],"id":[21959094],"kids":{},"parent":[21954581],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;JNoLA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;JNoLA<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-05 02:59:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
