Instead, OpenAI put us off indefinitely despite repeated requests—even as it made access widely available to the media... OpenAI’s striking lack of openness seems to us to be a serious breach of scientific ethics, and a distortion of the goals of the associated nonprofit. Its decision forced us to limit our testing to a comparatively small number of examples, giving us less time to investigate than we would have liked, which means there may be more serious problems that we didn’t have a chance to discern.”<\/i><p>Several other researchers I know — <i>very<\/i> good researchers who happen to have been publicly critical of GPT-2 — have not been given access.<p>This isn’t how science is done (access for reproducibility and probing, but selectively and excluding prominent critics).

My primary account has 3000 rooms and about 450K visible users - on element-web this uses 1.1GB of RAM, but on hydrogen it uses 14MB :)  We’re also looking at glueing E2EE into Hydrogen via the crypto layer of matrix-rust-sdk, which could be a massive win in terms of reusing and auditing a robust safe implementation for the Hard problem of encryption, rather than implementing it from scratch every time in every new client.<p>Dendrite (go server impl) progress is also very promising - we’ve been focusing on it (at last!) since the beginning of the year, and going to enter beta in the next few weeks. A typical small&#x2F;medium live server is currently using 57MB of RAM (rather than synapse’s ~500MB). We haven’t started optimising yet :)<p>Synapse has also finally come of age - the whole codebase has almost been switched to twisted&#x2F;asyncio rather than twisted deferreds, which both speeds things up a bit but also gives us way better visibility on profiling for future perf work. Almost all bits now scale horizontally (apart from the master dispatcher process). Synapse isn’t going away - we see Synapse and Dendrite coexisting much as Apache and nginx coexist today.<p>Conduit is also super exciting as an entirely community developed Rust homeserver, which currently runs ~10x faster than either Synapse or Dendrite (but doesn’t federate yet, or scale horizontally). It’s really fun to see an indie FOSS server implementation properly take off :)<p>Finally, P2P Matrix is coming together well - compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it clientside, using Yggdrasil currently as an overlay network to tunnel through to other P2P nodes.<p>In short: the Matrix ecosystem is in a fairly healthy place right now - the next gen of clients and servers should be incredible :)"],"time":["2020-08-22 11:03:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["siraben"],"id":[24241441],"kids":[24242961,24243861],"parent":[24239564],"text":["Matrix is great for bridging[0] between different chat applications.

One party is effectively utilizing this to obtain, maintain and increase their hold on govt positions.<p>&gt; None of this is a coincidence. Republicans responded to the election of Barack Obama in 2008 not by trying to broaden their own base or appeal to a changing nation, but by modernizing voter suppression tactics out of the old Jim Crow playbook.\nChief Justice John Roberts’s shameful 5-4 decision in 2013’s Shelby County v Holder ripped the heart out of the prime enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts argued that the South had changed, and such protections were no longer necessary. 1965, Roberts suggested, was a long time ago, in a different nation, across a changed South. The tens of thousands of Georgians whose voting precincts were closed, forcing them to endure six-hour lines to vote during a pandemic would like a word with him Roberts’s calamitous ignorance has done grievous damage.<p>&quot;Crosscheck&quot; app&#x2F;system which is frequently run against democratic counties was found to have a 200 to 1 false positive to true negative rate. It&#x27;s still being heavily pushed.<p>&gt; Crosscheck is a national database designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck&#x27;s algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives.[108] Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights organizations for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas.<p>&gt; Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such measures, even when the incidence of voter fraud is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud; none were cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented.

Great way to taint a theory and practice that is not the current paradigm, and implicitly associating anyone who takes an interest in it with a community of people few want to be associated with<p>2. “Many self-identified incels have a highly mechanistic understanding of human relationships and believe they can improve their station in the sexual hierarchy through a practice called ‘looksmaxxing’: enhancing one’s sex appeal through weight lifting, skin and hair treatments, and even plastic surgery” – Try replacing ‘self-identified incels’ with ‘self-identified women’. Hardly controversial that getting in shape and grooming oneself increases one’s chances of finding a romantic partner, even if might be neither sufficient nor necessary.<p>3. “I already knew how I felt about some of the Mews’ claims – John’s absurd belief, for instance, that unattractive criminals are less likely to reoffend if their faces are made more beautiful” – Ok, so say you have two job applicants for the position you’re trying to fill for a customer-facing job. One applicant, though in all other ways a seemingly good candidate, has terrible teeth - think ‘faces of meth’ bad - the other, equal in all other respects has a mouth full of perfect glistening teeth and a winning smile. Who do you honestly think you’re more likely to pick? If you think the first, you’re most likely fooling yourself, and you’re also not good at your job, being to find the person most suited for interacting with your customers and making them feel at ease. Which of the candidates do you think is more likely to stumble down a path of criminality due to lack of good job opportunities?<p>4. Yup, the Mews are definitely odd characters, that in no way invalidates their theories, and apart from some  representatives of the current paradigm in orthodontics expressing their disdain for the Mews and their theories, there’s no substantial evidence given for why they are so wrong – so wrong as to be villainous in the eyes of their critics it seems. The article ends with a cliff hanger with the perfect teethed skulls of yore. This is in fact very strong evidence that the heredity argument is plainly wrong. To argue that the crooked teeth and underdeveloped mouths that appear quite suddenly in conjunction with the industrial revolution are due to genetics is like ripping off your shirt to show the massive tattoo on your chest that says, “I know nothing about the timescales of evolution”<p>5. “This emphasis on compliance irks the Mews’ critics almost more than anything, because it allows them to blame their patients for any failures” – replace ‘the Mews’’ with ‘the sports coaches’ and *patients’ with ‘athletes’. All treatments that are not surgical require compliance to some extent to work. Changing your body through behavioural changes is obviously possible, but often requires more diligence and discipline than many are ready for. On a personal level, I fixed a massive overbite and a terrible posture as a teenager by consciously pushing my jaw forward all waking hours and straightening my back and paying attention to my posture while walking and standing. It takes time, but it generally works<p>6. What is the actual, real scandal exposed in this article? A couple of dentists who believe strongly in a theory and practice based on fairly good evolutionary reasoning and some obviously positive results? The fact that a community of bitter young men who deem themselves undateable and ugly are looking to these dentists ideas to improve aspects of themselves? Or maybe the fact that our current paradigm has no good explanation for why our collective mouths have on average degraded in modernity, and the standard treatments – that are both invasive and painful – apparently don’t fix the underlying problems.<p>7. From my own experience with everything from teeth issues to asthma, eczema and allergies, I know that the current paradigm of healthcare for all those problems is stuck on a track of symptom suppression via medication, with practitioners in general knowing nothing to very little about how things like breathing, nutrition, gut flora and many other things affect these conditions. Scientific and medical paradigms are always tough to change, and there’s a plethora of examples of mainstream practices and accepted truths that in hindsight appear absurd – such as the belief that hand washing was unnecessary for doctors between attending to patients that was dogma before Semmelweis – that are defended tooth and claw by the establishment, while detractors like Semmelweis are shunned and vilified.<p>8. Among the comments on NYT and here, many of which gleefully or dramatically jump straight at the incel angle and join in the hate and ridicule chorus (it’s apparently ok to hate and ridicule disillusioned, often autism spectrum young men who can’t find girlfriends. How sweet…), I see comments from dentists and individuals who testify to the problems of the current paradigm, and share stories of positive and negative change that lends credence to the Mews’ theories. How would the comments section have looked with another angle to the article? Are there examples of people who have started practicing these methods and have documented their results? Wouldn’t that be more interesting to look into? Oh well.<p>edit: paragraph separation\nedit 2: spell check and specifying comments on NYT and here in point 8"],"time":["2020-08-23 12:44:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["elric"],"id":[24250816],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["Previous similar article &amp; discussion:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23335368\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23335368<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-23 11:50:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moltar"],"id":[24248958],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["This was described in the Breath book."],"time":["2020-08-23 04:04:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["citizenpaul"],"id":[24260160],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["Why is this on &quot;Hacker&quot; news?"],"time":["2020-08-24 14:58:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trabant00"],"id":[24250403],"kids":{},"parent":[24246577],"text":["Why are trying to tie these two orthodontists to mysoginism, alt right, toxic internet forums, etc?

We can go much deeper into what Bitcoin can do, but all other chains wishing to do other things this guy mentions always were a cheap piggy back on Bitcoin.<p>I&#x27;m here to tell you Bitcoin works, and does not need anything else. Bitcoin is not slow like many folks will tell you all day long, either. Bitcoin does not have high fees, either. Bitcoin is very sound &quot;money,&quot; and not a great currency. If someone wishes to transfer money to someone else anywhere in the world, they simply tailor their fee to be low, and they send it for 40-60 cents and understand that it will confirm over the next day. (Yes, the mempool surges during times of heavy use, and yes it may take a little while longer, but just the same, millions of dollars can be sent with no third party for under $1 fee)\nThe time itself for this does not really matter, as this could never be done prior to Bitcoin. Ask those sending money home to the Philippines or folks who are unbanked how many days a wire transfer takes, and how many third parties take a massive chunk in fees. Nobody controls your money in Bitcoin, and nobody takes a fee. (Nobody is taking your money from a BTC fee, the paltry amount is paying into the system to keep the miners mining)<p>It&#x27;s nothing else beyond this, and nothing else is needed. \nAnyone can argue about this endlessly but Bitcoin solved it&#x27;s problem it was designed for, and all else is just garbage tacked on by other people trying to strike it rich.<p>I have used Bitcoin regularly since 2011. I have purchased real, legal goods from folks in other countries over forums in escrow that could not be done otherwise without incurring very large fees.

Entire modern monetary system is based on a trusted party - a central bank. Blockchain provides a way to remove trusted party out of equation. One can argue that existing system just works, why would you want to change something that works? Answer is simple - it does not work in many countries and trusted parties&#x2F;authorities abuse their powers, sometimes in a ways that is not so easy to see.<p>First application of a blockchain is digital money which is free from a central authority. Here is real world scenario that happened in so many places. Your domestic currency is crushing, has lost 30% of it value already and is about to loose another 80%. You want to by US dollars and save what is left but you cannot because government temporary prohibited purchase of a foreign currency. I’m thinking about Russia, Belorussia, Venezuela and many many others.<p>Political activists get blocked by a banking system all the time. For example in Russia there is a “list of terrorists”, people on this list excluded form the banking system. This list probably has some terrorists in it but it also has quite a few activists in it as well. You can go to a protest, grabbed by a police and next day find yourself out of the banking system.<p>Decentralized money is at least partially a solution to issues arising form an authority abusing it powers as cryptocurrency cannot be blocked so easily. It does not have to be used much, it just has to be around.<p>Second blockchain application is smart contracts to simplify value transfer. For example shares offerings - when a company sells it shares to a bunch of investors. It often happens outside of an exchange, without IPO (search for Reg-A, Reg-D offerings). In this process a bank holds investor money until offering completes and a “transfer agent” hold stock in the name of an investor after. Bank and transfer agent are there only because of trust issues, someone has to guarantee that investor pays and receives shares. Investor cannot directly hand over cash to a company because it can fail to pay or company can fail to deliver it shares and then they will have to spend time and money in court. Both bank and transfer agent take their commission just because they trusted and licensed to hold value during and after transaction. These commissions are not small, a bank may take few percents for organizing an offering.<p>Shares can be issued on a blockchain and a smart contract can govern entire value transfer starting from escrow, to enforcing offering conditions and then to transfer of shares and money to counter parties. You can imagine banks might not be happy about loosing their profits but competition in democratic countries slowly but surely drives process in a right direction.<p>Similar examples arise all the time in international trade, trade clearing, interbank relationships, etc, etc. blockchain is a solution to all of this but maybe we need another financial crisis (when  “trusted parties” became not so trusted) to speed up it adoption."],"time":["2020-08-24 08:20:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["centimeter"],"id":[24241558],"kids":[24241645],"parent":[24241488],"text":["There are precisely two legitimately useful applications of the blockchain data structure that have been invented:<p>1.

This results in a more efficient economy: more people can get plumbing at lower prices, and more people can work as plumbers.<p>But what if some business owners cost structures (due to mismanagement, poor productivity) do not result in good wages? (eg, XYZ Plumbing struggles to stay in business while ABC is doing just fine). Or what if the market forces end up in a clearing price that&#x27;s too low? In today&#x27;s economy, it&#x27;s considered normal for some businesses to shut down if they cannot make money (know of a restaurant that has closed due to COVID?). But do we as a society want individuals taking on that much risk? If not, how can we insure against that risk?"],"time":["2020-08-22 02:56:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["daniel-s"],"id":[24240445],"kids":[24240878,24240496,24240937,24249395,24240767,24240495,24242271],"parent":[24239513],"text":["I will confess to not making it to the end of the introduction, but this is a general comment about anti-trust and monopoly laws.<p>They&#x27;re made up and arbitrary.

I&#x27;d love to get into more detail and write out a massive essay&#x2F;text wall... but today&#x27;s not the day...<p>An unfortunately long time ago now, when I was a younger teen (like, 13), I had a large amount of mechanically inclined hands on hobbies. As a dirt poor person from the <i>really<\/i> dirt poor part of Appalachia, if you wanted something, especially in a niche hobby, you built it from near raw materials.<p>At the time, a few of the things I needed had a surprisingly small supply chain&#x2F;availability in the U.S., and with asinine prices at that. One thing in particular, could be found practically nowhere aside from a single source in the U.S., and at something like $20&#x2F;pop with a business type account necessary to purchase.<p>Frustrated, and having been raised by the internet, I went to China, mainly Alibaba&#x2F;AliExpress for sourcing - Tangent: as I write out this comment, I was going to state &quot;back before everybody and their uncle knew about AliExpress in the U.S., atleast.&quot; - turns out, it was only a year after AliExpress had launched. Didn&#x27;t know that till now.<p>So, I found the specific thing I was after - needing only two of them. Two were $8 shipped, 10 was $17 - and these were the exact thing being sold for $20&#x2F;PC from one U.S. supplier, and a pain to purchase. Obvious what choice I made, luckily had an older friend to use their credit card for purchase. Since I only needed the two, I for some reason thought, hey, maybe somebody else might be in my same situation, put them up on eBay for $5&#x2F;PC + shipping, and hoped that maybe 2 or 3 would sell in a month and I&#x27;dve gotten what I needed for basically free.<p>By the end of the night, all eight of them had sold. Kinda shittered myself, and that&#x27;s how I became a go-to stateside supplier of a few very niche fans, some other RC-type hobby supplies, and most notably the second top-seller of quality multi-stranded silicone &quot;hobby&quot; (UL 3135) wire on eBay as a sick 13-15 year old. A little over 2500 packages in 2.5 years. And, I think I&#x27;ve forgotten to include the main point - I was making some pretty massive margins on sales - but still undercutting the next seller by half or more. My entire point of doing this was in hopes of making some niche hobby stuff more accessible for people like me. I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able say that I&#x27;d regularly reach out to buyers and get fairly frequent replies, and found that I was often able to fulfill that goal.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s my I should definitely be asleep by now HN ramble of the week.

I generally did not drop ship it, I ordered it in bulk from a wholesaler and then sold it on eBay, as well as on a website I maintained, which ran a heavily modified version of osCommerce.<p>Buying this one item, which I knew had regular demand, from a retailer allowed me to offer a price which was competitive, but from which I could also make a small profit.  With dropshipping, I was competing against others who could drop ship the same items, so I could not offer as competitive a price, nor have any kind of margin.<p>I used dropshipping for two scenarios.  One was if I traveled and was unable to ship out the item I had in stock.  In this scenario, I would drop ship the item and lose any margin (or sometimes even take a small loss).<p>The other scenario was to test new items to sell.  My main wholesaler (which I bought my 3M bulk item from) could drop ship a catalog of items at a decent rate from their one watehouse.  I also had accounts with two larger dropshipping wholesalers, both of whom had multiple warehouses with mostly the same catalog in stock - with items more likely in stock, but at a higher markup.<p>So what I did was for through my main wholesaler&#x27;s catalog and see what items they had.  I then checked that both other wholesalers had the same item in their catalog, and that all currently had the item in stock.  Generally my main wholesaler would drop ship for the lowest rate.  So I put the item up on my website, at a break even price.  I did this for many items.<p>Sometimes I would have a sale.  Often my main wholesaler still had the item in stock.  I would break even on the sale, but would know there was demand.  Sometimes they would be out of stock - then I would drop ship from one of the two backups and lose some money on the sale.  Maybe I would increase my sale price until I knew my main wholesaler had the item in stock again.<p>As margins were small, one goal was to sell more and increase margins.  If I bought boxes, tape and shipping labels in bulk, my margins increased a few cents per sale - I could decrease the sale price (and increase sales doing so) while also increasing my cut a few cents.  This worked for a number of things - with $3,000 a month in sales my Payapl fees would drop, with $10,000 a month in sales they would drop even more.  This would also allow me to offer more items at a competitive price.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it works nowadays.  One lesson I learned was what to do when you succeeded.  I got to where I was shipping several items a day and making a small margin, and had the opportunity to ship even more.  But it would then outgrow my closet space - I would need to rent some warehouse space or something to receive shipments and store items.  Also, as sales grew, I spent less time programming my web site, and more time putting items in boxes, taping up boxes, weighing boxes, printing out shipping labels to attach to boxes etc.  I figured I eventually would have to hire someone part time to ship items out during the week.  By then I was familiar enough with the business to decide I did not want to make this leap, and decided to wound down my business.  Actually I stumbled out of the business like I stumbled into it - my friend had some familiarity with some of these wholesalers, knew I could sell online and suggested I try it out, which I did."],"time":["2020-08-22 20:58:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foolinaround"],"id":[24244059],"kids":[24244344,24244319],"parent":[24243763],"text":["&quot;the fool and his money are soon parted&quot;<p>This has become quite a phenomenon due to the rise of the &#x27;influencers&#x27; and a generation that blindly follows them.<p>Even though this method may be legal, the onus is on the people to look for something like BBB certification, and this new certification, whatever form it may be, should be nimble and easy to initially obtain, and fast to update by the consumers."],"time":["2020-08-22 15:41:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tedunangst"],"id":[24246116],"kids":{},"parent":[24243763],"text":["Are these revenues or profits?"],"time":["2020-08-22 20:27:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24244129],"kids":{},"parent":[24243763],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-22 15:51:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["twat"],"id":[24247308],"kids":{},"parent":[24243763],"text":["Dropshipping is like MLM, but the scam part happens after the purchase.

Given a local repo, Codemap statically parses the code and renders a directed graph of all function calls in the least cluttered layout. It helps programmers familiarize with a new codebase, trace possible scenarios that lead to a bug in a function, or understand the scope of impact when making a code change. Codemap runs offline on your local machine and never sends any sensitive code data to remote servers.<p>I built Codemap because I noticed that good engineers always spend quality time understanding the code architecture before making changes. This process is crucial, and it usually requires drawing a function call diagram on a whiteboard or in the head. Some people use IDE &quot;Find usage of function...&quot; search box for a million times, some people ask senior engineers for tribal knowledge, and some just get lazy and start writing code with ignorance.<p>As a software engineer, I think there&#x27;s a better solution than this tedious and error-prone practice. I looked at existing code visualization tools and felt that the visualization tends to be overly cluttered and not that user-friendly. I believed that, with some level of design, I can build a tool that is pleasant to use, easy to navigate, and versatile for any codebase in the supported languages.<p>During the development of Codemap, I would sometimes grab a popular Github repo to test the Codemap app, and I often find myself exploring its call graph for hours to satisfy my genuine curiosity of &quot;How does &lt;popular project&gt; work?&quot; I&#x27;d encourage curious HN readers to visit the website and see screenshots of call graphs from React, Keras, Django, and Typescript (yep the one from Microsoft).<p>I would love to hear what you love and hate, as well as any questions you may have.

I only did the first part to some extent: parsed JS and rendered the AST into a treemap using WebGL.<p>What I actually envisioned in my mind is a 3d nested boxes rendered in a &quot;galaxy style&quot; where you can fly from one box to another, click on boxes to show their sub-boxes and see the lines that represent connections. The 3d space would allow to unclutter the image.<p>Edit1. While I think that nested boxes is the natural way to represent ownership, it&#x27;s often difficult to figure this ownership from the code. For example, class A is really the owner of B and C, but those are given to A as args in the constructor, so to an unsophisticated analyzer tool, B and C would be just deps. Perhaps the tool should allow the user to adjust the relationship status between objects based on some a priori knowledge. The changes would need to be saved, so next time the diagram is rebuilt from code, the visualizer would remember that A owns B and C. I believe this would be really useful in big companies that struggle to keep such diagrams up to date.<p>Edit2.

Do remember to cancel. Thank me later.<p>Second: The whole download&#x2F;install experience is a trip.  You need to download about ~90 GB of data (no problem!). However, the downloader is abysmal. It&#x27;s not optimized for throughput at all, each (often small) file is individually downloaded and then uncompressed in sequence. Is this 1997? My favorite bug: if you minimize the download window it starts using 100% of the GPU. This is kind of indicative of what you&#x27;ll experience later on - that special kind of randomness that stems from developer incompetence. Most people (including me) seem to need to restart the whole thing a couple of times. Loads of people are simply stuck at the download step.<p>Third: Loading times with this game are insane. It can take a minute or two (with a very fast 6-core CPU, 1 Gbit&#x2F;s network connection, M.2 SSD, etc) to load the main menu, because it seems to download the scenery for the stuff that is vaguely visible in the background scenery every time. Then another minute or two for actually getting started with your flight. And when going back from flight mode to the main menu: yeah, another 1-2 mins.<p>Fourth: When you actually get to start the aircraft:<p>- There are loads of bugs that cause insane FPS drops&#x2F;frameskips.<p>- There currently seems to exist an issue that causes FPS slowdowns <i>when the Azure-based geometry servers are slow<\/i>. Did they do blocking networking in the same thread as the rendering? :) No idea, but the propblem is for for real. The typical FPS is higher when fewer people are playing. All of those gorgeous youtube videos you&#x27;ve seen from before the launch? Yeah, those are no longer representative. Also, I think most of them have been carefully edited. There are just way too many random FPS \n and frame skipping bugs abound. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>I recommend looking at a recorded live stream (from recent days) to get a better understanding of the simulation performance.<p>(I&#x27;ve spent maybe 6 hours with MSFS2020 so far.)<p>Fifth: This is a very complicated application. There is no documentation.<p>Sixth: I&#x27;m running on a GTX 1070 with 8 GB of video memory, so sadly I can only run this at 1080p. When everything is working perfectly it&#x27;s kinda smooth - about 40 fps. Most of the time though, something is causing a severe FPS slowdown, so closer to 5-10 fps. It&#x27;s all kind of random. It seems like most of these issues are bugs, rather than the hardware meeting actual limitations. Changing the display quality (ultra&#x2F;high&#x2F;etc doesn&#x27;t really impact these random variations in FPS much.)<p>Seventh: The in-game credits start with this sequence: DESIGN, UI DEVELOPMENT, PROGRAMMING. Maybe I&#x27;m being overly sensitive here, but to me this order could sort of explain why this disaster shipped in its current form.<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.

I noticed two major changes already. The first thing was freelance work drying up, because new projects were put on hold. With most of the economic consequences (and bankruptcies) still to happen, this could go either way. Either the tech sector has a lot less work, with wages falling and everyone trying to get the security of a salaried position, or there is a boom of software with businesses trying to retool and freelance work coming back with a vengeance. The second thing is obviously the shift to WFH. This move could conclude with everyone being ordered back to the office (once vaccinated), or with structural WFH being a thing for always, and many if not most developers rarely seeing the inside of an office. I don’t think anyone knows where it is headed, but the global impact of covid makes it that for the first time the changes to programming culture are likely to happen everywhere at once, instead of happening first in SV and then slowly rippling out.

Products like like Google Docs, social networks, messaging app, etc don&#x27;t depend on a proof of stake, and we shouldn&#x27;t be running miners to power such simple operations. All these applications need isa decentralized form of message distribution and log storage paired with public-key cryptography in order to build a CRDT log. I understand why IPFS in itself at first glance often seems over-hyped, since it is essentially just a hyper-distributed caching layer. However, I highly recommend looking at technologies built on top of it like [OrbitDB](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db<\/a>) and [Textile](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textile.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textile.io&#x2F;<\/a>). When they work reliably, their API is as easy if not easier than other &quot;server-less&quot; products like Firebase or Parse to use. Once libraries like these become mature, I believe the way we build software will be flipped on its head within 10-15 years to be completely client focused with minimal backend infrastructure.<p>The main advantages I see are:<p>* Increased reliability. This allows developers to remove almost all of their centralized servers and rely instead on a common infrastructure and protocol.<p>* Much simpler codebases and infrastructure. You only need to write a frontend for most applications. Building on u&#x2F;searchableguy&#x27;s comment: I can see no&#x2F;low code tooling really taking off with decentralized-first applications, since there is no need to manage a complicated backend infrastructure with vendor lock-in.<p>* Real-time by default. Since IPFS databases run off of CRDT logs which rely on realtime syncing of new operations, they are benefit from immediate updates at all times – even when not connected to the main swarm out in the boonies.\n* Offline-first by default.<p>* Cost&#x2F;resource efficiency. No technology is magical, but [this](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withblue.ink&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;hugo-and-ipfs-how-this-blog-works-and-scales.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withblue.ink&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;hugo-and-ipfs-how-this-blog-...<\/a>) article from March is an early real world demonstration of how well this technology works already.<p>* Transport agnostic. It&#x27;s completely feasible to have your watch, your phone, and your laptop have their IPFS nodes connected over Bluetooth, but never have to worry about if and how they&#x27;re connected together since IPFS takes care of handling that P2P connectivity automatically. Instead of writing code that says &quot;my watch created a reminder, upload this to the cloud for my laptop and also tell my phone this happened if we&#x27;re connected,&quot; I can just write &quot;my watch created a reminder, broadcast this operation to the IPFS network&quot; and your phone and laptop will automatically receive this update.<p>* Security. The less that is stored on centralized servers, the better. While OrbitDB is not built to work off an encrypted database yet (it&#x27;s in the roadmap for v1), Textile already is. Having everything be encrypted by default and optionally never leaving my device has many advantages.<p>The main challenges I see blocking this from going mainstream:<p>* Reliability still feels like the early days of the internet. The database-level libraries are still young, IPFS is slow&#x2F;unreliable at times, and browser support is fairly strong but still has a way to go, and native mobile&#x2F;native support is nonexistent.<p>* Filecoin is not ready yet. You still need to run your own IPFS node&#x2F;swarm in order to do anything serious. Existing pinning services can only go so far if you&#x27;re working with something like OrbitDB.<p>* Education. Security is of upmost important when designing technologies like this, so developers need to understand how a CRDT log works, how to build with merge conflicts in mind, and how to write&#x2F;manage custom ACL for complex interactions. It also takes a different way of thinking to design networks like this.<p>* Reliability and security audits.<p>* Transport protocols. At the moment, many of the advantages of P2P over things like Bluetooth have not been realized yet since the IPFS core is still where most of the development is focused at the moment.<p>* Cross-platform support. IPFS only has an official Go and JavaScript node implementation with a Rust implementation in the works. While Go has become fairly portable in recent years, it still has a very bloated runtime that doesn&#x27;t embed well on mobile and web. Once we have a reliable Rust port and some OrbitDB-like Rust-based libraries ports, I suspect we&#x27;ll start seeing ergonomic mobile and web APIs that bind to these popping up.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying centralized servers will vanish in to thin air. There are many tasks like indexing large amounts of data that are incredibly difficult and not beneficial to build on a distributed network. The decentralized web – if done right – will make developers&#x27; lives much easier for many common applications, but there should not be a need to port things that aren&#x27;t practical to run on the Dweb.<p>[Edit: Formatting]"],"time":["2020-08-22 16:36:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24244528],"kids":{},"parent":[24243598],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-22 16:54:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["UncleOxidant"],"id":[24245843],"kids":{},"parent":[24243598],"text":["Rapid tests you can do at home for a variety of viral illnesses, initially for COVID-19, but expanding to a wider variety of viruses and virus types.

You can write automated tests and verify systems with a level of precision that humans cannot rival and it&#x27;s not expensive to do so. If your QA teams are catching errors of this variety it&#x27;s a symptom of another problem: communication issues. Your QA people shouldn&#x27;t be catching errors of this variety -- it&#x27;s way late in the development process to realize that your developers didn&#x27;t understand the requirements or didn&#x27;t write tests to specify them.<p>There are a lot of reasons why your QA team is doing this kind of work. Common causes are:<p>1. The development team is pressured to prioritize budgets and deadlines<p>2. The requirements are not communicated well, never gathered to begin with, or no single person knows what exactly is being built or why<p>In the first case developers might not be given the time and space to scrutinize the requirements, write tests specifying the appropriate behaviors, and making the effort to build a system to that specification. Your QA department is basically picking up the slack: the development team pushes what they think meets the requirements and waits for the QA team to give them the thumbs up or down.<p>The second is also pernicious and makes the former worse.<p>In an ideal world the QA team should be saving their time and energy for informally-specified requirements and difficult to qualify goals such as, &quot;It must look good in IE 11.&quot; There&#x27;s no way to formally specify that requirement so it must be checked by a human who does understand what that means.<p>I&#x27;d caution that if your QA team is growing with your development team then you should treat it as a symptom of a larger problem.

If the traffic is not requested over HTTPS, it will be equally unencrypted once it exits the VPN tunnel.

All a standard VPN does is change your source IP.<p>A couple of other threat models:<p>4) Rogue ISP<p>Now, if your ISP is truly rogue, a VPN might help lessen some of the problems, but no more than conscious awareness while browsing the web will. If it&#x27;s not a secure page, it&#x27;s not a secure page, whether it&#x27;s been served over a VPN or the most hostile ISP known to man.<p>5) Government Wiretapping<p>A VPN, even an international VPN, will never stop a state level actor if they really want your traffic. International agreements (such as 5 eyes) exist to make these kinds of requests <i>easy<\/i>.<p>IMO, the only real use of a VPN is to bypass IP based region checks.

(My previous comments about this.[0][1])<p>- protocols do not provide humans assistants such as system administrators or a salaried staff of IT workers to run &amp; maintain decentralized systems for others.  (E.g. my previous comment[2] that us uber geeks on HN know how to run Git but it doesn&#x27;t matter because we don&#x27;t have the time nor enthusiasm to run decentralized git on our home laptop, or Gitlab on Raspberry Pi to serve our repos to others.  It&#x27;s easier to just use centralized Github.)<p>If you&#x27;re thinking that money and staffing are <i>&quot;out of scope&quot;<\/i> for a decentralized open protocol RFC, you are correct!  But that&#x27;s also why decentralized protocols don&#x27;t lead to the decentralized utopia that enthusiasts envision.  Consider that both the protocols TCPIP an HTTP are <i>already decentralized<\/i> -- and yet one decentralized node spelled &quot;thefacebook.com&quot; (and later changed to &quot;facebook.com&quot;) is now feared as too <i>centralized<\/i>.  Think deeply about how &amp; why that happened.  If your mental framework is limited to thinking about &quot;protocols&quot;, Facebook being centralized is a mysterious contradiction to decentralized tcpip&#x2F;http.  However, if your mental model <i>includes economic forces<\/i>, there is no contradiction.<p><i>&gt;web remains community-focused and user-oriented, just like it was originally intended to be.<\/i><p>Yes, Tim Berners-Lee developed the open http <i>protocol<\/i> and also open HTML language but he was originally trying to get scientists to share their data more easily.  He and his colleagues&#x27; salaries and their computers and servers to run http+html were <i>paid for by the government<\/i>.  His decentralized vision didn&#x27;t scale out to a billions of users because most everybody else doesn&#x27;t have the same financial situation.  The missing discussion about economics is the same missing factor in his newer SOLID project to re-decentralize the web.[3]<p>If everyone keeps writing essays on &quot;open protocols&quot; as being the savior from centralized behemoths, we&#x27;re not advancing the discussion.  We&#x27;re actually going backwards.  Look at history to see that open protocols do not achieve that goal as intuition would lead you to believe.  Instead, integrate realistic <i>economic incentives<\/i> into your predictions for a decentralized future and write new essays that take that into account.  Think about why the original Bitcoin whitepaper didn&#x27;t predict that mining would shift from a wide open democracy of home computers to a handful of miners in China.  Even the open protocol of Bitcoin blockchain couldn&#x27;t prevent economic incentives to consolidate into mining pools.  A protocol can&#x27;t stop a handful of miners in China to <i>spend more money<\/i> on custom ASIC chips and run thousands of them in datacenters to shift the balance of blockchain power from the hobbyists that mined on home computers with AMD graphics cards.<p>Maybe a thought experiment in a different domain to help break out of &quot;open protocol&quot; thinking:  The blockbuster film industry of English-language movies is too &quot;centralized&quot; in Hollywood.  Hmmm... so let&#x27;s create a new language (maybe Esperanto?) so that it breaks the power of Hollywood and 1000 decentralized film communities making Esperanto movies can flourish in places like Alabama and Montana.  Well, Esperanto or any other synthesized language will not solve the centralization problem.  The English language is already decentralized.  You&#x27;re proposed solution is at the wrong level of abstraction.  Look at the economics.  (E.g. millions of dollars to pay for desirable actors and special efx is out of reach for most hobbyists regardless of the spoken language.)<p>[0] &quot;openness of a protocol&quot; idealism such the early tcpip internet leaves out the fact that governments paid the salaries of people to implement a protocol and also paid for the computers to run a protocol:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20231960\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20231960<\/a><p>[1] Signal protocol is open and free (free-as-in-speech) but there are still economic forces (not free-as-in-beer) that affect decentralized deployment : \n <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20232499\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20232499<\/a><p>[2] decentralization works against the aggregate choices of how most people want to allocate their time &amp; money:   <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21535703\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21535703<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=SOLID+decentralized\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=SOLID+decentralized<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 14:14:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mark_l_watson"],"id":[24542661],"kids":{},"parent":[24535710],"text":["I like the author’s enthusiasm, even if I don’t personally think proof of work blockchain is a general solution (proof of stake blockchain for specific applications is more interesting to me).<p>I went to the distributed web conference a few years ago (and I was thrilled to have good and long conversations with Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf) but I am losing some interest in distributed web because other issues are more pressing that are only partly helped by distributed web: surveillance capitalism; attention economy; decoupling much of my time from using digital devices; government interference with free information flows; income inequality; lack of social discourse across political parties; etc. For me personally, these are the issues that I choose to address.<p>A little off topic, but I have recently updated the way I use tech: use freedom.to to make time wasting web sites and apps unavailable for large blocks of time during the day; reorganized my email and calendar to use Google’s services (I pay for ProtonMail and FastMail but I find that compromising on privacy for personal efficiency is better for me - as an author and developer I get a lot of email that I want to process in a personal way, but also be hyper efficient); I leave my iPhone at home, relying on my Apple Watch for receiving texts and calls (when I am out in the world, digital life can be too large of a distraction).<p>I have tried hard to use Mastodon social, but it takes too much of my time.
