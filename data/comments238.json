I imagine they aren’t as good as mid-sized cities for commodity careers due to the cost of living.<p>Disclaimer here: I don’t know anything about London. And I won’t talk about Brexit, that’s a separate and important consideration.<p>The higher salary will almost certainly make up for the cost of living.<p>You just need to do the math. The information is readily available. Find salary information for your role and experience level, and then jump on real estate websites and find out how much rentals costs near some of those employees.<p>I thought San Francisco was crazy until I did the math. Sure, the rent is $5000 a month or higher, but that’s only $48k a year more than a $1000 a month apartment in the Midwest United States. But you’re looking at a salary difference of over $100k, maybe even $200k, and all that extra money means extra savings that could be taken to a cheaper city when you retire, or help you retire faster.<p>Not only that, but everything that comes from a factory, and things like plane tickets all stay the same price while your salary is way higher.<p>I personally think going from a mid-size city to a larger one is appealing. Larger cities have more things to do, more ways to explore niche interests, and better transit.<p>There are downsides but I think some adjustment is all you need. For one, you have to take your personal belongings seriously. If you have a suburban habit of storing a bunch of stuff you don’t need, you will need to change that.

However, this attack is more limited because there is little to no control over the pseudorandom C1 and C2 (the only differing parts of the messages).<p>With a chosen prefix collision, though, things are way worse.

I have the gen 1 airpods, have had them about 1.5 years and overall, I have been pleased. Many people complain about battery life in the gen 1, I&#x27;ve never experienced this, but I typically only use 1 pod at a time and cycle them out when the battery gets low on one.<p>Pros: I think that the overall design&#x2F;form-factor is the true winner. The conveniently pocketable charging case, and the ability to wear them during physical activities without falling out, without the need for annoying straps etc is a huge win. Seriously. My hobby is skateboarding, and I have taken countless falls, tons of high-impact activity, and have never once had them fall out. Being free of wires also helps this. The pairing capabilities are fine (Mac and Iphone user), but I agree with what others are saying in that other options also handle this (almost) as well. I switching from IOS to Mac to be mostly seamless, but sometimes have issues switching from Mac to IOS. The sound quality is, meh, but this is Bluetooth, if you want audiophile quality, you must look for wired.<p>Cons: One major gripe I have with the Airpods is that, while using &#x27;Find-My&#x27; works great if you lost an Airpod outside the case (while paired), it does not work at all when the pods are in the case. I understand the charging case has no speaker, therefore no good way to alert, but if Apple had this feature on a new version, it might be enough to make me buy them before my current Airpods reach EOL. My second complaint, is that I feel like Apple is under-utilizing them as an input device for IOS&#x2F;Mac. You have the capability of summoning siri, and skipping tracks, but you can&#x27;t do both on a single pod. This design is bad UX for people like me, who typically only use 1 pod at a given time. I also think it would be nice to adjust volume with a gesture. I also get that Apple probably doesn&#x27;t want to have feature overlap between Airpods and Apple watch, but I digress.<p>Overall, despite some gripes, I don&#x27;t really see any better options at this time for what I need them to do. When my Gen 1s die, I will shell out for new ones. I hope that Apple doesn&#x27;t just rest on their laurels and actually adds some new features&#x2F;capabilities on subsequent releases, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath."],"time":["2020-01-08 14:51:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peterwwillis"],"id":[21986445],"kids":{},"parent":[21985239],"text":["Several brands&#x27; true wireless earbuds have been rated as just as good or better than Airpods, such as the Jabra Elite 65t and Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2, for significantly less ($100 and under).

Poverty consumes each person that lives inside of it and strips them of their own individual identity. As the author said, if you look at the faces of people around you long enough, you will start to see pain, fear, uncertainty, and many more unspoken emotions that is tied to poverty.<p>Poverty makes a person begin questioning what it is they did in their life that brought them to this low of a point. Ignoring all of the economic reasons and social standings, poverty makes the person believe they are incapable of ever achieving anything more. It is when that same person begins to actually feel as if they can escape poverty that they also begin to have stronger fears of insecurity. For many, they feel as if they do not belong in a higher bracket. Trailer parks, frozen foods, and generic brands are all they ever knew and it’s all they should ever have.<p>Being around those with money who have never experienced this lack of worth is a terrible time for those who came from poverty. In their eyes, if they were given the opportunity to be so comfortable in life, they would do anything they could to spread joy to anyone who walked through their door.

Which is true.<p>However a more practical HN topic would be &quot;we all know&quot; that inter building LAN networking should be optical for power isolation reasons, but &quot;we all know&quot; that often you can get away for years with copper network cables over a short enough distance if they&#x27;re on a similar enough electrical feed.  If you live in Florida, world capitol of thunderstorms, the wiring and switch ports won&#x27;t survive a week, but maybe northern yankees can do copper inter building networking for years between lightning related failures.  Anyway, yesterday, if you lost some ethernet switch ports or entire switches connected to 100 meter copper lines over long distances maybe to an outbuilding or up a tower or to the roof for cameras or something, well, you kinda know why now.  Of course you probably lose 0.1% per year of hardware anyway under normal conditions so maybe losses were mere coincidence... or was it?  There&#x27;s probably a dollar value to blown ethernet ports related to that storm; can&#x27;t say if its $10K or $10M worldwide but I&#x27;m sure at least SOME money was lost in hardware and lost productivity.<p>2) Aside from bulk power transport, and wired signalling, a third application of ground current is archaeological &#x2F; geological resistance surveys.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrical_resistance_survey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrical_resistance_survey<\/a><p>The idea is underground &quot;stuff&quot;, perhaps geology layers, perhaps ancient ruins, has varying DC resistance compared to typical background dirt and rock, and we have the technology to measure and map those electrical anomalies and therefore determine things about underground stuff.

I wonder how bad the geomagnetic weather has to be to keep construction civil engineering surveyors home for the day, probably pretty bad indeed, but I bet a lot less and a lot more likely to happen than it takes to &quot;short out substations&quot; and vaporize high voltage lines or whatever doomsayer stuff.<p>Aside from DC resistance measurements, I know the same people do magnetic surveys and likewise having a huge geomagnetic storm as a noise source would seem likely to degrade the gathered data."],"time":["2020-01-08 13:32:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tilt_error"],"id":[21986062],"kids":[21990515],"parent":[21984761],"text":["Moskstraumen?"],"time":["2020-01-07 23:52:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["77544cec"],"id":[21989699],"kids":{},"parent":[21984761],"text":["The earth is about to flip !<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E31FHHH9is4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E31FHHH9is4<\/a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1UJKZTjGCss\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1UJKZTjGCss<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-08 10:02:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["abcleb"],"id":[21990325],"kids":[21990353,21993791],"parent":[21984761],"text":["USA might have used harp to cause an earthquake in Iran near a nuclear location.

It relies on a combination of physical process and cryptological algorithms, rather than either of those separately. It harvests randomness from physical processes, and uses that randomness efficiently. The hash saturation principle is used to distill the data, so that the output is virtually 100% random for all practical purposes. This is calculated based on physical properties of the inputs, not merely estimated by looking at the statistics of the outputs.

A lot of it was about naming. It occurred to me that very opinionated people had no idea what people in the community are actually doing, and so the whole excercise seemed like a learning experience for them, which seems to be a good thing.<p>The goals of AI (which Google trends classifies as “field of study” - I think that captures it quite well) haven’t changed in decades - to reverse engineer the miracle of human cognition. A certain number of people (like the teams of Yoshua Bengio or Demis Hassabis) have the clear mission to work on just that. The progress in this area is much slower than the perception of the last 5-10 years would suggest. It was just that work from the 90s and 2000s were put to test and quickly outperformed other approaches - symbolic or what we now call “classic machine learning” (e.g. in speech recognition, image classification&#x2F;detection, machine translation, Information retrieval). All these areas had important and valuable applications in industry and have sucked up a lot of money.<p>But this is only a tiny part of what human cognition entails. Areas around memory, reasoning, consciousness etc. are completely unsolved. Where are we on a scale of 0 to 1000 of solving the problem? Perhaps somewhere between 20 and 50, nobody knows. AI is a north star, and it is a weird development that people have started to call it “AI” again (it felt totally weird about 3-4 years ago when this happened).<p>So, I think the field is still rightly called “AI”.

If I’m using a query tool like this it will be interactively writing a one-liner so I want syntax that’s easy to get right (balancing parens by hand is hard), easy in the usual case (eg I think it should accept some way to use symbols to name fields in a record because typing and balancing double quotes all of the time is a waste of time) and easy to append to (I will run a query, press up, move to the end of the query, and modify. In this case I think moving to the end involves counting parens).<p>Perhaps I would want some implicit pipe or threading at the top level (which could be turned off with some option for scripts I guess).<p>Another helpful feature could be adding the magic closing paren: ] which will close all open parens to the top level. E.g. these two lines are equivalent:<p><pre><code>  (foo (bar (baz) whizz))\n  (foo (bar (baz) whizz]\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA completely different (and less powerful) paradigm I like is one of match-format where the pattern looks a lot like what it’s trying to match. In this case most functions and fancy transformations are impossible. So you could write something like this to extract the list of countries:<p><pre><code>  j &#x27;{countries: %%}&#x27;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nOr to extract each country’s name:<p><pre><code>  j &#x27;{countries: [ .*, { name: %% }, .*]}&#x27;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n(Presumably you would have syntax for trying to match against each array element).

It could finish by outputting a command line to run the query non-interactively.<p>The closest thing to this I know of is a small programming by example demo that came out of Microsoft research. The goal was to figure out how to extract some desired data from some big blob of json (or maybe html, I don’t remember). The user would see the json in some web gui and could click on the data they wanted and the app would try to figure out the “most obvious” query to get it. If they clicked on the country name, I think it would probably suggest a query for all the countries’ names (but maybe that would be the second option). I think it would also try to be clever about grouping, so if the user picked name and population it would hopefully figure out that they should come in pairs rather than being two independent lists that might not be the same length."],"time":["2020-01-07 20:51:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lcfcjs2"],"id":[21984326],"kids":{},"parent":[21981158],"text":["Syntax is too confusing, I&#x27;ll stick with jq thanks"],"time":["2020-01-07 21:18:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["intsunny"],"id":[21977864],"kids":[21978131,21980711,21978003,21977882,21979844,21978516,21978535,21980982,21981173,21984501,21989062,21989851,21981381,21978388],"parent":[21975877],"text":["I&#x27;m convinced there is a conspiracy that prevents laptop manufacturers from shipping AMD chips on 13&quot; high end laptops.

My mothers attitude was that it is better to have a boring stable job that provides enough for you and your family than to be rich or famous. For example she implored me to study for a fall-back manual trade in case the computing degree thing didn&#x27;t work out.<p>Recently, I decided to go self-employed and do my own thing in my own time. This was driven by the fact that having worked for a few startups I couldn&#x27;t deal with the success at all costs approach of some of the founders and managers. For example being forced to push out new features before they are ready, knowing that the technical debt is mounting and that it will come back to bite me one day. Trying to explain why stuff like this was a bad idea would be met with a response implying I didn&#x27;t care for the company and didn&#x27;t value success. I also got frequently reprimanded for refusing to do overtime on a regular basis, preferring instead to be with my family. Plus all this was usually coupled with some horrific &quot;Fake it till you make it&quot; promotional activities that we&#x27;d get roped in to.<p>One of the founders went out and got himself a Porsche 911 and put an email around the office showing it off and telling us if we worked hard to make the company a success we too could afford a similar car.

Rails was the hot thing those days because of this as well. Hence we saw many new grads or even people who change careers to fullstack development and bootcamps churning out these workers at an incredible pace (regardless of quality) but the job market took it because the job market was desperate for fullstack engineers.<p>During that time, the best career move you can do was to join the startups movement as fullstack engineers and get some equity as compensation. These equities, if you are lucky, can really be life changing.<p>Fast forward now, the low hanging CRUD apps (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc) search space has been exhausted, and even new unicorns (i.e., Uber) don&#x27;t make that much money, if they do for that matter. Now those companies have become big, they are the winners in this winner take all filed that is the cloud tech software. Now these companies these days have no use for fullstack engineers anymore, but more specialists that do few things albeit on a deeper level.<p>Today, even the startup equity math has changed a lot. Even with a good equity package, a lot of the search space has been exhausted. So being fullstack engineers these days that join startups don&#x27;t pay as much anymore. Instead, a better move would be to try to get into one of these companies because their pay just dwarfed any startups or even medium &#x2F; big size companies.<p>Just my 2c as someone who is very green (5 yrs) doing software engineering.

Soon I\ngraduated and was a new B-school prof\nwhere the school wanted more in computing.\nSo, I led an effort to get a Prime -- we\ndid.  IBM and their super-salesman Buck\nRodgers tried hard but lost.<p>The Prime was easy to run, very useful,\nand popular but would not have replaced\nIBM mainframe work running CICS, IMS, DB2,\netc.  Of course, in a B-school, we wanted\nto run word processing, D. Knuth&#x27;s TeX\nmath word whacking, SPSS statistics, some\nadvanced spreadsheet software (with linear\nprogramming optimization), etc. and not\nCICS, IMS, DB2.<p>(2) Later I was at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab in an\nAI group.  For our general purpose use,\nour lab had six IBM mainframes, IIRC U, V,\nW, X, Y, Z. As I recall they had one\nprocessor <i>core<\/i> each with a processor\nclock likely no faster that 153 MHz.<p>Okay, in comparison, the processor in my\nfirst server in my startup is an AMD\nFX-8350 with 8 cores and a standard clock\nspeed of 4.0 GHz.<p>So, let&#x27;s take a ratio:<p>(8 * 4.0 * 10<i><\/i>9)&#x2F;(6 * 153 * 10<i><\/i>6) = 34.9<p>so that, first cut, just on processor clock\nticks, the one AMD processor is 35 times\nfaster than all the general purpose\nmainframes at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab when I was\nthere.<p>But, still, on IBM&#x27;s &quot;mainframe monopoly&quot;,\nif what you want is really an IBM\nmainframe, e.g., to run old software, then\nabout the only place to get one is from\nIBM.  So, IBM still has their &quot;mainframe\nmonopoly&quot;.<p>Or to be extreme, an Apple iPhone, no\nmatter how fast it is, does not really\nthreaten the IBM &quot;mainframe monopoly&quot;.<p>Continuing:<p>&gt; ... like DEC, Data General, Wang\nLaboratories, Apollo Computer, and Prime\nComputers.

There&#x27;s a reason this is going to the supreme court, the rulings didn&#x27;t really match up with accepted evidence and testimony of experts in the court.<p>Google will lose this. You don&#x27;t explicitly copy code, take other people&#x27;s engineers after exiting licensing talks with the company you took from, and have it not be about stealing someone else&#x27;s intellectual efforts.<p>The courts have already explicitly denied Google&#x27;s claim they did this for compatibility or interoperability. The grey area is how much damage Google has done to Oracle, and it&#x27;s hard to put an explicit price on that. But given the popularity of Android and how Google&#x27;s has massively benefited from the platform, in no small thanks to the development community around it, and given the absolutely morbid failure of its other community dev efforts it&#x27;s not really hard to see that Android wouldn&#x27;t be what it is today without Java; having a familiar platform for developers to code against is priceless (but not legally).<p>Google wanted all the benefits of using Java without actually paying for it.<p>Sun put a lot, and I mean a lot of money into Java. Java had well defined licensing terms for how to use their code. Oracle bought Java. Oracle has the rights to license and price their code however they want. Google does not. Google was in talks with Oracle to license Java but backed out when they didn&#x27;t want to pay to use it. Instead Google took engineers from the company they copied code from, and re-licensed said code.<p>It&#x27;s black and white but people&#x27;s blind hate for Oracle leads them down an argument or view point the courts have already denied and are now ignoring.<p>Don&#x27;t sacrifice your principles for some cheap hit against Oracle. If Google can just throw their man power around to ignore your license, your open source license will not matter. You will not get credit for the work you do. Google and others can just feel like they don&#x27;t want to abide by your license, take your code, and re-license it however they want. It&#x27;s already hard to enforce any type of open source licence but if Google comes out on top it really won&#x27;t matter moving forward.

If a new system can fix that without sacrificing any of Git&#x27;s benefits, I think it can topple Git.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that Git was popularized in the same era as monorepos, yet Git is a poor fit for monorepos.  There have been some attempts to work around this.  Google&#x27;s `repo` command is a wrapper around Git that treats a set of smaller repos like one big one, but it&#x27;s a (very) leaky abstraction.  Microsoft&#x27;s GVFS is a promising attempt to truly scale Git to giant repos, but it&#x27;s developed as an addon rather than a core part of Git, and so far it only works on Windows (with macOS support in development).  GVFS arguably has the potential to become an ubiquitous part of the Git experience, someday... but it probably won&#x27;t.<p>Git also has trouble with large files.  The situation is better these days, as most people have seemingly standardized on git-lfs (over its older competitor git-annex), and it works pretty well.  Nevertheless, it feels like a hack that &quot;large&quot; files have to be managed using a completely different system from normal files, one which (again) is not a core part of Git.<p>There exist version control systems that do scale well to large repos and large files, but all the ones I&#x27;ve heard of have other disadvantages compared to Git.  For example, they&#x27;re not decentralized, or they&#x27;re not as lightning-fast as Git is in smaller repos, or they&#x27;re harder to use.  That&#x27;s why I think there&#x27;s room for a future competitor!<p>(Fossil is not that competitor.

Again. :)<p>============<p>Yes, I know you love to run around going “Craig’s not Satoshi, don&#x27;t listen to him”. However, all of that is irrelevant. The simple fact of the matter is that I&#x27;ve taken the original protocol that I designed and implemented it and it scales and it works. Not the way that people like James A. Donald desired (and yes, he is a child pornography and paedophile and that is part of why he wanted an anonymous coin, something I didn&#x27;t realise in 2008). Rather, it is a micropayments system that changes the entire nature of the Internet. It allows companies like Google and Facebook, or rather the ones that will replace them to create systems that earn through micropayments and at the same time allow individuals to earn the money to pay for this. It&#x27;s not the concept that people in the cryptocurrency space think about, but then the people in the cryptocurrency space are rarely those who will take this forward.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, you can still play. I do know how to fix lightning; I have patents on it. Likewise, I have patents that would fix Ethereum but then I don&#x27;t need to, bitcoin doesn&#x27;t need Ethereum.<p>It surprises me how little people bother to learn. The entire cryptocurrency space is premised on ideas that have gone before. The only true innovation that I added to bitcoin was an economic system that linked to a traceable pseudonymous series of transactions. Proof of work-based Cryptocurrencies existed 20 years ago. Distributed Cryptocurrencies existed 20 years ago. The entire technical and corporate space 20 years ago was larger than the entire bitcoin space and in fact cryptocurrency space at the peak a couple years ago. But then, few bother to actually do the research. Few and then fewer even bother to understand that the concept of a blockchain, of hashing a block of information into next block was not new. It was published 25 years ago.<p>Yet none of you seem to have bothered to take the time to read the source documents. I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised at this sort of attitude, I sought in students all the time. People are becoming lazy, not all of us but many.\nIt&#x27;s interesting in a way that people believe that bitcoin acts outside of government and law. In the Whitepaper I stated that bitcoin nodes, miners enforce the rules. I didn&#x27;t say that they create the rules. I said that the rules were set in stone. The incentive system allows miners to act in a manner that keeps them honest. You see, in law, the definitions of used in the Whitepaper have meaning. In particular, the term attacker has meaning.<p>Bitcoin is an economic system. Miners always end in data centres. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you change the proof of work protocol. If an ASIC device was never created, it would still be more efficient for miners to end running many many computers in a data centre. In scale there is efficiency.\nThe problem is that you guys think you can beat me. You don&#x27;t even realise you&#x27;ve already lost. Then, commenting on information that I know when you don&#x27;t and some of you will say this informational asymmetry is an unfair advantage. I&#x27;m sorry if you&#x27;re a snowflake and I don&#x27;t care.<p>This collectivist, socialist mindset that has infiltrated what people call libertarian thought is rather despicable. You seem to actually believe, surprising as that seems that you have a right and that I have an obligation to give you information. That when I&#x27;m not seeking anything from you, what am not asking you to help, where in fact I don&#x27;t actually care two damns about your existence that I should do something to obtain your gratification or even some respect from you. I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t care about the respect that some people seem to garnish and gather from social media sites to their pseudonymous identities. It is funny to watch however.\nEnjoy. 2020 is going to be an interesting year and some of you are going to find out how interesting very shortly."],"time":["2020-01-07 12:23:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["rechargedishtv"],"id":[21978975],"kids":{},"parent":[21975736],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rechargedishtv.in&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rechargedishtv.in&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-07 12:28:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["janu12"],"id":[22033546],"kids":{},"parent":[21975736],"text":["This post is extremely easy to peruse and acknowledge without forgetting any subtle elements.

Some factory owners work hard for a year, while the incoming is even less than the value increased of lands he owns.<p>So the business all goes to the lands, housing, malls. People don&#x27;t know where is the top, but people believe is far more yet. Because Hong Kong, the city next to Shenzhen, has a higher land price.<p>For the future, the great bay area may solve this issue. Shenzhen will focus on the development of high-tech technology as a research center and enterprise center. The manufactory will move to Dongguan, Huizhou. While HongKong serves as a business&#x2F;finance center. Guangdong will be the transaction center.<p>It is possible with the highly developed traffic net.

They become programmers, researchers, programming language designers, QA engineers, systems analysts, etc., and eventually technical managers and business leaders.  And they also get all the benefits of having a very technical and highly educated workforce.  It&#x27;s interesting that a recent survey of their school children, said that 56%  wanted to become Astronauts.<p>The next phase of their national development should probably be to move into design, research, development, and ultimately indigenous intellectual property.<p>The past 10 years of smartphones have changed the country, that their children are exposed to all the software and technology at a young age.  This should make it easier for them to become engineers, programmers, scientists, and mathematicians, as they enter college.<p>Their current generation of engineers has proven that they have the technical capabilities to achieve that.  They appear to be very good at building massive infrastructure.  So they can plan, design, architect, and build out massive things (high speed rail, rockets, military planes).  But let&#x27;s see if they can build out small things, like software systems (OS, compilers, AI, etc.)<p>It will be interesting if Huawei takes the lead, and their new Harmony OS becomes a viable contender in the mobile space in China.  Or if it even displaces Windows and Linux as the primary desktop or server operating system within China.  Maybe Microsoft would eventually port over Word and Excel to the Harmony OS?<p>And I&#x27;m still waiting for them to come up with their own programming language.  Although this might be a tall order, as C is quite popular there.  However, the guy who created Vue.js is of Chinese descent, but it seems America snatched him away.  Now I could be wrong, but the current perception appears as if the Trump administration is hell bent on alienating everyone of Chinese descent from working in America.<p>If they can succeed at all this, then a slowdown in the Shenzhen manufacturing economy for export, is irrelevant.

And the first thing to know is what they found is, the central prediction, I believe it was the modal prediction, close to the median prediction, was 20 years away. But what&#x27;s really interesting is that they then went back and divided the data by year, and it turns out that people have always been saying it&#x27;s 20 years away. And they were saying it was 20 years away in 1955 and they&#x27;re saying it now. And so people always think it&#x27;s just around the corner. The joke in the field is that if you say it&#x27;s 20 years away, you can get a grant to do it.
