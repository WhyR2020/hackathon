The first is that Python’s list is fast, really fast. Lists have great characteristics for memory management and random access. The second is that bisect.insort is fast. This is somewhat counter-intuitive since it involves shifting a series of items in a list. But modern processors do this really well. A lot of time has been spent optimizing mem-copy&#x2F;mem-move-like operations both in hardware and software.<p>&gt; But using only one list and bisect.insort would produce sluggish behavior for lengths exceeding ten thousand. So the implementation of Sorted List uses a list of lists to store elements. In this way, inserting or deleting is most often performed on a short list. Only rarely does a new list need to be added or deleted.<p>&gt; Sorted List maintains three internal variables: _lists, _maxes, and _index. The first is simply the list of lists, each member is a sorted sublist of elements. The second contains the maximum element in each of the sublists. This is used for fast binary-search.

Everyday there is a video conference call.<p>This communication is mostly about trying to keep a relationship with the teacher and sharing stories they are writing only if a student desires.<p>2. There is no teaching, just lesson plans.<p>The responsibility of the actual schooling has been left completely up to the caregivers at home.<p>3. Schoolwork is expected to be uploaded daily.<p>There was no set way to do this. We are simply taking photos of the work done on paper (and at times screen shots if a login is shared for an activity) and pasting them in a google doc for each day in the students NYC google drive account.<p>4. There has been zero specific feedback on any of the work submitted.<p>The only accountability has been an online sticker chart where parents award award stars and teacher do also. We have given 1 star a day for completing assigned work, and 2 for a day when it is done with less struggle to maintain attention. Each parent has their own view of what a star means.<p>5. Writing has been the main focus over the past month.<p>My child already struggles with “writers block” even in school. We are fortunate to have a retired teachers assistant in our household who is able to do one-on-one teaching. While not trained or experienced  in first grade education with the attention my child receives I have seen more improvement in the past month than the previous three months by a long shot.<p>6. The schooldays often goes later than when in school, and rarely earlier.<p>This is skewed by a new 9:00 start time, so the actual time may be less, but I would say it feels like more. It took at least 3 weeks to get into a rhythm where the days did drag out from morning to night.<p>7. There is no homework anymore.<p>Well, more correctly homework was initially part of the daily lesson plan, but we always did it during the day.<p>8. Reading, social studies and science have been done almost exclusively online.<p>This is the easiest for us as it is mostly self directed at this point. Additionally no work needs to be uploaded. IT started with Social Studies and Science each day, but they are now alternating days.<p>9. Friday’s have just become catch up days.<p>This is great, but in our situation was not necessary. We are hoping this means a 4 day school week.<p>10. We left NYC to a place where we have space to have school in a separate room behind a closed door.<p>I don’t think it would have been possible in our NYC apartment to limit distractions. There is also a younger sibling that requires attention and provides distraction to the student.  In addition we now have ample outdoor space to allow the children to play with zero pandemic anxiety involved.<p>11. We still get assignments for the enrichment classes (music, art, physical education, and foreign language) separate from the primary teacher.<p>The first three are generally videos posted of the teacher providing interactive instruction. Foreign language is done with an online lesson and mimics social studies and science comments above.<p>The morning conference call does not address these at all.<p>In summary, my child has probably been doing better or as well as most in their class, and I don’t think they are falling behind. However, this is due to the time we have to teach them ourselves and not the attention given by the teacher. The teacher has been good at creating lesson plans and lowering our expectations, but other than that has been diminished to a technical support role in our case. There has been little to no remote teaching. We do have the ability to call hotlines and request more help from the teacher, but I can’t comment on those methods."],"time":["2020-04-29 13:53:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jiux"],"id":[23016655],"kids":{},"parent":[23010079],"text":["I’m a single, full-time dad to two girls - a six year old kindergartener and two year old toddler.<p>I’ll share some of my observations and thoughts so far (in no particular order):<p>- It’s nice to be around them more. Seriously. I personally invest a lot into their development and seeing them positively grow is a great feeling. Being around them more during the day seems to amplify this. “Time” is finite.<p>- I put my daughter into private school and the expensive monthly tuition bill still came at full price. Was it fair? I don’t know. I knew I could get by financially so never brought it up with hopes it might just help a teacher keep a paycheck. The teachers are passionate and are really trying with distant learning too. If anything, they deserve more.<p>- No longer paying for a babysitter nor after school care returned a lot back into the wallet. This actually turned into a new and positive financial investment adventure. I’ve saved more money in the last two months than I have in a year. ”Wow” is the feeling.<p>- The heightened risk around handled food has mentally “forced” me into eating exclusively at home from grocery store goods. We three were a 99% eat-out&#x2F;takeout everyday family beforehand. Surprisingly, the adaptation has been a lot easier than expected. Eating out was almost never for self-pleasure, just convenient usually. This also has helped save lots of $$$.<p>- The commute to work has lightened up a little. I think maybe 10ft (+&#x2F;- a foot or two for you anal type). The car has been with a full tank for over a month. ~5 miles in this timeframe, all of which for grocery store (wow more money saved).<p>- Morning commute consisted of driving girls to school and babysitter, then to work. That short distance in the car alone cost me ~1 hour each way, so ~2 hours of time returned daily. I normally lay outfits out the night before, the toddler is usually chill about what outfit to wear, and the school requires uniforms, so morning prep was fast and smooth, usually. Maybe 30 minutes returned here.<p>- Standard of cleaning dipped lower than desired once we became the three musketeers. New found time went as fast as it came here. Having our apartment a little more clean feels good though.<p>- My official title at the 9-5 is “software engineer”, so the concept of working from home is realistic. Doing so with children as a single parent is where reality hits the fan too. Just one child around is not too bad, doesn’t matter which one. Having both means girls argue, fight over stuff like who gets the last corndog, if Barbie should or shouldn’t go stand in the corner in timeout for doing something bad, so on. My concentration skills with work have been tested here FOR SURE. It’s easy and then it’s not. Productivity is overall on average higher when they take an afternoon nap and lower when awake and about.<p>- This whole online learning concept sounds nice on paper and might be the best alternative next to in-person schooling, but man it really is difficult to pull off during the week for me. An hour or two a day? I’m already writing this at 3am if that tells you anything. That might be realistic to some, but it’s not for me, and I’m not even dismissing any opportunity to save time. For example, I have it figured out when I wake up: first use the restroom, wash hands, then proceed to brush teeth after washing hands, but before drying. This saves from wetting hands and drying with towel twice. When time is at a premium, it makes you think about weird stuff like that. I try for weekends to catch up on daughters schooling. We are a week and a half behind. I also emailed the teacher on my own behalf to simply let her know I’m having a hard time keeping up and to ask if she had any tips or suggestions to offer.<p>Overall, social distancing hasn’t phased us since we keep to ourselves in our private time for the most part already. No real negatives experienced on a personal level and our health is good. I suspect this concept of online learning might be easy for some, if not most, but it sure as hell hasn’t been for me with time already at a premium.<p>My girls and I will get through it, just like the rest of you reading this will."],"time":["2020-04-29 10:05:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DiffEq"],"id":[23011446],"kids":[23011559,23011751,23011610,23011518,23011867,23011762,23012645,23012090,23026559,23013339,23013320,23011652,23011527,23011987,23012830],"parent":[23010079],"text":["Just want to take exception to what you have said here.

Here is another video from Southern Saskatchewan.  People might be interested in the equipment being used.  Mike is quite an character.  He works on a big operation, I think over 20k acres.  The equipment he is using costs a fair bit of cash.  The seeding system (para-link hoe drill) and tractor to pull it likely costs between 500k and 1m CAD.  They have multiple units like that.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uM5ZBNzvKz4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uM5ZBNzvKz4<\/a><p>The video doesn&#x27;t show too much of it but Mike&#x27;s equipment a bunch of technology on it as well.  Some of the stuff:<p>- auto section control: turns off&#x2F;on seed &amp; fertilizer automatically to minimize overlaps and prevent skips.  On large machines (e.g. 80 ft) the cost of overlap is quite significant.  The seed and fertilizer is carried by a pneumatic system and optimally tuning the system is a bit tricky (he shows a bit of that)<p>- auto rate control&#x2F;variable rate control: with variable rate, the field is split into many zones and the applied rate of seed and fertilizer is optimized.  That&#x27;s a whole topic into itself, I won&#x27;t explain here.<p>- population&#x2F;blockage monitoring: this system monitors seed and fertilizer flow in the pneumatic delivery system and will alert the operator is something is wrong (blocked run, rate to high or low).  That&#x27;s the &quot;Agtron&quot; system he is talking about.<p>- I don&#x27;t know if his para-link drill has it but there is a variable packing system available.  That will monitor packer (the wheel behind the seed opener) and adjust packing pressure depending on field conditions.  Wet areas of the field will need less down pressure compared to dry areas<p>- As is typical these days, GPS mapping, guidance.  He has two different screens showing the map.  The Deere screen doesn&#x27;t show the individual on&#x2F;off sections of the drill and so it shows more overlap.  The Topcon screen (comes with drill) shows the sections.<p>- The system for controlling the metering on the drill is fairly advanced.  For planters, it is typically more advanced yet (corn seed is really expensive and so very precisely metering it and placing it is key).  On the Bourgault drill he is using, there is a variable speed hydraulic motor on the metering system with a feedback control loop to control the rate.  Early in the video he is calibrating those meters so the system knows the mass-flow feedrate of the meter (e.g. RPM of meter -&gt; lbs&#x2F;min of material).

Since I&#x27;ve short DSLRs for almost 20 years now, my workflow is wired to work with the technology and its limitations.  And DSLRs have some significant limitations.<p><i>Let&#x27;s forget about the limitations of small sensors and tiny optics for a bit. It&#x27;s a phone and not a DSLR or a medium format camera with glass that costs more than your car.  It can only do so much.<\/i>.<p>When I shoot I aim for data capture and not how the image looks as shot.  How it looks comes later.  Which, in overly simplified terms, means: don&#x27;t blow out the highlights ever and try to keep the noise level in the shadows as low as possible.  Or in other words: try to get as much as possible within the dynamic range of the sensor at the lowest possible sensitivity (amplification?) setting of the sensor.  (I&#x27;m not fond of large grain - artificial or otherwise).<p>The post processing is essentially about taking more data that your output medium can reasonably render and then offset, squeeze and stretch parts of the dynamic range until you get the tonality you want from the data you have.<p>Even the iPhone 6 did an amazing job at automating this.  But I can&#x27;t help but feel that with each generation, iPhones get a little bit worse.  It tries to do more, which means that when it gets things wrong, the results can get really horrible.  And I&#x27;m not fond of images that have had heavy alterations of pixels.<p>Sure, most people aren&#x27;t going to see this when the image is rendered on a surface that isn&#x27;t that much bigger than a baseball card.  And sure, for most pictures it probably isn&#x27;t going to be as noticable for the 2 seconds they spend looking at it.<p>And as someone else pointed out, if you are going to fake focus blur, you&#x27;re going to have to do a hell of a lot more complex stuff than just smearing pixels with gaussian blur or any other blurring method that doesn&#x27;t model how lenses actually work.<p>If you want a really stark example, take a 85mm Petzval lens, or some other &quot;bokeh monster&quot;, shoot it wide open with a foreground subject that is 2m away against a background that is 4-5 meters away that contains lots of small highlights.  Then repeat the same with various iPhones.<p>No the iPhone doesn&#x27;t have a Petzval lens or any other (relatively) large lens.  So why try to fake that you do?  If you want the visual effects of large glass then shoot with large glass.<p>As a hobbyist photographer I find it easier when a camera doesn&#x27;t try to be clever.  When it just does what it does.  To me a mobile phone camera is more of a &quot;documentation camera&quot; - it should try to capture what you are interested in.  It doesn&#x27;t always have to be pretty.  It just needs to be reasonably accurate.  Subtly applied HDR tricks are okay since it helps you capture what you are looking at, but when you start to alter pixels, it becomes less useful as a tool."],"time":["2020-04-28 15:09:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["type0"],"id":[23025645],"kids":{},"parent":[23003308],"text":["That just looks strange, I would not subject my dog to such terrible portraits."],"time":["2020-04-30 01:07:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["diogenescynic"],"id":[23003731],"kids":[23004279],"parent":[23003308],"text":["I really wish there was an iPhone SE Plus.

More stringent than China at their COVID peak.<p>* Indian public health is at the very least experienced, (I think competent as well, but opinions there may vary) with national epidemics.<p>* Indians know what mortality feels like. &lt;- My opinion, but the west simply doesn&#x27;t fear death the same way. For good reason, but in India a silent biological killer of millions is something people intuitively understand. In part due to wounds of Plague, TB, Aids, Malaria and Polio, all being quite fresh in memory.<p>* More fact, Indians also know what national emergencies and curfews feels like. We have had a few in the last few decades, and some have been nearly as drastic.<p>* India relied strongly on ICMR (it&#x27;s medical research body) over WHO or the US&#x27;s recommendations. That included using funding to push a lockdown far earlier into the spread than other nations, consistently recommending masks and contact tracing. On the other hand, testing and ventilator recommendations were not taken and it has worked. The death rate of COVID patients on ventilators is 88%. It is less a life saving device and more an expensive pyre. India has also been smart about running really intelligent statistical tests instead of mass testing. They randomly tested people coming in reporting pneumonia symptoms, they tested randomly sampled population and closely tracked the death rate, instead of spending 100s of millions on testing everyone. (esp. when everyone is 1 billion people) Additionally if high rates of testing only serve to better provide recommendations on distancing, mask wear and lockdowns, then India has jumped to stringent action already, making high rates of testing rather meaningless. (2 week delayed death number spikes are far more reliable for longer term decision making such as when to restart the economy)<p>(also, even more controversial, it doesn&#x27;t help that the Indian intellectual and political left (esp. the Luthiens Delhi crowd), despises the current government, and would rather evangelize and believe in its incompetence, ever get caught giving it credit where it is due. I say this as someone who would be considered a proper social democrat in the US and is not a fan of the current US or Indian Govt.)<p>Is it possible that there are other reasons for why India has low Covid-19 death rates ? -&gt; Of course it is possible. But, the pigheaded quest of the western media to find an alternative &quot;godsent&quot; reason to keep believing that India has an incompetent public health infrastructure is honestly quite appalling."],"time":["2020-04-28 16:16:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Syzygies"],"id":[23007674],"kids":{},"parent":[23004361],"text":["As I write the word &quot;immune&quot; appears only twice in 161 comments.<p>In &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s Truth&quot; by Erik Erikson, he wrote fifty years ago of adapting one&#x27;s immune system to India as a rite of passage.

Are you on this, Cathy?<\/i><p>Cathy Spindler: <i>Right. So, there was an article that I first saw in the LA Times &quot;Chinese Scientists Say Second Coronavirus Strain Is More Dangerous&quot;[2]. But in that there&#x27;s a link to virological.org, which we talked about another article posted there a couple of weeks ago[3], and they really debunk this and think even that this Chinese article about a second Coronavirus should be retracted. Two of the key claims that are reached by misunderstanding and overinterpreation of data and an additional analysis suffers from methodological limitations. So this long thing on virological.org goes in to the reasons why there&#x27;s no real evidence for two different strains, a more severe strain and a less severe strain.<\/i><p>Rich Condit: <i>It also provides a nice summary of this sort of variation in sequence that&#x27;s being observed in the virus over time, which is good.<\/i><p>Vincent: <i>Yeah, it&#x27;s a good article. We&#x27;ll put a link. It&#x27;s worth reading, but as everyone should know, when these [indistinct] viruses, every replication cycle they sustain mutations in their genomes and the lethal ones are gone, the viruses don&#x27;t reproduce, but some of them stay and if they&#x27;re neutral they remain. So they can be characteristic. So the virus introduced in to the Washington area is a single introduction and then it&#x27;s spread and you can tell that because it has a unique set of mutations compared to say, the Chinese isolate, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything biologically. It&#x27;s just markers.<\/i><p>Rich: <i>And the markers are really interesting because they give you insight in to, I mean the insight that I got from observing what came out of the Washington cases is that from looking at the sequence of the virus they concluded that in fact it had been circulating for some time, and they could even get a very very rough estimate of how many cases might be out there based on the variation in sequence and the time at which the disease first showed up in a person.<\/i><p>Vincent: <i>I think there are some emails later about this. People are concerned that, and people suggest in these papers, at least the one here, that we&#x27;re being critical of that it could be evolved to be more virulent or more transmissible. There&#x27;s no evidence for that whatsoever.<\/i><p>Rich: <i>This is the kind of thing that... it just won&#x27;t go away!<\/i><p>Vincent: <i>Oh, it doesn&#x27;t go away... new outbreak and it comes back.<\/i><p>Rich: <i>Yeah, and there&#x27;s no evidence. People have looked at this. We&#x27;ve gone over this for several.. Zika, Ebola, where&#x27;s there&#x27;s been variation and people point to a particular variation and they say, &quot;This is going to make it more virulent&quot; or something, and then the experiments ultimately get done and no. It hasn&#x27;t made a difference.<\/i><p>Vincent: <i>And also the issue of increased transmissibility, I think this virus is already very transmissible as it is, and I think the mutations that made it effectively transmissible among humans, which happened very early on, I don&#x27;t know, either in animals or in humans early on, before we knew about it, they&#x27;re done, and it&#x27;s going to be hard to know what they were. MERS coronavirus has never acquired those high transmissibility changes and it keeps fizzling out and then you have another reintroduction from camels but this particular SARS-Cov-2 sustained them probably early on and it&#x27;s a very good transmitter. It doesn&#x27;t need to get better, at least from my anthropocentric view. We never really know what viruses are selected by, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence, and it&#x27;s very hard to get that evidence. That paper tells you what you need to prove that mutations are doing something phenotypically. It&#x27;s very hard to get that.<\/i><p>Rich: <i>It has occurred to me that people who don&#x27;t think about this stuff every day might be a little confused by this discussion relative to the discussion that goes on all the time about variation in influenza virus strains, and new strains coming up and having to change the vaccine and stuff. But that&#x27;s different. That&#x27;s variation in the influenza virus that makes it evade the existing immunity, and those sorts of variations arise so you get circulation of viruses that you don&#x27;t have as good an immune response to, but that&#x27;s different than a virus making mutations that make it more virulent. It&#x27;s a different story.<\/i><p>Then they talk about it again in episode 592[4]:<p>Alan Dove: <i>David sends a link to a paper on possibly being two strains of SARS-CoV-2.  This says, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen this pop up.&quot;<\/i><p>Vincent Racaniello: <i>These are just basically single nucleotide polymorphisms.<\/i><p>Dove: <i>Oh those, yeah.<\/i><p>Rich Condit: <i>This is the paper where they were talking about an S-type and an L-type and one maybe being more pathogenic than another and blah blah blah blah.  Basically, yes, there&#x27;s variation in the virus.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything.<\/i><p>Racaniello:  <i>No.  They have no evidence that&#x27;s it&#x27;s functionally of any importance at all.  No.  But he does say &quot;this virus has now conducted many human-to-human transmissions.  Have we discovered mutations that enhance transmission?  Welcome to evolution.&quot;  Well, the problem is you need to have the virus before it started transmitting efficiently among people.  Right?  And we don&#x27;t have that and I&#x27;m not sure we ever will.  But then maybe you could look at it and see what changes occur.  And I&#x27;m not sure you could ever do anything about it because you can&#x27;t infect people and we don&#x27;t have a good animal model for transmission so, no.  Unfortunately we won&#x27;t be able to know about that.<\/i><p>And in episode 596[5]:<p>Rich Condit:  <i>So the second question is the doctor asking.. It&#x27;s basically, can the virus mutate so you wouldn&#x27;t be immune to it?  And our understanding, my understanding with SARS-CoV-2 now is that there&#x27;s no evidence that it&#x27;s going to undergo what we call antigenic drift, right, that it will be SARS-CoV-2 for the foreseable future, and once you mount an immune response to that you&#x27;ll be immune to it and there won&#x27;t be, as far as we know, new strains coming up to which you will not be immune.  These things, the human coronaviruses seem to be pretty stable over time.  Yes, they can accumulate mutations but they are of essentially no consequence.<\/i><p>Alan Dove:  <i>And as viruses go, these coronaviruses, because of the proofreading are actually more stable than a lot of other viruses.  Probably what the doctor is thinking of is that this is analogous to flu, where you do see antigenic drift and antigenic shift, and where yeah, you get different strains circulating all the time.  But there&#x27;s no evidence, as Rich said, that SARS-CoV-2 is doing any of that.<\/i><p>[1] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-590&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-590&#x2F;<\/a> at about 13 minutes in<p>[2] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-03-05&#x2F;chinese-scientists-say-second-coronavirus-strain-more-dangerous\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-03-05&#x2F;chinese-sci...<\/a><p>[3] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;response-to-on-the-origin-and-continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2&#x2F;418\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;response-to-on-the-origin-and-conti...<\/a><p>[4] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-592&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-592&#x2F;<\/a> at about 1 hour and 41 minutes in<p>[5] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-596&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-596&#x2F;<\/a> at about 39 minutes in"],"time":["2020-04-28 15:52:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SubiculumCode"],"id":[23003993],"kids":[23004461,23005210],"parent":[23003035],"text":["Off topic, I wish HN downvoting cost something, maybe a bit of karma.

Now, $20&#x2F;kg to LEO is very optimistic, but even at 5-10x that rate, a more believable $100-200&#x2F;kg, that would still make the launch possible for 200-400m, which is roughly the cost of a Delta Heavy launch.

And not from Cairo to Tel Aviv, but to Yasser Arafat International aka Gaza Airport (GZA).<p>The plane was a standard 737, but completely unmarked, sitting in a remote bus bay far from the terminal.  Load was abysmal, maybe 20 or so people.  Service was the usual surly Egyptair (aka &quot;Misery Air&quot;, <i>Misr<\/i> being the Arabic name for Egypt) experience, but it was a short flight of only an hour or so.<p>On arrival at GZA, we were driven over to the nearby Rafah border, herded into a holding area, instructed to identify and open our luggage, and then moved to a different room to be frisked and interrogated by Israeli security while another set of guards pawed through the bags, sight unseen.  All staff involved were very much not in a hurry, and all in all, it took about four hours (!) for the 20 of us to go from wheels on the ground to getting into the airport terminal, through Palestinian immigration and then Gaza proper.  And I didn&#x27;t even get a passport stamp.  (I did get one from the Erez border when crossing by land into Israel proper later, which raised some eyebrows later when leaving Israel...)<p>At the time, the airport served around 2 flights per day (Cairo and Amman, Jordan, IIRC), but the departures board optimistically listed a whole slew of fantasy flights from all over the Arab world and Europe (Milan! Istanbul!).  I remember seeing a school group on a tour through this airport and thinking that odds are very high that all these kids here will live their lives without ever leaving this 40x6 km slice of land (large chunks of which are off-limits buffer areas), packed with 2 million Palestinians living cheek to jowl.<p>Shortly thereafter in 2000, the al-Aqsa Intifada started and the airport was bombed by Israeli fighters.

It would still count. I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to see it since I&#x27;d probably not even bother to put on my eyewear just to see five seconds of sky.<p>I&#x27;m trying to work out my intended goals if I&#x27;m going to attempt such a thing.

But if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to combat, I&#x27;m not sure just &quot;looking at the sky first thing in the morning&quot; is going to help me accomplish reducing phone usage in bed. Because once I&#x27;ve looked at the sky for the morning, I&#x27;m free to do whatever, and there&#x27;s only one other thing I&#x27;m going to do first thing in the morning.<p>The same happened when I tried to follow a course on building self esteem. It consists of writing three positive experiences and three things you&#x27;re grateful for each morning. The author noted: if you&#x27;re skeptical at staying on track, try it for 30 days. You&#x27;d be surprised at yourself.<p>All that happened was that I did this for exactly the 30 days, stopped cold, and haven&#x27;t found the motivation to start again. Rereading what I wrote during that time on the occasion, I fail to see what I accomplished.<p>Same with a 30-day morning exercise routine. My thoughts: I&#x27;m no longer indebted to follow this person&#x27;s advice. I&#x27;ve tried it. I&#x27;ve forced myself through it. I don&#x27;t feel any different, except perpetually exhausted throughout the rest of the day. Now what?<p>I still want to do these things, because there&#x27;s clearly <i>some<\/i> benefit to be had if someone went out of their way to host an entire webpage for this concept, and stating that it &quot;sounds easy&quot; as opposed to &quot;it <i>is<\/i> easy&quot;. Exercise leads to better health. Writing some words supposedly leads to better mental health.<p>Yet it always feels compulsory, like someone on the Internet has the power to control my behavior against my will, and if I &quot;fail&quot; the &quot;challenge&quot; I&#x27;ll think less of myself for it. The only reason I&#x27;m doing this is because someone I don&#x27;t know suggested it, and the whole point is once you start, you <i>have<\/i> to follow through. So essentially, I feel like no matter what happens I&#x27;m roping myself into something I will not stick through to the end. Then I end up dreading every moment of it, eventually forgetting why I even bothered to try it in the first place amongst how forced and tiresome it is, and inevitably go back to my usual habits.<p>Ultimately it comes down to consciously not trying and staying the course in equilibrium, or trying, failing, and managing to convince myself I didn&#x27;t have it in me, or that I see no benefit. For something as simple as scribbling some notes in a journal.<p>I noticed that my desire to exercise disappeared entirely the moment I bought myself an exercise bike and put it two feet away from my desk at home.<p>I also tried sleeping for a week with my phone in a separate room. Cue not being able to fall asleep outright until 3-4 AM for the entire week. At least 12 AM with my phone on night mode was better for my health before.<p>I don&#x27;t get it. Maybe when next month comes around I&#x27;ll just have to try harder, as they say.

I have spent most of my adult lifetime working to make amends for this shameful period in my life.\nIn my teens, I dropped out of school, lived on the streets, ate out of dumpsters and raised money panhandling. I was desperate and afraid. I was taken in by skinhead gangs and white supremacist organizations. Over the course of a few years, I did many things as part of those groups that I am profoundly ashamed of and sorry about.\nEventually, I was able to get myself away from this world while serving in the United States Navy. This turned my life around. While serving my country, I worked with law enforcement agencies in hate group prosecutions and left this world behind.\nSince then, I have tried and failed to completely accept and come to terms with how I, a child of Jewish heritage, became part of such a hateful, racist group. One thing I have done, through therapy and outreach, I have learned to forgive that 15 year old boy who, despite the absence of ideological hate, was lured into a dark and evil world. For all of those I have hurt, and that this revelation will hurt, I’m sorry. No apology will undo what I have done.\nI have worked every day to be a responsible member of society.

On-line school is far from perfect.  There are two approaches I&#x27;ve seen:<p>1. The &quot;self-taught&quot; style.

Periodically, he sends out a take-home test; we work it and send him the answers.  This style is helped by the fact that our book is short and concise enough to teach but still be readable.  No one wants to read if a chapter takes hours.  This approach works great for me, but it requires a more self-directed student to function.<p>2. The &quot;micro-manager&quot; style.  This one is being done by my physics class: the prof uses online, checked homework, multiple zoom calls, requires us to record videos of ourselves solving problems in a &quot;tutorial style&quot;, gives on-line quizzes, and attempts to give the same tests on-line as were given in-person.  This results in horrible, invasive solutions that give a &quot;proctor&quot; remote access to one&#x27;s computer, require one to use a webcam to be monitored, and require one to show the space around him using a mirror.  This style is awful, wastes colossal amounts of time, but is the option on which teachers fall back when they lack confidence in their students to be self-directed.<p>Most teachers are going for option 2, which is worse than in-person learning.  This may sound cynical, but mot of the tools for &quot;active learning&quot; or &quot;on-line engagement&quot; make students&#x27; lives harder, waste their time, and offer no benefit beyond an administrator feeling as though he&#x27;s &quot;done something&quot;.<p>Edit: can any current student tell me if y&#x27;all are getting refunded for room and board, at least partially?
