This is an extradition hearing. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether Assange is guilty of the alleged crimes the US has come up with or not, what matters is whether he is expected to receive a fair trial in the US and whether the potential sentences in the US would be roughly on a par with what he&#x27;d expect for the same alleged crimes in the UK. For all I can see, this is definitely not the case.<p>You can even make a case that almost nobody should be extradited to the US by any country, since the US justice system has serious flaws, might not be just at all (e.g. it has about 10 times longer maximum prison sentences than in the rest of the civilized world) and the US penal system constitutes a constant human rights violation. For example, the administrations of many US prisons are notoriously unable to prevent the raping and murdering of their inmates. I&#x27;ve even heard people from the US making jokes about prison rape, as if that was to be expected and part of the &quot;justice&quot;. As another example, a prison in Illinois was under 23 years of permanent lockdown, meaning that all inmates were in isolation for 23 years. There are credible accounts that Assange is facing imprisonment in high-security isolation facilities similar to what they did to Manning for a long time. I cannot understand why any civilized person would allow a treatment as inhumane as in US maximum security prisons with isolation, regardless of the crime.<p>Generally speaking, countries should review their extradition treaties. US justice is non-proportionality based on revenge and involves frequent human rights abuses.

I don&#x27;t know how to do it using one of the existing Big Data formats, and developing my own format is hard.<p>My FPB file format is a FourCC format with several chunks. One chunk stores all N fingerprints, cache size aligned. These are ordered by popcount, so in principle some should be easily compressible - I haven&#x27;t tried, and can&#x27;t figure out how BLOSC is supposed to be used.<p>Another chunk stores the corresponding fingerprint identifiers, UTF-8&#x2F;non-fixed-length strings, in the same order (fingerprint[i] corresponds to id[i]).<p>A third chunk stores a multi-valued hash table so I can look up fingerprint(s) by name, instead of by index. The hash table is a variant of the djb&#x27;s &quot;cdb&quot; hash table. This is a 32-bit hash, which means for large data sets I get many collisions. (I designed it for &lt;100M entries. Some people now want to handle &gt;1B entries.)<p>I&#x27;m hoping to use an existing format rather than roll my own.

So instead of following Twain by encouraging his fellow citizens to buy land, he called on the state to tax it. On what grounds? Because much of land’s value comes not from what is built on the plot but from nature’s gift of water or minerals that might lie beneath its surface, or from the communally created value of its surroundings: nearby roads and railways; a thriving economy, a safe neighbourhood; good local schools and hospitals. And he argued that the tax receipts should be invested on behalf of all.<p>Determined to prove the merit of George’s proposal, Magie invented and in 1904 patented what she called the Landlord’s Game. Laid out on the board as a circuit (which was a novelty at the time), it was populated with streets and landmarks for sale. The key innovation of her game, however, lay in the two sets of rules that she wrote for playing it.<p>Under the ‘Prosperity’ set of rules, every player gained each time someone acquired a new property (designed to reflect George’s policy of taxing the value of land), and the game was won (by all!) when the player who had started out with the least money had doubled it. Under the ‘Monopolist’ set of rules, in contrast, players got ahead by acquiring properties and collecting rent from all those who were unfortunate enough to land there – and whoever managed to bankrupt the rest emerged as the sole winner (sound a little familiar?)&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-26 19:02:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chungy"],"id":[22425060],"kids":[22425112,22425250,22425242,22426331,22428351,22428827,22425452,22427120,22425896,22425232,22425147],"parent":[22424267],"text":["Monopoly teaches people a view of economics being a zero-sum game and too many people learn the wrong lessons from it.

His intent was to demonstrate how harmful monopolies could be to a free-enterprise system, and how antitrust laws work to curtail them in the real world.<p>&gt;The game was originally to be produced in 1973 as Bust the Trust, but the title was changed to Anti-Monopoly. It has seen multiple printings and revisions since 1973. In 1984, a new version appeared as Anti-Monopoly II; this version was updated and re-released in 2005 without the numerical designation. The game is currently still in print, and is produced and distributed worldwide by University Games.<p>&gt;Trademark lawsuit<p>&gt;See also: History of the board game Monopoly (Anti-Monopoly, Inc. vs. General Mills Fun Group)<p>&gt;In 1974, Parker Brothers sued Anspach over the use of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; name, claiming trademark infringement. While preparing his legal defense, Anspach became aware of Monopoly&#x27;s history prior to Charles Darrow&#x27;s sale of the game to Parker in 1935, and how it had evolved from Elizabeth Magie&#x27;s original Landlord&#x27;s Game into the version Darrow appropriated. Anspach based his defense on the grounds that the game itself existed in effectively the public domain before Parker purchased it, and therefore Parker&#x27;s trademark claim on it should be nullified.

It&#x27;s a parody of Microsoft that&#x27;s fun to play, a free board game based the rules of Anti-Monopoly, and a political statement protected under the First Amendment.<p>This web site exists to freely distribute the full set of graphics and rules for Micropoly, in the &quot;open source&quot; spirit of the original folk game monopoly invented by an Atlantic City Quaker woman.<p>You are encouraged to download the graphics, print out copies of the game set for yourself and friends, and have fun playing Micropoly!<p>The Goals of the Micropoly Project:<p>To make a political statement about the effect of Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly on the economy.<p>To raise awareness of the original folk game monopoly invented by Quakers and illegitimately patented and pirated by Parker Brothers.<p>To promote the alternative Anti-Monopoly rules, invented by Ralph Anspach in 1973, that teach why monopolies are bad.<p>To distribute the graphics and rules of Micropoly as a free &quot;open source&quot; game, true to the spirit of the Quaker who originally invented monopoly.<p>To develop a computerized version of monopoly, that can be customized with any local theme and artwork, and played over the Internet.<p>To imitate life imitating art imitating life imitating art, and so forth.<p>Micropoly synergistically illustrates several important points, by drawing parallels between the time of the Great Depression and the end of the Twentieth Century:<p>Monopolies are bad, and competition is good.<p>The original rules of monopoly require everyone to play as a monopolist. That&#x27;s why companies like Microsoft and Parker Brothers like the lesson it teaches: being a monopolist is good, and in order to win you have to make the biggest monopoly. But the rules of Anti-Monopoly divide players into monopolists versus competitors, resulting in a dynamic, unpredictable, more interesting game. Competition has the same benefits in real life!<p>The &quot;open source&quot; philosophy has been around a long time before computers.<p>The Atlantic City Quaker woman who invented the original board game spread it around to her friends for free. She would invite people over to play, and they loved the game, so they made their own copies with crayons on oil cloth. This free folk game spread around the country and was played by many people, long before Parker Brothers knowingly decided pirated it. Today we have computer networks, desktop publishing, color printers, and the &quot;open source&quot; model of software development, so it is much easier to spread the free Micropoly game all over the world.<p>Big companies abuse the patent and legal systems to pirate and exploit other peoples original ideas.<p>Parker Brothers pirated monopoly from its original inventors, illegitimately patented an &quot;open source&quot; folk game, perpetrated an extremely successful propaganda campaign to convince the world that Monopoly(TM) was invented by Charles B Darrow, and aggressively drove other companies out of business with frivolous lawsuits.<p>They waged a nasty 10 year legal assault on Ralph Anspach, inventor of the &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; game, ruining his successful game company, even though his case finally made it to the Supreme Court and won!<p>As a result of his hard fought victory, the true story of Parker Brother&#x27;s Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle has been published for all to read, and it&#x27;s safe to call a game &quot;anything-opoly&quot;.<p>We are very grateful that he never gave up, and won in spite of Parker Brothers&#x27; dirty tricks. We thank him, because he made it possible for us to publish Micropoly, and generously offered to let us use his superior Anti-Monopoly rules, which so perfectly illustrate the point of Micropoly.<p>The similarities in the monopolistic behaviors of Parker Brothers and Microsoft should be obvious.<p>Openopoly<p>The software used to produce Micropoly will be freely distributed, as well as the Micropoly content, to serve as an example of how to make your own personalized monopoly game.<p>We are developing a free &quot;Openopoly&quot; architecture based on XML, whose purpose is to automate the production of custom monopoly games, both printed board games and multi-player online computer games.<p>Micropoly will be the first example of such a custom game, so anyone will be able to drop in their own text and graphics, turn the crank, and produce a version of monopoly localized for their own city, university, company, church, sports team, or favorite political cause.<p>[...]"],"time":["2020-02-26 20:15:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dr_dshiv"],"id":[22425838],"kids":[22455272,22427694,22429150],"parent":[22424267],"text":["Wow, I guess that was a revelation and something worth appreciating: the idea that if we just take a little bit of everyone&#x27;s wealth and share it with the Commonwealth, then there can be a lot more wealth for all."],"time":["2020-02-26 19:39:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["planetzero"],"id":[22426962],"kids":{},"parent":[22424267],"text":["I wish more people would learn from it:  Monopolies are bad if it&#x27;s a private company or the government.<p>The outcome is still the same: a stalled industry, little to no innovation, and many times, high prices."],"time":["2020-02-26 21:28:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Jonahgay"],"id":[22425527],"kids":{},"parent":[22424267],"text":["In monopoly you&#x27;re forced to pay, in reality you have choice to who you want to pay."],"time":["2020-02-26 19:06:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["fag_tits"],"id":[22426574],"kids":{},"parent":[22424267],"text":["f<i><\/i>* off bernie"],"time":["2020-02-26 20:48:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["willart4food"],"id":[22425164],"kids":[22425392,22425358,22425207,22425190,22425219,22425199],"parent":[22424267],"text":["Someone needs to make a Socialism game.

It can&#x27;t be deferred to another milestone. i.e. we&#x27;ve made decisions that mean it can&#x27;t be deferred to the next phase. This is for things that we&#x27;ll need for the next phase or will become blockers but aren&#x27;t yet. It&#x27;s not for things where we have generally decided that Now Is The Time. There must be a specific reason it can&#x27;t be deferred. We use the milestone features to actually decide what&#x27;s in or out of a scope of work.<p>&quot;Blocks dependants&quot; is pretty high up and as such needs to be explicit about what it&#x27;s used for.

It&#x27;s hard for someone with authority to wedge something in here because they feel like it.<p>&quot;Release blocker&quot; is also pretty high up. This is where people get to jump up and down and explain why they think their bug is so important (and why it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t fit into &quot;do not defer&quot;). This is for stuff that means we can&#x27;t actually ship the release rather than things we&#x27;d just like to be in it. For example &quot;we can&#x27;t build the software until this is fixed&quot;. Hopefully reasonably rare stuff. You need to explain why this blocks a specific release rather than the release otherwise being enough better than the previous one to deliver value to users.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t go home&quot;. Sometimes things really are that bad and need to be fixed. At least the person assigning this knows what they&#x27;re asking, what the implications are and how bad it looks if everything always ends up in this bucket.<p>Severity works a bit differently.

They really are very subjective.<p>* Don&#x27;t care<p>* Embarrassing<p>* Minor peril<p>* Major shitstorm<p>* QA blockers<p>* Showstopper<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t care&quot; is the default.

This is often for things that end up as &quot;enhancements&quot; or &quot;tasks&quot; rather than &quot;defects&quot;.<p>&quot;Embarrassing&quot;. This is something that a user would notice and be left with an impression that we have less attention to detail than the best in the industry.<p>&quot;Minor peril&quot;. This is a bug that&#x27;s going to cause friction or trouble and give the user an uneasy sense or stop them from building confidence in the software.<p>&quot;Major shitstorm&quot;. I&#x27;m never profane in my software but someone suggested this and lots of people liked it and had a good idea of how it should be used. This is for stuff that causes problems when the feature is used. Stuff that leaves a persistent mess that needs to be cleaned up by hand or corrupts some state or something.<p>&quot;QA blockers&quot;. Without fixing these bugs then we&#x27;re unable to test our software properly. This means we might attract regressions and we probably shouldn&#x27;t be releasing stuff to users. For example, if you can&#x27;t save a record that contains the new features then you can&#x27;t test the corresponding load functionality.<p>&quot;Showstoppers&quot;. These are bugs that cause the whole software to break. Crash bugs, things that destroy user data, etc.<p>Most of our open bugs mostly sit at &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;, &quot;embarrassing&quot;, &quot;if time permits&quot;, &quot;next&quot; and occasionally &quot;do not defer&quot;. If stuff starts creeping up the ladder then we know we have a problem coming. If stuff starts to appear straight at the top of the ladder then we get those things fixed ASAPs: they don&#x27;t hang around as &quot;open&quot; for very long!<p>A lot of the &quot;higher&quot; values are things that help us deal with interactions. Problems on their own are often tractable. When things start affecting other things and causing knock-on effects then trouble occurs.

Or oxygenation. And once there, you may have tubes&#x2F;catheters&#x2F;wires in various orifices and puncturing vessels and organs.

I mean, imagine it -- maybe you wake up in the midst of this horrendous state of affairs, and you become understandably upset and confused, but if you move around or holler (if you can) you may well get further sedated.

Several filters meant to remove viruses, though I have a distiller so I would probably just use that if I was really that paranoid about my water, which I probably won&#x27;t be.<p>- My medicine cabinet has everything you can think of and more.  I have 2 first aid kits and a trauma kit.  I have what it takes to turn the entrance to my home into a decon chamber, if need be.  I have tons of bleach and disinfectants.<p>- I have full gas masks with filters, including adapters for 3M filters, which should be perfectly sufficient to remove droplets in the air.  I also have full tyvek suits in case there&#x27;s a worst case scenario but I have to leave my home.  I have lots of N95 masks, but obviously you can&#x27;t count on those for very much.  I certainly don&#x27;t have the belief that even the gas masks will prevent anything.  It&#x27;s just hedging my bets.<p>---<p>All that said, I am not paranoid.  I don&#x27;t even have anxiety over it.  Those things I mentioned would only come into play if things went extremely bad.  My life wouldn&#x27;t be very different if I had to stay indoors for months on end, so long as utilities continue to operate.  Even if the supply chain broke down, I would probably be better off staying indoors than trying to bug out to somewhere else.<p>One other thing I&#x27;m doing is trying to sell off a high value items I&#x27;ve been holding on to, but I&#x27;m selling them off now because the money could save me from strife if there&#x27;s widespread infection and my job totally falls apart."],"time":["2020-02-26 20:31:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cipan"],"id":[22429774],"kids":{},"parent":[22425593],"text":["I live in HK, so we&#x27;re already living through this.<p>I&#x27;ve basically been working remotely.

As the virus can spread through waste water systems, we flush out unpumped drains as well. When buying products, we only use e-payment to avoid loose change. Most places have gloves in addition to masks, and have hand sanitizer, so there&#x27;s no excuse to not use these things.<p>HK does not have a large supply buffer due to the small spaces.

That means that if it&#x27;s happening, all parties involved have a big incentive to keep it a secret. Also, it likely involves a lot of money as it is risky and there are only so many scientists willing to risk their careers.<p>Morals aside, the main technical challenge with human cloning is the high failure rate in terms of the numbers of less than perfect clones with defects that would have to be euthanized. But it&#x27;s not fundamentally harder or different from cloning sheep or pets. Of course high failure rates are also a challenge with IVF births. However, this seems to be far less controversial. Most non viable IVF embryos simply don&#x27;t make it to the womb (i.e. get discarded before implantation) or fail in a early stage. Some couples try for years before succeeding. I doubt it would be very different with cloning. Finding women willing to carry the child is another challenge. With IVF it&#x27;s typically (but not necessarily) the &#x27;natural&#x27; mother who gets her own eggs implanted back opting into this. With clones this might be less practical as the mothers might be a combination of too old&#x2F;dead&#x2F;unwilling so you&#x27;d need some woman to carry the child (probably in exchange for cash).<p>When it comes to animals, we simply care less about all this. Once the technical issues around this are addressed the remaining moral issues will have more to do with religious&#x2F;philosophical concerns than any practical concerns. The whole boys from Brazil thing is going to keep this controversial for a long time after most technical concerns are addressed no matter what.<p>Yet, there&#x27;s no shortage of wealthy hedonistic &#x2F; narcissistic types that are likely to want this no matter what.

SARS and MERS emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and caused a worldwide pandemic that claimed thousands of human lives, while SADS struck the swine industry in 2017. They have common characteristics, such as <i>they are all highly pathogenic to humans or livestock, their agents originated from bats, and two of them originated in China. Thus, it is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China. Therefore, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China.<\/i> The purpose of the review is to summarize the current knowledge on viral diversity, reservoir hosts, and the geographical distributions of bat coronaviruses in China, and eventually we aim to predict virus hotspots and their cross-species transmission potential.<p>Is this prescient or purely coincidental or something else?<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;1999-4915&#x2F;11&#x2F;3&#x2F;210&#x2F;htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;1999-4915&#x2F;11&#x2F;3&#x2F;210&#x2F;htm<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-26 20:30:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nexuist"],"id":[22423803],"kids":[22424218,22425686],"parent":[22423346],"text":["Should be noted that the numbers in the intro are a bit off, the U.S. now has 57 cases.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bnonews.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-latest-coronavirus-cases&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bnonews.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-latest-coronavirus...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-26 16:29:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hirenj"],"id":[22423929],"kids":[22424831,22426158,22424705],"parent":[22423346],"text":["Fun fact: Coronavirus also recognises sialic acids (but they need an extra acetylation on top).<p>Fun fact 2: Sialic acids are important for protecting your gut &#x2F; balancing the microbiome.<p>Fun fact 3: Bats apparently have a much simpler microbiome (less weight, better flying), and can tolerate low levels of coronavirus infection.<p>I would bet the closest non-flying relative of a bat would get respiratory infections too."],"time":["2020-02-26 16:40:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ptah"],"id":[22423872],"kids":[22423947,22425489,22424041],"parent":[22423346],"text":["i thought humans are just another animal. why the surprise about diseases jumping from other animals to humans"],"time":["2020-02-26 16:36:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwGuardian"],"id":[22424943],"kids":[22425560,22425262],"parent":[22423346],"text":["As with other attempts at sparking discussions on the origin [1], I&#x27;m not a virologist, just a bystander whose curiosity was piqued by the proximity of the sole lab in all of China that&#x27;s equipped to handle&#x2F;research extremely infectious viruses and that of the outbreak.<p>My observations (all facts)<p>1.

First, there&#x27;s the original song melody and harmonic structure. The notes of the improvisation need to reflect that base - the distance the improvisation extends from the melody&#x2F;harmony without breaking it is an emotional quality. And this is a moving target! That melody goes by FAST... bluegrass is often played at tempos exceeding 200bpm.<p>So on one level, I&#x27;m following the melody&#x2F;harmony.

On yet another level, I&#x27;m being purely technical - like making my hand slightly roll to play a downstroke on the E string followed by an upstroke on the B string without accidentally hitting the E string twice. On another level, I&#x27;m listening to the other musicians, with whom I&#x27;m generating a shared tempo, and who are also improvising, generating new ideas I can respond to while playing.<p>That&#x27;s expertise.

Heartening because it means a lot of behaviors that are billed as &quot;genius&quot; or &quot;high IQ&quot; or what have you, might just be an individual unconsciously drawing upon years, maybe even decades, of experience that is layered on top of each other. The most obvious example of this, for our community, are actually codebases. The more you work on it, the easier it becomes to debug and figure out issues, sometimes without even looking at the code. When I was first starting out as a junior software engineer, I was shocked at how quickly some of the seniors could figure out bugs. I was upset because I thought that they might just be smarter than me, from a raw intelligence perspective.<p>But now, some years later, I&#x27;ve become that person, at least in my current company. I can debug issues pretty quickly, and my brain has a store of literally thousands of bugs and snags that have come up over the years, to the point where if someone says, &quot;This feature isn&#x27;t returning the right variables&quot;, I can usually point them to the fix without even looking up from my laptop. It sounds like magic, but really it&#x27;s just localized expertise.<p>That&#x27;s the heartening part--that all it takes is years to do it. The expertise is available to everyone, perhaps.<p>The disheartening part is the other side of the coin--what if you&#x27;ve started late? Does this mean that software engineers who start late, in their 40&#x27;s or 50&#x27;s, for example, might never reach the heights of software engineers who started early? That isn&#x27;t true--there are examples to the contrary, I hope--but maybe they have a much steeper hill to climb.

It doesn&#x27;t need to be connected to 26 dimensions [2] or 10 dimensions [3][4], but we know that [1][2][3][4] are deeply connected already, and so if it relates to any of them, it must relate to all of them.<p>We should be careful about the degree to which we get &quot;lost in math&quot;, I suppose, but only in that we need to avoid <i>wrong-way reductions<\/i> [5].

When the game is first being played, most strategies haven&#x27;t been discovered. At this stage strategic play consists of (without loss of generality) player A using a strategy they think is effective, player B devising and using a strategy that will be effective against the strategy used by player A, Player A adapting in response, and so on. This is strategic play, but it isn&#x27;t a meta-game. The meta-game arrises when players A and B are both experienced enough at the game that they can debate which strategy is the objective best. The meta then becomes the agreed upon dominant strategy (or set of strategies). In the base game (i.e before the meta develops) strategies exist mostly independent of each other, while the meta-game consists of fitting strategies into a framework.<p>The meta can change because of external or internal forces. An external force is a change to the base game, which is common to e-sports, and less common in actual sports. In e-sports, most games will tweak how the game is played (change the cooldown of abilities, change the size of a characters health pool, etc) every month or so. This will change which strategies are best, and therefore change the meta.<p>Internal changes arise from the changing skill level of players. As players get better at the game, hard to execute strategies will become more viable, while easy to execute strategies will remain at about the same level of viability.<p>This article shows a great example of what the pro Overwatch meta (the game I&#x27;m most familiar with) looks like and how it evolves, and it&#x27;s (mostly) accessible to non-Overwatch players: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;overwatchleague.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;23053244&#x2F;the-meta-report-stage-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;overwatchleague.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;23053244&#x2F;the-meta-rep...<\/a> (WARNING: autoplay video)."],"time":["2020-02-25 20:12:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Aardwolf"],"id":[22414281],"kids":[22415677],"parent":[22413376],"text":["&gt; Judo — the sport that I am most familiar with — has a metagame that is shaped by rule changes from the International Judo Federation.

I opted to study other areas, partially motivated by a fear I wouldn&#x27;t do well and would hurt my GPA (my god was I vain, I feel I could do so much more studying full-time with my current world-view).<p>As time has gone on, and ML and quantum computing have simply blown up since I graduated in 2014, I quickly realized the magnitude of my mistake.

After reading Why We Sleep I think I got some explanation what happened to me, but at least for my case it seems it wasn&#x27;t really on the money. I _was_ able to make the switch from night owl to an early bird myself so it&#x27;s certainly possible, though requires some effort and dedication.<p>I naturally woke up at 10 am and didn&#x27;t really like mornings, and my most productive periods were definitely 1-2am. Thats when the most exciting coding solutions seemed to come to me.<p>Then I started going to early martial arts training. Since I wanted to go before work, I had to wake up at 7:30. For about 8-9 months it was quite unpleasant, though the training sessions themselves were fun enough for me to want to continue.<p>But then something strange happened. I vividly remember the day I &quot;switched&quot;. It was spring time and we just started getting our training sessions outside. It was intense enough that the guys decided to go shirtless and take in the morning sun. And at that exact moment, basking in the sun at 8am, during a demanding physical exercise I thought to myself - wow! this is so exciting, fun and natural. It felt a bit like a Chinese kung-fu movie. A very energising experience.<p>And from that exact day I start feeling sleepy at 11pm and wake up at 7:30 consistently each day and would feel awesome in the mornings.<p>This is I know very anecdotal, but at least I know it&#x27;s possible. And the recipe seemed to be lots and lots of sun, outdoor activity and a very positive emotional feedback. This I think might be the biggest reason. Currently the most positive feedback we usually encounter is in the evening - late night YouTube &#x2F; tv &#x2F; internet &#x2F; books &#x2F; friends &#x2F; family, ... even intercourse. Quite a lot of the stuff we look forward to happens in the evening. It makes sense that our bodies adapt to make us most alert when it senses we get the most bang for the buck. But if you reverse that and attempt to do the stuff you really like early, your body might adopt, albeit slowly."],"time":["2020-02-25 17:12:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["1e-9"],"id":[22414437],"kids":{},"parent":[22413676],"text":["It seems that sleep pattern variation is an evolutionary consequence of the survival benefit of having someone awake when others are sleeping [1].
