You could have Homer with translation and marginal notes on vocabulary and grammar, so that if that single book happened to be dug up in 2,000 years or so the people of the day would be able to read Homer, or better yet, we could disseminate the text as widely as possible to give it the best possible chance of survival.<\/i><p><i>What we should do, I said, is have legislation so that every book published was obliged to have, say, a page of Sophocles or Homer in the original with appropriate marginalia bound into the binding, so that even if you bought an airport novel if your plane crashed you would have something to reread on the desert island.

I had seen him around Apple before, and I knew who he was and what he was known for, but I didn&#x27;t actually meet him until I joined the Newton team. I found him friendly, modest, smart, shrewd, compassionate, full of interesting knowledge and ideas, and interested in other people and their ideas.<p>I got to know him better when John Sculley ordered him to have the Newton team ditch its Lisp OS and write one in C++. Larry approached me and a couple of other Lisp hackers and asked us to make a fresh start with Lisp and see what we could do on Newton. We wrote an experimental OS that Matt Maclaurin named &quot;bauhaus&quot;.<p>Larry had a sabbatical coming up right about then. He took it with us. He crammed into a conference room with three or four of us and hacked Lisp code for six weeks. He was a solid Lisp hacker. He stayed up late with us and wrote AI infrastructure for the experimental OS, then handed it off to me when he had to, as he put it, &quot;put his executive hat back on.&quot; He hung around with us brainstorming and arguing about ideas. He had us out to his house for dinner.<p>A little later, when things were hectic and pressure was high on Newton, one of our colleagues killed himself. Larry roamed the halls stopping to talk to people about how they were doing. I was at my desk when he came by, next to another colleague that I considered a friend. Larry stopped by to check on us. My friend had also been a good friend of the fellow who had died, and he lost his composure. Larry grabbed a chair, pulled it up close and sat with him, an arm around him, patting him gently while his grief ran its course.<p>After Newton was released, Larry moved on to other projects. I worked on the shipped product for a while, but I was pretty burned out. Steve Jobs persuaded me to go to work for NeXT for a little while.<p>Steve is infamous for being, let&#x27;s say, not as pleasant as Larry. In fact, he sat in my office once trashing Larry for about half an hour, for no good reason, as far as I can see. I politely disagreed with a number of his points. Larry made important contributions to the development of personal computing, and he didn&#x27;t have to be a jerk to do it.<p>Larry was extremely smart, but I never knew him to play I&#x27;m-smarter-than-you games. I saw him encourage other people to pursue, develop, and share their ideas. I found him eager to learn new things, and more interested in what good we could do than in who got the credit for it.<p>We weren&#x27;t close friends, except maybe when we were crammed in a conference room together for six weeks. I didn&#x27;t see him much after Newton, though we exchanged the occasional friendly email over the years.<p>I was just thinking lately that it was about time to say hello to him again.

There were many great people that were part of this group, including Larry Tesler and Don Norman.

(At that time he was thinking of computer tools as something like typewriters and in no way related to &quot;real book printing&quot;, until he saw the result of a &quot;real&quot; digital typesetter in 1977, which inspired him to write TeX.) In 2012 when he learned of this manual he wrote in TUGboat strongly recommending it to others: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tug.org&#x2F;TUGboat&#x2F;tb33-3&#x2F;tb105knut.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tug.org&#x2F;TUGboat&#x2F;tb33-3&#x2F;tb105knut.pdf<\/a><p>- Another of its users was Brian Reid, who went on to develop Scribe, which itself was influential in two ways: (1) It was a strong influence on Leslie Lamport&#x27;s LaTeX (in fact LaTeX can be viewed as bringing Scribe syntax&#x2F;ideas to TeX), and (2) It seems to have been influential in the development of markup languages in general, e.g. from GML to SGML (this part I&#x27;m not sure of and there are conflicting accounts), which eventually led to HTML and XML.

Everyone should also read the Wikipedia article about Bert.<p>Bert&#x27;s PhD thesis is most often characterized by its title &quot;Online Graphical Specification Of Procedures&quot;, but once you look at it you realize that he was one of the first (if not the first) inventor of &quot;dataflow&quot; programs, and in fact this thesis was central to the many &quot;prior art&quot; definitions to quash lawsuits about dataflow ideas.<p>Another dimension to Bert&#x27;s scientific and engineering career that is not mentioned enough is that he was one of the earliest and main drivers of what is called CAD today (a rather small number of people in different places made this happen in the early 60s -- including Bert&#x27;s brother Ivan -- and Bert focused some of the powerful human and computing resources of Lincoln Labs on this vital technology).<p>Bert&#x27;s personality was sunny, friendly, and &quot;sweetly firm&quot;, to the point that many people clamored to have him as their manager (including only half-jokingly: Ivan). I was completely thrilled when Parc brought in Bert to run the Systems Science Lab in which my group, Lynn Conway&#x27;s group, Bill English&#x27;s group etc were all ensconced.<p>Bert, as with the other enlightened ARPA research managers knew that &quot;the geese wanted to lay their golden eggs&quot; and the manager&#x27;s job was to support these efforts, not to try to tell the geese how to lay the special eggs). He was superb at this, and many critical inventions and systems happened because he was the nurturer.<p>I guess I should tell a &quot;Bert and Ivan&quot; story. Their father was a civil engineer who brought not just blueprints home but gadgets and kits for the two brothers -- who were just two years apart in age -- to play with. Bert would recall that Ivan was so smart that he would just start putting the stuff together while Bert read the manual. At the 95% point Ivan would get stuck and Bert would know what to do next. The two brothers with very different personalities got along wonderfully well over their entire lives, and would occasionally do a company together.<p>A big deal when the kids were young was their mother driving them down from Scarsdale to Murray Hill to Bell Labs to meet Claude Shannon. Years later at MIT, Shannon wound up being a thesis supervisor of both of their PhDs done a few years apart.<p>I think most of us from 50+ years ago in the ARPA community just revered and were in awe of the research generations that came before us, especially the one right before us. It was tough to do computing back then, but they didn&#x27;t let this bother them at all. They would program anything they wanted to have happen -- mostly in machine code -- and they would design and build any hardware they needed to run the programs they needed -- mostly with discrete components and relatively high voltages over sometimes acres of computer.<p>They showed us how to work and play and design and sculpt and the deep art that lies behind the components. We can never thank them enough, and can only &quot;pay forward&quot; by helping those who come after us."],"time":["2020-02-20 09:42:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[22370673],"kids":[22371587,22372224,22371048],"parent":[22370667],"text":["A 1966 demo of his pioneering Ph.D. work on interactive visual programming: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NLyIYmPfCps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NLyIYmPfCps<\/a>.<p>His Ph.D. dissertation is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;13474\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;13474<\/a>.

In the end we had a function that could be used to rename or delete a column even without switching off foreign key checking but it was not simple and it was not the first iteration of said function and earlier iterations caused lots of subtle problems, like a column having a default value or not depending on whether the database was a new database or was created using schema updates.<p>Use at your own peril."],"time":["2020-02-19 18:53:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sriku"],"id":[22373214],"kids":[22375599,22380849],"parent":[22367104],"text":["While on SQLite, Hipp&#x27;s fossil-scm is also another great piece of work.

I am also thankful for those client applications like &quot;DB Browser for SQLite&quot; [1]. It nearly provides the same functionality like SQL Management Studio, which is quite an achievement.<p>The only gripe I have with SQLite is with full text search FTS5. The last time I tried to store and retrieve text with associated metadata from another table was really confusing. It kinda worked in the end, but then I also realized that you can&#x27;t do a contains-query on your text, just starts-with and ends-with [2]. This is a major flaw in my book. So many times I just want to dump tons of text into a table and want to query single words naturally, but I can&#x27;t do that without resorting to hacks or unoptimized LIKE queries.

I&#x27;m not even sure how to fix that, unless I want to add a spinner and Ajax call on page load. (Right now I pass the initial state as JSON in the rendered HTML.) Maybe I could use local storage, but then somehow when you click Back I have to decide whether to trust local storage or make an Ajax call. . . .<p>Anyway, rather than complaining about the article, I&#x27;d be more interested in a conversation about how to build webapps with a keyboard focus, so that you can complete entire tasks without touching the mouse. What native browser features would you leverage? What frontend tech would help you? Can you imagine &quot;standard&quot; patterns you could encode in a JS lib, both for DRY code and for a more predictable UI? A &quot;Bootstrap for keyboard-first webapps&quot; would be really cool.

Try integrating old POS with 10 payment network working under milliseconds to authorise transactions. Worked enough since 1990 with dos based POS and also wrote IBM MQ C++ code for integration. Don’t want to go back there.<p>I think today is a step forward. Like always there will be good and bad as it was in 1980 or 1990. But largely today we do much more with computers than we ever did in those days.<p>So not everything is perceptually slow on computers. Apple Watch, iphone, androids are responsive and usually fast. Windows 10 for certain tasks might be slow but then overall it’s not that bad either.<p>As far as exploration goes you can do the same or even more today than before. I can discover planets. Built3D model in physical form, use CNC on desktop, do laser cutting in my home.<p>Built a computer like BBC micro, raspberry pi, fly a computer using fly by wire and test it using real physical model plane. Can do farming on a small scale using hydroponics at home. Can just go on and on about it. All possible thanks to advancement in speed and reduction of size in computing devices and peripherals.<p>So I feel it’s not slow, just the work we do with old computers is very different from what we do with modern one’s."],"time":["2020-02-19 18:10:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ThaJay"],"id":[22367478],"kids":{},"parent":[22365795],"text":["Google maps is actually bloody good at just being a map.

This is not a problem with the web app you are using, but with the fact that you are using a web app, which is a client running within your browser, itself a native client.<p>Simply returning to native desktop clients for productivity software would be a huge step in the right direction. There are economic incentives <i>not<\/i> to accommodate this user need, however. Developers need to offer cloud-based, app-based access to their services in order to remain competitive. For many companies, it is built into their SaaS business model! If you develop a productivity application professionally, you would need to believe that the existence of the native client (and all of the resources and man hours it consumes) will give you a meaningful competitive edge. The benefits to users are obvious to developers who have time to reflect on it, and to the users running a POS system, but not to the people several levels above the POS operator who are making decisions. For them, a cloud system that centralizes access, control, and supervision works better for <i>them<\/i>.<p>I had a job recently where I had to do data entry for a lot of invoices into a intranet cloud system. The system was slow; fields had bugs that literally caused the text to be entered backwards for some reason (seriously)... and it sucked for me. But for our business partner who was a majority owner of our main asset, it affords them control, centralization, and remote administration.<p>I actually agree with the OP aesthetically, but it dwells on the POS operator and forgets the hidden user-- POS operator&#x27;s managers and business ownership.<p>I will also say that to those of you who feel anti-javascript--an SPA is <i>much<\/i> better at managing stateful applications than dynamically pages generated by the server, and I&#x27;d much prefer to minimize chat between client and server where possible, which SPA frameworks do afford.<p>I think the whole thing could be improved by better support for native-style applications in the browser, possibly running in some &quot;native mode&quot;.<p>The last thing all say is that windows are nice for multitasking, but they do represent a significant cognitive load to manage, and you can&#x27;t usually do it from muscle memory. I remember teaching my grandparents to use AOL in around ~2000, and I literally had to make exercises for them to try to establish &quot;object permanence&quot; with windows that were hidden. The interface appeared flat to them, and they didn&#x27;t intuitively grasp that another window jutting out behind another was a part of a separate interface altogether. They got it eventually, but it is the type of thing that is easy to forget when we live our lives enmeshed in window based operating systems. But look at phones--they don&#x27;t have window-like functionality even after all this time, with bigger and better screens, multi-core processors, etc. Why? Because we still consider a phone to be a &quot;device&quot;. It&#x27;s capable of multitasking, but we subdue that aspect of the interface in favor of focus and usability. Terminal applications are similar in that respect, and I think that&#x27;s why people find them attractive in some contexts.<p>To anyone who feels strongly about this, I&#x27;d say: Develop a beautiful productivity app for native desktop usage. Market it. Make people fall in love with it. A deluge of such apps may promote a reversal of this trend."],"time":["2020-02-19 18:12:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cathames"],"id":[22368378],"kids":{},"parent":[22365795],"text":["thanks for writing what I&#x27;ve been thinking for so long"],"time":["2020-02-19 19:22:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimhefferon"],"id":[22366373],"kids":[22367228],"parent":[22365795],"text":["TeX is faster."],"time":["2020-02-19 16:36:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["B008L355"],"id":[22366852],"kids":{},"parent":[22365795],"text":["Caffeine be messing with your head boy"],"time":["2020-02-19 17:16:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tracerbulletx"],"id":[22366859],"kids":{},"parent":[22365795],"text":["rofl. no its not."],"time":["2020-02-19 17:17:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dr-detroit"],"id":[22366763],"kids":{},"parent":[22365795],"text":["This is the typical CS undergrad way of looking at the world.

Find more recognizable logos to use, or don&#x27;t use them. The whole purpose of authority logos is to leach off the goodwill people might have to brands they know and love. If they can&#x27;t recognize the authority logos, that defeats the point of having them.<p>2- I&#x27;d change from &quot;TV Famous Insurers&quot; to &quot;Geiko&quot; or whatever specific one you are talking about (lemonade uses specific names on their landing pages for a real good reason)<p>3- Clarify the meaning of &quot;Free Insurance&quot; - I&#x27;d use the Get 1 Month Give 1 Month of FREE Insurance&quot; or simply &quot;One Month of Free Insurance&quot;. I&#x27;d then make the text under the headline much clearer. Why you do something isn&#x27;t as important as what the end user gets, avoid getting bogged down in too many details.<p>4- Testimonials need to look more like testimonials. Use pictures or something that shouts &#x27;this is a testimonial&#x27;. The colored boxes look cool, but I believe design should always follow function.<p>5- I&#x27;d avoid mentioning the packages on the lander&#x2F;home. Just mention the highlights &quot;From as Little as $5 for insurance of up to $500,000&quot;.

First and foremost, while 3-6-9 months are great when you are going from zero knowledge, the challenge is that isn&#x27;t enough time to really be a junior developer unless you have prior experience. So you will need to continue to augment your education after graduation to ensure that you get a well paying job.<p>Most people attending bootcamps are doing so after college and later in life, which means even though some bootcamps are cheaper than attending a semester or a full year of college they are still quite expensive because the students are not &quot;students&quot; in that they are usually adults and need to figure out how to pay for school, attend classes, while effectively receiving zero income.<p>And applying for loans is much more complex because this isn&#x27;t the same as taking out student debt for college.<p>The second issue is that all of these bootcamps say that they are for beginners with zero knowledge, but looking over their curriculums that simply isn&#x27;t the case. Software engineering has gotten much more complex over the past decade. When I first started fumbling around with it myself I could just write some PHP or Perl code, and get up and running quickly. Today you need to know about github, javascript libraries, frameworks, and the typical &quot;Hello World&quot; application isn&#x27;t a direct route.<p>Most of these schools don&#x27;t realize that their first students are already exposed to these concepts, but later students aren&#x27;t so they don&#x27;t really adjust their curriculum.<p>With lambda in particular it also is a bit confusing because the school is online. Which should mean that you are able to provide the service for a lower cost, but they are charging the same amount as in person physically attended schools.<p>There are a lot of deceptive practices in the industry, lambda isn&#x27;t alone, such as taking recent grads and giving them low paying jobs as TA (teacher assistants) so that they can provide help to students at a lower cost while also allowing the school to claim that they have higher placement.<p>The curriculums are really dependent on a per school basis, but I have seen a bunch of stuff that simply doesn&#x27;t make sense and makes it more challenging for students.<p>One school had students do a group project, which wouldn&#x27;t count as part of their final for the first &quot;mod&quot; of the school. However they continued to teach things that you need for the final which would be a personal project. If you got assigned to a bad team you would be working much slower and not able to keep up and then your final which has nothing to do with a group determines whether you proceed or repeat the course (they charge you to repeat). Also it&#x27;s important to note that 50% of the students didn&#x27;t pass the first mod, which means you have a 50% chance of being on a slow team that would hamper your learning. Their advice was that it is important to learn to pair, and I agree, but when you get to your first job you are pairing with people that have experience, not where your partner has a 50% chance of failing out.<p>I firmly believe that bootcamps and providing secondary education choices are essential and if done correctly can really begin to combat the monopoly that colleges hold over education, but it&#x27;s a challenging mission.<p>With education there are student loans that you can take out and I think that is essential to get this going in the US because it is simply impossible for most people to not have any income and still pay for schooling for even 6 months, much less a longer period of time.<p>The other challenge is that you really need to have 3 terms. Beginner, intermediate, advanced. Each student can then apply based on skill set to determine where they place and students can move from one to the next, with each section being 4-5 months. If you did 15 months of education you would be much better off than what the school provides. It&#x27;s great to get from zero to one in terms of knowledge, but students are still left far from having skills that are immediately beneficial to employers.<p>There&#x27;s definitely more work that needs to be done.<p>As for Lambda itself, when you look at how other coding bootcamps have fared financially it doesn&#x27;t paint a rosy picture. It&#x27;s a challenging space to operate and the VC style returns simply aren&#x27;t there. If you want to offer an online only education that is fantastic but you have places like codecademy that do that and also do not charge you $30k for the privilege of basically accessing information that is online for free.<p>The challenge with coding is that it really is much easier to get going when you have someone you can ask questions from, so helping to improve that aspect of it while providing it online at a low cost is really the challenge."],"time":["2020-02-19 20:00:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kostyal"],"id":[22371115],"kids":[22371471,22372697,22371920,22373301,22372193],"parent":[22366474],"text":["I&#x27;m a current student at Lambda School.

I&#x27;ve been a fan of the idea of up-skilling at a bootcamp for those who either don&#x27;t want to spend 4 years getting a CS degree or being unable to finance its associated costs which can be in excess of $75,000. In an increasingly tight labor market, there&#x27;s fewer jobs available in the &#x27;middle&#x27; where companies seem to be either wanting an experienced SME in a specific domain or less-experienced programmers to do testing rather than development.<p>I think the bundling and selling of student CDOs works for a company in its early stages, since the costs for recovering unpaid tuition can range from high to being declared a total loss.

I found the docs much more edifying:<p>&gt; Materialize lets you ask questions about your data, and then get the answers in real time.<p>&gt; Why not just use your database’s built-in functionality to perform these same computations? Because your database often acts as if it’s never been asked that question before, which means it can take a long time to come up with an answer, each and every time you pose the query.<p>&gt; Materialize instead keeps the results of the queries and incrementally updates them as new data comes in. So, rather than recalculating the answer each time it’s asked, Materialize continually updates the answer and gives you the answer’s current state from memory.<p>&gt; Importantly, Materialize supports incrementally updating a much broader set of views than is common in traditional databases (e.g. views over multi-way joins with complex aggregations), and can do incremental updates in the presence of arbitrary inserts, updates, and deletes in the input streams.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;materialize.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;materialize.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-18 22:16:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["slap_shot"],"id":[22360461],"kids":[22360874,22361110,22364601,22360674,22360826],"parent":[22359769],"text":["&gt; We believe that streaming architectures are the only ones that can produce this ideal data infrastructure.<p>I just want to say this is a very dangerous assumption to make.<p>I run a company that helps our customers consolidate and transform data from virtually anywhere in their data warehouses.

Refreshing the data every five minutes in batches was more than sufficient.<p>Secondly, almost all data is useless in its raw form. The analysts had to perform ELT jobs on their data in the warehouse to clean, dedupe, aggregate, and project their business rules on that data. These functions often require the database to scan over historical data to produce the new materializations of that data. So even if we could get the data in the warehouse in sub-minute latency, the jobs to transform that data ran every 5 minutes.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t discount the need of telemetry and _some_ data to be actionable in a smaller time frame, I&#x27;m just weary of a data warehouse fulfilling that obligation.<p>In any event, I do think this direction is the future (an overwhelming amount of data sources allow change data capture almost immediately after an event occurs), I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s only architecture that can satisfy most analysts&#x27;&#x2F;data scientists&#x27; needs today.<p>I would love to hear the use cases that your customers have that made Materialize a good fit!"],"time":["2020-02-18 22:13:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrisjc"],"id":[22360419],"kids":[22360694,22360649],"parent":[22359769],"text":["Would it be fair to say this is a more OLAP-oriented approach to what KSqlDB (not KSql, but <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ksqldb.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ksqldb.io&#x2F;<\/a>) does?<p>Seems that it&#x27;s perhaps lacking the richness of how ksqldb uses Kafka Connectors (sinks and sources), but I don&#x27;t see any reason you couldn&#x27;t use Materialize in conjunction with ksqldb.<p>Eg:<p>KC-source --&gt; ksql --&gt; materialize --&gt; kafka --&gt; KC-sink<p>Question to Materialize...<p>What connectors (sinks and sources) do you have or plan to develop?

Now look at the horrible workarounds you need to apply to make old code compatible with newer versions as demands changed over the years tk focus more on user privacy and battery life.<p>For nearly every problem encountered here there&#x27;s a standard people just ignore. You can implement structured logging at OS level, like Windows does, and see random binary data drops and text files appear all over your logging interface and your file system. Linux config should follow the XDG standard so that configuration for applications can be structured into directories except half the programs don&#x27;t do that. Windows provides an API for this stuff (the registry) and it&#x27;s near impossible to configure an application using the registry. The registry is also combined with random config files all over the system, of course, to make it extra difficult to modify a program&#x27;s behaviour.<p>Most nice modern features are also missing because operating systems are still being made in C, not C++. The OS doesn&#x27;t have a concept of objects so yes your socket function will have to fall back to calling select(). A lot of these abstractions for basic communications have been solved on Linux using DBUS, which provides a somewhat standardised interface for many OS daemon and GUI features, all not being used because programmers forget that it exists or because programmers want to use their own solution instead.<p>On Windows there&#x27;s COM to try and help with that and well, see where that ended up: a versioned mess of pointers and factories to try to make it easier for everyone, where functionality sometimes completely breaks or needs to be emulated because it turned out the high level concept had a design flaw and now programs won&#x27;t work if you fix it.<p>I&#x27;ve done some thought experiments about structuring an OS and a file system to store data consistently and easily parsable, with modern bindings for most concepts. In the end I&#x27;ve had to conclude that the only way to keep the system working like intended would be to either convince everyone to do exactly as I say or to only allow me to write software for such a system. Whatever structure I can think off will inevitably be too constrained for someone else and the middleware abstraction problem starts all over again.<p>My only conclusion is that I want the OS to be as simple as possible with people following common standards when they write applications, such as using YAML&#x2F;ini&#x2F;XML configuration with Syslogd logging and XDG directory structures for user data, with the technical abstractions left at the library level.

You still have to figure out <i>what those exceptions or errors mean<\/i>, and there isn&#x27;t necessarily a <i>standardized format for those errors<\/i>. As a developer I&#x27;ve been recently been working on writing a Python api. As someone who has little experience with the intimate details of the Python language, I do not always know of the exceptions that exist that I am able to throw, I do not always know of which exceptions would be most appropriate. The same problem exists (obscure error values), but in a different form. There are existing libraries that I rely on that implement more exceptions, sometimes these aren&#x27;t documented, and even with the venerable Requests library, I have still had to crack open the objects that exist to find easier methods of passing data that the Requests library <i>has<\/i>, and <i>uses<\/i>, but does not <i>document<\/i> for external use.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the windows hive database. That&#x27;s a database of keys for values in the operating system. As a random developer, would you be able to open it and figure out what it does? I wouldn&#x27;t. As a windows power user I often relyied on articles from howtogeek without really fully understanding what the keys were doing (Although because of my experience an a systems developer, I could guess, but only <i>after the fact<\/i>). Again, the same problem (&quot;I know what I want to do, but I do not know how to do it&quot;) is exposed in a different form, and the methods and practices of the Microsoft organization make that difficult hard to reach. Yet again, the same problems are there, but in a different form.<p>I do agree that the shell should handle program arguments, a program could expose keys and values and a shell could read that and tell the user about it.

Opening a file is obtaining a handle, which represents both the file and the driver&#x2F;type behind it.<p>The file handle has some functions associated with it; write, read, flush, close. You can pass the handle to other processes, either cloned (RO or RW) or as ownership (loosing access to it entirely).<p>A printer has a different handle and different functions.<p>Programs can be the source of handles, so you can write a program that wraps a file behind a different set of primitives. Or that wraps the raw printer network socket and allows passing a PDF file handle into a function to print the PDF.<p>And if the printer goes away, the printer wrapper is notified that it&#x27;s gone away, so it can queue up any prints. Or exit and notify everyone owning a PDF printer handle that the handle is now invalid.<p>Device files like on Linux wouldn&#x27;t exist, you only need handles to operate on devices and you abstract over those, if you need it, you can abstract the filetree handle to provide a simulation of the &#x2F;dev&#x2F;lp0 file in it.<p>The filesystem would be a database, split into various tables (&quot;default-configuration&quot;, &quot;system-configuration&quot;, &quot;user-configuration&quot;, &quot;user-homes&quot;, &quot;executables&quot;, etc.) with some tables merged into a view (&quot;configuration&quot;), so you can completely forget about where a config file is. Files themselves can either be formatted as a table themselves (key-value, json&#x2F;nested data, etc.) or used as text or binary files. Of course a program can choose to use the FS transactionally, including SERIALIZABLE for your backup programs, that need a very consistent view of the FS.<p>Every interface would be malleable, a program with higher privilege can override it and change it for programs of lower privilege. Chroot becomes as simple as prepending the chroot path onto access to the filesystem functions. Going down the scheduler itself being runtime modifiable so a user can swap to a different scheduler at runtime or define a scheduler for a specific subset of programs.<p>If everything can be used, manipulated and introspected freely, then the programmer will have to do minimal work. Why use JSON configs when there is a perfectly good database system shipped with the OS? Why bother with logging when there is an interface for the system logger that supports structured logging and can ship logs to anywhere you want in any format at any detail level?<p>Sadly, some of these ideas aren&#x27;t very efficient or hard to implement.

For example, we now commonly package things up as docker containers with immutable&#x2F;ephemeral file systems. For better or for worse, that&#x27;s how a lot of server-side stuff gets deployed.<p>The whole point of that is simply emulating what the program is expecting to such an extent that it can run as if it was running on a normal file system. Often that means working around many broken assumptions. For example it might expect some configuration in a particular place in the filesystem. However, since the filesystem is immutable, you can&#x27;t really modify that after you build the docker container. So you work around it by e.g. using dockerize to template the config file and then inject the actual configuration from the environment variables on the docker command line. Likewise, applications produce logs but writing those to an ephemeral file system is kind of pointless; so you instead write to stderr&#x2F;stdout and leave it to the host OS, Docker, Kubernetes, or whatever is running your container.<p>These workarounds are something to avoid if you are writing new software. When you ship as a Docker container, you don&#x27;t care about the host OS. It might be Linux, BSD, Mac, Windows, or whatever else is capable of running docker containers these days. Chances are that the host OS itself is also running in some VM if you are shipping to a cloud environment. The nice thing with Docker is that you (mostly) don&#x27;t have to care about any of that.<p>With WASM this is extending to other places. People are running edge computing functions in WASM form, running WASM programs in a browser, or even in operating system kernels. Most of those places don&#x27;t necessarily even have filesystems, environment variables, or log files that you can access (or should access).<p>IMHO modern development requires a bit of upfront thinking on how to configure things, where to send logs, and where to store data. Rarely is the answer for any of those things a file on an (ephemeral) disk. Logs need to be aggregated so they can be analyzed. Local storage is not always available&#x2F;reliable. Configuration gets injected rather than loaded from a file. Files&#x2F;state gets written to some specialized service (a networked file bucket, some DB, a queue, REST service, etc.). Most of those things are accessed via networking rather than a file system.<p>This is also true of most frontend development these days. A browser application does not have a filesystem; it has no access to environment variables; and while it has a console, it&#x27;s considered bad form to actually log to it in production apps. Instead browser apps write to remote services (including logging and analytics data) and get their configuration from things like cookies, in browser databases, and remotely stored user preferences.<p>Come to think of it, most modern development is kind of detached from the operating system these days."],"time":["2020-02-19 09:54:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tonymet"],"id":[22363387],"kids":[22363628],"parent":[22357184],"text":["i think android &amp; iOS provide the data structures the author is looking for e.g. queues scheduled tasks, relational storage, key value and mostly typesafe"],"time":["2020-02-19 06:57:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["betimsl"],"id":[22369772],"kids":{},"parent":[22357184],"text":["My brain hurts from this article.

Moonshots are great if you have an actual goal that is achievable and will give you an advantage if it succeeds. Keep in mind that the original &#x27;moonshot&#x27; (going to the moon!) was a PR effort, not something that was meant to be sold, turn a profit or done on a large scale. It was simply a massive PR job to try to recover from the double hit of first satellite and first man in space victories the USSR scored over the USA. This whole project to me looked like a Google level version of Armadillo space, interesting but ultimately going nowhere. Shell may keep it alive as a PR item, they will need all the help they can get on that front but I really doubt it will ever be used in production anywhere in volumes that matter.<p>The easiest way to compare Makani to stationary wind installations out there generating power today is to look at the effective cross section of the rotors and to realize that a moving rotor consumes exactly the same amount of power in lift that it uses going forward. So that will cancel out across the loop leaving you with a bunch of small rotors vs a <i>much<\/i> larger rotor sweeping an enormous surface.

To be uprooted means to have no place in the world, recognized and guaranteed by others; to be superfluous means not to belong to the world at all. Uprootedness can be the preliminary condition for superfluousness, just as isolation can (but must not) be the preliminary condition for loneliness. Taken in itself, without consideration of its recent historical causes and its new role in politics, loneliness is at the same time contrary to the basic requirements of the human condition and one of the fundamental experiences of every human life. Even the experience of the materially and sensually given world depends upon my being in contact with other men, upon our common sense which regulates and controls all other senses and without which each of us would enclosed in his own particularity of sense data which in themselves are unreliable and treacherous. Only because we have common sense, that is only because not one man, but men in the plural inhabit the earth can we trust our immediate sensual experience. Yet, we have only to remind ourselves that one day we shall have to leave this common world which will go on as before and for whose continuity we are superfluous in order to realize loneliness, the experience of being abandoned by everything and everybody.<p>Dealing with &quot;uprootedness and superfluousness&quot; is one of the most perplexing questions facing modernity.

Having said that I honestly believe appropriate governance laws that recursively apply to subsidiary and owned companies would be a very effective (even if not perfect way) for a single country to start realizing tax on their multi-nationals before the much slower wheels of international agreements can grind the problem away.<p>My poorly thought out solution is along the lines of:<p>Any company owning shares in another must attempt to vote every year that that the subsidary (or just invested in company) company pays out a dividend proportional to net profit and 3rd party investment since the last such passing vote.<p>Any subsidiary incorporated by this company must apply these rules and any investment in the company is taxed when the subsidiary incorporates or buys stock in another company.<p>They must also attempt to vote that any company they have shares in follow these same rules.<p>No temporary transfer of shares or proxy appointment should effect the outcome of these mandated votes.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are issues with my implementation of this idea such as longer planning of a warchest for growth or perhaps intuitive structures such as a subsidiary that manages all international subsidiaries but it was more to highlight a particular structure than to be exhaustively tuned."],"time":["2020-02-20 00:12:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["freddref"],"id":[22367609],"kids":{},"parent":[22363150],"text":["Large corps can afford to figure out ways around the tax law internationally, while countries take a long time to legislate internationally.<p>Easier for states to retaliate by suing, or otherwise fining,\nlike google in the EU\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;eu-hits-google-third-billion-dollar-fine-so-what&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;eu-hits-google-third-billion-dol...<\/a><p>potentially cheaper than paying taxes?"],"time":["2020-02-19 18:17:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Shorel"],"id":[22367432],"kids":{},"parent":[22363150],"text":["Facebook converts to scientology."],"time":["2020-02-19 18:02:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LyalinDotCom"],"id":[22367969],"kids":{},"parent":[22363150],"text":["Reality is companies know that even if they have to settle in court they still save BILLIONS.
