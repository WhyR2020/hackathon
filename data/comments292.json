In the last few months people have received bills that amount to 10 to 20 times their usual bill.<p>In our case, with a 13 kW solar array, our usual bill is in the order of  $15 per month and has been so for years.  Last month our bill was $350 and the prior month $184.  We have been sending excess energy to SCE for years.  I built a larger system than normal in preparation for electric vehicles.  Which means that, at times, we send as much as 6 kW or so back.  None of that mattered.<p>What complicates everything is that we were auto-magically signed-up for CPA (Clean Power Alliance).  Which is, as far as I am concerned, a government run scam (sorry if this offends anyone).  By &quot;we&quot; I mean, most of our neighborhood and town.<p>What makes this a mess is that SCE can&#x27;t talk about CPA rates and CPA can&#x27;t talk about SCE billing.  One, in theory, provides the electricity and the other charges you for the transport and some fees.  If you have ever tried to make sense out of one of these bills you know exactly what I am talking about.  I have spent hours on the phone will SCE billing people and they can&#x27;t tell me how some of it is actually calculated, even managers don&#x27;t know.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleanpoweralliance.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleanpoweralliance.org&#x2F;<\/a><p>What makes it even worse is that the rate comparison tools and calculators available before the transition to CPA+SCE evaporated after the transition.  The SCE website has been a mess for about two years and not having access to rate comparison tools makes it even worse.  Billing and data clarity is obfuscated, to say the least.<p>Some of us are now in the process of opting out of CPA just to that we can talk to a single point of contact and actually discuss the bill.  With CPA in the loop it is impossible because CPA and SCE point fingers at each other and consumers are left in the middle wondering what the heck happened.<p>Even beyond that, SCE told everyone that they had &quot;grandfathered rates&quot;.  This are the TOU-D-A and TOU-D-B rates from a few years ago.  One of the things that changed radically with respect to that time is that some of the costs per kWh have more than tripled.  When inquiring about how this could happen with &quot;grandfathered rates&quot; we were told that the <i>rate schedule<\/i> was grandfathered not the cost per kWh.  In other words, the demarcation times between &quot;On peak&quot;, &quot;Off peak&quot; and &quot;Super off peak&quot; remain fixed but your cost per kWh changes.<p>This is the most dishonest use of the term &quot;grandfathered&quot; I have seen in my life.  This might not make sense to readers outside of the US.  Here, the term refers to a condition being protected from future changes.  Anyone who heard that term pretty much assumed their <i>costs<\/i> were locked in, not just the times for each rate.  From my perspective this was a swindle.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grandfather_clause\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grandfather_clause<\/a><p>Frankly, this is about as anti-consumer as one can get.  The average person isn&#x27;t equipped to run through even the simplest electrical power calculations, they just don&#x27;t understand.  Add to this the complexities of tiered and time-of-day systems, varying rates and costs of transport, energy vs. power calculations, area under the power curve (which is what you pay for), difficulty in understanding energy utilization, etc. and you have the makings for a public that is powerless against this complexity.<p>I am quite comfortable with mathematics and complex financial modelling and still had to devote hours to getting enough answers from SCE to attempt to create a model in Excel in order to understand what happened during the last few months, not just for us but also our neighbors.  Even with that, the decision had to be made to opt-out of CPA because the math is simply too complex and nebulous.  Not to mention that I have better things to do with my life.<p>The decisions people like myself made a few years back --in my case the 13 kW system-- were based on promises made --a contract-- with SCE.  Never in my life I would have thought that a system of this size would result in us having to pay for electricity.  And so here we are.  If this continues the ROI will be negative forever and the size of the system would either have to increase by 50% or more or batteries will have to be added in order to manage consumption at lower rate-per-kWh times of the day (which can change at the will of SCE).<p>I am literally working on this as we speak, so the pain and aggravation is fresh and real.  At some point legal action might become the only recourse, I don&#x27;t know.  My neighbors are absolutely livid, unlike me (I engineered, bought and installed my own system), they ended-up with a range of leasing and other arrangements from a number of different vendors.  The typical systems these vendors install are based on the rate structure at the time of system installation and only seek to achieve a baseline cost structure between lease payments and electricity purchase beyond generation.  As rates and billing complexity changed, some of these folks are finding out that their 3.5 kW system is now almost useless and their electricity costs are going off the rails.  The trouble is, they will have to pay on these leases for years and years.<p>This is a mess."],"time":["2020-08-17 19:23:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vmception"],"id":[24193282],"kids":{},"parent":[24188135],"text":["Jeffrey Skilling is out of prison and working on a blockchain energy venture with Lou Pai<p>Just check to make sure they arent holding California’s power for ransom pending payment to a random Bitcoin address"],"time":["2020-08-18 00:59:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tln"],"id":[24191804],"kids":[24192547,24195793,24191923],"parent":[24188135],"text":["The article ends with:<p>“If there’s really a problem and not just the ISO jumping the gun, it’s going to manifest tomorrow,” Mr. Marcus said. “Tomorrow evening, the wolf arrives.”<p>What is that referencing?"],"time":["2020-08-17 22:43:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scrumbledober"],"id":[24193376],"kids":[24194277],"parent":[24188135],"text":["If the state could magically have enough battery capacity in every county to smooth out this curve, what scale of battery installation would that take?"],"time":["2020-08-18 01:09:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevespang"],"id":[24194582],"kids":{},"parent":[24188135],"text":["&quot;As California ISO began taking its emergency actions on Saturday, electricity wholesale costs jumped on its energy market.

I have previously even hired digital artists&#x2F;CAD developers to help me illustrate my ideas.<p>To me there are lots of obvious structural things that are outdated about cities.  And it is fun to think of out-there concepts to radically change or maybe improve things.<p>Recently I was in Gravity Sketch making a 3D model in VR of part of my idea.  That 3d model looks terrible now and has only about 40% of the concepts included.  Right now it is a series of connected enclosures, sort of like domes but sort of not like domes.<p>Basically there will be like a grid of these enclosures that are connected by two or more levels of roadways for small autonomous cars (pods) -- most of which will be for single passengers.<p>Each megastructure is a little bit like a tree inside of an egg.  Spiraling along the internal edges will be roads for traversing the levels.  There will be something like 7 or 8 vertical levels, each of which is maybe 4 or more stories tall.  The branches of the tree are steel holding up platforms.<p>Each main level has two sub-levels: one for infrastructure, and one for people and buildings.  The infrastructure level contains the roadways for the autonomous pods, as well as things like water, electricity, sewer, networking, and basement&#x2F;cargo reception.<p>The main level contains multistory buildings, walking roads, and a significant amount of space set aside for a type of permacultural-landscaping.  So there will be zoning requiring that space to be developed as for example food forest with aquaponics built in.  This will be on all levels and platforms.  So in the city charter or whatever is this requirement to dedicate a certain amount of space to this type of agriculture which is also landscape.  The idea is not to realistically produce all of the food or even a great proportion of it, but to enable some fresh produce to be at hand and to ensure that people are connected with food sources.  The idea is that by making agriculture a more integral part of the city, there may be more attention placed on agriculture by ordinary people and there may be more attention placed on making it more sustainable or something.  Also it seems wasteful to just use landscaping for decoration.<p>Another aspect is that I would like alternating bands of facade on the egg.  So there will be strips of something like glass but which will permit UV B (required for Vitamin D production) in a double layer.  And then strips of a thick insulated layer with an energy-harvesting sheathing that incorporates solar panels and ducted wind turbines sort of embedded in tunnels in the solar-cell-covered undulating surface.<p>It seems that you would need strategies for passive and active heating and cooling.  Such as automated shading, opening and closing ventilation, and heat recovery ventilators.  Etc.<p>It would be nice if some type of glass could be used largely for central walkways in order to increase the penetration of light.<p>Anyway I have a bit more that I wrote up before.<p>Multi-Level City Concept<p>In a high-density urban core, many skyscrapers exist in a relatively small area.  This makes it possible to house many people and support many businesses in that small footprint.<p>However, in these areas, while most buildings may have 50 or more floors, there is only a single level containing public infrastructure: the ground level, which contains all of the vehicle transportation, water, sewer, electricity, and communication.<p>In this scenario, there is actually more private infrastructure in the buildings themselves than infrastructure in the public level.  This is because each structure is a self-contained, privately designed and privately maintained entity.  So transportation (elevators), electricity, communication, water, sewer must all be facilitated by each private structure.  In addition, each of these is connected to the public infrastructure on only one level.<p>This presents multiple problems.<p>Problems with Single-Level Infrastructure in Many-Level dense Urban Cores<p>Since vehicle traffic can only move on one level, congestion can be extreme.<p>Multi-Level Public Inter-Building Public Infrastructure for Dense Urban Cores<p>Supporting Autonomous Passenger and Cargo Delivery<p>Suppose that there was a way to build a type of multi-level skeleton for a city.  So instead of a single roadway at only ground level, there were several different roadways at different floors of a superstructure.  This superstructure would be designed to support the installation of modular construction.<p>With this system, delivery of goods by small autonomous vehicles could, for example, proceed directly from the back cargo door of a restaurant on level 8, to your front door on level 2 a few blocks away, strictly over the public roadways which connect not only different buildings but also at different levels.  Vehicles could traverse levels over graded roadways or perhaps some type of small vehicle elevator system.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>Another _totally different_ idea that I had quite awhile ago was <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runvnc.github.io&#x2F;tinyvillage&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runvnc.github.io&#x2F;tinyvillage&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-18 01:57:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Proven"],"id":[24194443],"kids":{},"parent":[24184470],"text":["Since when does $10B gets any attention?<p>$3,000B was given away this year, with nothing to show for.<p>Talk about doomed republic."],"time":["2020-08-18 03:39:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["lorenzfx"],"id":[24188289],"kids":[24194463,24194804],"parent":[24175728],"text":["There is hardly anything in this article on the influence of the Black Sea on the Mediterranean world.

Marking as deletion has a cost of maintaining them throughout the session.<p>#2 CRDTs were perfect for plain strings and arbitrary key&#x2F;value pairs. But when it comes to schematic JSON that has semantic value CRDT was an added overhead. For example, try making a collaborative HTML editor with support for table operations. It is very likely you will end up with a table structure that is invalid to render. In OT analysing, modifying or cancelling ops were much easier.<p>#3 Since the software is primarily a cloud document editor, a central server is necessary even otherwise. So why not use the server for efficient version management and operation sequencing as well? Why prefer CRDTs whose bulk of complexity comes from eliminating the need of a central system?<p>Such practical reasons have kept us from venturing into CRDTs.

One is the cost of the CRDT representation, the other is whether it accurately represents what you&#x27;re trying to do. Classical implementations of CRDT use a heavyweight node per character in the text, each with its own unique and permanent id. In my research in xi, it became clear to me that more compressed representations are possible, and the xi CRDT is one such: it is an &quot;op&quot; object per edit, but the string itself is just a string.<p>Lately there has been other work pursuing those compressed representations: Chronofold, I think Martin Kleppmann&#x27;s automerge has some memory-efficiency work, and there are others.<p>But at least in the context of xi, this is not where things went wrong. As I&#x27;ve written about (and the author was kind enough to link), it&#x27;s because CRDT merges aren&#x27;t a good fit for the problems a code editor is trying to solve, particularly when the &quot;collaborators&quot; are automated processes such as language servers.<p>In human collaborative editing, it&#x27;s important to preserve text that&#x27;s being entered, even in the face of conflict. But when a peer is an automated service, it&#x27;s much better to drop the edit on the floor and recompute. I&#x27;m simplifying here, as it depends on the service - some are history-insensitive, some are sensitive to a small window of history (in the case of automatically inserting indentation, etc), and (speculative) other services may be sensitive to more history.<p>In addition, the CRDT constrains the data model considerably. In other words, it&#x27;s unfortunately <i>not<\/i> a clean abstraction where you can easily add higher level layers on top of the CRDT, but you always have to design those with the CRDT in mind (ie, everything still has to be a monotonic semi-lattice).<p>So, as with everything else, it&#x27;s a tradeoff, and it&#x27;s a question of weighing the pros and cons. I&#x27;m glad to see work being done to improve CRDT, but even with a very efficient representation and solid algorithms, the problems with CRDT would be enough for me not to use them in a code editor."],"time":["2020-08-17 16:13:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["spankalee"],"id":[24188567],"kids":{},"parent":[24176455],"text":["I&#x27;ve implemented operational transform based systems several times, and every time I check out CRDTs I end up staying with OT.<p>I find the complexity arguments against OTs to be far, far overblown and mostly academic, and that OT is, for me, much easier to understand.<p>The two big critiques against OT are transform explosion: you could have N^2 transforms. Except that not every operation pair interacts. I usually see just a couple of categories of operations: text, key&#x2F;value, tree, and list, and they all only need transforms within a category.<p>The second critique is around sequencing in a distributed system, but I&#x27;ve also never seen a production system that doesn&#x27;t have a central coordinating service.

My elementary school in the 1990s had a bunch of Apple Macintosh Performa 575 and 580 machines running Mac OS 7.5; the school still had them as late as 2001 when I completed sixth grade.  At the earlier grade levels we learned typing (using &quot;All the Right Type&quot;) and LOGO programming, and starting around fourth grade we learned how to write basic reports using ClarisWorks&#x27; word processor.  I am also familiar with the drawing tool that is part of ClarisWorks.<p>I&#x27;ve been collecting classic Macs for the past 16 years, ever since one of my teachers gave me a Macintosh SE and a Performa 6220.  Every now and then I boot one of my classic Macs and open up ClarisWorks.  One of the things I like about most software written for the classic Mac OS is their strict adherence to the Apple Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just the nostalgia talking, but Apple Pages and Apple Numbers do not spark the same joy in me that ClarisWorks did, though Apple Keynote is a superb software product.  I&#x27;ve tried using Apple Pages and Apple Numbers in the past, and I often end up resorting to LibreOffice, despite the fact that LibreOffice&#x27;s interface isn&#x27;t Mac-like while Pages and Numbers are first-party programs.  It&#x27;s hard for me to articulate this objectively, but Pages and Numbers seem to deviate from the traditional UI for word processors and spreadsheets, respectively, and I&#x27;m just more comfortable with more traditional word processors like ClarisWorks&#x2F;AbiWord&#x2F;Microsoft Word&#x2F;LibreOffice Writer and traditional spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel&#x2F;Gnumeric&#x2F;LibreOffice Calc.  I&#x27;ve tried Pages and Numbers, but I find myself reaching for LibreOffice.<p>Perhaps it would be nice if somebody created a modern-day ClarisWorks as a type of counter-weight to Microsoft Office and LibreOffice."],"time":["2020-08-17 15:06:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["makecheck"],"id":[24190019],"kids":[24194054,24193019,24193253],"parent":[24184697],"text":["This was in a category of good software that doesn’t exist much today, and you just know it when you experience it.<p>Apps like this were filled with features that don’t fit into regular marketing bullet points but were evidence of care and attention.

The wave function does not exist in physical space, it exists in <i>configuration<\/i> space.  Configuration space is the same as physical space only in the one very special case of a single non-entangled particle.  The intuitions of physical space do not generally carry over into the general case of configuration space.<p>2.  In order to produce interference you have to split up the wave function into two pieces and then bring those pieces back together again with a phase change.  But since the wave function exists in configuration space, &quot;bringing it back together again&quot; becomes increasingly difficult as the number of entangled degrees of freedom grows.  As a practical matter, it is effectively impossible to do this once the number grows beyond a few hundred (this is why building quantum computers is hard).  But an actual macroscopic observer consists of O(10^23) degrees of freedom, and is also entangled with their environment.  This is the reason that large systems behave classically and don&#x27;t exhibit interference.<p>3.  Whether or not a system is in a superposition is not a physical fact about the system, it is a consequence of the measurement you choose to make.  A vertically polarized photon (for example) is in a superposition relative to a measurement axis rotated away from the polarization axis.  For a more complicated system, the measurement axis, like the wave function itself, is in <i>configuration<\/i> space.  But we can only do measurements in <i>physical<\/i> space.  This is the reason that in order to see interference in an entangled system it is necessary to do multiple physical measurements and look at the correlations between them.  Doing those kinds of measurements on actual macroscopic objects is <i>way<\/i> beyond the current state of the art, and may well be impossible even in principle.  But this is the sort of thing that is contemplated in the theory behind these experiments.  This is the reason that single particles are used as stand-ins for Wigner&#x27;s friend."],"time":["2020-08-17 23:58:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["monktastic1"],"id":[24190251],"kids":[24192365,24195237],"parent":[24189723],"text":["I haven&#x27;t read the new paper in enough detail to comment, but also mentioned is the Renner-Frauchiger paper, which Scott Aaronson heartily debunks here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=3975\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=3975<\/a><p>The primary error there is one that people can&#x27;t seem to stop making for some strange reason: if you don&#x27;t measure a property X, and instead measure a (non-commuting) property Y, you are not free to say what X &quot;would have been,&quot; and -- especially egregiously -- to use that to demonstrate a contradiction.

The Art and Architecture departments are like that also, and I suspect but can&#x27;t prove that e.g. Economics, and more to the point, Physics, are too. I probably sound like I&#x27;m verging dangerously close to anti-intellectualism here, which I don&#x27;t really want to do in the current cultural climate, but if anything it&#x27;s the opposite: We should remember that believing someone implicitly just because they&#x27;re an intellectual is also anti-intellectual.

Someone is not necessarily immune to institutional pressures (nor are they even necessarily an honest person) just because they&#x27;re an intellectual.

Google Apps Script is Google’s development platform for writing scripts for Google apps like Sheets, Docs, Slides etc. It also lets you load HTML pages inside window dialogs in these apps, so you can build a simple UI that can interact with, for example, a spreadsheet, or you can use these dialogs to create an add on and publish it in the G Suite marketplace for others to use.<p>When you load an HTML file, the window dialog environment provides you with a way to call functions you’ve written in Google Apps Script (basically, Javascript with access to Google APIs).<p>The drawback with Google’s platform is the HTML file has to be a single page, and it can’t load other scripts. Google’s own documentation recommends using jquery and templates. Bah! Not good!<p>With the right webpack configuration and plugins you can build a complex React page that is bundled as a single HTML file, and load it into a dialog window. This project is a working demo of how to do that (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enuchi&#x2F;React-Google-Apps-Script\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enuchi&#x2F;React-Google-Apps-Script<\/a>).<p>The trickiest part here is building a proper local development experience. What I ended up doing is creating a wrapper app that is loaded into the dialog window during development instead of the actual React app. The wrapper loads an iframe pointing at a localhost address, and then I use a modified version of Webpack Dev Server to serve the React app in development at that localhost address. I use a helper utility to call the server-side Google Apps Script functions directly in production, but tells the wrapper component to call the functions in development, so it behaves pretty much the same way in production and development. Okay, a bit hard to explain…<p>Here’s a link to a quick video of using the development mode to actually hot reload the app inside a Google Sheets dialog.

I&#x27;ve written code at every level of &quot;the stack&quot;, from kernels of several nix-related operating systems to application GUIs. I&#x27;ve worked on &quot;plumbing&quot;, on libraries, and on applications.<p>And here&#x27;s the thing: I understand, at a very very deep level, precisely why my application is slow to start up. I understand it at every level from the semiconductor gates in silicon up to the color specification lists used by the GUI toolkit. But none of that helps me make it as fast as the handmade community thinks things should be.<p>Why? Because I know that the slow startup is caused by substantial amounts of code that all add useful functionality for at least some of my users. Do I want to get rid of i18n? Shall I skip checking for new versions? How about forcing plugin scans to be initiated by users and never doing them automatically (don&#x27;t even <i>think of<\/i> suggesting doing them in another thread, and don&#x27;t ask me why)? Shall I skip the ability to handle RTL text? Should we drop human readable and editable configuration files in favor of some faster and less resource-eating format? How about a scalable GUI, is that really useful for most? How about a themeable GUI, given that it&#x27;s not actually that themeable anyway?<p>And so on and so forth. Each one of the above (and lots more) contributes just a little bit to the slow startup. For most users, all but one of them will likely seem not very important. So which ones do we drop to get back to the sort of startup times that the handmade community seems to expect?<p>Because let&#x27;s face it, xterm can put a window on the screen before my finger is off the return key.

This includes technology decisions, like using web tech for applications instead of the native platform.<p>For example, Apple has had a lead of at least five years over Android when it comes to performance and user experience, because their system and apps were all built in native environments, instead of the JVM abstraction layer. It took at least five years for Android to catch up, and it took quadcore CPU&#x27;s to do it. Around then, Apple carefully started using dual-core CPUs.<p>Meanwhile, companies like Facebook and Twitter spent dozens of work-years on trying to make web technology feasible in native apps and never really cracked it.<p>If they had just focused on building good native apps they wouldn&#x27;t have wasted so much time.<p>Caveat &#x2F; Aside: IIRC Facebook is having &#x2F; has had massive issues with having too much code &#x2F; classes &#x2F; files in their app(s), on both iOS and Android.

IIUC, mass-produced physical goods are inferior to their handmade counterparts because of the trade-offs that enable profitable mass production. So we have a strong emotional attachment to handmade things being better, and the Handmade movement plays on that emotional attachment.<p>But the metaphor breaks down if you think about it. A carpenter making a single piece of furniture can tailor it to the person who will be sitting on it. A cook making a meal for one person can tailor it to their dietary requirements or tastes. But software of any non-trivial scale is rarely written for one person. Even when it&#x27;s developed according to the ideals of the Handmade movement, it will be mass-distributed.<p>I actually think that, contrary to our intuition about handmade things, Handmade software tends to have compromises compared to software that builds on well-established components. I won&#x27;t repeat miki123211&#x27;s top-level comment [1]. I&#x27;ll just add here that it&#x27;s precisely the economics of large-scale software distribution that allow concerns such as internationalization and accessibility to be addressed, while a solo Handmade project will probably not have these important things.<p>So, while slinging JavaScript code with no regard for performance and packaging it with Electron is certainly not the ideal, I strongly believe that the Handmade approach isn&#x27;t either.

Contrary to many of the comments here, I would never just go for a &quot;boring framework&quot; because it is tried and true, or just use what I already know.  That sounds like a great way to grind yourself into burnout.<p>Instead I would start jamming on a whiteboard or in a notebook.  Think about the problem you are tackling: what are the inputs, what are the outputs, what are the key functions, and what data structures and algorithms might be important?  How about the team?  Is it just you, or are you working with other people? What are your experiences, interests and passions? What&#x27;s the timeline?  Spend some time exploring libraries, reading paper and blog posts to inform yourself of the space.  Maybe read some open source libraries.  Don&#x27;t go nuts, but scan around to soak up some good ideas and build a mental model of the space.  This all helps put some parameters around the situation and give you some confidence that you are making informed decisions.  Now you can think about the MVP, key interfaces, etc, and you might find that you can do some quick and dirty components for 80% of the project while really focusing on the heart of the challenge in that last 20%.<p>Often times if you define good interfaces you can swap early hacks and experiments out for something fancier (faster, more scalable, etc) later on, so then you don&#x27;t need to worry as much about making optimal decisions.  For example, you might use some distributed key value store or message bus in the end system, but to get the ball rolling you can just spin up a Redis instance during development, or even just write a couple functions that fake it in-memory or using JSON on disk for starters.<p>Now you can think about what you want to learn in this project.  What&#x27;s going to be fun and interesting about it?  Do you want to dig into some new algorithms, a different language, a machine learning model?  I like to use my curiosity as a major motivation to differentiate from other solutions and push through what could otherwise be boring aspects of the project.  Say you need a service that just manages logins and sends back some tokens.  That can be done in a million ways, and it is likely to get swapped out down the line anyways as you scale or whatever.  So make it interesting, pick a new library or language and go nuts.  This of course needs to be balanced with making sure you can accomplish the task in a reasonable amount of time, but this kind of learning is empowering and it will make you a more capable engineer.  Now 20 years into my career I can program in 10+ languages on embedded micro-controllers or virtual cloud clusters, and picking up a new language or framework isn&#x27;t daunting at all.<p>Have fun doing it, and you&#x27;ll get better faster than everyone who is picking the boring framework in their same old language to solve it the way that the blogs are telling them to and then frantically searching stackoverflow because half way into the project they discover that their square problem doesn&#x27;t perfectly fit into the framework&#x27;s glorious round, ahem, hole.  That&#x27;s not engineering or craftsmanship.  That&#x27;s nervous fanboy frenzy that is the opposite of empowering.<p>Everyone has to find their own explore vs exploit trade-off, and we need people whose experience is narrow and deep as well as others who have learned far and wide.

First you don&#x27;t need to be on the latest tech stack. Tech stacks come and go, but some stick around with force for a very long time. In fact the most successful will always stick around. For instance, while I wouldn&#x27;t start a new Java based stack today, I would have no problem starting a Kotlin one, which will end up using the same technology under the hood. The reason is that I&#x27;m not particularly found of Java, but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are a huge amount of people that would start a brand new Java project with no hesitation. And they would be right to do so. Consider the following:\n- what is your team familiar with?\n--if your team is comfortable with a strong, battle tested technology, that&#x27;s a strong incentive to use it.\n- is the technology of choice not too obsolete?\n--if you start a brand new Cobalt project, then you are dealing with some serious problems in your environment. In fact, in some extreme cases, choice is non-existent, but in those cases you would not have the so called &quot;decision fatigue&quot; to begin with, since there would be no choices to speak of.\n- does stack X solve a problem you are having with stack Y?\n-- if the proposed stack doesn&#x27;t address real world issues with you current stack, than there is no need to change.\n- is stack X an evolution of stack Y?\n-- in same cases the new stack is very familiar, an evolution of kinds of your current stack. For instance .Net Core is and evolution to regular .Net. In those cases, migrating your team to the new stack should be pretty easy and provide some benefits. Just be careful not to jump the ship too early. Make sure the features you rely on are available, and that the new platform is stable.<p>If you read the above, you might get the impression that I&#x27;m saying people rarely change stacks. And that&#x27;s actually true. At the end of the day, people tend to stick with what they know, because it works, and has worked for years. Rewriting software is risky and expensive. But even for new projects, if the teams sticks to their current tech stack, they can reuse years of work, as well as rely on the expertise they acquired through the problems they faced. Now I know that this kind of question often comes from people that are either new to the field or not very experienced. So I will give some advice if you get a fresh start, as in a start up with no legacy code or existing team, or if you are building or own project, or maybe you get a team that is somehow isolated from the rest of the company.<p>Basically if you have no real world bias (as opposed to personal bias) towards any tech stack, then the only solution is to do a lot of research. Building prototypes often help test out the options. But first learn about them. Learn their motivation. Why was this stack built to begin with, what problems were they trying to solve. Are their problems similar to what you expect in you project?<p>Sometime people build new stacks to address real world problems. Some times they build them because they can. I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t use a technology just because the other had no good reason to built it, just had to opportunity. Sometimes people build really good products even if they are not trying to solve world hunger. And if you find such stack go ahead. But in general, try to find stable, battle tested tech, that solves your particular problem. Ignore the trends, focus on reliability and familiarity."],"time":["2020-08-18 02:33:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crdrost"],"id":[24189499],"kids":{},"parent":[24176774],"text":["Haha, everybody is going to have their opinion on this. Heck, I read through the comments and I didn’t see this answer but probably in the time it takes to type it up, someone else will post it.<p>So Adam Savage had a video[1] a few months back on weathering prop money to look like a properly “gangsta” stack of bills rather than a set of nice printed paper. And when it was broadcast it was live and he took questions from the audience while some espresso was drying on the bills in his oven, and one of those questions was about someone needing a prop that looked properly covered in dirt and blood, and what is the best way to do that?<p>He said that the dirt part was easy (I assume he meant, just bury the stuff for a day or two and come back and it will be covered in dirt) but the blood part was harder because blood doesn&#x27;t stay red for very long. But at the end he had some really great commentary, looking back at the question he said<p>&gt; So, your question though, “what is the <i>best<\/i> way”... The answer is, <i>there is no<\/i>, there is no best way! There is the way you figure out how to do it. Yeah! That’s really the thing. It may be that you’ve gotta, like, <i>take a brush<\/i> and kinda work at a whole bunch of different bills, and then take the stack and then effect the stack, right?, I think that’s like a multi-stage process, and then you should do some tests with different paints and see, like, under the lighting conditions these will be seen—I don’t know if it’s for a theater or a film—does it communicate? Does it <i>tell you<\/i> that it’s bloody, dirty money? That’s the question to be asking, you gotta hold it up, look at it, <i>[mimes looking at it and pausing and thinking] “does that sell to me?”—and ask other people, “does this sell?”... and like most of the time they’re gonna go, “no,” and you’re gonna keep on going. But it’s trial and error.<p>I present this advice to you in part as a way of combating decision fatigue. It’s gonna be trial and error, there’s not gonna be a ‘best way,’ so spending too much time up-front trying to figure out <\/i>what is that best way* is gonna be a waste of your precious limited resources of attention and drive.<p>Because the actual definition of “best” is coming from these extrinsic factors. Sure you don’t have lighting. But maybe you have a constraint that you would like to build a JavaScript game around the same rules engine as you’re using to analyze the game and figure out cheap play and winning&#x2F;losing, and it would be really tremendously inconvenient if you discovered that the two rules engines are subtly different and your analysis misses a loophole that breaks your JavaScript game. So you write the analysis engine in Node.js or so, so that you can reuse identical code in both places—or maybe JS is an inconvenient language because it does not have a great library that some other language does, like maybe you need to do a Fast Fourier Transform as part of this game so now you have to switch to a client-server model with the server having access to your FFT library. I don’t know. But the decision is made not by which technology is intrinsically better, just like the decision of which red goes into your blood paint is not about which paint is intrinsically better.<p>Two minor tips,<p>(1) I commented recently in another post that you should not concern yourself at all about scaling problems. I want to repeat that here. On initial selection of technology, do <i>not<\/i> worry about whether it scales. On initial selection of algorithms, it is even acceptable to brute force through some <i>n<\/i>! number of ways of permuting some elements until you find some better heuristic. Always start with doing it whatever is the easiest way for you personally, because <i>you do not know until you see it in its eventual lighting<\/i> what parts will and won’t work. It may be that this <i>n<\/i>! is indeed too long, mostly <i>n<\/i> is small but every once in a while it goes to 12, 13, 14, or even 15. But it may also turn out that the final decision can be effortlessly cached and then it becomes O(1) after that, so it is a one-time cost that doesn’t need to be recalculated. Or maybe it does. Spend all of your time optimizing that, and you may find out that <i>n<\/i> is never more than 8 in practice and the thing completes in some fraction of a second. You don’t know how to choose tech or algorithms to scale until you know what your scaling problems are, and when you know that you’ll be able to measure them. Never start with Kubernetes, never start with anything intricate, just do the easiest thing which might work and then see why it doesn’t. And this solves a lot of decision fatigue.<p>(2) In addition to ease, you might consider joy. Start writing the thing in Haskell, if that will bring you joy. You may find that with a Data.Map.Strict and a System.Random.StdGen that you can very easily load a dictionary of names and frequencies into Haskell and then randomly generate a name according to that frequency table, and maybe that is fun to you, that this fits in just a couple lines of code. If you are playing then you aren’t nearly as subject to decision fatigue. Nobody sits there with a box of lego trying to make a castle going “but is the 2x4x3 brick a <i>better<\/i> material to build this castle rather than say the thinner, longer walls of a 1x6x3 brick? What about a 2x4x1 brick, a larger number of thinner layers in case I need curvy designs built into the walls?” Like those decisions do have to be made but you kind of just <i>make<\/i> them and if it’s wrong you unmake them later, and you don’t care because you’re <i>playing around<\/i> and so it doesn’t feel like a big decision to you.<p>Those are my three pieces of advice. There is no best way there is just the way that you figure out which does the thing; do whatever comes easiest to you and worry about making it better later; and feel free to play around with other things you’re curious about.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=igEqC3snaYY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=igEqC3snaYY<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 19:32:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lr4444lr"],"id":[24189072],"kids":[24197487],"parent":[24176774],"text":["Use frameworks."],"time":["2020-08-17 18:56:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DominoTree"],"id":[24192542],"kids":[24193240],"parent":[24176050],"text":["It&#x27;s not pretty or nearly as useful, but towards the &quot;end&quot; of its life, the ST had native Ethernet and TCP&#x2F;IP<p>Here&#x27;s a picture of a native session running (on sdf.org)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;DG0_h-eU0AEFy_7?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;DG0_h-eU0AEFy_7?format=jpg&amp;name=...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 23:44:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter_d_sherman"],"id":[24200780],"kids":{},"parent":[24176050],"text":["&gt;&quot;In the following tutorial, I’ll describe how I connected my Atari ST to the Internet via using a cheap ESP8266 microcontroller as a WiFi-to-serial router – running at 19.2 kbit&#x2F;s.&quot;<p>This is a great idea!<p>I don&#x27;t own an Atari ST, but in theory this should work for any computer with an RS-232 interface, of course, non Atari ST computers would need their own SLIP-compatible software stack on the software side, but this article covers all that&#x27;s needed on the hardware side for any computer with an RS-232 interface...<p>Anyway, brilliant and tremendously useful idea!"],"time":["2020-08-18 18:34:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j45"],"id":[24194460],"kids":[24194712,24195213,24194529],"parent":[24176050],"text":["The 1040ST was truly one of the more flexible and malleable computers in it&#x27;s day.<p>Connectivity between computers using MIDI Cables, for example was a regular way to play networked games.<p>I feel extremely lucky to be exposed to an entire lab of them in Canada and it did the right thing at the time - feed the imagination in ways 5-10 years ahead of it&#x27;s time in North America that other machines couldn&#x27;t quite do it.<p>If these kinds of machines had caught on in North America like they had in Europe maybe the world would look different."],"time":["2020-08-18 03:43:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["leothekim"],"id":[24198482],"kids":{},"parent":[24190385],"text":["Possibly one of the most moving interviews I’ve seen was Dave Brubeck talking about returning to America after WWII and witnessing racism towards black veterans.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;stadqAHRroA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;stadqAHRroA<\/a><p>The story he tells at the very end brings me to tears.

So the kids do most of their schoolwork in their rooms or at the dining table. They work in blocks of about 2 hours, and I schedule breaks to coincide with theirs. During the breaks we try to go for a short walk or something to get the wiggles out, and then it&#x27;s back to work. Tuesdays (and sometimes Thursdays) I go to my spouse&#x27;s office where I can isolate and get some real work done until late. We trade that time for Fridays, when I stop work a couple hours early so the au pair can leave if he wants to. If I need to be able to really focus I leave the house and go to a park where I can tether and crank out some real work.

Sometimes she gets to help other kids when they get stuck with their learning apps, and visa versa, which is fun. We&#x27;re likely to expand this to some of the afternoon too, since they&#x27;re adding a Spanish program.<p>Overall, I&#x27;ve noticed that her development has thrived since she&#x27;s moved to a more self-paced environment. There&#x27;s been no sign that using screens a lot is causing any problems. We&#x27;ve set up an iPad on an adjustable goose-neck stand so she can (and does) run around a lot and her friends can still see her. We also make sure there&#x27;s time outside for exercise.<p>We&#x27;ve found a lot of good online resources, generally free or very cheap, such as Cosmic Kids Yoga, Draw Every Day with JJK, Mo Willems Doodles, and Khan Academy Kids. We&#x27;ve also discovered kids coding apps, like CodeSpark and SpriteBox, that have been a big hit. The teacher at Modulo.app does a good job of helping us find resources for stuff our daughter takes an interest in, and we share stuff we find with them too.<p>We&#x27;re both full-time parents, and certainly we&#x27;re not as productive as we were before, but for me it&#x27;s a totally acceptable compromise. I get to be more involved in my child&#x27;s development and I get to see her much more than I did before. One key thing is to have carefully planned schedules for everyone in the house. Kids are generally much happier when they have a schedule, and it also means as parents we know when we can arrange meetings, do live coding, and so forth.<p>We&#x27;re very lucky to have these options.

This is one less tab they have to keep open and refer to constantly. Also, a second copy helps parents keep on top of the kids schedule. A color printer here is a huge benefit. We have an HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw, and it’s amazing.<p>2) Get a headset with a microphone; aim for comfort more than style. Something over-ear with a cushioned headband. They’re going to be wearing it all day, and earbuds can fall out of small ears. My 7yo daughter looks like an airline pilot with hers on. They’re huge, but she loves them.<p>3) Encourage your child not to panic when something goes wrong. Adults are much better equipped to handle meeting malfunction than kids. They won’t get an unexcused absence or other demerit because of a computer malfunction.

My daughter (then in the 4th grade) was attending a private school in the Chicago suburbs. The transition was decent, with her school already having a 1:1 laptop program and Google Classroom integration into her curriculum. The only change was that 4th graders didn&#x27;t take their chromebooks home, but when school was abruptly closed, the laptops came with. All of her subjects had asynchronous work pages or chapter questions, asynchronous reading, asynchronous projects, and then synchronous instruction, synchronous classmate discussion&#x2F;talk&#x2F;project time, and synchronous project presentations. My daughter&#x27;s grades improved slightly, likely from the additional focus given the lack of classroom distractions at home. My wife was available to answer immediate questions while I was working from home in most subjects, although I helped out when additional perspectives were needed to learn the material (my wife and I had very different education experiences, so our methods tend to be divergent).<p>This year we had the option of a similar remote program for the first semester or in-person, with the commitment lasting until the grading period is over. We&#x27;re very fortunate to have one parent who can easily dedicate time during the day and a program conducive to remote learning. I can only imagine the sleepless schedules that would be involved in a less structured online program or with both parents working.<p>The major reason for not moving to home schooling this year is to guarantee our place at the private school for 6th&#x2F;7th&#x2F;8th grade without a significant donation to get back in.

We&#x27;re fortunate to have a pretty big house for a city, but still space could be cramped: we have a parents&#x27; bedroom, living room and balcony upstairs, and a children&#x27;s bedroom and large work&#x2F;game&#x2F;guest&#x2F;second livingroom downstairs.<p>Quite often, my wife was working upstairs, I downstairs, my oldest son in his room, and my youngest son was mostly playing and watching TV with the occasional school-related lesson on a tablet. On Thursdays, our cleaner would come, and we all had to cram into half the house while she cleaned the other half, or we had to leave the house. Sometimes we ended up working in bed or on the balcony.<p>My oldest son was quite capable of doing his own schoolwork, though he&#x27;s always finished way too quickly and spent the rest of the day gaming, so this made his gaming addiction a lot worse in retrospect, but at the time, he didn&#x27;t need much attention. Or youngest did, though. It&#x27;s hard to work when a 5-year-old wants your attention. But our regular babysitter had all her other babysitting jobs and restaurant jobs cancelled, so eventually we hired her 3 days a week to entertain and teach our youngest, and that worked very well. I still ended up shifting a lot of work to the evenings and weekends, which works fine: play with your kids during the day, work in the evening. There&#x27;s not much else to do anyway.<p>So the isolation wasn&#x27;t perfect because of outside help, but that did make it bearable. We always kept a lot of distance from our cleaner (who always wore masks and gloves), and the babysitter didn&#x27;t have much else going on in her life anymore, so we figured she wasn&#x27;t a big risk.<p>So I guess that&#x27;s my advice: adopt a near-permanent babysitter. There are probably plenty who are currently our of a job, and as long as they don&#x27;t do much else than babysit at your place and go back to their own home, they&#x27;re not a big risk.

Our local policies have them physically going in in about 3 weeks, or being &quot;virtual&quot;.<p>We have a legally deaf-blind student that we feel will not be able to cope with everyone wearing a mask and having to be distant. (Under normal circumstances, he tends to get rather close in because he&#x27;s trying to see you; he&#x27;s got rather more European personal space sensibilities than American ones.) We also have a sneaking suspicion that &quot;in person school&quot; will last less than a week before someone coughs and everyone is sent home. (So to speak.) We think this is going to be a very unstable and destabilizing option.<p>The local virtual option was well established here before, but involves children sitting in front of computers for nearly the full 8 hours, as if they were at school. As adults, we&#x27;re hardly willing to be on 8 hours of video call a day and asking for this from children is absurd. (I&#x27;m not too worried about the details of whether it&#x27;s exactly 8 hours, the point is, they&#x27;re clearly trying to function as a school <i>day<\/i> replacement rather than a <i>school<\/i> replacement; the two are not the same.)<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed my oldest is falling behind in math, because they&#x27;re going just a <i>touch<\/i> faster than he can quite keep up with [1], and I&#x27;ve kind of wanted to fix that anyhow. I can see the memeplex forming where he realizes that there&#x27;s no reason to put any effort in, because almost no matter what he does, the curriculum goes zooming on and gives him an OK grade. Even if we only do this for half a year or a year I&#x27;m hoping to have a chance to break in to this cycle.<p>At the moment I&#x27;m not focusing too hard on the &quot;socialization&quot; problem. Lockdown is precluding a lot of good solutions to that anyhow. We can address it more thoroughly later.<p>The main thing I&#x27;m having to reconsider is music. I still want to offer a music program, but now band isn&#x27;t an option and&#x2F;or is not a reliable option. (This is true even if we took the full-physical option anyhow.) We&#x27;re doing a trial run of the home schooling this week (before our actual start date, so we can decide how we like it), and I&#x27;m considering trying to offer the kids some music programs involving instruments that are capable of functioning alone. I took enough piano that I could easily teach it; I&#x27;m also considering electric guitar as a versatile option that seems to have some passable electronic teaching options.

Lack of native distributed search led to Google’s monopoly.<p>“The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for.”<p>This doesn’t make any sense.   Google’s entire early innovation was to use hyperlinks as an indicator of popularity and thus a proxy metric for veracity, and PageRank was born.<p>Original attempts at distributed search based on other metrics like text analysis were tried (Webcrawler, AltaVista which was used by Yahoo, Inktomi which was used by Lycos, HotBot, etc) but didn’t produce better results, and Google eventually grew to #1 by 2004 (6 years after intro).<p>Google could not have existed without the hyperlink.  The reason it has a monopoly today is largely due to investment cycles and intellectual property law:  after the dot com bust, there wasn’t exactly an appetite to build new search engines given PageRank was patented and would need to be licensed (it expired in 2019).<p>This monopoly doesn’t matter as much:  generic search engine use has been declining for years in favour of other approaches to finding content (social media, syndication, domain specific aggregators, etc).<p>Decentralized Index&#x2F;search (not just distributed but truly decentralized) remains an open research problem.   it may be possible to improve and deploy with the right incentives and investment, but it’s ludicrous to think this was possible in 1992-1998.<p>2.  Lack of native payments led to advertising to take off.<p>This has no factual basis:  CGI-bin scripts to purchase things with HTTP POST calls existed as early as 1993.  Amazon and eBay launched in 1995.  PayPal started when Google did, in 1998.<p>More importantly, most viewed the web as another visual media like Television, which was ad-driven. People generally didn’t like paying for things that felt free, like information, or music, or movies.<p>But again, the Ad Words monopoly remains tenuous.  Facebook has been steamrolling it in growth and will eventually eclipse it.  We are also seeing a lot more willingness for people to pay for content to avoid ads.<p>3. “poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all)”<p>It was called hypermedia widely by around 1995 when images and audio (Real Networks in particular) took off, there just wasn’t the processing power, bandwidth, or compression algorithms available to make this real until 1998 when MP4 came out.<p>Google’s early attempt at video, Google Videos, was a market failure.   They had to buy YouTube which (most importantly) made it easy to publish videos compared to others, but it took many years for it to reach #1.<p>And that position too is threatened between Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc.<p>In summary, Google is #1 in a number of markets due to a combination of smart business moves, smart technology, being an early player, and the business&#x2F;investment climate at key inflection points of the industry.  There are a large number of competitive pressures against Google that make this lead tenuous.   Google is as vulnerable as AOL or Microsoft were in the late 90s, when they were thought to be unassailable.<p>As for the health of the web, let’s remember that regardless of all the claims of the death of the web, whether native mobile, or WebSockets, or walled gardens, GraphQL, or single page apps or accelerators like Amp (which had to change offer direct hyperlink access due to complaints), the web remains entrenched, omnipresent, and has no clear replacement.<p>This matters because the core architecture of the web:  URLs, HTTP, MIME, and (to a somewhat shrinking extent) HTML remains the foundational glue that holds all this mess of media and technology together, and is fundamentally about enabling decentralization.  URLs still are the main way that native mobile apps integrate with the network.  HTML is still the default fallback UI.  HTTP is still the primary application protocol by far.<p>All of this was the design intent of the architecture of the Web:  to last decades, regardless of how the origin servers or user agents evolved.   It’s an architecture ripe for innovation to make decentralized alternatives to today’s incumbents.<p>To paraphrase John Lennon, centralization is over, if you want it.<p>But this requires the experience to be actually better for users, and not just in an “eat your vegetables &#x2F; don’t give your privacy away” manner. Starting a new venture to take this on requires a combination of investment, insight, and commitment that’s not easy to assemble.  But it can and probably will happen, relative to legislation or very possible social catastrophes that entrench the current players longer than needed."],"time":["2020-08-16 19:00:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saos"],"id":[24177728],"kids":{},"parent":[24176898],"text":["&gt; AMP, a technology no one asked for<p>!!!"],"time":["2020-08-16 15:47:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cmrdporcupine"],"id":[24177715],"kids":[24178256,24178604,24178539,24177742,24178643,24178914,24177730,24179871,24177923,24179664,24177746,24180036,24180198,24177906,24179261,24178889,24179093,24178440],"parent":[24176898],"text":["A lot of talk in this article about Google capturing the whole web, all valid points, but I find the Facebook walled garden even more terrifying.

One, it will pull resources away from things you actually need in order to keep making more green circuits, even though you have more than you can use right now anyway. The copper that could be going to manufacturing the item that is your current bottleneck is instead going towards something you have too much of anyway.<p>The second issue hits you on the other side... when you DO start using more green circuits than you are producing, you won&#x27;t notice until your issue is very severe, because you will have been using your reserves for quite a while. By then, you will have to increase your production a lot to make up for it... which might put a different resource out of whack.<p>The trick is to let the factories overproducing to backup production and stop... let that back pressure behave as a natural production regulator, which will make it much easier to have a factory that always works as efficiently as possible given your current raw material production."],"time":["2020-08-17 02:04:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bcrosby95"],"id":[24182167],"kids":[24182316,24182312],"parent":[24181783],"text":["Playing Factorio certainly feels similar to some kinds of Software Engineering.<p>But I don&#x27;t particularly like the comparison because a huge thing about Factorio is the restrictions on physical layout.

Don&#x27;t have lots of dependencies, build isolated services to focus on certain things.  Have a high speed bus for different services to communicate over.  Keep comms efficient and direct as possible.  Build with scaling in mind.  If you need something quick, build in an optimal way without considering scaling beyond your goal."],"time":["2020-08-17 04:15:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["barbs"],"id":[24182616],"kids":[24183082],"parent":[24181783],"text":["Relevant Vice article: Why Do We Play Video Games That Feel Like Work?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;4x38aq&#x2F;why-do-we-play-video-games-that-simulate-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;4x38aq&#x2F;why-do-we-play-vid...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 02:31:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kkapelon"],"id":[24185279],"kids":{},"parent":[24181783],"text":["Apart from SHENZHEN, most other games from Zachtronics are great about teaching programming.<p>I can recommend spacechem, which looks simple at first glance, but is all about threads,multiprocessing, mutexes etc.<p>Silicon Zeroes is also another great game for developers."],"time":["2020-08-17 10:40:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wotamRobin"],"id":[24182464],"kids":{},"parent":[24181783],"text":["This is a great article!

When it speeds up, it is subject to time dilation. Time slows down more as it speeds up, and so any electromagnetic waves emitted by the body will have a lower frequency.<p>The effect of the speed up is not separable from the fact that it has dunked deeper into the gravitational field of the black hole, which also contributes time dilation.<p>&gt; <i>If you shine a beam of light into the sky, the light doesn&#x27;t slow down, but gravity does take away some of its energy.<\/i><p>The red shift that we see is purely a time dilation effect. So that is to say, if there were, say, a 101.5 Mhz radio station on that star, we would see that at a lower Mhz figure purely due to the oscillator of that station appearing to be slower due to time dilation. Someone riding that star, clapping their hands once per second might look like they are clapping once every 1.2 seconds.<p>The beam of light which is conveying to us the events from a source cannot alter the frequency of those events, even if it changes speed along the way. If we see 1000 events per second, then it means the source is generating 1000 events per second, according to our frame of reference.
