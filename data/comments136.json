There are many areas where Native apps have the upper hand w.r.t Electron.<p>Memory Usage<p>A few years ago while trying to figure out why I was running out of RAM, I stumbled upon chrome’s task manager. Gmail was using up 700MB of RAM and all I had open was the Inbox. No fancy search box or Compose, the Inbox was taking up 700MB of RAM to display lines of text in a Tabular format. I’ve been a heavy user of Email clients and if you pick any of the native clients (Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail) and open a bunch of searches and compose windows the memory usage will still stay below 100MB. I used mIRC a few decades ago to connect to multiple chat servers, run my own bots, serve files over DCC and run scripts all while staying under 20MB of Ram. These days to send a text message over Slack I need over 1GB of RAM. Even basic apps with all of their trackers, external javascript scripts and doms take up 100s of MBs in memory. And the most common solution to running out of memory is to close chrome windows.<p>Battery&#x2F;CPU Usage<p>DOM is slow. Updating layout and repainting is even slow. Javascript being a dynamic language is slow. Web apps are anything but simple these days and since they have to work under the limitations of all the slow components, the CPU ends up making up for it. Chrome is almost always present in my Macbook’s ‘Using significant energy’ tab. On the other hand, I rarely if ever see native apps in the battery bar unless I’m doing something which should actually consume a lot of CPU cycles like running multiple synths in Ableton or Compiling.\nWhen apps are built for mobile, battery usage is a major area to optimize on. But nobody even gives it a thought for web apps<p>60 FPS<p>Mobile apps run on 60fps, Native desktop apps run at 60fps, Games run ( or at least are designed to) run at 60fps. Instagram on chrome starts at 2-3 fps and usually hovers around 30fps. My laptop which is supposed to be more powerful than my mobile phone is only able to churn out half the frame rate even though they are both running at the same resolution! Web apps are not buttery smooth and can be jerky at times. Sure somebody can work really hard and optimize a website to run at 60fps at all times, but it needs a lot of effort. Mobile apps run at 60fps out of the box without much effort. \nMobile and native apps use the GPU a lot more efficiently. Since they have a lot more information about which controls are being used, they can recycle items a lot better and do a much better job at hardware acceleration via the GPU. Not to mention that you have access to raw graphics APIs in case you want to push UI performance even further.<p>Runtime Environment<p>You can build desktop apps in a plethora of languages and even for mobile apps you have many cross-platform frameworks. But building for the web(and electron) forces you to HTML&#x2F;Javascript(and derivates). Javascript is a dynamic prototypical language that was not designed for the scale of apps that are being built in it today. It has no type safety, memory leaks are common and it’s slow due to its dynamic nature. While there have been many efforts to improve performance like V8s JIT, it still lags behind a lot of major languages. WASM seems promising, but it’s still has a long way to go. \nAnd it’s laughable how weak the browser platform itself is. SQLite is available on raspberry pi, embeddable systems, mobile platforms and just about every other platform on the planet. You can store data, run complex relational queries and do more with so less. But it is not available on the most widely used platform on the planet, the browser.<p>With the rise of electron apps, big and bulky web apps have started making their way onto the Desktop.

And you code using regular text, which feels much better than colored boxes.<p>And Small Basic is still better than Scratch I think, even though it seems kind of abandoned by Microsoft.<p>[1] (notice: direct downlad) <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.microsoft.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;9&#x2F;0&#x2F;6&#x2F;90616372-C4BF-4628-BC82-BD709635220D&#x2F;Introducing%20Small%20Basic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.microsoft.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;9&#x2F;0&#x2F;6&#x2F;90616372-C4BF-4...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-16 16:55:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lacker"],"id":[22590296],"kids":[22590957,22592986,22590518,22592327],"parent":[22574222],"text":["I have tried this and basically all of the kids-programming methods I can find.

I get wanting to see better, but the problem with a lot of these aftermarket kits is that the really don&#x27;t improve visibility that much. The problems are twofold:<p>Fist, beam pattern, housing alignment, and lens clarity are <i>important<\/i>. If you throw HIDs or LEDs into a reflector housing designed for halogens, you&#x27;ll end up casting a bunch of light upward, high enough to be useless for long-distance road visibility at highway speeds at night. Yeah, you&#x27;ll see those reflective highway signs lighting right up all right, at a distance way too far for you to even read what&#x27;s on them. And if your headlamp lenses are dirty or hazed over, you could have the luminous output of the sun in each housing, and you&#x27;ll still only get a slight improvement in visibility for all the diffusion the lenses are causing. You would be amazed just how much visibility you can get by cleaning &amp; polishing your headlight lenses and making sure they that are properly aligned and putting out the correct beam pattern, all while leaving the light emitting devices themselves unchanged.<p>Second, the color temperature of these aftermarket kits often ranges from sub-ideal to outright wrong when considering the purpose of nighttime visibility. Most of the aftermarket kits I&#x27;ve seen on the road have had a very high color temperature -- very very blue, or sometimes outright purplish. Someone might think their car looks very stylish with such a headlight color, but they are actually working against how their night vision works. By my reading, the human eye is most responsive to light in the blue band for brightness perception. So, by that logic, it would make sense to turn the color temperature up, right? Well, only up to a point. Naturally, light is more bluish during the daytime. And outside during the daytime, one&#x27;s pupils end up quite constricted, so not to overwhelm one&#x27;s eyes. And so when someone drives around with headlights at 5000k, 6000k, 7000k, with all this bright blue light right there in the foreground in front of the car, they&#x27;re actually killing their night vision, and their peripheral vision, especially.  Everything in the path of the headlights might seem nice and bright, but anything outside of the center of the beam is going to be a lot harder to see than if they were running a much lower color temperature at equal brightness. And finally, in inclement weather, like fog or snow, all that bright blue light is more liable to get reflected back at one, blinding one. IMO, 5000k and up is too high of a color temperature. 3000-4000k is ideal.<p>I personally would love to start seeing more enforcement of the existing laws on the books regarding headlight beam patterns. Because if there isn&#x27;t, then it seems likely to me that there will be new laws passed that make it harder to get any aftermarket retrofit kits or do any DIY retrofits, period, even if one&#x27;s retrofit were otherwise completely compliant with the existing rule as to beam patterns et. al. I really hope that those who are being irresponsible with aftermarket LED headlights don&#x27;t end up ruining things for those of us who are able and willing to do the research and take the time to do a headlight upgrade correctly, such that it is safe, legal, and actually useful."],"time":["2020-03-16 22:13:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jeadfa"],"id":[22650709],"kids":{},"parent":[22593604],"text":["Getting Your Travel Information , Travel Guides, Discover,  Plan, Destination information if you Love Travel .

Sorry if the messaging is unclear; we&#x27;ll work on it.<p>Allow me to tell you about Backstage in the form of a story. Assume you&#x27;re at a medium-to-large-sized company, in a team tasked with boosting developer productivity. You&#x27;ve developed a kick-ass pipeline to calculate test flakiness based on historical build logs and some data from your internal userinfo service. Problem is, userinfo has suddenly started exhibiting p99 response times in the 10s of seconds. It&#x27;s not feeling well.<p>You go to backstage.yourcompany.net and search for userinfo. You reach the overview page for the service. It shows a ton of information, some of it pertaining to who owns and operates the service. Apparently it&#x27;s the devcore team, they&#x27;re on #devcore-support on slack according to the page but they&#x27;re in the US west coast timezone so they&#x27;re asleep. Well you are using the PagerDuty plugin in Backstage so there&#x27;s a big &quot;page us&quot; button right there.<p>So now you&#x27;ve got the issues solved and you need to expose the pipeline output somehow. Cool, you go to backstage.yourcompany.net and click &quot;Create&quot;, and select one of the templates. It scaffolds a Go service in your GitHub org, according to your company&#x27;s best practices. All the builds and deployments are already set up and hot. You add some code to your service and shortly it&#x27;s up and running and serving the pipeline output with caching out of S3. You check backstage.yourcompany.net to see how all aspects of your service&#x27;s runtime status is looking. All good. Now, how do you actually get that useful data into your company&#x27;s other devs&#x27; hands?<p>Well you COULD make an entire microsite, or some CLI tool orrrr... Come to think of it, they are already all using backstage.yourcompany.net, and there&#x27;s already an integration in there showing all builds for all services, and it has all of the utilities and auth and bells and whistles already in place for you. So you make an internal backstage plugin. You find that it&#x27;s pretty much a matter of cloning your internal backstage repo, running a create-plugin script, and boom you are up and running. You add a data source feeding off of your new Go service, you add a column to the builds table ... and you have your own team review and merge it because it&#x27;s covered by CODEOWNERS. And everybody rejoiced and told you how useful this new column was to them. You start getting a bit famous on your internal Slack, actually.<p>Now you are getting greedy. You feel that actually, this plugin could be useful to the general public - as long as the build logs are in a known format, you can eat them. You start open sourcing the pipeline, and the service - and, critically, also the backstage plugin.<p>This is how things are internally at Spotify today. What we released here today is not this entire story yet, but we are lifting more and more out into the open at a rapid pace.

The virus has been named “SARS-CoV-2” and the disease it causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”).<p>Current diagnosis efforts of COVID-19 are primarily focused on symptomatic and&#x2F;or high risk individuals.<p>Verily, the Alphabet company focused on life sciences and healthcare, has offered to support public health efforts by providing its data collection infrastructure to help individuals understand their risk profile for COVID-19, help facilitate testing if indicated, and provide test results back to tested individuals in an efficient manner.<p><i>What will I need to do?<\/i><p><i>1) Complete a short survey.<\/i><p>This will include questions about yourself, including age, gender, home address, contact information, recent travel history, current health status, and any known contact with others who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.<p><i>2) For those deemed eligible for free testing with this program, schedule an appointment to go to a local facility to provide a test specimen.<\/i><p>Based on your survey results, if you are identified as eligible for testing under this program for COVID-19 disease, you will be asked to provide a biospecimen using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab.<p>• You will be asked to schedule an appointment at a local facility. You may be contacted directly to schedule this appointment or this may be facilitated through an app or web portal.<p><i>3) Go to the test facility at your assigned time for the test swab.<\/i><p>At the test facility, you will need to bring a form of identification to confirm your identity prior to performing the swab collection.<p>A trained healthcare professional will perform the swab collection.<p>• This will be done by having you tilt your head back while a trained healthcare member inserts a sterile cotton swab into your nostril towards the back of your nose. The swab will be inserted to a depth about the distance from your outer nose to the outer opening of the ear. Once inserted, it will be held in place for a few seconds then slowly removed with mild rotation. This may cause temporary discomfort.<p>• Your sample will be coded and associated with the data you provided in your survey.<p>Your sample will be tested by a clinical laboratory to determine if your sample is either positive or negative for SARS-CoV2.<p>4) Follow recommended guidelines based on results of your lab testing.<p>The lab results will be provided directly to you via email, text, phone call or through an app or web portal. The testing may take a few days and results will be returned to you when available.<p>In addition, results of your test will be provided to public health authorities, including the California Department of Public Health and potentially other federal, state, and local health authorities.<p><i>How will my data be protected?<\/i><p>Privacy is a top priority.<p>• Your data will be kept in a secure, encrypted database with restricted, monitored access<p>• This database complies with applicable state and federal laws that protect the privacy and security of your health information<p><i>Who will access my data and in what form?<\/i><p>Verily will have access to information that directly identifies you, including your name, street address, email address, and phone number. This information may also be provided to Verily’s contractors, the healthcare professionals who collect your specimen, the clinical laboratory that processes your specimen, he California Department of Public Health and potentially other federal, state, and local health authorities, and other entities that assist with the testing program. The information collected will be sed to perform the test, administer and improve the testing program, and for public health purposes.<p>In addition, your survey responses and test results will be provided to Verily, and may be further shared with the clinical laboratory performing the testing (for example, Quest Diagnostics), and public health authorities, including the California Department of Public Health.

The problem is, people living in these communal spaces complain about the lack of privacy or ownership. People don&#x27;t know what they want even when the answer is in front of them. Humans have conflicting individualistic needs and needs for companionship as well, the dual nature of our desires actually evolved under communal living spaces so in actuality, despite the fact that you desire privacy, you&#x27;re actually healthier if you give in to the alternative desire of companionship.

We&#x27;re not doing what we really want, we&#x27;re pleasing others.<p>Another area to dig into is True self and false self: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;True_self_and_false_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;True_self_and_false_self<\/a><p>In Social Psychology, related terms and concepts include self-monitoring, impression management (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faculty.washington.edu&#x2F;jdb&#x2F;452&#x2F;452_chapter_07.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faculty.washington.edu&#x2F;jdb&#x2F;452&#x2F;452_chapter_07.pdf<\/a>)<p>&gt; And they have good reason to: In a game theoretic way, unless they’re already inundated with social bids<p>Social Exchange Theory and CL-Alt covers this in greater detail: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smashtyn.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;social-exchange-theory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smashtyn.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;social-exchange-th...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-16 20:55:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rajlego"],"id":[22595396],"kids":{},"parent":[22594807],"text":["What he mentions about people being superficially nice to allow for more selectiveness is very interesting.

From what I can see, there&#x27;s a lot of consumers whose personal finances will blow up if the economy shuts for a couple of months. So perhaps what needs to be announced needs to be aimed at those types of people. Certainly people will protest if fiscal stimulus means just handing money to people and companies who aren&#x27;t in dire straights. How about a rent break or something drastic like that?<p>- The effect of systematic strategies should not be underestimated. By that I&#x27;m lumping passive index trading in with various forms of systematic rules based trading (my specialty actually). Things that hop on the momentum bandwagon will make the move more extreme. They will also tend to whipsaw on reversals. There&#x27;s also risk parity funds, which now need to reposition based on risk being higher.<p>- Also you have to figure on short options players getting blown up on this kind of thing. (Vol trading was my other specialty). Basically what I mean is in recent years it&#x27;s been quite enticing to simply sell options to pick up premium, which normally is a bit too expensive in relation to the expected volatility (ie it seems smart a lot of the time). Of course nothing is free, and when there&#x27;s a blowout the short gamma guys are also pushing the market the wrong way.<p>- There&#x27;s at least one major investment bank that thinks this will end soon, markets to recover in H2, and no systemic risk. (Got that from a friend chain so grain of salt.) Not sure what to think, since this is more a question of how politicians will respond than ordinary day-to-day reading tea leaves.<p>Interesting times."],"time":["2020-03-16 15:05:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["VBprogrammer"],"id":[22592700],"kids":[22592829,22593162,22593010,22593503,22592965],"parent":[22592499],"text":["Every time I see one of these articles I&#x27;m reminded that it was only just over a month ago I had a conversation on here with people suggesting that taking a 7 year car loan to buy a car and using their saving to buy mutual funds was a sound financial decision.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how quickly the whole world can be flipped upside down."],"time":["2020-03-16 14:58:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["adrianN"],"id":[22592640],"kids":[22592723,22592755,22592744,22592867,22593255,22592717,22593029,22594089,22592714,22592665,22593152,22592952,22592715,22592695,22593146,22592713,22592670,22593025],"parent":[22592499],"text":["I don&#x27;t understand this at all.
