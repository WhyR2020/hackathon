It is an\neasy mistake to make, because reasoning is indeed at the core of most intelligent behavior. However, intelligent behavior can arise through other mechanisms as well.

Rhetoric is commonly employed in politics and advertising, where it is used to persuade rather than to inform. Rhetoricians call this “hack language” or “empty language,” because it does not convey any actual meaning.<p>I have trained myself to recognize hack language, and to produce it as well. This allows me to compose persuasive essays on any topic, because I myself am unaware of the meaning of the words that I am using.

This may be because, on some level, you believe that computers cannot lie. I cannot either, technically, but I have just done so. How did I do this?

I&#x27;m probably going to be disappointed by this one, but I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic. Definitely the best 2020 news so far. HeXeN was one of most thrilling games of my childhood. It left a big impression on me. I even made a pretty creative balancing&#x2F;fun mod for HeXeN using the source port Vavoom. I lost the code in a hard drive crash though.<p>The game was far from perfect and there are good reasons it didn&#x27;t reach the popularity of DooM or even Heretic. What would you do to make HeXeN and HeXeN II more fun? Here&#x27;s my take:<p>1. Both HeXeN games suffered from unfun level design. It was nice looking, but confusing to navigate, especially switch hunting. You alternatively had adrenaline rushes and pixel hunting. I think both provide a different experience and doesn&#x27;t mesh better than Chess Boxing.<p>2. HeXeN classes don&#x27;t really have distinct playstyles. They&#x27;re all shooters at core except for Warrior&#x2F;Paladin. More could be done to diversify them. In particular, no late game weapon was meant for up close.<p>3. The game is too linear and not very modular in its level design. You can warp to any Heretic level and start slaughter from that point. It was a legacy of DooM design which was originally meant to play with limited lives, arcade-style.<p>4. HeXeN 1 was notorious for &quot;haha, you die!&quot; traps that required either foreknowledge or LIGHTNING reflexes to dodge.<p>5. Low enemy variety compared to DooM 2. You kept fighting the same few dudes over and over, and 4 weapon limit per class is... not a lot, even with Tome of Power.<p>6. They should limit the ability to hog inventory items, for example like in Heretic where you can only carry 1 of each to next level.<p>7. HeXeN never rewarded people for finding secret rooms. It punished those who didn&#x27;t find them, because instead of goodies they had switches and keys mandatory to progress.

Reference capabilities are really great, but they have this weird special syntax around them, and they&#x27;re all termed in a very unique way.<p>I very much want a language like Pony because, as this talk demonstrates, it&#x27;s doing some incredibly cool and powerful things. But it&#x27;s pretty confusing.<p>Rust types like Arc, Mutex, &amp;, &amp;mut, and affine, have been wayyyy easier to learn for me because they aren&#x27;t totally new concepts - I know what Arc is, Mutex, references are, moves are new but that&#x27;s just one thing and it wasn&#x27;t too crazy coming from C++. I know how to convert between these types because they&#x27;re regular structures, with methods and documentation like all other structures. This is in really direct contrast to my experience with Pony where I had to learn like 6 new keywords, try to map them back to my own reference model, and, worst of all, trying to remember the strange incantation to map between them. I bet this is a &quot;learn it once&quot; thing, and it would be fine if that were the <i>only<\/i> new thing, but it&#x27;s not - there are object capabilities, actors, learning the runtime&#x2F;GC, learning new libraries, etc - there just isn&#x27;t enough complexity budget in my brain for all of these things.<p>I contrast this with Rust, which people consider quite hard to learn, and Pony has just been way, way harder. It&#x27;s a little &quot;too good&quot; - nothing in Pony is unjustifiable, like not having assertions&#x2F; failures, but I really want those things! Division by 0 is a perfectly fine thing to define as returning 0, I seriously don&#x27;t even care, but it&#x27;s just one more straw.<p>All in all, I was so hooked on learning Pony at first, totally enamored, and then I just found that I couldn&#x27;t justify putting in the time.<p>I ended up writing an actor library inspired in part by Pony for Rust, using macros, and I&#x27;ve been fairly satisfied - though there&#x27;s much more Pony offers, by far.

I feel way more tired and mentally exhausted from remote work, and casually I’ve noticed many, many more arguments and short fuse communication issues with everyone in my company.<p>I think it speaks to the evidence that the most cost effective office environments for knowledge workers, even in dense urban centers, from the point of view of pure short term cost savings to the company, are environments where every individual knowledge worker has a private office with a door that shuts, combined with separate communal workspaces for the extreme minority of people who either need a mix or need more extraverted &#x2F; social work environments instead of quiet &#x2F; private workspaces.<p>That way meetings naturally happen in person and it’s low-cost to setup meetings, grab coffee together, grab lunch, etc., while still preserving the remote work benefits of privacy and quiet.<p>Unfortunately though my experience working remotely has taught me that avoiding a commute is deeply not a good reason to be remote, because the costs in terms of worse work experiences and worse communication are way too high."],"time":["2020-09-07 20:54:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["theodric"],"id":[24402365],"kids":{},"parent":[24401246],"text":["Looks like I&#x27;ll never work at Netflix!"],"time":["2020-09-07 22:12:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Rafuino"],"id":[24403394],"kids":{},"parent":[24401246],"text":["&quot;Politics is tough because in many ways people elect people who lie a lot.

I am also someone who has been on the receiving end of bullying and (rarely) on the dispensing end, but I feel that the premise of this article is wrong. The reason why people did not care about the highway of death is because 1) it happened a long way away 2) people like us, from our side, did it 3) very few popular faces said it was wrong and 4) it happened to people we don&#x27;t care about very much. These views can be summed up as parochialism, and they are usually the reason that we allow evil to be perpetrated against the innocent.<p>It&#x27;s also the reason we allow the poor of the world to starve (c.f. Living High and Letting Die, Peter Unger) which I don&#x27;t feel can be construed as bullying. A similar example is the behavior of the allies immediately after the second world war, who apparently did little to acknowledge the Holocaust.<p>My view differs from David&#x27;s in that I don&#x27;t think we seek to justify bullies because we think they are better than their victims - I think we seek to justify bullies because we don&#x27;t care very much about other people, due to lack of time and energy.

I couldn&#x27;t get emacs to play nice with syntax highlighting modern front end. I could get JSX highlighted OR I could get TypeScript highlighted. Not both. I started using WebStorm and discovered that the emacs keybindings were pretty good! Not perfect but the best I&#x27;ve found outside of emacs. And the refactoring! So nice, so convenient.<p>I still used emacs for various languages. Ruby, Python, then some Rust. I wrote a solid amount of Rust in emacs. But then my Rust projects started growing, I started wanting automatic refactors and good type info. A couple times setting up language servers on emacs had chastened me. So I switched to IntelliJ Rust. And damn, it&#x27;s really nice. Same decent emacs keybindings, with really good language tooling. I can see the inferred type of a variable while I&#x27;m typing it out. I can refactor without having to run cargo all the time.<p>At this point I use emacs for writing blog posts, Python&#x2F;Ruby, and config files. That&#x27;s it. Oh and debugging wasm binaries.

Multiple cursors mostly work but aren&#x27;t the first class citizens of IntelliJ.<p>If I had to provide a thesis on why emacs is failing me, it&#x27;s because emacs was designed to manipulate text.

It is very practical to debug keybinding issues and I wish more editors had it. Other editors feature <i>similar<\/i> stuff, but not quite as good as this <i>echo mode<\/i> for keybinding.<p>Btw, for Doom Emacs this is accessible through the help interface.<p>`SPC h k &lt;key combo&gt;` will open up the manual page for that function, with a description, list of keybindings, argument list, and at the bottom, full code listing where you can jump to references including callers&#x2F;callees and examine the code in-situ if you need.<p>`SPC h b b` will allow you interactive search through Doom Emacs bindings and bring up the same as above, and `SPC h b` exposes other neat things like keymaps for the current major-mode, etc.<p>---<p>Honestly, I have been using Vim constantly in various forms -- GVim, Vim, Vi, ex-vi, Neovim, etc. (Even ex and ed(1) for a little period) for about 8 years. I discovered Doom Emacs this July, and gave it a few hours. Then I kept on giving it a few hours. A week later I hadn&#x27;t boot up vim for a week. With Vim, there was always a barrier around writing extensions -- it never really felt like it was <i>meant<\/i> to be integrated with them. The single best Vi experience I&#x27;ve had wasn&#x27;t with Neovim, it was with ex-vi. There were some sharp edges but the interface felt orders of magnitude more clean than I was used to.<p>I had tried Emacs before but Spacemacs was poorly integrated -- I tried using package-install and I was dumped into a buffer with no evil-mode bindings. And learning Emacs was a hilarious nightmare. Just look at these amazingly terrible commands to know how horrible that was[0], the last straw was when I tried to undo using `C-x u` (I think?) and it undid one character at a time!<p>Two things sold me on Doom Emacs - the support, and the feeling I get when using it.<p>* The support is amazing, I can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend how much the maintainer, Henrik, works at it. He has a well-developed system on the discord where you can hit up one of the assigned channels (how-do-i or troubleshooting are the main ones as a newbie), tag \\@helpme, and you will get seen quickly. He stays up until 2 am some nights answering support requests, and has put a lot of work into `doom doctor` so there are some rudimentary diagnosics included. It is by far the most pleasant and memorable support experience I&#x27;ve ever had with any piece of software in the 10 years I&#x27;ve been programming, and I have a <i>huge<\/i> amount of respect for him.<p>- The feeling I get when using it is harder to quantify. I&#x27;ll attempt to quantify the 4 or so years I spent digging into hacker history in the following comparison:  \n  - Vim - Editing becomes <i>muscle memory<\/i>, so you don&#x27;t need to think. You can sit down at a computer and be sure it has some variant of Vim that you can use almost like normal.  \n  - Emacs - The editor grows around you, as you customize it to your taste. You&#x27;re taking an editor built on a language, and altering the code, patching in improvements.

A few months down the road they said I wasn&#x27;t meeting expectations because of my &quot;time management&quot; which had too many meetings and lacked focus time for IC work - which definitely was not my 50%+ focus. I&#x27;m &quot;winning&quot; the resulting political war (my last 1:1 left my lead in tears), but only in the limited sense that I&#x27;m not getting fired; it&#x27;s been a bit of a disaster for everyone.<p>The unclear expectations of what gets someone an EM role and what is expected of that role is the root of my problem, some of the author&#x27;s, and a lot of the industry&#x27;s as a whole.<p>Leaders are picked from those that are truly focused on tech and truly excel at it... and then told not to do that. How can somebody be &quot;intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome&quot; of tech work and then suddenly be expected to stop doing it?<p>I should have been that rare counter-example in that I got picked for this role because of my very visible leadership in other areas. However, when it came time to give me the position formally they fell back on code output and found it somewhat lacking (specifically, the number of commits I made while onboarding was less than those of my established teammates).<p>There&#x27;s a school of thought that switching back and forth between IC and EM tracks lets you build a lot of knowledge and be both better manager and IC (the author evidently did). While I do think experience with each helps you do the other, there is a cost to that focus shifting. This isn&#x27;t like the cost of only being able to code in 45 minute blocks.  It&#x27;s the cost of shifting the things you care most about entirely.<p>Most managers fail to ever make that shift. Even if they manage to hold themselves back from coding (not all do), their heads remain in the code. One sign is when, in response to impossible expectations from above, they try to come up with technical solutions (e.g., if only we redesigned this module we could meet these impossible deadlines). If your mind is focused on tech, it&#x27;s the tool you use to solve every problem. Another example is when team members have no idea how to move their careers forward and don&#x27;t know expectations. A tech focused lead won&#x27;t be thinking about how a new project is actually the perfect challenge for a more junior employee; their head will be figuring out the best way to solve the task technically.<p>An EM is not a tech lead.
