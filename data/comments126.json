A large part of this preparation was realised through the unusual but effective way the country had organised its defence which was integrated into most parts of society. The system was called &#x27;Totalförsvaret&#x27; (literally &#x27;the total defence&#x27;) and integrated armed forces, civilian institutions and parts of industry into an organisational structure which was designed to be resistant against the loss of one or more of its arms. There were large stockpiles of material and supplies scattered around the country, these included amongst other 50 mobile field hospitals with 2100 respirators, fully equipped operating theatres, etc. The country had stockpiled food supplies which could last for a maximum of 2 years.<p>But... nearly all of this was disbanded, given away, thrown away, sold off or demolished in the years after the demise of the Soviet Union. The field hospitals went to the Baltic states, the respirators (new, unused) were given away or thrashed. The food supplies are gone, Sweden has gone from 2 years of supplies to about 16 days, i.e. whatever is in the distributor&#x27;s warehouses and on the road at the moment.<p>Before the 90&#x27;s Sweden had access to about 3600 respirators, now the number seems to be around 520 - seems to be because the &quot;government&quot; has decided this number is critical to the nation&#x27;s security and as such is not published.

Swedens largest ski resort Åre, an hour west of Östersund, has a bunch of Covid-19 cases that has spread through after ski parties (which has since stopped).<p>Some context to the article not relating to Covid-19:<p>Jämtland, the region where Östersund is located, is located in the geographic middle of Sweden, but is considered to be in the northern parts because the demographic of the country is heavily skewed south. In the west it borders Norway and in 1563–1677 it switched between being part of Denmark&#x2F;Norway and Sweden 13(!) times. Perhaps as a result of this there is still a strong sense of regional identity. Among other things Jämtland is a &quot;fake republic&quot; with a &quot;fake president&quot; which gives a speech during the music festival once a year. This is just in good fun and the speech is mostly about peace, love and understanding, but hearing 15k people singing the regional anthem &quot;Jämtlandssången&quot; after the speech always gives me goosebumps.<p>Östersund has always been strategically important militarily, in semi-recent times because the Soviet Union would have to pass it to take Trondheim in Norway and the harbor there. The article mentions the airbase closing down, but there were other military units that were disbanded as well. The article touches on this mentioning the university, but another reason the town is still successful today is that it also supported newly unemployed military personel in starting companies.

Not requiring any builds and utilizing the JS module graph are big ones.<p>The most important though is that the essential job of templates is to interpolate data into DOM. It&#x27;s much easier this by building DOM in JS, than by trying to access and transform data in HTML.<p>Templates need some kind of expression language. If the template is in HTML then you need to invent expression delimiters, the expression syntax and semantics, and a way to get data into HTML: HTML doesn&#x27;t natively have a way to refer to JavaScript objects.

This forward-looking component was not always an easy sell. I regularly drive one of the last sections of the original interstate system to be completed, I-25 between Socorro and Truth or Consequences. The existing US Highways serving this area received very little traffic and  work on the interstate did not even begin until the late &#x27;60s, due to a combination of the state refusing to expend the money and controversy over the bypass issue.<p>The bypass issue is an extremely important part of the interstate system. Because interstates must be freeways, it was extremely difficult to place them through towns, and so they usually &quot;bypassed&quot; the town. Especially in the west this had a devastating economic impact and lead to a broad trend of urban blight on roads which are former US highways. Late in interstate construction efforts were made to prevent this, but the problem was more or less intractable as not bypassing required a large amount of demolition.<p>At the same time, in urban areas there was an almost incredible enthusiasm for freeways. Modern Albuquerque has two freeways which more or less divide it into four quadrants. However, controversy around routing of I-40 during initial planning lead to a response of ¿porque no los dos? and at the peak of freeway mania plans included three east-west cross-town freeways (two of them barely more than a mile apart) as well as a beltway. Fortunately these plans were largely abandoned before construction, which is not the case in other cities in which construction was started before cancellation (for example, Portland&#x27;s &quot;Mt.

I&#x27;m a software engineer and she teaches fitness and dance.<p>Between us I think we&#x27;re doing okay. We&#x27;re not going hardcore on structure. We&#x27;re being relaxed on TV&#x2F;videogame time (we usually only watch TV on weekends for an hour at most and video games are usually played together). We swap responsibility around. I take breaks to horse around with the kids in the yard or go for a walk around the neighborhood. We share meal preparation, chores, etc. While I need longer stretches of focused time I also dedicate a part of the day for household distractions.<p>We&#x27;re also keeping the neighbors in the loop. Some of the parents, such as myself, have offered to take the kids out for a regular &quot;recess&quot; during the afternoon. We keep our distance as usual but go for walks, kick a ball in the field, count birds, have races, etc.<p>And at work I keep the team up to date on our situation. Everyone is in the same boat more or less. Some have high-risk dependents. Some have kids. Some are simply not comfortable working from home full time.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned about working from home for a period of about 5 years was: don&#x27;t worry about the structure of your day. Wake up at a regular time, work out if you can, and realize that nobody can see you -- only your results. You can find a routine that works for you and yours. I hope most employers are smart enough to know that for some people this may mean less output but it can also mean more. Flexibility and responsibility are key. As long as you&#x27;re communicating with your team I don&#x27;t see the problem of fitting work around life.

Most kids love them and it can keep them entertained for a long time and more mentally engaged than TV. Sometimes my kids just sit and listen, and other times they do other activities while they listen. Even if they get bored of the audio book, I&#x27;ve noticed they are much more likely to stay focused for long periods doing other activities like drawing or playing with toys if there&#x27;s an audio book in the background. You can find all the children&#x27;s classics in audio books. If you have an audible subscription, you can sometimes find whole children&#x27;s book series for a single credit (like 19 hours of the Ramona Quimby collection). You can also check them out of many municipal libraries online. Children&#x27;s podcasts are also good, and there are educational options there too.<p>You could also give them some screen time, but try to keep it more engaging. For instance, video calls with their friends(clearly won&#x27;t work long with the toddler though) or physical activities led by an instructor on the screen like kids yoga (Cosmic Kids Yoga is good) or dance.<p>Also, anyone who&#x27;s used to teaching dance, martial arts, physical training, music, foreign language tutoring, etc is really struggling now with the quarantines.

We&#x27;ll see some data when China attempts to relax restrictions.  I&#x27;d also assume that all the stuff folks normally do to for their kids for the summer period while they aren&#x27;t in school -- ie all the camps -- are basically not going to happen, so you&#x27;re going to be doing this until <i>at least<\/i> labor day.<p>As a cxx, we can &#x2F; are definitely expecting some choppiness over the next couple weeks while everyone figures out how things work with us all working from home with the entire family home.<p>Given the economic guesses above, an inability to put in a reasonable workday is likely going to be a problem for you given the length of time I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;re going to be doing this.

If you do that, you&#x27;ll have a lot more time for yourself.<p>I&#x27;ve got three young kids, and I&#x27;m in the same situation you&#x27;re in. I&#x27;ll spare you the long backstory of how I came to this conclusion, but over time I&#x27;ve learned that there&#x27;s a big gap between the amount of attention young children want and will ask for (which is effectively infinite) versus what they actually need to be happy.<p>The real problem is they&#x27;re humans, they don&#x27;t like being bored, they don&#x27;t know how to deal with it on their own, but they learn really fast that you are a great source of entertainment. Once I came to see the problem this way, I realized I needed to help teach and train them to self-entertain when they are bored. That turned out to be easier than I thought, and it helped _a lot_ with the problem of being able to get work done with kids around.<p>The best way I found to train them is essentially to create a suitable play environment (in our little apartment this is just the kids room, with anything I don&#x27;t want them getting into placed on high shelves in the closet), set out a small sample of toys or activity (like paper and crayons, or stuffed animals), and then just sit there. If you are more boring than the stuffed animals, they&#x27;ll start playing with the stuffed animals :)<p>Repeat this over time and they get much better at playing happily on their own for long stretches of time.<p>Note that the younger they are, the more you need to be physically around for this to work. If you just plop a toddler in a play pen and leave, they&#x27;re not likely to make it very long, because they also have separation anxiety and don&#x27;t like being alone. They need the reassurance of an adult (or older child may also work) nearby to feel safe. But once they feel safe, their only problem is boredom. So by being around but extremely boring, you help them learn to solve this problem on their own.<p>Being boring doesn&#x27;t mean cold-smoldering the kids, just kind of politely humor them without really engaging. I&#x27;ve found that &quot;taking a nap&quot; is extremely effective - just sit and rest, they know what a nap is, they don&#x27;t  take it personally. Sometimes you even get an actual power nap in haha.<p>To some degree you also have to put up with whining and fussing during the adjustment period. They&#x27;re likely to feel frustration that their entertainment source has failed. Also, doing this training will probably be boring for you too. But the silver lining is once they start to play autonomously it actually becomes very entertaining to watch!<p>One last thought: as far as work goes, I think you (and your employer) will also need to accept that a strictly focused 9-5 schedule isn&#x27;t realistic. Young kids need help with basic needs (food, bladder, hygiene), and there&#x27;s nothing you can do that will get them to chill out autonomously for 9 hours straight. But if you teach them to self-entertain, even a toddler can go for 60-90 minutes, which is enough to get a lot of things done (and bigger kids can go longer).<p>The way I see it, I can either get up really early and knock out a ~3 hour focus block before they&#x27;re up, or stay up late and do it after they&#x27;re asleep. I generally prefer late. That&#x27;s my key productivity time, for things that require more than one full hour of dedicated focus to make good progress.<p>I know it&#x27;s hard.

The skills you learn in the simulator are 100% transferable to real life, and they happen without you having to think.<p>I went 9 years without using a sim and then two years ago started using it.<p>What gets transferred immediately are how you turn the steering wheel, catching the car in slides, and your gas pedal application while this is happening.<p>People often forget that our bodies are complex operating systems and they are operating distinctly. There is plenty of documentation that shows mirroring for knowledge transfer works, and when you use a sim the habits that you develop are available subconciously to you.<p>I&#x27;ll give you two examples, the first is at my last race in Global MX-5 Cup at Laguna Seca. At the start of the race on the opening lap I was going through the corkscrew and got hit at the apex of the right hand corner. The car immediately went into a large slide because of how much steering input I had. I immediately started to correct with both steering input and gas pedal application. I had to correct the two slides to save the car. Immediately upon impact my body was doing what I needed to do, it was completely subconscious, so much so that the only conscious thought I had was, wowee fun, just like the simulator. There was no fear, despite the fact that the slide was massive and I was likely to hit the wall if I didn&#x27;t catch it.<p>The second happened a couple of months earlier. I was testing at Sonoma in my BMW m235ir for a Pirelli race. I was going out on old tires, that we were going to swap for fresh ones at the next session. Going through the double right hair pin, I applied a bit too much throttle, car started to slide, I was correcting, but under corrected and went back to full throttle too soon. The car spun, hit the wall, caused $10,000 in damage. The reason that happened was whenever I played the sim I always kept my foot in the gas. Just trying to save the car and have fun. Then I realized, that when I use the simulator I can&#x27;t approach it from a &quot;fun&quot; mentality, because my brain is remembering what I&#x27;m doing. I have to treat it like real life, or I will do something stupid in the car.<p>There are certainly differences between how a real car handles and a simulator handles, but the skills are the same and what you are really honing is the ability to control the car which is completely transferable. The brake points are very transferrable so it is a great way to push yourself in a simulated practice to get ready for a real race. Learning the track is obviously a benefit.<p>iRacing has done a fantastic job at all of the above. Coming from a tech background I&#x27;m actually blown away by the realism and how much it teaches you transferrable skills.<p>If you take one of the top 5 people in iRacing that&#x27;s never been in a car before and put them into a race car they will be quick. This is because everything that will be happening they have already trained for. They won&#x27;t have fear because everything will feel the same. As long as you don&#x27;t have fear, and have the underlying skill, subconsciously you will do what you need to.<p>The reverse isn&#x27;t as true. Being quick in real life doesn&#x27;t mean that you will be fast in the simulator. This is simply because it can&#x27;t replicate the physics 100%. In iRacing it is very sensitive to understeer as you enter a corner, where in real life you can get the car to slide a bit more with some hard inputs into the steering wheel.<p>But overall I would say it is a 90%+ effective tool, so much so, that anyone who isn&#x27;t using one in pro racing today, is really at a disadvantage.<p>The other thing that is critical to racing is practice. Any sport you take seriously the more time you spend doing it the better you will be. Unfortunately racing is extremely expensive, and so no one but the absolute pros can spend as much time as they would like in a race car. Being able to hop on the simulator, at any time, is amazing to help you continue your training and stay sharp during the offseason, or at times like this when all racing is pretty much cancelled.<p>Anyone who is saying that this isn&#x27;t transferrable is simply incorrect. They&#x27;ve already taken pure sim racers and put them behind the wheel of real race cars and those people did phenomenally well.<p>There is more strain physically in a real car, g-forces, breathing, pulse will be higher, but these things are much easier to train for.<p>There is a reduced amount of feedback certainly, one of the biggest issues for me is not getting a great feel for the brake pedal, but this is where muscle memory comes in, you keep doing laps and refining and your muscles will recognize what inputs you need even though the g-forces aren&#x27;t there.<p>Furthermore I tried VR iRacing for the first time and it was insane how amazing the VR is. It is completely life like, just missing the rush of air around me.<p>I was at Road Atlanta doing laps and went through the last corner on my first lap. You come down a massive hill, hit the compression, and turn right into the fastest corner of the track where you also have walls on both sides that are very close. This is not the corner to fuck up. There is tremendous g-forces in this corner in real life. On the way down the hill I feel fine in VR. The second I hit the compression I get dizzy. This is because my eyes and everything around me is recognizing this part of the track and my body is tensing because it remembers real life. But my body isn&#x27;t feeling the compression. So the difference between what my eyes see, my brain interrupts, and the lack of sensation in my body is making my brain go haywire and makes me dizzy.<p>The first time I just thought it was odd. The second lap same exact thing happens. The third lap again. It happened every time I had to take the VR off because I started getting a headache.<p>Anyway those are my real life stories. If there is anyone on here racing or tracking their car I highly recommend they get a great sim and install it in their house. It will be a lot cheaper than tracking and infinitely less expensive than racing and it will tremendously improve your skills.<p>This is probably less relevant for top of the sport racers, but if you watch today&#x27;s youngest F1 athletes all of them do sim racing and all of them are extremely quick. Specifically Lando Norris and Max Verstappen."],"time":["2020-03-23 17:16:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["djaychela"],"id":[22661936],"kids":[22663237,22662042,22662253,22662765,22662358,22662379],"parent":[22658503],"text":["It&#x27;s definitely not circuit racing, but I had some experience in Rally driving for about 10 years.  Did mostly gravel stuff, and did the UK WRC round 4 times in a self built car.  Definitely low budget (and low talent!) stuff, but I think I have some experience and know how a car should handle on a loose surface.<p>I&#x27;ve never found a rally driving game that handles like a real car.  The physics always seems off - in Dirt Rally (the last one I tried seriously, and the one that everyone raved about), the car still seems to have the old physics of pivoting around the centre of the car, but whatever, it&#x27;s miles off.  The mini cooper in there is about the same power and weight as the Skoda Felicia that I drove, but it behaves nothing like it.  I wish it did, as I no longer have the money or time to do anything like this, and if it felt anything like the real thing I&#x27;d have a fun hobby to take part it.  But I always get hugely frustrated when I can&#x27;t get anywhere near what I used to be able to do - place the car with precision on the road, get a good rhythm up and start to flow, and don&#x27;t seem to be able to adjust to the way the cars handle in these games.

He is showing leadership that everyone wishes to see at the Federal level.<p>Having all of these laboratories in the state of NY makes me grateful every time I think about how much I pay in state taxes. But I can&#x27;t help to think about how all of the bloodshed is a direct result of the failure of leadership at the federal level to be proactive about the situation. There is nothing of greater importance than every individual human life. The federal government sacrificed these people and all the people who will suffer and die in the future in the name of better polling numbers, placating a fan base, and keeping stocks afloat for a mere month longer than they would have.<p>Edit: Moved 53% statistic into its own bullet. Don&#x27;t know know why I had it as a sub-bullet of the deaths statistic.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RjbIVnnMT18\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RjbIVnnMT18<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-22 21:54:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["robomartin"],"id":[22658741],"kids":{},"parent":[22657339],"text":["A couple of observations:<p>First, most of what’s out there in the media and popular discussion is nothing less than ignorant.  Sometimes I feel people watch too many movies and think they are real.<p>Under normal conditions it can take over a year to go from nothing to making something as simple as a certified N95 mask at scale.  Under normal conditions component lead times in electronics can easily be in the 8 to 16 week range.  Not to mention such things as manufacturing tooling, molds, test systems, etc.<p>Making hardware is hard for a reason. It takes time, and money can’t always accelerate the timeline.<p>And so, reporters pounding away at test kit, mask or PPE is ignorant and counterproductive.  Making 100 million masks in haste could result in ineffective masks that provide little protection.<p>This problem is exacerbated by a supply chain that has been the subject of major disruption.<p>The sad reality is, when you don’t control the entire supply chain you can only accomplish so much.  This is surely a lesson that might change the world post COVID-19.<p>Aside from that.  It seems to me converting cruise ships to temporary hospitals might be the quickest way to expand capacity.

You also want the skill of knowing when you <i>should<\/i> divert your attention. Otherwise, you end up going down a rabbit hole before you realized that you&#x27;ve been focusing on the wrong thing for a while. If you get stuck, it can be very useful to take some time away from the keyboard and let some other ideas float in and out of your working memory.<p>2) A key question to answer is &quot;What should I focus on?&quot; One thing that can make this much easier is if you have a way to find out from your team:<p>- Why does our team exist?<p>- Who are our stakeholders?<p>- What are our goals? Why do they help our stakeholders?<p>Getting this information can be quite difficult, depending on your company culture.<p>If you are feeling distracted while writing an essay, see if you can imagine that someone asked you a question on reddit.<p>3) Another useful question to answer is &quot;What does better look like?&quot; for any given task. Essentially, jot down a leading-KPIs for the next couple hours...or next minutes! This is one reason why writing automated tests is useful, even if they are only mental scaffolding that you refactor away before committing.<p>For writing, it can be helpful to do &quot;question-driven drafting&quot; where you write your first draft as a dialogue between someone who is confused and someone who understands. That lets you look at your explanations and treat &quot;does this seem like a good answer to the question I just wrote?&quot; as your leading-KPI to shoot for.<p>4) One thing that can impede deep work is when you intuitively suspect that your pursuit of your current goal puts other things you value at risk. This tempts you to keep checking on that thing, forcing you to shift attention. One approach to that is to tell yourself &quot;don&#x27;t worry about it.&quot; I&#x27;ve rarely found that approach valuable -- indeed, the knowledge that I&#x27;m just not handling a risk I&#x27;m responsible for makes me <i>more<\/i> tempted to check on it. I&#x27;ve found it much more valuable to set up something which would detect the risk for me and could shift my attention at that point. This is another reason why automated tests are useful.<p>But you can also just have a checklist that you add to as you go along and check at the end."],"time":["2020-03-22 18:26:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hhsuey"],"id":[22657272],"kids":{},"parent":[22646839],"text":["&gt; Rather than focusing on a list of things other developers have learned, and targeting that list, I humbly propose that a leading indicator of acquiring this kind of knowledge is “hours per week spent in a state of intentional deep work”.<p>So he&#x27;s just proposing that one should just spend time to cultivate those skills?<p>&gt; Imagine two equally knowledgeable early-career software developers.

They are distributed via the BGP protocol, just like how normal routing information is distributed. Once your server enters this blacklist, nothing can be done.

These domain names are entered to the national DNS root server as records with bogus IP addresses. It was used more widely than the IP blocklist, since it has zero cost to operate, but it can only block websites in the list and it takes time for the censor to be aware of a target&#x27;s existence.<p>* A naive keyword filtering system.<p>All outgoing international traffic is mirrored for inspection. A keyword inspection system attempts to match the URLs in HTTP requests against a blacklist of unwanted keywords. Rumors said the string matching was performed by hardware in ASIC&#x2F;FPGA, allowing enormous throughput.<p>* A TCP reset attack system<p>Once an unwanted TCP connection is identified by the keyword inspection system, the TCP Reset attack system fires a bogus RST packet to your computer, fooled by the packet, your operating system will voluntarily work against you and terminate the connection, saving the censors&#x27; CPU time. The keyword filtering system paired with reset attack was the preferred way to carry out censorship.<p>That&#x27;s all. The principle of operation was simple and easy to understand. So what were the options for bypassing it? There were a lot. To begin with, the blocked IP addresses were blocked, you could do nothing about it. But in the earliest day, accessing them was as simple as finding a random HTTP proxy server. Later, the inspection system was upgraded to match HTTP proxy requests. Then, you could simply play some magic tricks with your HTTP requests, like the example in the beginning, so that your request wouldn&#x27;t trigger a match. Around the same time, in-browser web proxy tools became popular, they were PHP scripts running on a web server that fetched pages. However, they became useless when the keyword matching system was upgraded to match the content of the entire page, not simply the requests (remember, few sites had HTTPS). At this point, all plaintext proxy techniques and HTTP request &quot;massaging&quot; techniques were all officially dead.<p>Some naive rot13-like techniques were later implemented to some web proxies, HTTPS web proxies were also a thing, but they saw limited use.<p>* New: A complete keyword filtering system - Inspect all HTML pages (Was: A naive keyword filtering system)<p>Another target to attack was the DNS poisoning system, sometimes all you needed was a correct IP address, since not all IPs were included in the blocklist due to the costs. Initially, all one needed to do was modifying one nameserver to 8.8.8.8. However, countermeasures were quickly deployed. A simple countermeasure was rerouting 8.8.8.8 to the ISP&#x27;s nameserver, continued feeding the same bogus records to you. Nevertheless, there were always alternative resolvers to use. So the system was upgraded to provide a DNS spoofing infrastructure - at the instant an outgoing DNS packet is detected, the spoofing system would immediately answer with a bogus packet. The real packet would arrive at a hundred milliseconds later, but it would be too late, your OS had already accepted the bogus result.<p>And ironically, even if DNSSEC was widely supported (it was not), it couldn&#x27;t do anything but returning an SERVFAIL, since DNSSEC can only check whether the result was true, dropping the bogus packet and accepting the true one was outside the capabilities of a standard DNSSEC implementation.<p>* New: A Real-time DNS Spoofing System<p>Better tools were developed later, that acted like a transparent resolver between the upstream resolver and your computer, that identified the bogus results to drop them, but the use was limited. Also, at this point, the IP blocklist has been greatly expanded. Even if a correct IP could be obtained, it was still inaccessible. Around 2008 or so, a special open source project was launched by developers in China - &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts list, whenever someone found a Facebook IP address that was not in the blocklist yet, one sent patches to the project. There were also shell scripts to keep your list up-to-date.<p>However, a &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts list was useful but its usefulness was limited. First, it was a matter of time before a new IP address was blocked. Also, a working IP address still was restricted by the same keyword filtering system.<p>* New: Expanded IP Blocklist.<p>Some people also realized that the firewall was only able to terminate a connection by fooling the operating system. Soon, iptables rules for blocking RST packets appeared in technical blogs. By ignoring all RST packets, one essentially gained immunity at the expense of network stability, as legitimate RSTs were also ignored. Soon, the censorship responded by upgrading the reset attack system, so that RST packets were sent to both directions - even if you ignored RST, the server on the other side would still terminate it. Also, RST was now &quot;latched-on&quot; for a limited time, when the first RST was triggered, the target remained inaccessible in several minutes.<p>* New: Bidirectional TCP Reset Attack<p>* New: &quot;Latched-On&quot; Reset Attack<p>When HTTPS was enabled, it was impossible to perform keyword inspection in the HTML pages - at this time, censor sometimes still wished to allow partial access, only triggering the block when detected a match. This strategy cannot be applied to HTTPS, since the content was all encrypted. Some people realized some popular websites supported HTTPS but not enabled it by default, such as Wikipedia. The Great Firewall responded by implementing a HTTPS certificate matching subsystem in the keyword matching system, when a particular certificate was matched, you were greeted by a TCP RST packet (this system has been removed later when HTTPS saw widespread use).<p>* New: Certificate-Based HTTPS Blocking System<p>At this point, around 2010, the only reliable way to browse the web was using a fully-encrypted proxy, such as SSH dynamic port forwarding or a VPN, which required purchasing a VPS from a hosting provider. SSH was more popular due to its ease of use - all one needed was finding a SSH server and ran &quot;ssh -D 1337&quot;, so that port 1337 would be a SOCKS5 proxy provided by OpenSSH. OpenVPN was reserved for heavy web users, since it&#x27;s more difficult to setup, but had better performance.<p>From the beginning to the 2010s, anyone who was using VPN or SSH can enjoy reliable web browsing (only be disturbed from time to time due to the overloaded international bandwidth). However, the good days came to an end when the Great Firewall implemented a real-time traffic classifier, it was first applied to SSH. It observed the SSH packets in real-time and attempted to identify whether an overlay proxy traffic was carried on top of it. The blocking mechanism was enhanced as well, now it was able to dynamically inserting null route entries when it decided that the communication with a server was unwanted. The IP blocking system was also improved, now it was able to collect unwanted IP addresses at a faster rate with help of the traffic classifier. If you used SSH as a proxy, after a while the connection would be identified, with all packets dropped, repeated offenses would earn you a permanent IP block. For VPNs, the firewall implemented a real-time classifier to detect OpenVPN&#x27;s TLS handshakes. When handshakes were detected, a RST packet is sent (or if you use UDP, all packets are dropped). Repeated offenses would earn you a permanent IP block as well.<p>New: Real-Time Traffic Classifier<p>New: Real-Time IP Blocking<p>New: Actively Updated IP Blocklist using Classifiers as Feedback<p>Traffic classifiers would later be expanded to cover HTTPS-in-HTTPS as well, so a naive HTTPS proxy wouldn&#x27;t work, and possibly have other features, it&#x27;s a mystery.<p>BTW, after Google exited from China, the HTTPS version was immediately blocked, and for HTTP, a ridiculous keyword blocklist was enforced and it generated huge amount of false-positive RSTs for harmless words, apparently a deliberate decision, preferring false-positive over false-negative. Eventually, all Google services had been permanently blocked. The IP block became extensive, major websites have been completely blocked, the unblocked sites were only exceptions. For most people, the arrival of widely-used HTTPS was too late and useless, since IPs were blocked. And as mentioned, SSH and VPNs were classified and blocked as well.<p>This was when a new generation of proxy tools started to gain popularity,"],"time":["2020-03-22 23:55:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["1996"],"id":[22656173],"kids":[22656426],"parent":[22654737],"text":["A simple countermeasure at the ISP level: a buffer to merge &#x27;www.you&#x27; to &#x27;tube.com&#x27;<p>A far greater danger is DPI that use statistical analysis to detect possible tunnels.

If you published them they would likely be lost in a see of other low effort comments, or if they were acknowledged-- not likely much more than comments that merely took an hour.<p>You don&#x27;t just see fewer multiday comments, you see essentially none at all.

Which to me is dubious. Our current system counts the production, deployment and detonation of a bomb all as positive production meanwhile not counting unpaid domestic work. I know economists don&#x27;t like to out a value to different types of services and goods because they feel they are putting a finger on the scale. But they are doing just as much by using a blind metric which ends up counting some work and not other.<p>2) It never cost adjusts growth. For example, all that wonderful growth in the midst of the 20th cwntury incurred significant externalities. The system we have now tries much harder to make producers realize their externalities. This curbs growth which is not necessarily a bad thing.<p>3) It assumes we can atomize historic growth and single out what things contributes to what. But this seems ridiculous especially how these factors interact and are not necessarily seperable. For example, we happen to live in a universe in which the movement of electrons can be used transmit energy and appropriate it to many tasks. The story of the 20th cwntury&#x27;s economy is very much the story of how we mastered this one property of nature. Electrification doesn&#x27;t just provide heat and light. It enables the transportation of water. It enables the construction of more and larger structures. It enables the creation of aluminum and plated metals. Aluminum itself allows many features of our world we take for granted. From airplanes to electronics. But does abundant aluminum lay at the feet of scientific innovations? In its infancy for sure but after some basic science it is widespread cheap electrification which allows us to mass produce aluminum. How much of that economy do we count to cutting edge science? It&#x27;s not easily disentangled from popular politics which allowed the mass construction of hydroelectric damns throughout the U.S. and other countries. There is a possible future in which for centuries, growth has slowed to something more than Renaissance levels but well below mid 20th century levels. In such a future we might look back at this period as the time we mastered the single most useful physical property of our universe and so of course it was an era of unprecedented growth.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re wrong. But every time someone from Bill Gates to NBER talks about this issue of growth, whether it has slowed, why it as slowed, how it can be increased, I just get this feeling that people are failing to realized what a unique time we live in.

Most things are calculated based on precise risks and probabilities so naturally we would opt for the least risky path. As a result, the system has evolved into favoring incremental improvements rather than explorations of uncharted territories that are much more riskier.<p>In scientific publishing, this metric is represented by an over-emphasize in citations which has become the main criteria those publications are now being evaluated based on. Novelty or a desire for new experience that can generate large and meaningful impact, or even simply playful experimental ideas are no longer valued as much. Citations quantity has become the main currency in scientific publishing, and understandably has also led the community to prioritize incremental improvements.<p>In the paper, it mentioned that many seemingly irrelevant or uninteresting new scientific discoveries initially took a long time for the community to understand its potential, but those very same discoveries would later lead to much bigger and more meaningful inventions, such as the gene-editing tool CRISPR we have today. It took 20 years for this to happen counting from the initial discovery, so this is where the disconnection occurred.<p>In that sense, there is a great need to help propagating those initial discoveries both in its magnitudes and speeds so that it can receive more attentions from other scientists and community. The novelty should once again be the main focus to drive motivations and inspirations. Scientific publications shouldn&#x27;t just prioritize on hard cold metrics like citations, but instead attaching more metaphors and new visions of future possibilities that can excite and propel both science community and public interests.<p>More than ever, people today are craving for that common naivety which used to connect everyone together into believing making the impossible possible.

As the article explains, the 8008 was designed for the Datapoint 2200 terminal. The 8008 was intended as a compatible replacement for the existing Datapoint processor, which was built from simple TTL chips.<p>To reduce the chip count, the Datapoint 2200 used a serial processor, which processed one bit at a time, so you had a 1-bit ALU among other things. One consequence is that you have to start with the low-order bit when doing addition, so you can handle carries. And for 16-bit values, you also have to start with the low-order byte. This forces you into a little-endian architecture.<p>Thus, to be compatible with the Datapoint 2200, the 8008 was also made little-endian. Unfortunately, Intel was very slow creating the 8008, so Datapoint had moved on to a parallel 74181-based architecture and didn&#x27;t want the 8008.
