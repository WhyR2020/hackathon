After the last US election there was some analysis and discussion of Google&#x27;s youtube recommendations engine which appeared to show a strong bias towards conspiracy videos, which in turn led to videos that generally promoted Trump over Clinton. Now, I&#x27;m not American, and don&#x27;t care who your president is, but it was around this time that I realised youtube&#x27;s search engine had become pretty useless for me. Since then I only use youtube for watching tutorials or technical talks (and old TV shows that are hard to find elsewhere). I try to avoid the search engine and recommendations altogether.<p>Ok so that&#x27;s the why, now what&#x27;s this simple test? Just search youtube for CERN and note the mix of results. I found that most of the results could be categorised as either pro-science or anti-science&#x2F;conspiracy.  In an ideal world I would expect to see the official CERN channel at the top, followed by sciency videos about CERN, and finally the fringe conspiracy videos about wormholes to other dimensions and such. It&#x27;s fun to use tor to see how the results vary by country. The last time I did this was 2017, and I don&#x27;t have the data to hand, but it was roughly 70-80% of results in the first few pages where conspiracy related.<p>Here&#x27;s a screenshot of my result in 2017 when I&#x27;m logged in. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;28928495&#x2F;71557922-17e1b780-2a45-11ea-84de-93a9725dc6af.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;28928495&#x2F;71557922-...<\/a><p>I just had a quick look now and my first impression is that results have certainly changed and improved, but it&#x27;s a mixed bag.

But what I&#x27;m looking at is a bit more subtle than pretending to have written a paper.<p>In several fields, you get someone popularizing certain topics and observations. Some guy will write a book about economics or psychology with some compelling storytelling, and many articles will be written reviewing the books. But actually nothing new has been added. It&#x27;s simply a rehash of a few well worn ideas from an area. Importantly what can also happen is something that was considered marginal is brought up (Marxist&#x2F;Austrian economics) as accepted mainstream. Or something with weak reproducibility (Marshmallow) is brought up as the accepted truth. Nothing that&#x27;s a complete lie, but you get a picture of a field that is quite different to what the experts see it as.<p>The fact that they aren&#x27;t making up complete lies is what makes them hard to critique. If someone comes up with a list of studies that seem to support some tenuous case, it becomes quite hard to rebut them without seeming quite pedantic. For instance you might need to dive into the methodology of some survey to understand the critique, but the soundbite culture of our times does not permit that.<p>Often the person writing these books is portrayed as someone very authoritative, and certainly that makes sense for the publisher. They get in the news, they give commentary on relevant news items, and the circus continues. They never really have to defend their positions, because they&#x27;re always a sort of conduit for some other historical authority figure.

What may be critical is thus not only age but &#x27;state&#x27; of the galaxy, and we might find ourselves in the beginning of such a cycle (we sure accumulate enough particularities in the topology of our local spacetime, being both rich yet calm enough, to warrant the assumption that we&#x27;re currently &#x27;privileged&#x27; on average).<p>- We have no way to detect life in other galaxies. They could be swarmed by spaceships and interstellar spatian empires and we just wouldn&#x27;t be able to determine that. Thus basing the Fermi &quot;paradox&quot; on such a small sample (on the order of 10<U+207B>¹²) seems much too weak data. We simply don&#x27;t know. We actually can&#x27;t properly observe ours yet, especially behind the core, generally in the alignment of the disc. We are just now discovering that said disc is distorted and there are remnants of jets above&#x2F;below us[1]. There are hundreds of galaxies in our local Andromeda-Triangulum region, huge gravity streams, and we&#x27;ve only begun to grasp that in the last few decades... It&#x27;s still very, very early in our observations of the cosmos.<p>I think it&#x27;s good to ponder such questions and raise apparent &quot;paradoxes&quot;, go science! — but to draw any conclusions based on weak data and conjecture of a perceived (read: biased) mean is, IMHO, rather foolish, way too premature at best. Not hubris but wishful thinking, belief, opinion. So let it be that, humbly, defusing the anxiety.<p>In the grander scheme of things, we&#x27;re not much better off than the Ancient Greeks when faced with this question. Give it another thousand years, and then I&#x27;d expect a whole other level of questioning. Not 10 or 20 or even 100, if we are to tackle that kind of scale — we need infrastructure for this, in space, way beyond the solar system (think telescopes, probes, not even manned missions).<p>The ultimate problem with time is not evolution (of us, of science, of tech), it&#x27;s information travel: e.g. if we were to use the thickness of the Milky Way to set up telescopes, at ~1,000 LY, it would take half that time to transmit pictures to a central aggregator. 5 centuries for your next picture, I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ll be able to commit to such transgenerational projects without huge changes in our biology (lifespan, mindset, whatever but huge, enough to make us a different species).<p>Until we&#x27;re able to do such things, grow such infrastructure, gather such meaningful data, we&#x27;re just too small to even <i>look at<\/i> the cosmos.

We were successful in the end, but it was a LOT of hassle.<p>So, when you switch on &quot;OEM unlocking&quot;, you get a warning that it&#x27;s &quot;for protection against thieves&quot;. Like, a thief would steal your phone and it&#x27;s encrypted and locked, but because &quot;OEM unlocking&quot; is off they can&#x27;t simply wipe it and reinstall to re-sell, or something. So to them it&#x27;s a brick and therefore they wouldn&#x27;t have stolen your phone I guess. Except if they spend some effort they can totally cleanly reinstall the thing, it just takes more steps.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing some part here about how this &quot;OEM unlocking&quot; option supposedly protects against theft, but for me it was a simple sum. Number of times my phone got stuck in a boot loop: 3, number of times my phone got stolen: 0. So I set that to unlocked, now I&#x27;ll have an easier time if I ever mess up my phone again.<p>The only real reason I can think of is that they WANT your phone to stay bricked&#x2F;bootlooped when it&#x27;s bricked, and be unable to fix and repair it. It has nothing to do with theft, it&#x27;s just a way to make sure the device stays disabled when it&#x27;s disabled, and to make you buy another new phone.<p>Additionally, I got nothing but happy comments about LineageOS from my friend. You can really tell in the feel of the entire system the difference between what it means to be a user (normal software) or to be the product (like in Android or any of the Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Apple systems). Just by what options you&#x27;re given and the fact that applications actually behave <i>at your service<\/i> instead of nagging you while you&#x27;re trying to accomplish a task. I&#x27;m not really happy about how Android 9 is running on my moto-g6, so I think I&#x27;m gonna make that switch soon as well.

TLDR; I hate companies like Sonos. They add no value to people who know about audio. \nYou see, everything about speakers is really simple. From the way they work to the way they&#x27;re made. There&#x27;s really just 4 pieces to make a speaker system. The speaker, power supply, amplifier and a pre-amplifier to modify the sound (eg. DSP, Equalizer, etc.)<p>That&#x27;s why if you search on the used market today, you&#x27;ll still see equipment from companies like Aiwa&#x2F;Sony from the 80s and 90s simply because these speakers can be re-used even now as you can connect anything to them before the pre-amplifier and they&#x27;ll still reproduce your source (iPod&#x2F;TV&#x2F;Computer&#x2F;whatever). I posses a 40 year old Aiwa system that still functions flawlessly today like brand new. This is also possible today because speakers themselves can last so much longer. More than 40 years as you can tell.<p>All companies like Sonos do is add just another layer before the pre-amplifier stage - which is to make the speaker &quot;smart&quot;. This is usually all those wifi chips and bluetooth and Google assistant and what not. This is the proprietary part of their system. Normally, you are able to throw away this proprietary part and still use the speaker system. But, in pursuit of more sales, to reduce the lifespan of a perfectly fine speaker system to simply increase revenues is the most hardcore, cruel thing one can do.<p>Sonos&#x27; speakers are so bad that many models aren&#x27;t even serviceable. Meaning, you can&#x27;t open them like you could on those Aiwa&#x27;s and Sony&#x27;s and put them back together. Once taken apart, they&#x27;re useless. They use tons of glue, proprietary shaped screws sometimes even wire the speakers in such a way that they&#x27;ll damage the units if you try to take them off. They purposely do this so their speakers can&#x27;t be used anymore without damaging the appearance.<p>That&#x27;s why I will any day buy a mediocre music system from Sony or LG than buy trash like Sonos. First of all, I know the quality of components they use is not that great. They use ordinary stamped steel, sometimes plastic baskets for their driver units as opposed to high quality aluminium construction. Paper diaphragms too. Their units don&#x27;t even have proper crossover circuitry in some models. And besides, the drivers they use are actually based off rebranded generic Chinese, just tweaked a bit. They&#x27;re very good at fooling people pretending to be an audiophile company. In reality, they&#x27;re not even half as close to the stuff from the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.<p>So, having ranted this, there&#x27;s literally no reason to support such terrible ethics backed company simply for the sake of their profits. Fuck Sonos and get a Sony (or whatever else you like that doesn&#x27;t do this). This is not just for the environment, but to set a full stop to such terrible practices.

A profound little philosophy book from Japan, communicating the psychology of Alfred Adler - a rival of Freud. Told as a conversation between an angry student and a patient teacher. A little book so good that I rushed home from other activites to keep reading it, and finished in a day. A surprisingly fresh perspective on how to live.

Small Gods, Terry Pratchett (this might actually be more than 10 years ago, but I&#x27;ll still list it)\nI really like this one because it emphasizes the value of caring about the _core_ of anything instead of the _trappings_ that will spring up around it. Keeping this book in mind reminds me to focus on the thing instead of the appearance of the thing.<p>2. On Writing Well, William Zinsser\nI&#x27;m a programmer, and I&#x27;ve often found that improving my ability to write clearly translates directly to programming well: On Writing Well is the best – and warmest – book I&#x27;ve read on writing nonfiction.<p>3. Incerto, NN Taleb\nThis series forced me to revisit several assumptions. Something that still resonates is valuing anything – particularly books – that has aged well across several years, because it&#x27;s clearly valuable; and to discount the new shiny.<p>4. The Pragmatic Programmer, Andy Hunt &amp; David Thomas\nI started an open source project in my 3rd year at college – as part of Google Summer of Code; inevitably every release would break something and I started hungering for skills that would let me create new releases _without_ breaking the world every time. I stumbled across the pragmatic programmer in my 4th year, and immediately started applying it on my project. This carried through to work and helped me a lot early in my career.<p>5. The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, Richard Hamming\nThere are so many gems in this book: from the emphasis on fermi numbers for quick approximations, to a simple demonstration of the distance covered by a random walk as opposed to the distance covered by choosing a direction, to asking the question: &quot;Am I working on the most important thing I could be? If not, why not?&quot;. He also predicted that great programmers will have one thing in common with great writers – clarity of thought.<p>There are some books I&#x27;m reading right now that I suspect will end up on this list: Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;center-for-the-study-of-intelligence&#x2F;csi-publications&#x2F;books-and-monographs&#x2F;psychology-of-intelligence-analysis&#x2F;PsychofIntelNew.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;center-for-the-study-of-intellig...<\/a>) – for making better decisions with limited data; and The Power of Choice – to allow me to pay attention to the non-technical parts of doing valuable work."],"time":["2019-12-29 06:48:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["navidr"],"id":[21901503],"kids":[21903557,21907831,21901555,21901748],"parent":[21900498],"text":["The Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

I&#x27;ve read two of her books (Sense and Sensibility &amp; Pride and Prejudice) ~2 years ago. What they made me realise was that people are not absolutely good or absolutely bad. Human character consists of so many <i>gray areas<\/i> (as americans or...

I&#x27;m not in a position to fully understand and appreciate this book, but I just want to share a few quotes[0] that stood out for me when I read it:<p>&quot;<i>The subliminal ego is in no way inferior to the conscious ego; it is not purely automatic; it is capable of discernment; it has tact and lightness of touch; it can select, and it can divine. More than that, it can divine better than the conscious ego, since it succeeds where the latter fails. In a word, is not the subliminal ego superior to the conscious ego?<\/i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Under this second aspect, all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness. This, too, is most mysterious. How can we explain the fact that, of the thousand products of our unconscious activity, some are invited to cross the threshold, while others remain outside? Is it mere chance that gives them this privilege? Evidently not.<\/i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>All the difficulties, however, have not disappeared.

Great book to understand the historical underpinnings of different regions in America.<p>Carrion Comfort by Dan Simmons (who wrote Hyperion). Great horror scifi book with a nice concept. Fairly long though.<p>Thwarting enemies at home and abroad by William R Johnson.

Such as that the world is going to shit (we&#x27;ve been doing great in reducing worldsuck), violence is increasing (it&#x27;s not), that most people on the planet don&#x27;t get vaccinated (globally, 90% of one-year-olds have some vaccination), etc. It provides practical methods to understand better how things work, for example the graph of world population growing exponentially in the past century is something that looks unsustainable, but the truth is that it&#x27;s slowing down (I think many people know this nowadays, the book is already showing its age two years down the road) and that families are getting smaller when health increases, irrespective of religion or geographical location.<p>Of course, we have an absolute emergency regarding our CO2 emissions and the ongoing 6th extinction event, that&#x27;s not what this book is about. The book just shows we&#x27;ve been doing great and how to get a better sense of reality and what&#x27;s important. I think it&#x27;s a positive and helpful foundation for putting the current status of humans on this planet into perspective.<p>In fact I think it would be really good if everyone did read this book. I&#x27;ve made a preview that includes part of the first chapter that you can use to make a decision whether this book is something for you, send me an email if you want to take a look (not sharing publicly because it&#x27;s in the grey area of fair use).

He has a lot of ideas that were ahead of their time (positive psychology, etc). You can see a lot of parallels between his ideas and modern Stoicism (although Russell criticized it elsewhere, I think he came to some of the same conclusions).<p>- Introduction To Mathematical Philosophy by Bertrand Russell. Another Russell one. I think this is probably the clearest and easiest to understand explanation I&#x27;ve ever read of the underpinnings of mathematical foundations. It&#x27;s written in a style that should be accessible to almost anyone with a high school education. He wrote it while he was in prison (for refusing to be drafted) during WW1. Apparently he left a copy of it to the prison warden.<p>- An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding by David Hume. This is worth reading because it is the motivation for basically all of modern philosophy of science (at least in the west). It&#x27;s also pretty easy to read and if you read it you&#x27;ll be able to more easily understand other books and papers that are responses to it.<p>- Turing&#x27;s Cathedral by George Dyson. This book should be required reading for every programmer or aspiring programmer IMO. I learned so much about the history of computing that I didn&#x27;t know before reading this. You will not regret buying this one.<p>- I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. Obviously everyone knows about GEB, but he also wrote a shorter follow up that in my opinion expresses his ideas much more clearly. I think that even if you disagree with him, it&#x27;s worth reading because there are so many things you can take away from this book. For example, he talks about his wife&#x27;s death, and ties that into his theory of mind and explains the unstated purposes of why we have funerals&#x2F;wakes for people.<p>- An Introduction to Information Theory by John R. Pierce. For someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really have a very strong math background, this was a very clear intro to the ideas behind information theory, and why they&#x27;re important historically. I would recommend this to anyone who feels like they need a gentle intro to the ideas and motivation for them. Dover mathematics books in general are great.<p>- Borrow: The American Way of Debt by Louis Hyman. This is a <i>fantastic<\/i> historical overview of personal credit in the US that covers the past 120 years or so. I learned a ton from reading this that I had no clue about.

This applies just as much to negative depictions of work&#x2F;life overlap, e.g. the obsessed cop whose wife is now divorcing him because of the job: the point isn&#x27;t that the overlap is &quot;good&quot;, that&#x27;s not the aspiration; the point is that the structure of these depictions represents the fundamental narcissistic fantasy: a fixed and clear identity-- a character-- seen by a potential audience.

I disagree that this is a good solution though. Of course it is more thorough, but it requires additional intervention&#x2F;setup, and not everyone has the needed expertise.

Today&#x27;s smartphone platforms have given a canonical ID to the user, and often their location. Location tracking is starting to become a really hot issue for the general public. I think its a gateway drug to digital security. The model of a dedicated secure device that uses external communications accomplishes a lot technically, but also &#x27;fits&#x27; comfortably in the habits of millions of people. Such a device could fit right in with phone, wallet, and keys, and it could be an ideal tool for storing your on-the-go crypto. People trust things they can touch and can audit.<p>The first team that can ship a universal, secure hardware wallet that &#x27;just works&#x27; for $50-$150 could sell 5 million units in a year. In 7 years there could be billions of them, selling for $10+ a unit; a consumable like a traditional wallet.<p>I would keep one on my person at nearly all times, and have it replicate state to another at home, and a third in some vault service (like a connected safety deposit box). They devices would establish a physical pairing by creating an irreversible key-pair on the hardware itself. The replication could be a sequential log (like mysql binlog or git), and the integrity of that log could be additionally verified by bringing the devices within close proximity. All that is to say, there needs to be a secure, peer-based way to mitigate inevitable loss, damage or theft of the physical device- without centralizing the data or losing state. It would do well to be dummy-proof and make fun sounds when performing the above pairing and verifying operations. Megacorps shouldn&#x27;t get to be in charge of syncing everything for us.<p>Let&#x27;s take back the autonomy that has been stolen from us during these awkward teenage years of a digitally-driven society, and this time let&#x27;s keep it in our own hands."],"time":["2019-12-29 07:29:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevewillows"],"id":[21901901],"kids":{},"parent":[21899254],"text":["Interesting to see a mobile hardware keyboard with a Dvorak layout."],"time":["2019-12-28 22:34:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bawolff"],"id":[21902492],"kids":{},"parent":[21899254],"text":["Interesting.

Those interested in exploring such alternatives need to provide the necessary development and packaging resources to do that work. Technologies such as elogind that facilitate exploring alternatives while running software that depends on some systemd interfaces remain important to Debian. It is important that the project support the efforts of developers working on such technologies where there is overlap between these technologies and the rest of the project, for example by reviewing patches and participating in discussions in a timely manner.<p>Packages should include service units or init scripts to start daemons and services. Packages may use any systemd facility at the package maintainer&#x27;s discretion, provided that this is consistent with other Policy requirements and the normal expectation that packages shouldn&#x27;t depend on experimental or unsupported (in Debian) features of other packages. Packages may include support for alternate init systems besides systemd and may include alternatives for any systemd-specific interfaces they use. Maintainers use their normal procedures for deciding which patches to include.<p>Debian is committed to working with derivatives that make different choices about init systems.

However, people nowadays need to train themselves in complete new fields multiple times in their lifetime and therefore we already have to teach ourselvs new things all the time and be able to proof that we are qualified in something without a university degree. So why a degree in the first place?<p>- Before we had the internet, digital books, online training courses and other learning materials at our fingertips one had to go to a different physical location packed with other students and learn a subject at a slower pace so that everyone could equally follow the topic. Today this is a waste of time. If one has access to all the learning materials themselves, then they can consume it at their own pace, possibly learn a 3 year course in a single year. Why slow yourself down unnecessarily?<p>- Experience &gt; degree. After the first 2-4 years of work experience nobody cares anymore about your initial degree, unless it&#x27;s medicine or law. Once you&#x27;ve worked, people are interested in your actual ability to deliver and after 2-4 years there&#x27;s enough data to convince someone how good you are.<p>- The more people have a degree, the less it&#x27;s something which makes you stand out. I believe that being different is the best way to stand out from a crowded and competitive market, no matter how. Basically you want to be part of the minority. If nobody has a degree, you want to have a degree, if everybody has a degree, then you don&#x27;t. People like to see something special in other people, if you can convince them that you know something without going through a lengthy programm like everybody else, then people will think you are smarter or something like that (even if it&#x27;s not true). This only works though if your in the minority. It&#x27;s the same pshycology which allows one person to charge 300% more than competitors and having the largest share of customers, because they think that there&#x27;s something inherently better about it.<p>- In many countries attending university means creating debt. There&#x27;s good debt and there&#x27;s bad debt. If I take credit to buy a property which has very high and real chances of drastically increasing in value, then it&#x27;s good debt, but if I take credit in order to learn something which I can learn myself and which after 2-4 years won&#x27;t even matter anymore, then it&#x27;s possible very bad debt.<p>I know someone who paid 150k for an MBA at a business school and I think the money was wasted. If you pay 150k on an MBA in business, then clearly the course material will be entirely wasted on you. 150k is good money that could have been spent so much better in other areas, like buying property and then see the value grow whilst receiving passive income through rent or investing in an actual business which you want to create after the MBA."],"time":["2019-12-28 12:26:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tamaharbor"],"id":[21896601],"kids":{},"parent":[21890872],"text":["If &#x27;free college&#x27; becomes the norm, it will become as valuable as what you paid for it - nothing."],"time":["2019-12-28 03:19:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["daodedickinson"],"id":[21898414],"kids":{},"parent":[21890872],"text":["Degree never helped me for shit.

You&#x27;re also in a quite restricted social group with only the professors providing contact with older, more experienced people.<p>- There really is nothing you can learn in college that isn&#x27;t public knowledge. At best you get a better idea of what the experts think is important in a field. So for instance I didn&#x27;t read Marxist or Austrian economics.<p>- Nobody is going to know whether you did that advanced course on category theory for coders. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s both interesting and relevant, but you have more time to learn this yourself, when you&#x27;re not being judged by an exam.<p>- You&#x27;ll also learn things better when you&#x27;re not constantly thinking about proving it on an exam.<p>- Everything is college is really an intro. A really evil one where you&#x27;re asked to fly over some field and then get asked some very specific questions when it comes to exam time.<p>- Of course there are things that really are work relevant at college, especially programming related stuff. It&#x27;s hard to know what they are as a novice, but looking at it now it seems anything where you&#x27;re in the practice of using a repo and iterating a solution is what you&#x27;re after, or using common tools like git or tmux (there&#x27;s a lot).

Having said that, the main change I&#x27;d make to this and other similar games is to have an option to limit and adjust the number of actions the AI player can perform on each turn.

Not only would the AI&#x27;s turns take ages, but on my own turn it&#x27;d take me a long time to catch up, figure out what the AI did and play accordingly.  Another, additional option would be to limit the number of units and&#x2F;or cities the AI player (or maybe all players) can build.
