The original idea was that the entire memory would essentially be a single address space, with segments being blocks of memory that might be in core, on disk, or on tape (called very slow storage if I remember correctly but it’s been decades). Security was at the segment level, so you could for example have (in posix parlance) an suid shared library that an ordinary program could, with appropriate authentication and permissions, call into in a controlled manner.  Multics’ permission structure was more fine grained than the binary of suid.  You can see how the backup system kind of falls out of this automatically.  I trust some multician will step up and correct any memory-corruption-based thinkos in the above.<p>Of course reality didn’t quite match the dream and Multics was cancelled before some of that research could be completed.  But if you look at the x86 segment registers they could implement something like that.  I think this was also in the intel iapx-430 but fortunately even the name of that ancient dead processor is hazy in my mind.<p>As for the alto filesystem and its descendants: the labels don’t have to be next to the blocks they describe.  After all Unix filesystems have multiple copies of their basic breadcrumbs at least.  There’s certainly plenty of room for these in modern storage systems; every modern drive, whether  spinning or ssd, does a small amount of this in block remapping and wear leveling."],"time":["2020-09-09 04:24:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tyingq"],"id":[24413419],"kids":[24414087,24414860,24419962,24420171],"parent":[24412970],"text":["Was surprised not to see the VAX&#x2F;VMS filesystem on the list.

This won&#x27;t show up in onload or first meaningful paint, etc. So the first paint is fast, but then if you try to scroll immediately afterwards you&#x27;ll probably hit some jankyness while the rest of the page loads asynchronously (but only kind of asynchronously since there&#x27;s a single main thread).<p>Some other things that could cause the regression are that more people own a budget Android phone now than before. People may not realize how slow these phones are. The single core performance of the top budget phone, the Samsung A50, is comparable to an iPhone 6 which came out in 2015."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:43:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rhizome"],"id":[24414635],"kids":[24414817,24414885,24415250,24415393,24414736,24418482,24415431,24417943,24418410,24415144,24415306],"parent":[24413705],"text":["Yes, demonstrably and provably.

A part of the article acknowledges that this all depends on the device, etc., but this is ignored in the conclusion!<p>Let&#x27;s say that, as a first approximation, the first set of quotes is correct. I think most developers who look at user experience with respect to latency or performance today (or even ten years ago) would agree that we should not only consider the average and that we should also look at the tail. If we do so, we see that device age is increasing at the median and the tail, quite drastically in the tail even if we &quot;only&quot; look at p75 device age: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;android-updates&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;android-updates&#x2F;<\/a>.<p>If we consider a user who&#x27;s still using a 2013 Galaxy S4 and ask &quot;does your phone feel 5 times faster than it did in 2013?&quot;, based on some js benchmarks improving by 5x, I think they&#x27;ll laugh in our face. I&#x27;ve used a couple of Android devices that I tried to keep up to date (to the extent that&#x27;s possible on Android) and each one became unbearably slow after taking some big Android update. Those updates probably included improvements in the Android Runtime as well as V8, and yet, the net effect was not positive. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this -- if you read any forum where people discuss taking updates for the phones, one of the most common complaints is that their previously usable phone became unusable due to performance degradations caused by the update.<p>Sure, my personal user experience on my daily-driver phone is ok on my phone because I have very fast phone and I&#x27;m often using it from fast wifi. But it&#x27;s terrible if I take a road trip across the U.S. and the experience is terrible anywhere in the U.S. with an old phone. I don&#x27;t think we should just write off the experiences of people with old phones or who live in places where they can&#x27;t get high-speed internet even if life is good for people like me when I&#x27;m at home on my 1Gb connection. When I looked at this with respect to bandwidth and latency (inspired by a road trip where I found every website from a major tech company to be unusable, excluding a few Google properties), I found that, on a slow connection like you get in many places in the U.S., websites can easily take more than 1 minute to load in a controlled benchmark: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;web-bloat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;web-bloat&#x2F;<\/a>. My experience in real life (where I probably had higher variance in both latency, packet loss, and effective bandwidth) was that many websites simply wouldn&#x27;t load.<p>One thing this post looks at is the 75%-ile onLoad time. When I travel through the U.S. on the interstate (major throughfares which will, in general, have better connectivity than analogous places off of major throughfares) most pages are so slow that they don&#x27;t even load at all, so those attempts aren&#x27;t counted in the statistics! I don&#x27;t dispute that things are getting faster for the median user or even the 75%-ile slow user if you measure that in a specific way, but there are plenty of users whose experiences are getting worse who won&#x27;t even be counted in this stat that&#x27;s in the post because their experience is too slow to even get counted in the stats."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:40:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TeeMassive"],"id":[24416620],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":["&gt; Mobile page weight increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020.

The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.<p>I have family in an African country where the only reasonably priced home internet connection is about 56kbps over DSL (yes, dialup speeds over DSL, very confusing). Web pages have gone from very slow to unusable very quick.<p>I believe and appreciate that the users most people target have faster devices now, especially in the core hubs of Web development like Silicon Valley. However, this trend of &quot;we can fit more data in because devices are faster&quot; is horrible for anyone already behind in available technology or even on a limited data plan.<p>My father uses my old smartphone, a Oneplus One with the latest release of LineageOS. This device runs a Qualcom 801, a chip that was considered to have flagship speeds t the time of its release. WiFi speeds are over 100mbps, but websites and applications are still getting slow somehow.<p>Even a mid-range or cheap smartphone has a better GPU than older devices, and there are many of those out there. The advice to test on budget smartphones is solid, but people often go out and buy a new cheap phone instead of using something that was popular a few years ago. People who can&#x27;t afford or don&#x27;t see the value in getting a new S20 don&#x27;t necessarily have cheap smartphones, they often have second hand phones or hand-me-downs as well. Frameworks like Flutter and browser engines using canvas are very noticeably slow on those older devices because of the advancements GPU tech has made, as CPU tech improvements in smartphones have begun to slow down over the years.<p>Is the web slower? No, not for the people you want to sell your product to. The question is, why should we accept this bloat? Web applications can be as slow as you want to make them with festures and pretty designs for all I care, but the web in general doesn&#x27;t need two megabytes of javascript to render a manual or a forum post. The metrics discussed here are wrong in the context they were originally used in, so the article does have a point. However, I don&#x27;t think we should say the web hasn&#x27;t gotten slower because computers have increased speeds to compensate with the load. Every byte you save, every script you ignore, every image you compress can have significant impact on hundreds of millions of not billions. If you can&#x27;t justify that to your team lead, use the argument that the less resources you use, the better the users&#x27; battery lives are and the more responsive a site feels.

I believe this is what applies when a company acquires another company. At first glance, it appears the email Scribd sent does comply with most of article 14 such as:<p><pre><code>    - They notified you they were acquiring your personal data.\n    - They notified you are able to opt out.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe email <i>is<\/i> missing a few things such as the legal basis for processing.

I was in board rooms advising CEO’s before turning 18. I started in infrastructure. First building gaming computers for clients then  shifting to a new model servicing business clients by setting up servers, implementing computer and phone networks, setting up a PBX or VoIP system. Then transitioned from that to designing data centers and call centers for larger clients. Got deep into the architecture of ip transit layers. Fell into resale of existing tech and security for servers&#x2F;networks&#x2F;endpoints.<p>Cloud started eating the market for private data center facilities so I started a VoIP company. We did novel stuff with open platforms to create high density usage without performance impacts on 10 year old hardware (back when hardware was still expensive because cloud couldn’t do telephony well).

If you&#x27;re starting out with a game, it is gonna get mighty difficult to fit whatever it is into a set of objects. By the time you come around to an ECS, you&#x27;ve probably got a fair bit of experience under your belt.<p>- A lot of games have a realtime component. So now you need to know about performance, so that you can draw a frame in a few ms. To do that, you need an abstraction of the machine that includes things like cache misses and branch prediction.<p>- Syntax for c++ is probably the weirdest among common languages, and you need to know it in order to do all the allocations and type safe calls. You&#x27;ll need a bunch of knowledge about how the thing builds, which also isn&#x27;t trivial. (Why h files?)<p>- Games might have 3D graphics. Now you&#x27;ll need a math course, and a bit of reading about some particular lib.<p>- Games tend to have multiple abstraction layers. If you need a high performance data structure, you&#x27;ll have to spend time on writing that while also thinking about the thing you&#x27;re using it for. You might end up mixing the game logic with your data structure if your thinking is muddled.<p>- You&#x27;ll need some artwork. It&#x27;s not as easy as you might think to come up with some nice colors for your characters. Textures, see 3D graphics.<p>- Gameplay itself is a huge topic straddling coding, design and culture.<p>- Want to play with the computer?

I knew about Teletypes from being a ham radio operator, but I thought they were just for sending and receiving text over the air or over a phone line to another Teletype. You could either connect to the other Teletype and type in real time, or you could punch a paper tape first and then send it over the air or across the wire at the full speed of 10 characters per second.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teletype_Model_33\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teletype_Model_33<\/a><p>This Teletype was special, though. The school had an account with a local timesharing computer company, and for a mere $30 per hour ($200&#x2F;hour in today&#x27;s dollars) you could dial in and <i>run a BASIC program<\/i>.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time-sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time-sharing<\/a><p>Naturally my first program was:<p><pre><code>  10 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nand it printed HELLO!<p>You can probably guess the next line I added to the program:<p><pre><code>  20 GOTO 10\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhoops! This wasn&#x27;t just text scrolling on a screen, it printed out line after line on the roll of Teletype paper. Had to hang up the dialup modem fast.<p>That summer I got a job as &quot;night operator&quot; at the timesharing company (Transdata in Phoenix, AZ). The great thing about this job was they shut down the timesharing service at night. So I had their SDS Sigma 5 all to myself. My first personal computer!<p>I found a copy of the Algol-60 Report and taught myself Algol. And then Sigma 5 machine language. It was great fun to see how much of a program I could write on a single punch card (80 bytes).<p>We had a nice single-card program that you could put in front of a deck of cards to print out the whole card deck. But it was kind of slow, because it would read a card, print the card, read the next card, print that one, etc.<p>There were a few bytes left on that print program card, so I squeezed in code for a double buffer. It would read the first card, start it printing, and then <i>while it printed<\/i> read in the next card, overlapping the reads and writes so it printed twice as fast.<p>That fall I went to Caltech, lasted a year and flunked out. I loved science and math, but when we got to partial differential equations my mind just couldn&#x27;t handle it. But there was a systems programming class, and the final project was to write an infix expression parser and evaluator with operator precedence in assembly language.<p>I was the only person in the class to turn in a complete working program with test cases. I could probably tell you exactly where I was sitting when the instructor announced the results. I had found my calling, and have been at it ever since.<p>My secret weapon: while everyone was punching cards with their program, submitting the batch job, and waiting hours or overnight for the core dump when it crashed, I found an <i>interactive console<\/i> on campus where I could code and run and test my program in real time. Just like the Teletype I learned on.<p>Moving forward to the present, I interviewed with a FAANG company last week. It reminded me a bit of the discouraging experience the article&#x27;s author initially had with LOGO and competitive programming.<p>Everyone I interviewed with, and the company recruiters, were all super nice and supportive. But the gist of the interview process was to tackle four medium to hard algorithm problems and come up with not only a working solution but a perfectly optimized solution, in 15 minutes each!<p>The recruiters advised me to spend at least an hour or two every day for two weeks on LeetCode banging through as many algorithm problems as I could, timing myself to see if I could solve each one with optimized code in that 15 minute time limit.<p>There was also a system design interview focused on scaling out a backend system to support a billion users. I explained to the recruiter and the interviewer that this wasn&#x27;t my forte, but I had a lot of experience with low level hardware interfaces and was really interested in a job in their hardware group. They don&#x27;t hire for a specific role like that, though, they hire &quot;generalist engineers&quot;, which means being able to come up with a fully optimized solution for any algorithm in 15 minutes - and without the ability to <i>run and test your code<\/i>.<p>In fact, they used an online code editor that normally lets you do just that, but this capability was disabled. I suppose they were trying to limit the online editor to match the capabilities of what you could do scribbling code on a whiteboard.<p>This all reminded me of what discouraged the OP&#x27;s author so much about his initial foray into programming: the competitive coding competition with LOGO. That is fun for some people, but not for him and not for me. I would rather learn how to <i>cooperate<\/i> with other programmers, not compete with them.<p>One of the algorithm problems stuck in my mind. Of course it was a LeetCode problem that you can read about here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;valid-palindrome-ii&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;valid-palindrome-ii&#x2F;<\/a><p>&quot;Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.&quot;<p>In Python, there is a simple solution for this:<p><pre><code>  def is_palindrome_with_at_most_one_character_deleted( string ):\n      if string == string[::-1]:\n          return True\n      for i in range( len(string) ):\n          s = string[:i] + string[i+1:]\n          if s == s[::-1]:\n              return True\n      return False\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf the string slice notation is unfamiliar, here are some references:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=python+slice+notation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=python+slice+notation<\/a><p>But of course this simple solution would not be good enough. What about the time complexity?<p>This LeetCode problem has 520,862 submissions at the moment, with 191,325 accepted. The solution above would not be accepted.<p>There is a faster solution, but it is less obvious and prone to off by one errors and other logic errors. It&#x27;s not <i>that<\/i> complicated, but not something I would expect anyone to code correctly and verify in 15 minutes.<p>If that kind of competitive programming was what programming looked like to me, I could see myself being easily as discouraged as the OP was.<p>Fortunately there are other fish to catch in this grand ocean of programming!"],"time":["2020-09-08 08:06:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["markus_zhang"],"id":[24409452],"kids":{},"parent":[24404628],"text":["I&#x27;m on the same boat.<p>Kind of weird (and again in the same boat as OP) as I was probably among the few in my country to actually have access to a brand new IBM PC back in the late 80s as my father got it from the university as part of the research grant.

Mostly in the &#x27;code-challenges&#x27; being asked. I recently was given an challenge and after they gave me a small overview of it, I asked roughly what the time-box should be to get a feel for what they thought the effort take. The hiring manager said to me &#x27;it shouldn&#x27;t take more than 8 hours&#x27;. I was shocked. I&#x27;ve been given many coding challenges, they generally fall into the 2 hours or less category. 8 hours is a serious time commitment. I ended up passing because if this is what they find reasonable during the interview I can&#x27;t imagine what kind of demands they&#x27;d place on me day-in-day out.<p>That&#x27;s just one recent example. Before that I was asked to write a simple todo list, and given a time box of 2 days. In that case I chose to do it because I knew I could do something like that in way less than 2 days. I ended up using the full 2 days just sprucing up the UX.  I ended up not getting an offer from that company because I bombed the 2 hour group interview which I knew would happen; our family pet had been suddenly ill and in the ICU for 4 days straight and my wife and I had maybe 8 hours of sleep over the previous 5 days.

I started during that growth period, and 10 years later, we&#x27;re still digging ourselves out of those mistakes.<p>One reason for this was how heavily we prioritized first mover advantage. We pushed extremely hard to get into new markets, and while strategically this worked out extremely well for us, it meant that later development was hamstrung by earlier decisions. Any iteration on old features almost always meant rebuilding it entirely, and we&#x27;ve only just started to get to a place where previous efforts to do this are now paying off in increased velocity.<p>I think there&#x27;s an argument that this <i>could<\/i> be good, since you&#x27;re only improving features when there&#x27;s some other value you can ship. However, I think it&#x27;s short-sighted, because it means prioritizing small iterations has an unnecessarily large cost, simply because that cost wasn&#x27;t paid down slowly over time. While I do think prioritizing new markets early on was a good call, that mindset bit us in the ass in a big way when we tried to ship a very flashy new feature later in our growth cycle that crashed and burned because of tech debt, and it took us over a year to fix everything to release it. If we had taken a mindset of building for the long term five years ago, which was already years after we&#x27;d gotten to a comfortable place in revenue and marketshare, we would probably have paid off most of the major tech debt by now.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know how a company can get past the addiction to shipping, at least not during its growth period. It can be strategically necessary, and I imagine in only a two-year period at the early stages of a company, like what&#x27;s in this article, it&#x27;s impossible to avoid. But leaders must have in the back of their heads the idea that they will need to start tipping the scales toward standardization, building to last, and building infrastructure as well as features sooner than they&#x27;d probably like to avoid larger problems in the future.

I&#x27;d argue that the success of your initial customers is more important than the features for your next deal, and that feature investments should reflect that.<p>The problem, as the OP said, is in estimating the difference between the incremental feature requirements of your initial customers and what your strategic feature set will be. There may be no difference, and your strategy is to ship features in order satisfy each new customer as you get it. Perhaps you can design for that. Chances are though that your first customers are not wholly repsentative of your strategic, target market.<p>So, in the early stage, you have to make  choices about allocating dev for tactical &quot;now&quot; or for strategic  &quot;later&quot;. In the early stage, if there is not enough &quot;now&quot;, there is no &quot;later&quot;. The question is when to begin budget for later. I&#x27;ll argue that you are attempting to build a business, not a suspense movie, and that you budget a fixed amount for &quot;later&quot; from day one. Plan to succeed.<p>I agree with the recommendation of a strong Professional Services function as an buffer for dev, but will note that culturally you have to work hard to not silo. Your Support and ProServe teams become a primary channel of learning for dev. As a business, though, you may have to give away ProServ hours.<p>All in all my biggest takeaway here is that you attempt to &quot;hire&quot; customers strategically.

Ultimately I believe the outcome of this case will depend on two questions:<p>1. Can Epic establish that iOS app distribution is in fact a valid antitrust market that Apple has monopoly control over?<p>Epic argues that Apple is abusing its &quot;monopoly&quot; over the iOS app distribution market. However, in an antitrust case you cannot simply declare an arbitrarily narrow market where the defendant is the only participant and expect the court to accept it. iOS app distribution is an &quot;aftermarket&quot; of the smartphone market, and as a general rule, US courts do not permit antitrust markets to be based on a single brand&#x27;s product unless specific exceptions are met.<p><i>&gt; &quot;In general, a manufacturer&#x27;s own products do not themselves comprise a relevant product market..... [A] company does not violate the Sherman Act by virtue of the natural monopoly it holds over its own product.&quot; Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i><p>The circumstances in which the courts have allowed a single brand&#x27;s product to be treated as a valid antitrust market have usually involved situations where the customer purchased a product <i>not knowing<\/i> they would be locked into some aftermarket restriction, for example due to a change in contract or company policy. If, on the other hand, customers knew about the restriction ahead of time, could have purchased an alternative product without restrictions, and went ahead and purchased anyway, the market power deriving from that restriction is generally not considered a valid basis for an antitrust claim.<p>Of particular note is that courts routinely reject market definitions based on restrictions stipulated in EULAs that customers voluntarily agreed to when purchasing the original product. For example, in <i>Blizzard Entertainment Inc. v. Ceiling Fan Software LLC<\/i>, the court rejected the defendant&#x27;s claim that Blizzard held monopoly power in the &quot;WoW add-on software&quot; aftermarket, because WoW customers explicitly agreed to WoW&#x27;s EULA stipulating they would only used Blizzard authorized WoW add-ons when they purchased the game. Similarly, in <i>Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i>, the court rejected Psystar&#x27;s claim that Apple held monopoly power in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket because customers <i>&quot;knowingly agreed to the challenged restraint&quot;<\/i> when they purchaed Mac OS.<p>Interestingly enough, I double checked and surprisingly the iPhone EULA does not appear to have language restricting app installation to the &quot;App Store and other authorized sources only&quot;. If it did, I believe Epic would have trouble getting past here. However, even in absence of an explicit contractual restriction, the court permits an analysis of <i>&quot;whether a consumer&#x27;s selection of a particular brand in the competitive market is the functional equivalent of a contractual commitment&quot;<\/i>. This analysis is explained in <i>Newcal Industries, Inc. v. IKON Office Solution<\/i> which describes four relevant aspects to consider:<p>a) The existence of two separate but related markets. Epic alleges these are &quot;smartphone OSes&quot; and &quot;app distribution&quot;. It&#x27;s not clear to me whether these two markets need to be economically distinct (more on the meaning of this below), but it could be problematic for Epic if they do.<p>b) The allegations of illegal monopolization relate only to the aftermarket. (This is a given.)<p>c) Whether the source of the company&#x27;s market power is based on contractual provisions obtained in the initial market or based on the company&#x27;s relationship with its customers. Epic argues that in the absence of a EULA there is no contractual relationship, while Apple will presumably argue that there is a quasi-contractual agreement in place because they made the app installation policy very clear at the launch of the App Store and it has never changed.<p>d) Whether market imperfections prevent customers from realizing their choice in the initial market will impact their freedom to shop in the aftermarket. In other words, did customers <i>&quot;make a knowing choice to restrict their aftermarket options&quot;<\/i> when they decided to buy an iPhone instead of a different phone that allowed side-loading?<p>I think Epic is going to have a particularly tough time establishing (c) and (d). If the court concludes that customers purchased iPhones knowing that they would be restricted to installing apps from the App Store, then Apple&#x27;s &quot;monopoly&quot; over iOS app distribution is based on the customer&#x27;s knowing consent, and therefore will not be a valid basis for an antitrust claim.<p>We&#x27;ll see what the court decides. But in any event, even if Epic succeeds in proving that Apple has a monopoly over iOS app distribution, the job is not done. They then need to prove that Apple used that monopoly to illegally restrain competition in another market, which brings us to question 2.<p>2. Can Epic establish that iOS app payment processing is a separate and distinct product from iOS app distribution?<p>In order to prove Apple illegally tied app distribution and payment processing together, Epic will need to show that the two are actually economically distinct products.<p><i>&gt; &quot;[T]here must be a coherent economic basis for treating the tying and tied products as distinct. All but the simplest products can be broken down into two or more components that are &quot;tied together&quot; in the final sale. Unless it is to be illegal to sell cars with engines or cameras with lenses, this analysis must be guided by some limiting principle. For products to be treated as distinct, the tied product must, at a minimum, be one that some consumers might wish to purchase separately without also purchasing the tying product. When the tied product has no use other than in conjunction with the tying product, a seller of the tying product can acquire no additional market power by selling the two products together.&quot; Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde<\/i><p>In <i>Jefferson Parish<\/i>, the Supreme Court ruled anesthesiological services were <i>not<\/i> economically distinct from hospital services because anesthesiological services were always sold in conjunction with other hospital services, and therefore tying the two together was not illegal. In <i>Rick-Mik Enterprises, Inc. v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC<\/i>, credit card processing was considered an essential component of a gas station franchise and therefore was not economically distinct from the sale of the franchise itself. The legal test for whether two tied products are economically distinct has historically depended on whether consumer demand exists for the tied product separate from the tying product, but it&#x27;s not clear whether that test is appropriate here.<p>For the case of paid apps, there clearly <i>aren&#x27;t<\/i> economically distinct products. If Apple distributes a paid app on behalf of a developer and collects a fee in exchange, the fee is the cost of using Apple&#x27;s distribution service. Distribution and payment happen simultaneously, they are not separate services, therefore there is no tie between them.<p>Now, what happens if Apple initially distributes the app without a fee and (later) takes a fee when an in-app purchase is made? Does the act of deferring the payment from the download create two economically distinct products when before there was only one? Apple argues that it does not, and similar to <i>Rick-Mik<\/i>, in-app payment processing is simply a component of its app distribution service.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this argument will hold up in court but it&#x27;s certainly very interesting and probably venturing into uncharted territory as far as existing precedent is concerned. But if the court does decide that in-app payment processing services are not economically distinct from app distribution services, then Epic is going to have difficulties with their tying claim.<p>Overall these are very tough questions and as the judge said, it&#x27;s not a slam dunk for either side. I tend to think Epic is fighting the uphill battle here, as existing US antitrust law seems like it favors the defendant in cases like this. If Epic does win, it&#x27;s certainly going to open up a lot of similar questions for other companies that sell tightly controlled hardware and software.

I doubt this time will be different, though the brief renaissance will doubtless be appreciated.<p>Charles Perrow wrote of this in the mid-1980s:<p><i>After the critical period from about 1956 to 1960, when tastes were unfrozen, competition was intense, and demand soared, consolidation appeared. The number of firms stabilized at about forty. New corporate entries appeared, such as MGM and Warner Brothers, sensing, one supposes, the opportunity that vastly expanding sales indicated. Some independents grew large. The eight-firm concentration ratio also stabilized (though not yet the four-firm ratio). The market became sluggish, however, as the early stars died, were forced into retirement because of legal problems, or in the notable case of Elvis Presley, were drafted by an impinging environment. Near the end of this period the majors decided that the new sounds were not a fad and began to buy up the contracts of established artists and successfully picked and promoted new ones, notably The Beach Boys and Bob Dylan. A new generation (e.g., The Beatles) appeared from 1964 to 1969, and sales again soared.<\/i><p><i>But now the concentration ratios soared also. From 1962 to 1973, the four-firm ratio went from 25 to 51 percent; the eight-firm ratio from 46 to 81 percent, almost back to the pre-1955 levels. The number of different firms having hits declined from forty-six to only sixteen. Six of the eight giants were diversified conglomerates, some of which led in the earlier period; one was a new independent, the other a product of of mergers.<\/i><p><i>How did they do it? The major companies asserted “increasing central control over the creative process”[352] through deliberate creation and extensive promotion of new groups, long-range contracts for groups, and reduced autonomy for producers. In addition, legal and illegal promotion costs (drug payola to disc jockeys, for example) rose in the competitive race and now exceeded the resources of small independents. Finally, the majors “have also moved to regain a controlling position in record distribution by buying chains of retail stores.”[353] The diversity is still greater than it had been in the past, and may remain high, but it is ominous that the majors have all the segments covered. As an executive said, “Columbia Records will have a major entry into whatever new area is broached by the vagaries of public tastes.” But for a concentrated industry, the “vagaries of public tastes” are not economical; it is preferable to stabilize and consolidate them. This would be possible through further control over the creative process and marketing.<\/i><p>Charles Perrow, <i>Complex organizations : a critical essay,<\/i> 1972, 1985. pp. 186--187.<p>The dynamics, actors, and economics remind me strongly of the software &#x2F; high-tech industry, though with much weaker coupling  and different lock-in mechanics."],"time":["2020-09-08 09:17:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vmception"],"id":[24404755],"kids":{},"parent":[24396681],"text":["Perfect"],"time":["2020-09-08 04:37:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregjw"],"id":[24406229],"kids":{},"parent":[24396681],"text":["Betteridge&#x27;s law of Hacker News headlines"],"time":["2020-09-08 10:08:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["charliebrownau"],"id":[24406355],"kids":{},"parent":[24396681],"text":["Mainstream killed itself<p>Let the American&#x2F;Western top 40 die ,<p>the same with TV , News, Movies, Comics and scifi"],"time":["2020-09-08 10:28:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["peter_l_downs"],"id":[24404221],"kids":[24404229,24404430,24404286],"parent":[24396681],"text":["No (Betteridge&#x27;s law)"],"time":["2020-09-08 02:53:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["roughly"],"id":[24412109],"kids":[24414305,24415143,24414678],"parent":[24408077],"text":["The amount of computational power in biological systems is simply staggering.<p>In extremely simple organisms like roundworms, there are on the order of hundreds of neurons; for most insects you&#x27;re in the 10k-1M range.<p>A honeybee contains one million neurons, which are computational devices that we have a hard time fully and accurately mapping, and something like a billion connections between them.<p>Each of those neurons contains the entire genome for that honeybee, around 250 million base pairs.

Happened quickly and was the worst smoke I’ve experienced since the Camp Fire blew into Los Altos, CA, a while back.

That’s one of the most impactful things that can be done to mitigate the risk — make sure flammable plants and trees are far from the house, use hardscaping (stone, gravel) around the foundation, and keep anything within 30-100’ well irrigated. Also, don’t allow leaves etc to gather under porches, gutters. Make sure vents are well screened.<p>The forest becomes more wilderness but we’ve been doing a bunch there as well: limbing trees up to reduce the risk of “ladder fires”, getting rid of brush, cleaning up old access trails in case a fire crew needs to come through.<p>Fires are pretty awesome events — experiencing them first-hand gives you a sense of scale that’s impossible to convey through pictures alone.

The vaccine might have a small likelihood of triggering reactions or otherwise having adverse effects, and spread over the entire population these edge cases can add up to do more damage than the disease itself.<p>Again, that is for typical vaccine situations.  A pandemic is totally different--the number of cases is exponentially increasing and ripping through the entire population.  So our options are:<p>1. Wait the additional 6-12 months it would take (even accounting for the immense investments that have been made) to get a vaccine to go through all the normal regulatory hoops we would demand of vaccine development outside of a pandemic. During which time COVID-19 rips through the population leaving potentially millions dead and hundreds of millions of recovered with disease-related tissue damage.<p>2. Wait, but stay in lockdown to keep the disease at bay, but in the process massively drive up suicide, domestic violence, and divorce rates, wreck the economy, and force people to spend their savings and&#x2F;or trigger massive inflation through pandemic relief.<p>3. Some horrible compromise between the above two extremes.<p>4. Roll out the vaccines as quickly as they can be manufactured, starting now. Don&#x27;t wait for Phase III results.<p>The Phase I and Phase II trials tell us that the vaccine successfully generates antibodies.  The group sizes so far have been large enough to know that the risk of fatal interactions is less than the risk of dying from COVID-19 itself--indeed, for the most part there haven&#x27;t been ANY severe reactions, at least in the major vaccines.<p>This &quot;wait until the vaccine is proven safe!&quot; is politically generated nonsense. There is no data-driven argument supporting it.  Ideologues on the left assume that Trump wants a vaccine ASAP to win reelection, don&#x27;t trust is understanding of the science, and therefore assume that early administration of a vaccine would be some sort of unsafe political compromise.  Ideologues on the right believe COVID-19 is a hoax anyway.

Various administrations have touted these investments as a solution to the city&#x27;s high crime levels, notoriously poor performance of APD (in terms of both crime reduction and compliance with a Department of Justice consent decree), and chronic understaffing of many area police organizations but especially APD.<p>There has, of course, been no real evidence of success. A promising change in local crime trends seems to be more a result of significant reform of the DA&#x27;s office than anything APD has done. APD&#x27;s main contribution to the effort has been harassing anyone who happens to be near downtown at night, including people who live and work there. That and shooting someone on occasion.<p>What is perhaps most surprising about these programs is how little attention they have received from the public. While APD&#x27;s abuse of force and corruption problems are widely known and one of the area&#x27;s foremost political issues, there is almost no discussion of APD&#x27;s mass surveillance programs even among police abolition groups. It seems to reflect the general trend that mass surveillance is a much great topic of discussion in the tech community than outside of it.<p>All that said, my real comment is that this program seems unsurprising and of little import compared to the real-time crime center, its privacy implications, and ongoing internal problems including chronic high turnover and sudden dismissals (which tends to suggest problems that were not publicized), hiring a director with a history of internal affairs problems, etc. And then even that seems like a small matter in the context that APD has been under a department of justice consent decree resulting from a pattern of excessive force for six years now and has only just in the last few months finished making the policy changes required by DoJ, with the independent monitor reporting that compliance with those new policies is extremely poor.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just hard to get too fired up about APD being run by major retailers when it&#x27;s been clear for years that APD does not answer to the people, the city government, or the federal government. Being in the pocket of Target is downright wholesome compared to what we expect from APD.<p>Look on the bright side: APD has it together compared to BCSO. Sheriff Gonzales resisted implementation of body cameras for years until the state legislature took the matter into their own hands and mandated cameras for all law enforcement agencies. After a series of gaffs including Sheriff Gonzales announcing that he thought officers owning smart phones was sufficient to meet the mandate, the media has enjoyed discussing what will happen when they blow through the deadline and BCSO no longer meets statutory requirements to exercise law enforcement authority."],"time":["2020-09-08 06:49:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rshnotsecure"],"id":[24407199],"kids":[24408238],"parent":[24402937],"text":["The City of Albuquerque&#x27;s site was maintained by Netsential, who in turn used &quot;Data Foundry&quot; in central Texas as their colo &#x2F; cloud provider.<p>It appears that the specific colo being used was also a major NSA bulk intel collection point.

In the aughts, a number of startups tried to take on that space (notably Odeo, which incubated and then pivoted into Twitter) and all of them failed. Apple has been largely an absentee steward, which has worked out well for podcasting. It wasn’t until Google decided to take podcasts seriously about five years ago and launched its own podcast directory. Spotify’s podcast directory started about five years ago too, though took longer to build momentum.<p>All three are largely copies of one another — although Spotify has exclusives in its directory that can only be played in its app — and most major podcasts choose to submit their RSS feed to those directories, with some also choosing to share with other services (Stitcher, Luminary, etc.) that can do some fucked up stuff with the audio. It’s all a game of reach for a podcast publisher, unless you choose you don’t want Luminary or Stitcher to insert their own ads into your content — or you have an exclusive with some service or another.<p>So now there is ostensibly yet another podcast directory, except it can’t offer a good value prop for existing except that it is “open” — which sounds good if you’re Alex Jones or you make content that has been kicked out of the other directories — but will realistically impact only a small number of podcasters.<p>The target audience, I assume is podcatching apps. Right now, most of them scrape the Apple or Google podcasts directory to save the insanity of trying to maintain their own directory.<p>So what value is there for this “open” directory to someone who has a podcatching app? Well, nothing unless there is a critical mass of podcasts submitted. Moreover, the service says it’s free, but is also asking for donations, which makes me worry about the viability of the index longterm.

When I realized programming was easy<p>That&#x27;s it. For a long time, when I thought of the hardest stuff to program, I was thinking of computer games. Mind you, not the latest AAA billion dollar development budget 300+ people on the team kind of games. No - given my age, I was thinking about single-programming doing code and graphics and sounds on a C64 kind of games. To me, it was incomprehensible how one person alone could manage to do a machine, especially with the hardware limitations, do all <i>that<\/i>.<p>And then one day it struck me. I had started to dabble with programming in my early teens and then never stopped but, I guess, gotten better at it over time.<p>Like with every process that evolutionary rather then revolutionary, there&#x27;s a good chance to lose track of your progress. I remember clearly after finishing college, I really though that everything I knew then about computers and programmers I had already known even <i>before<\/i> I entered university. But then one day, a freshman asked me a question about a programming assignment in their class, and it was completely trivial to me. Yet, when I was a freshman, I would have probably asked the same question to someone else.<p>And yet, that was not my aha moment. It still took many years for me to realize that my idolization of game programmers was perhaps a bit much. Mind you, I do realize of course that someone specialized in <i>any<\/i> area will be able to produce better code than someone who&#x27;s not - for any definition of &quot;better&quot;. I&#x27;m still not a game programmer and never will be, so I still have the highest respect for their profession. But I do realize now that there&#x27;s not outer-worldly skill that separates the game coder from the crop of all other programmers. Anything is within reach - what you need is not some innate talent, it&#x27;s just dedication.<p>Life is somewhat better now and I&#x27;ll never go back to thinking I&#x27;m not good at programming."],"time":["2020-09-08 10:06:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gonzo41"],"id":[24407101],"kids":[24407149],"parent":[24397272],"text":["1.

That programming and making stuff people want are two entirely different things, although programmers always assume that whatever you&#x27;re building, it&#x27;s the right thing. You can spend your entire career in programming, learning all sorts of goodness about things like Erlang innards, and never really understand what your job is.<p>3. That all of that mousing around, learning a new IDE every two or three years when I started was a complete waste of time. I automatically assumed that the more cool and shiny the programming environment, the easier it would be to code and the better my code would be. But no. grep and awk work (mostly) the same way now as they did 30 years ago, and any time I spent learning which hotkeys did that work in some long-lost dev stack was a complete waste of time.<p>4. Conversely, that UX beats internal architecture, every time. If folks are having a blast using your app, you win, even if it crashes every five minutes (How they could have fun if it crashed every five minutes is a good question. You might want to ask them)<p>5. The more smart people you throw at a programming project, the bigger mess you end up with. I know when I say that people are thinking of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, but it goes deeper than that. Even if you somehow manage to stay on-schedule, human communication around innovation stops working at a certain scale, and that looks like a hard limit. There are ways around it, using things like Code Budgets, following CCL, layers and DSLs, but nobody does that, so it doesn&#x27;t matter. We, as an industry, have absolutely no idea how to staff or run projects.<p>ADD: One thing that was quite profound that I discovered late: if you code well, the simple <i>act<\/i> of programming can tell you something about the way you&#x27;re reasoning about the problem that you couldn&#x27;t learn any other way. Programming is by no means a simple one-way street where ideas come out of the head of the programmer and end up as bits on the tech stack. It&#x27;s very, very much bidirectional.

I got started with programming via BASIC (various forms), none of which supported recursion. I didn&#x27;t really <i>know<\/i> what it was, but knew that I just wanted to call into the same routine again from itself or via mutual recursion (again, didn&#x27;t know the term). This didn&#x27;t work as expected, however. Either the program wouldn&#x27;t compile&#x2F;execute (threw an error at the recursion) or the recursion just corrupted the data (each call shared the same local data, so they&#x27;d clobber each others&#x27; work). While playing around on a TI calculator I programmed (something, can&#x27;t remember the details) but created a stack using the list data structure. I then looped (versus recursed) but pushed a data element onto the stack or popped elements off of it. The program quit when the stack was empty.<p>Later, in college, we were learning lower level programming details (like what C translated to in assembly and how it managed calls and the stack frame). Despite this being my third CS course in college, I hadn&#x27;t really <i>grokked<\/i> recursion yet. But I had a flashback during one of the classes to the TI-BASIC programs I&#x27;d written using a stack, and realized I&#x27;d recreated recursion (but manually). After that recursion and loops were synonymous in my mind (as they should be, at least in many cases) since I knew how to translate between them. Whenever I saw someone managing a stack and looping until it was empty, I knew both that it could be and how it could be translated into recursion (and vice versa).<p>It seems to be one of the hardest topics for many of my colleagues (especially those without a CS degree, so lacking practice with recursion) to understand or ever use. But I can usually get them to understand it once I draw a few things out on paper and show the two solutions to a problem (recursive or iterative). This doesn&#x27;t mean they like recursion, most still avoided it, but they started to understand that it wasn&#x27;t magic, it was just the computer managing the same data structure they were manually managing."],"time":["2020-09-08 19:21:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["animesh"],"id":[24402044],"kids":[24402131],"parent":[24397272],"text":["1.

See [1]. Newer language wars center of safety and bug creation, so maybe this point is dating me.<p>- Programming languages are more about human psychology than about some mathematical proof of correctness. Programming languages are designed as a compromise between how a computer needs to be told to operate and how humans communicate. All the theoretical and mathematical infrastructure around language design are there to justify decisions once the language has passed the &quot;psychology&quot; test. This is the same idea between JPEG, MP3, etc. compression. Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms don&#x27;t inherently create a saving, it&#x27;s only when we can throw away higher order coefficients because the human perceptual system isn&#x27;t as sensitive to them as lower order coefficients, does it give benefit. That is, JPEG and MP3 are specifically tailored to the human perceptual system. The math is there as the building block but which bits&#x2F;coefficients to throw away are determined empirically. To belabor this point a bit more, programming language discussions arguing over functional vs. imperative, type safety, etc. that don&#x27;t try to determine measurable metrics of success, preferably through testing their hypothesis with data collected on actual usage, are expressing an opinion only.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200407014302&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gmarceau.qc.ca&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;speed-size-and-dependability-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200407014302&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gmarc...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 11:34:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kangnkodos"],"id":[24409253],"kids":{},"parent":[24397272],"text":["When I first started compiling code, there were often pages and pages of compiler errors.

Clean is when you don&#x27;t have to make many decisions to get things done.<p>Example decisions, I&#x27;d say I spend at least 90% of my time developing on these decisions:<p>- What feature would be good to have?<p>- Is the feature worth the effort to build?<p>- Is the feature worth the compute costs?<p>- What language&#x2F;framework should we use for this feature?<p>- How should we structure persistent data related to this feature?<p>- Where should the code for this feature live?<p>- How should we test this feature?<p>- How performant should this feature be?<p>- What name should this helper function&#x2F;variable have?<p>The more of those you have to think about when developing the slower you will make progress. Therefore the main productivity hack is to write down guidelines or roadmaps or design documents for all of those so you don&#x27;t have to think much about it when developing. This means don&#x27;t be a manager when coding, let someone else do that work or do it before you start programming.<p>Things you can do to reduce mental cost of above decisions:<p>- Product roadmap with features that would be good to have.<p>- Discussions in the roadmap related to how much value said feature will provide and the effort to produce it.<p>- Discussions in the roadmap related to how expensive the feature will be to run.<p>- General guidelines on what language&#x2F;framework you use.<p>- Have a very good architectural document describing how you structure persistent data.<p>- Have list of example commits showing where to put code for different features.<p>- Have a well documented testing strategy with examples pointing to commits with good integration and unit tests.<p>- Have guidelines on how much typical actions are allowed to take, like &quot;page update should take 100ms at most&quot;.<p>- Try to write code where you don&#x27;t need a lot of long superfluous names, namespaces and anonymous functions are your friends.<p>- Lastly, as much as possible try to make reasonable defaults for shared code. If you have to make 20 configuration decisions in order to use a library then you wont save a lot of time using it, and likely people will just copy the configuration from other places anyway since making 20 decisions is too much work. For example, lets say your library have a flag that can speed up processing 2x in some cases but with extra overhead most of the time. You could think that forcing the developer to decide in each case to ensure we aren&#x27;t missing any performance improvements would be a good thing, but in reality a 2x performance improvement rarely matters. So the cost of having every developer making this decision outweighs the performance benefit.

By 1930, most streets were primarily a motor thoroughfares where children did not belong and where pedestrians were condemned as &quot;jaywalkers.&quot; In Fighting Traffic, Peter Norton argues that to accommodate automobiles, the American city required not only a physical change but also a social one: before the city could be reconstructed for the sake of motorists, its streets had to be socially reconstructed as places where motorists belonged. It was not an evolution, he writes, but a bloody and sometimes violent revolution. Norton describes how street users struggled to define and redefine what streets were for. He examines developments in the crucial transitional years from the 1910s to the 1930s, uncovering a broad anti-automobile campaign that reviled motorists as &quot;road hogs&quot; or &quot;speed demons&quot; and cars as &quot;juggernauts&quot; or &quot;death cars.&quot; He considers the perspectives of all users--pedestrians, police (who had to become &quot;traffic cops&quot;), street railways, downtown businesses, traffic engineers (who often saw cars as the problem, not the solution), and automobile promoters.

My kids at that age would often be about to trip over the last nerve with some sort of interruption only to say, &quot;Mommy and daddy, I love you.&quot; In some ways, I think the goodness that kids these ages show must be some sort of evolutionary mechanism to remain &quot;cute&quot; and keep the parents from harming them (i.e. self-interested).
