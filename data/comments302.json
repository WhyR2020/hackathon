If you live in a house that has a typical unfinished basement, don&#x27;t overlook the advantage it offers.

Just move your refrigerator to the basement.<p>Since the basement is normally cooler than the upstairs, the refrigerator will run less often. This will not only extend its lifetime, but also lower the electricity it consumes, thus also reducing your carbon footprint.

However, the size of your butt may be improved.<p>It&#x27;s a simple step that can be done in a couple of hours.

It has an automatic defrost unit- this means that it heats the evaporator coils in the freezer every so often (I think it&#x27;s once every 36 hours) to melt the frost off of them, producing the same condensation you normally get from an A&#x2F;C.  So where does this water go?  Well there is a hose from the freezer to a pan underneath  the fridge.  There is a cooling fan for the condenser coils there which can dip into this pan.  The idea is to use this water to help cool the condenser coils, making the fridge a little more efficient.<p>Anyway, so the failure has to do with the management of this condensation water. When it&#x27;s not working, you get a puddle of water in the bottom of the fridge compartment which eventually leaks out to the floor.  First thing to check- is the hose clogged?  Yes it is, washed it out, but problem still happens.  Next thing to check- behind the back wall of the freezer you find the evaporator coils.  At the bottom is some cheap metal called the &quot;drain trough&quot;.  It is a funnel that leads the condensation into the hose.  This is where the planned obsolescence comes into play.  I&#x27;m convinced that the manufactures make this metal out of steal with just the tiniest amount of galvanization so that it will eventually rot out.  I think even plastic would have been a better material.<p>It&#x27;s theoretically possible to replace this metal, but consider the work involved: you need to empty the freezer, dry it out, remove the back of it, figure out how to move the evaporator coils out of the way without damaging them, unscrew the trough, and figure out how to wiggle it out.  You need to do this at least twice (once to debug the issue in the first place, next to actually replace it).  Finally good luck finding the replacement in stock (also add the time needed for this search). The fridge is maybe good for 12 years, but little chance of replacement parts stocked for that long.  Certainly this is the case for my fridge, and I fabricated a temporary patch out of rubber.<p>Also, of course, there is absolutely no way for you to inspect this part before you buy a new fridge.

It’s a perverse sort of global irresponsibility.<p>I guess so many folks are salivating over a multi trillion dollar global slush fund, with no practicable short or middle term accountability, that they don’t care about the hundreds of thousands of excess deaths, young and old, occurring over the next few years by not focusing on fundamental issues today.

Too many people, not enough land, too few trees, too much polluting economic activity, poor agricultural practices, not enough clean water, over urbanization...a few Trillion on these core elements might get the world somewhere.  Again, maybe for the slush fund people this may affect the wrong color people.<p>There is the international political benefit of blaming decades of political mismanagement on some mysterious outside element with deep pockets, instead of taking responsibility for local actions.  But local action is the most critical element in addressing the issues.  Of course, once the slush fund money is doled out, I don’t think they would care if kids’ lives were ever spared.

He stood up and declared very loudly:<p><pre><code>    “I will not permit the testimony of a torture victim to be censored by this court”\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA great commotion broke out. Baraitser threatened to have Julian removed and have the hearing held in his absence. There was a break following which it was announced that el-Masri would not appear, but that the gist of his evidence would be read out, excluding detail of US torture or of US pressure on the government of Germany. Mark Summers QC started to read the evidence.<p>Khaled el-Masri, of Lebanese origin, had come to Germany in 1989 and was a German citizen. On 1 January 2004 after a holiday in Skopje he had been removed from a coach on the Macedonian border. He had been held incommunicado by Macedonian officials, ill-treated and beaten. On 23 July he had been taken to Skopje airport and handed over to CIA operatives. They had beaten, shackled, hooded and sodomised him. His clothes had been ripped off, he had been dressed in a diaper, shackled to the floor of an aircraft in a cruciform position, and rendered unconscious by an anaesthetic injection.<p>He awoke in what he eventually learned was Afghanistan. He was held incommunicado in a bare concrete cell with a bucket for a toilet. He was held for six months and interrogated throughout this period [details of torture excluded by the judge]. Eventually in June he was flown to Albania, driven blindfold up a remote mountain road and dumped. When he eventually got back to Germany, his home was deserted and his wife and children had left.<p>When he made his story public he was subject to vicious attacks on his character and his credibility and it was claimed he was inventing it. He believes the government sought to silence him. He sought a local lawyer and persisted, eventually getting in touch with Mr Goetz of public TV, who had proven his story to be true, traced the CIA agents involved to North Carolina and even interviewed some of them. As a result, Munich state prosecutors released arrest warrants for his CIA kidnappers, but these were never executed. When Wikileaks issued the cables the pressure that had been brought on the German government not to prosecute became plain. [The judge did not prevent Summers from saying this.] We therefore know the US blocked judicial investigation of a crime. The European Court of Human Rights had explicitly relied on the Wikileaks cables for part of its judgement in the case. The Grand Chamber confirmed that he had been beaten, hooded, shackled and sodomised.<p>There had been no accountability in the USA. The CIA Inspector-General had declined to take action over the case. The ECHR judgement and supporting documentation had been sent to the office of the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia – precisely the same office that was now attempting to extradite Assange – and that office had declined to prosecute the CIA officers concerned."],"time":["2020-09-21 00:38:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Yc4win"],"id":[24539284],"kids":{},"parent":[24536970],"text":["It makes me so unbelievably sick that the western powers that be are TORTURING a journalist because he exposes their sick crimes."],"time":["2020-09-21 04:43:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BXLE_1-1-BitIs1"],"id":[24540329],"kids":{},"parent":[24536970],"text":["National Security = Covering up our war crimes and our crimes against humanity"],"time":["2020-09-21 08:10:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lucasnortj"],"id":[24537501],"kids":{},"parent":[24536970],"text":["Craig Murray is an antisemitic conspiracy crank.

This describes both classical &quot;company towns&quot; with dorms and factories and companies that emerged in the consumer software boom of the 80&#x27;s, for example Sierra Online was HQ&#x27;d in Oakhurst, CA, a town of a few thousand people in a region with about 10,000.<p>The maturation of a competitive industry gradually pools the talent into an urban center, as hiring demands increase, more managerial and financial elements are needed and more of the workers hop between companies. Sierra moved to Bellevue, and then to LA during the 90&#x27;s amidst a flurry of mergers.<p>Companies that occupy monopoly positions don&#x27;t experience the same pressure to move or change. Epic Systems, a contemporary to Sierra, still has its HQ in Wisconsin, and its company culture has resisted work from home.<p>And work from home is a kind of last step in enlarging the worker pool, since the online world effectively represents the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest city&quot; - a vast, unknowable thing that we have barely begun to tap into. It does not have the exact form of a physical megacity takes, but in terms of building strong networks that generate productive relationships, it can supplant physical presence in many instances. Plus, the rent is very low, so everyone can move there.<p>The core premises of the megacity still hold validity. Not everyone is an office worker or a multimillionaire, and we continue to have many occupations that benefit from local connectivity and physical presence. But the megacity as a speculative playground, where the real estate market is used to stash wealth, might be done. The playground relies on growth keeping up with debt, but as debt piles up you get zombie companies.

They adapt to your habits and lifestyle very quickly and they go out of their way to please you. Their emotions are much more complex than we think.

This should be your no. 1 priority. Go to puppy classes, go out of your way to meet as many different dogs and people as possible. Go to different places like parks, public transport, coffee shops, etc.<p>(2) Something I realized that while positive training is very popular these days (for good reasons), there are some cases when you MUST be firm with your dog. You can&#x27;t explain to a dog why going off the sidewalk without permission is extremely dangerous. The only way I could train my dog not to was to shout at him at the exact moment he tried it, and praise him a lot when he turned around. Now he is off-leash 99% of the time and 100% reliable.

Not as limited as you might think, because I have seen dogs who were keenly aware of exactly what they can get away with. Some dogs, like some people are indeed stupid, and my advice is to get a dog that is a smart as you are but no smarter. But you have to explain things to dogs in a way they can understand.<p>- Dogs have a pecking order and as the owner you will establish where you are in that order - as seen by the dog. Some dogs assume people are superior, but many of them know better until proven otherwise. So you need to be aware of when your dog challenges you. This is not an opportunity to be mean, this is an opportunity to show you are a kind yet firm leader.<p>- Dogs want you to like them. Not to see them as pets but to like them, so make sure you establish the pecking order in a way that you can still be friends. And keep a sense of humor.<p>- Dogs are instinctual. Do not expect a lab to ignore a thrown tennis ball, or an open container of food. If your dog ate all the dog food that is not a &quot;bad&quot; dog that is a mistake you made. Bad Human, Bad! This goes for breeds of dogs that have traits and especially working dogs. They will try to work.<p>- Be a responsible person and understand the health issues your dog may have. Many dogs have health issues because of breeding so know this and check it. Also,  if you are unsure you want or can keep a dog, borrow one for a week. Better yet borrow two different ones. Just as we don&#x27;t return babies once they are born, you should not return your dog - unless it is better for the dog.<p>- Finally teach your dog to lie down when you say &quot;down&quot; and point to the ground. Your dog should allow anyone, even a four year old human to give it this command. At any time in any circumstances.

Our dog knows what she can get away with with different family members and I’ve inadvertently taught her to “politely beg” for snacks in certain circumstances that I will try not to repeat for any later dogs.<p>Make them feel secure, be consistent, be wary of over-treating and being too varied in training. “Come”, “Comehere”, “Get over here” might as well be three different commands. One trainer said dogs don’t generalize well. They might quickly learn “when he says that and I’m in the kitchen and he’s holding a bowl, I should sit” much faster than “when he says that and we’re outside and a squirrel is running around, I should sit” much faster than “anytime he says that, I should sit”. (It’s really fun watching them puzzle it out and I could tell when my dog was really trying vs just being disengaged.)<p>What would I do the same: crate train. love my dog and make her feel protected and provided for. Do basic obedience training. Lots of short training sessions. 10 3-minute sessions a day is not wrong. 1 hour-long session is. Ensure that if she ignores a command she knows that I consistently enforce that what I want happens. (If she ignores a come command for example, I will always march to her and make her come to where I was standing when I issued it. My spouse does not [despite being overall more consistent]. Our dog knows this and acts accordingly.)<p>What would I do differently? Fewer treats during non-training times. Teach the kids to give the same consistent commands. (Dog pre-dates kids in our house, so this was not possible.)<p>Our dog is 15 pounds and we decided to let her on the furniture (inc bed) and we’d do that again for a dog under 20 pounds. With a larger dog, don’t let the puppy dog on the furniture if you don’t want the adult dog on it.<p>100% agree on the suggestion to pre-determine dog ownership and not have it be 50&#x2F;50, we’ll figure it out, YOLO.<p>I would 100% crate train. The amount of consistency it provides helps incredibly, not just for potty-training (but it’s incredibly helpful for that, of course). It’s not doggy jail (unless you use it to punish, in which case just don’t get a dog). Our dog would happily go to her crate when overwhelmed by kid visitors and though we later took the crate away, we put the same little padded mats in several spots around the house for her, including one in a closet that she likes to use while we’re working or during thunderstorms.<p>I hesitate to recommend specific books as I read a stack of them and probably got something from all of the first four or five."],"time":["2020-09-20 12:29:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ndanmand"],"id":[24540715],"kids":{},"parent":[24532872],"text":["We appreciate all your comments - Thank you!"],"time":["2020-09-21 09:22:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ufmace"],"id":[24535146],"kids":{},"parent":[24533026],"text":["Characterizing an auto-update system as a RCE for the product&#x27;s developers is an absurd exaggeration IMO.

It seems to me these two objectives are somewhat in competition.<p>(there&#x27;s also comprehension and thinking but I see those as separate)<p>I think splitting up the two objectives makes more sense. Handwriting notes enhances memory formation, but is less optimized for searchability. Digital notes are great for long-term searchability, but are weaker for memory formation.<p>Why not have two systems instead of one? Just handwrite whatever you want to remember, and type whatever you want to stash away? It seems inefficient, but in multiobjective optimization we usually end up with Pareto optimality rather than a single point of optimality.<p>One might ask, how would I know a priori what to remember and what to stash? I personally prefer handwriting,  so I&#x27;ll usually go there first and if I need to stash it I&#x27;ll retype it into Google Docs. That said, I&#x27;ll hop on Google Docs first if it happens to be more convenient (like if I&#x27;m browsing and want to copy-and-paste something for long-term storage, or if I&#x27;m outdoors and all I have on me is my phone)<p>Meetings are a great candidate for handwriting notes -- and then discarding. You and I know that most meeting notes are throwaways. Despite that, I personally find that in complex multiparty meetings, I&#x27;m able to follow the flow better if I continuously take notes. Being able to remember who said what, and being able to summarize a meeting are all very valuable skills to have.<p>(p.s. with regard to memory, Socrates didn&#x27;t even believe in writing -- he believed writing things down would weaken our memories in the long term. He believed that talking about things was a far superior way to form memories and to understand subjects deeply. He&#x27;s not completely wrong about the role of discussion and disputation [emotional connection is a potent force in memory formation], but all the same I&#x27;m glad Plato didn&#x27;t take to this thinking and actually wrote stuff down)."],"time":["2020-09-19 17:34:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amadeuspagel"],"id":[24528225],"kids":[24529879,24528447,24528359,24532680,24534655],"parent":[24519008],"text":["&gt; Researchers have found that note-taking associated with keyboarding involves taking notes verbatim in a way that does not involve processing information, and so have called this “non-generative” note-taking.<p>From the linked paper:<p>&gt; Taking notes on laptops rather than in longhand is increasingly common. Many researchers have suggested that laptop note taking is less effective than longhand note taking for learning. Prior studies have primarily focused on students’ capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.<p>The mechanism here is probably that people are able to type faster, so typing lets them write down every word, whereas handwriting forces them to choose what to write down.

I just joined a company this past week as a software engineer. Day one, I knew 5 people, only topically. By the end of week 1, I have introductions&#x2F;1:1s scheduled for 30+ top-notch people at the organization. Here&#x27;s the method I used to do this:<p>I created a really comprehensive intro email about myself (work stuff, personal stuff, passions, etc). I wrote this in Google Docs, so it would be easy to paste into Gmail, and preserve the nice formatting. In this email, I included several questions (see below), which I wanted to ask the person. I got these questions from a few sources, including &quot;The first 90 Days&quot; book, along with some other questions I found through Google. At the end of the email, I marked in bold: Suggest 3 other amazing people for me to connect to, and why you recommend them.<p>I sent the emails out, and got replies within 1-2 days - 75% provided me with 3 names! If some did not provide me with names, I politely followed up with warm, thankful email, but also a reminder to please send me name, which each of them did.<p>I then sent out &quot;cold&quot; emails to THOSE people, starting with &quot;X person said to reach out you&quot; (helping bring a familiar name immediately at the beginning of the email). I used the exact same email template for that, along with asking for more names.<p>I used a Google spreadsheet to keep track of all the people I reached out with, along with columns for questions, the people they referred, and who referred them.<p>At current, I have 15 1:1s scheduled for next week, and tentatively 5-10 scheduled for the week after. I&#x27;m using labels in Gmail to flag &quot;@ Waiting&quot; for the people who have not responded, so that I can follow up after a few days.<p>In the meeting invites I sent to folks, I included the agenda items in the description, so it was top-of-mind for them, as they checked their calendar.<p>I&#x27;m using a note taking tool called Obsidian (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;<\/a>) to take notes on all the conversations I&#x27;m having with people. This tool lets you write in markdown, and quickly crosslink topics (like a personal wiki). The goal is to create a knowledge base of information, based on all the &quot;here&#x27;s what you need to know&quot; topics that people share with me.<p>Finally (and important). I made sure to set expectations with my manager before doing this. I basically told him: (1) I am going to setup conversations with many people this first 2 weeks of work. (2) I will use this output of these conversations to build a learning plan of topics which these people suggest focusing on, (3) I will then synthesize these notes, and will share them with you (manager). (4) You and I will review the learning plan, and prioritize it together. (5) We will use this plan, along with our weekly 1:1s to build out a 30&#x2F;60&#x2F;90 day plan.<p>This was important, because it allowed me to &quot;buy time&quot; before being thrown into a million meetings, assignments, etc. Each person I have spoken to so far has had different suggestions on what the first several things to focus on, learn, etc are. However, they have all been incredibly valuable - and in many cases, they are things I would not have immediately known to even list down.<p>The great part about this approach (in my opinion), is that all of the people I&#x27;m meeting are essentially pre-selected for awesomeness by someone awesome. All of the conversations have been enormously valuable.<p>The feedback I&#x27;ve gotten from the people has been really great, and validating!<p>Bonus: I have been using an app called UpHabit (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uphabit.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uphabit.com&#x2F;<\/a>), which is a &quot;Personal Relationship Manager&quot;. It lets you tag people (e.g. by skill, passion, etc), and then assign regular reminders to reach out to them (e.g. &quot;connect with this person every 3 months&quot;), and lets you take notes on the conversations you had. I have found this tool enormously valuable, as its allowed me to &quot;scale&quot; my personal network, and trust that important people don&#x27;t get forgotten. I find myself a very LIFO person (the people I most recently connected with, I&#x27;ll remember to connect with. The folks from long time ago, I often forget). This tool has been helping me re-invigorate my personal&#x2F;professional relationships.<p>Note: I have no affiliation with either of the tool recommendations in this post, aside from finding them very useful!<p>Below are the questions I included in my intro email. If anyone would like to see the &quot;full&quot; email, I could probably generify it, and share directly.<p>---\nTell me about yourself! If you feel comfortable sharing, I’d love to hear what you are personally passionate about, and what topics, processes, areas etc you are passionate for at X.<p>What is your role &amp; your responsibilities at X?<p>What’s a “day in the life” like for you? This helps build empathy and understanding for your world, and how I could best help.<p>What are your top 3 priorities in the next two months?

I suspect most readers of HN are already very familiar with it.<p>Dijkstra is of course right that you can&#x27;t replace the precision of formal languages. Precision allows you to &quot;one-shot&quot; a spec. For simplicity, consider just machine code. A compiled program, given to the right machine, is a sort of message that can be delivered unidirectionally and understood perfectly. From the perspective of natural languages, that is nothing short of a miracle. Can you think of a case where you said something mildly complex and were understood perfectly, the first time, without questions and clarification?<p>To drop the need for formality and precision then, the tradeoff is this: we must program by conversation; the compiler must be able to talk back and collaborate with the programmer to &quot;discover&quot; the program spec. This is not talking back in the sense of waiting for input or mouse events--at that point we are already running the fully compiled program. Remember, this conversation is replacing the work of writing the program. We want something that substitutes for the information content of the compiled binary, that &quot;single message&quot; I can send to a computer to tell it unambiguously what to do.<p>Programming by conversation ends up being a kind of iterative programming by trial-and-correction.\n- Programmer says, &quot;I my windows to automatically close when it&#x27;s raining, and open when the sky is blue.&quot;\n- Compiler: &quot;I can almost do that, but what about when it&#x27;s both raining and the sky has patches of blue?&quot;\n- Programmer: &quot;That can happen?&quot;\n- Compiler: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of counterintuitive, but it happens occasonally&quot;\n- Programmer: &quot;Well when that happens just keep the windows closed&quot;\n- Compiler: &quot;Ok, but what about-&quot;\n- Programmer interrupts: &quot;Do the other edge cases happen often?&quot;\n- Compiler: &quot;Maybe 0.1% of the time.&quot;\n- Programmer: &quot;Ignore them and just let the system crash and call for help--I can just come work the windows myself those days&quot;\n- Compiler: &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ll just need to ziptie a few motors to the windows like so, and-&quot;\n- Programmer: &quot;Whoa whoa, can&#x27;t we make it prettier?&quot;\n- Compiler: &quot;I guess... gonna take a while though&quot;\n- Programmer: &quot;Oh, well I&#x27;m in a hurry.

Still probably immensely complex to build, and Dijkstra&#x27;s point about ease of expression stands strong--some things are much, much faster to say in formal language rather than by having a slow conversation that whittles away the ambiguities, and it increases the amount of work from both Programmer and Compiler (conversations take mental energy!).

I appreciate that the article is about objective self-evaluation and self-improvement, but that requires a good understanding of why you really didn&#x27;t get the job. And it&#x27;s possible the feedback you are getting is not the whole story.<p>Back in 2003 I was a young C++&#x2F;C&#x2F;Java developer with a couple of years of experience looking for a new job in a new town. I felt like I was talented and capable and was hungry to prove myself. It was a tougher market in those days so I was applying anywhere that posted a job that seemed like a fit. I got rejected time and time again and most of the time I didn&#x27;t even get a rejection. I never even heard back at all. I was ignored. It was demoralizing.<p>I knew if I could just get an interview, I&#x27;d have a great shot at a good job. But I couldn&#x27;t even get an interview. I felt like a failure.<p>I finally landed a C++ gig at a company I accidentally applied to twice (they gave me an interview because they thought I was resilient). It turned out to be a great experience. I got to tackle hard problems, learned a lot, and was promoted quickly. I was soon managing the team I was originally hired to write code for.<p>After a few years of that I was headhunted to work for a consulting firm that specialized in what later became DevOps (we were pushing CI&#x2F;CD back in 2006 and automated virtualization for build and test in 2007). As part of that job, I ended up with a few gigs at companies that had rejected me only a few years before. Here I was telling them how to make software at 4 times the rate they could have hired me for full time just a few years earlier. I&#x27;d won!<p>But really, I learned most of these companies hadn&#x27;t hired me for reasons that had nothing to do with me. I didn&#x27;t know who I was competing with. I didn&#x27;t know what specific traits they valued. I didn&#x27;t understand the stresses and risk and pressure those hiring managers were under when they compared the PDF I submitted to the PDF someone else submitted.<p>For example, the company that hired me after I applied twice rejected me first because I was from out of town. They had so many bad experiences with hiring and firing that they didn&#x27;t want to hire someone that had to move to take the job. <i>They were actually being considerate of my risk, not just their own.<\/i> They thought they were doing me a favor!<p>And in a few of companies I was now consulting for, I saw poor culture, poor talent, poor processes, and poor hiring practices. I saw HR people filtering out prospects because that person&#x27;s resume didn&#x27;t have everything on some magic, unadvertised checklist. I saw politics. I saw bias. I saw incompetence. Some of these places wouldn&#x27;t have been able to spot talent if their lives depended on it.<p>Really, I wasn&#x27;t the one that failed when I was rejected. They had failed by rejecting the wrong people. And I was fortunate they&#x27;d rejected me because it would have been an awful place to work. <i>Rejection is God&#x27;s protection<\/i>, I&#x27;ve heard it said.<p>So rejection wasn&#x27;t failure. It usually had nothing at all to do with what I really could do or couldn&#x27;t do. If I failed, it was in allowing rejection to affect my self-worth.<p>After running my own business for almost a decade, I&#x27;m back in the software industry. I&#x27;m fortunate to have a good job thanks to people I worked with previously, but I&#x27;m hungry for bigger challenges and believe I have the skills and capability to meet them. Except now I have a 9-year &quot;hole&quot; in my resume that doesn&#x27;t say Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Facebook or AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Cloud or whatever else the cool kids are doing. From a hiring manager&#x27;s perspective at those great jobs that attract lots of talented candidates, that means I&#x27;m a risk. But having been that hiring manager, having owned my own business, and having spent time in the trenches, I understand and sympathize.

Farnam Street&#x27;s Shane Parrish is the newsletter and subscription business, just like CNBC is in the financial infotainment business not in the investment or wealth creation business. They want you think of them as the authority by peddling ideas from an place of authority without actually providing a track record of success. CNBC&#x27;s Jim Cramer&#x27;s stock recommendations on evaluation had a worse than S&amp;P record and subsequently pulled from his site.<p>Mental model are quite interesting to read but applying them is another matter. It like asking Tiger Woods for golf lessons. I have been reading mental models for a couple decades now. I decided to pick one model and focus on applying it - invert always invert. This one simple rule has been really hard to apply. One, it is really really hard to remember to apply in the heat of decision making. Two, you cannot just <i>apply<\/i> it. That requires practice <i>with<\/i> an expert practitioner like an apprenticeship (guilds), extended internship (law&#x2F;finance) or residency (medicine). You cannot just pick it up by reading a damn article or book.<p>Let me give an analogy of trying to reason about physical properties from first principles which is another &quot;mental model&quot;. This is another popular exhortation - think from first principles just like Feynman or Fermi. Apparently, Fermi figured out the yield from the first test nuclear blast by tossing paper confetti over his head and calculating the yield from the scatter from the blast wave. I can think from first principles in one extremely narrow field where I happen to have half a decade of education and 20 years of experience. To reason from first principles like Fermi or Feynman in a broad domain like physics requires a world class mind, a world class education and a world of experience. Seriously, WTF.<p>Most mental model writing is akin to consuming youtube fitness porn. It looks easy to do, you look cool doing it and the end results are just spectacular. However, like Arnold or David Goggins it requires an inhuman dedication, purpose, ability to withstand pain, bounce back from trauma and just keep sacrificing attitude for a couple of decades with a healthy dose of failure. Most of the time the only person benefiting is the video creator from the ad-roll.<p>I appreciate the posts but I now believe these mental models are incredibly hard to do and like most of the self-improvement&#x2F;growth hacking genre is just good for entertainment and commerce 99.99% of the time."],"time":["2020-09-20 05:37:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jlj"],"id":[24533697],"kids":{},"parent":[24527003],"text":["This book talks about in mental models in depth, &quot;Deep Survival&quot; by Lawrence Gonzales [1].
