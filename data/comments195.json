The author makes some thoughtful suggestions and points out some common pitfalls.<p>Although recently, I&#x27;ve noticed another reason to tread lightly with metrics: Metrics have become a highly-charged topic among developers who consume a lot of Twitter, Reddit, HN and other developer chatter. The cynical response to any metrics tracking program is to claim that they will be gamed, or abused, or misused by management. Once your team has adopted this cynical mindset, they&#x27;re unlikely to see metrics any other way, so they get to work gaming and abusing the system.<p>In my experience, getting as much team buy-in as possible is the key to making metrics a success. It&#x27;s healthy to invite the teams to an open discussion about what metrics they think should be tracked. Give them an opportunity to openly discuss objections, and make a valid effort to acknowledge and work with their suggestions as you develop your metrics program. Ideally, you would find one or two metrics that benefit the team members directly rather than the company or management.<p>It&#x27;s important that developers can see the metrics as an open target to help them excel within the company, rather than a punitive measure or something that management can use as a substitute for real engagement. When team metrics decline, use that opportunity to open a discussion with the team. If you let metrics become a punitive measure or a guide for who gets promoted or fired, they will absolutely be gamed to death."],"time":["2020-02-05 01:22:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RcouF1uZ4gsC"],"id":[22242721],"kids":[22243013],"parent":[22242416],"text":["I don&#x27;t think so.

Column... well, here&#x27;s the impressive team. You can mark comments as &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;false&quot; which is more impactful than &quot;like&quot;.

Everybody has SOME down time. Hey, why not use our app while taking a shit? You can solve climate change with Thiel while waiting for your limo or taking a dump. Community&#x27;s approach? Celebs control the dialog AND they control the audience. Their magic is in selective controls: Text only the fans in Toledo and let them know about a new concert date or pass them a secret coupon. Or ask everyone in Boston where you should go get a burrito. That gives celebs real marketing power AND provides individual and personal value. And fans are interested because hey, they might get to tell Beyonce where to stop for a burrito while she is in a car to get one. Real connections, real value.

Why should they love her laws? \n    She tells them of Life and Death, and of all that they would forget. \n    She is tender where they would be hard, and hard where they like to be soft. \n    She tells them of Evil and Sin, and other unpleasant facts. \n    They constantly try to escape \n    From the darkness outside and within \n    By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good. \n    But the man that is will shadow \n    The man that pretends to be. \n    And the Son of Man was not crucified once for all, \n    The blood of the martyrs not shed once for all, \n    The lives of the Saints not given once for all: \n    But the Son of Man is crucified always \n    And there shall be Martyrs and Saints. \n    And if blood of Martyrs is to flow on the steps \n    We must first build the steps; \n    And if the Temple is to be cast down \n    We must first build the Temple. \n    \n    — T.

Making sites that are usable in more browsers than the top 2 (or 1) will weaken the amount of control that Google has, by allowing more browsers to appear and gain userbases."],"time":["2020-02-05 02:25:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["csagan5"],"id":[22239797],"kids":[22241659],"parent":[22236106],"text":["Credits to the ungoogled-chromium project [0] for the patch [1] which is also used in Bromite since 15 February 2018 to prevent this type of leaks; see also my reply here: [2]<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Eloston&#x2F;ungoogled-chromium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Eloston&#x2F;ungoogled-chromium<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;blob&#x2F;79.0.3945.139&#x2F;build&#x2F;patches&#x2F;ungoogled-chromium-Disable-Google-host-detection.patch\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;blob&#x2F;79.0.3945.139&#x2F;build&#x2F;...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;issues&#x2F;480#issuecomment-582070839\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;issues&#x2F;480#issuecomment-5...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-04 20:20:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ec109685"],"id":[22236404],"kids":[22237768,22237834],"parent":[22236106],"text":["You can see all the domains they add the header to here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;components&#x2F;variations&#x2F;net&#x2F;variations_http_headers_unittest.cc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;comp...<\/a><p>Previous discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21034849\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21034849<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-04 16:14:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AlphaWeaver"],"id":[22238258],"kids":[22239402,22240257,22239816],"parent":[22236106],"text":["According to this source code [0], it looks like this is in Chromium as well.

Common examples include holding the down arrow key for 30 seconds to scroll to the bottom of a large file in Vim, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1597&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1597&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>At least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple.

Many of the courses have had the same problem sets since 1985.<p>At the time, students had problems with it because &quot;how are we supposed to build apps with this knowledge?!&quot; There were even student efforts to &quot;modernize&quot; the curriculum by supplementing it with student run workshops on app building (which actually did really well).<p>Personally, I really appreciated the curriculum. I was a self taught programmer going into CS, having done lots of web dev and automation stuff with PHP &#x2F; Python. And I was really cocky about it. But as my adviser told me on my first day, &quot;yes, you&#x27;re a programmer, but you are not yet a computer scientist.&quot; I knew nothing about Computer <i>Science<\/i>, and had never touched a low level language, because I had no practical reason to. The next four years were valuable for me because they forced me to learn about topics that I will never teach myself.<p>And you know what?

No mouse, function keys and other modern facilities.<p>So, yeah, if you were writing a text editor at the time, you would be well served to do such things as implement modal view&#x2F;insert operation for more reasons than just the archaic keyboards.  These terminals were used to connect with remote systems at VERY LOW BAUD RATES.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine that BAUD 300 or 1200 was great speed at some point in history.  In that context, cursor keys or grabbing a scroll bar with a mouse to yank it around with abandon made no sense.  You were literally only able to receive from 30 to 120 characters per second...and a screen with 80 characters by 25 lines had 2,000!<p>This is another reason for which escape control commands had to be invented.  You had to be able to address you 80x25 canvas and place text where needed rather than to refresh the entire 2,000 character screen.<p>This is why, quite frankly, I hate the &quot;cult of vi&quot;.  Cult members are, for the most part, people who have no historical connection to where this tool came from and why.  We, at the time, would have KILLED for a graphical UI with a mouse.  Yet that was impossible at the time due to both machine and connection speed limitations.  You literally could not have used it even if you had it.<p>So, yes, at the time, if you had to write a text&#x2F;code editor (I wrote a few) you had no choice but to use a bunch of Ctrl-&lt;something&gt; codes and perhaps even implement a distinction between reading and inserting code.  I still remember sequences like Wordstar&#x27;s &quot;Ctrl-k-x&quot; running on an 8080 S-100 system with, yes, a VT-100 terminal attached.<p>Yes, the VT-100 introduced four cursor keys, but if you were writing software at the time you could not make the assumption that the user had access to cursor keys, most keyboards did not have them until much later.  That assumption was not safe when VI was created.<p>Like I said above, use whatever you like, I truly don&#x27;t care.  Just don&#x27;t lie to yourself about it, particularly when the truth is a matter of history.  I think most people who came up through that era of computing laugh at the vi&#x2F;vim cult because from our perspective --not yours-- it is complete nonsense.  This text editor had NO CHOICE but to be as it is due to being written for crappy computing hardware and environments of the time.  If you had to use one of those systems today you would be horrified.  If you had to write a text editor back then you would write it exactly this way.  And the minute a decent an ubiquitous GUI showed up you would drop it like a hot potato and try to forget the nightmares.<p>MIT Computer Scientists ought to know history and not print nonsense like that.  That entire paragraph about VI is basically wrong, historically wrong.  You can leave it like that and perpetuate a fantasy or correct it and at least show some respect for history.<p>And then do everyone a favor and explain that the speed of text entry is of no consequence whatsoever.  MIT should not propagate that cultist belief.  The time devoted to things having nothing to do with text entry is, in some cases, orders of magnitude greater than text entry.  Not everyone is a PHP script kiddie.  Some of us are writing real and complex software, some of it with life&#x2F;death potential, and code entry is so ridiculously low in the scale of where time is spent and what things are important that it is absolutely laughable to talk to someone who has become religious about text editors because of stuff like this out of a respected university.  Do you really think code entry speed and efficiency is important at all when working on the code for an MRI machine, a space capsule or an implantable insulin pump?  Exactly!<p>If coding is factory work, then, sure, mechanize as much as possible and count strokes.

I&#x27;m not talking about intermittent fasting, one meal a day, or fake fasting like juice fasting.  I&#x27;m talking not eating for 48 hours, 72 hours, or more.  With electrolytes, it becomes a lot easier than you think.  Once you can comfortably achieve 72 hours of no eating, it will seriously change your perspective on food.  You&#x27;ll realize that you&#x27;ve been throwing your money away every few hours on food you didn&#x27;t need to eat, and that everyone around you is wasting resources.  You&#x27;ll lose weight better than any diet there is.  Trust me.  When you do choose to eat, because you&#x27;ve saved your money, you can eat better food.  You will become healthier in general because fasting actually gives your organs a rest and heal.  Once you&#x27;ve done a few fasts, you may find that you&#x27;re able to sleep a lot better.  Fasting is a skill because it takes discipline.<p>- Get to know your neighbors.  This is really not that difficult at all, but we avoid it because we see new social connections as &quot;work&quot; to maintain, whereas it&#x27;s just easier to go home and watch Netflix alone.  I&#x27;ve realized that having a small social network wherever you live is nice and makes you feel connected with your community.  One of my best friends used to be my neighbor, whom I wouldn&#x27;t have had lots of great experiences with had I not talked to him, like most people.<p>- Learn to cook sous vide style.  You can do this the poor man&#x27;s way using hot water and a thermometer, even with your dishwasher.  But I suggest just getting an automated sous vide circulator and using that.  You can make steak, pork chops, eggs, etc., that taste like they&#x27;re made at a restaurant, or better!  It&#x27;s clean, which is good if you live in an apartment, and very difficult to screw up.  Unlike barbecue, you don&#x27;t have to pay close attention to it.  You can pan sear your meat afterwards, or even sear using a George Foreman grill for even easier cleanup.  Because sous vide will help you cook tasty food, you will find yourself cooking at home more.  People will be blown away by how good your steaks are.<p>- Learn about emergency planning.  Most people(Americans, anyway) are woefully unprepared for emergencies and disasters, and even a lot of those who think they&#x27;re prepared are mistaken in thinking that a few granola bars and a flashlight will save them.  Learn what it takes to get yourself and your family prepared, and you will feel a sense of security when the day comes that a violent storm comes, or an earthquake hits, or your home is in the way of a wildfire, or there&#x27;s civil unrest, or <i>worse<\/i>.  This is not a fringe idea or &quot;doomsday prepping&quot;.  President Obama told everyone to prepare for these possibilities, and the Department of Homeland Security encourages us to prepare.  The website ready.gov is a good place to get started.

In Toronto I make about 10% less then what I did in NYC if you don&#x27;t factor in exchange rate. But since I did my entire academic career from undergraduate to phd in Canada, I am able to enjoin a large amount of tuition tax credits which sort of makes up for it. This year I invested in some property downtown Toronto which I plan to hold onto, either living here or leasing it if I leave.<p>However, I think given the right opportunity I would still head back to the U.S. Things are fucked in the U.S. but the sense of scale, velocity is unmatched. In Toronto you feel that people&#x27;s attitude is just not the same. There is no hunger or lust to be number #1 and I have always been competitive personality type. In NYC even traditional enterprise corporations (where I worked) there is an intensity and drive that&#x27;s missing here. Call it the american spirit.<p>Salary as this stage is relatively unimportant, making 150 or 250k is about the about the same to me. But the scale and types of opportunities is something else. There are roles and jobs that only exist in the U.S.<p>That being said, for me going back is just a tour of duty, once you are past the journeyman stage of your life and wanting to start a family, then Canada wins unquestioned. The environment, benefits, healthcare, and most importantly education for your children will outweigh just about any salary you can command state-side. Because now you are talking about intangible things that are harder and harder to buy with money.<p>My opinion is, stay in the U.S. when you are young and&#x2F;or talented. Then, if you are of Indian or Chinese birth, move elsewhere to start a family and take a senior position in Canada. Typically if you come from reputable shop state-side and demonstrate your worth, you can find a job where people will treat you with respect for that experience. They might not be able to compensate you the same way but you can usually get bumped up a notch.<p>If you are of white or European heritage and you are in a good place then you can consider staying the U.S. if you can make it work."],"time":["2020-02-04 17:02:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zyang"],"id":[22232282],"kids":{},"parent":[22232036],"text":["Raw numbers don&#x27;t tell the whole story.

Unfortunately, all they could get was an visa that they bestow and control, putting them in a position to determine micro aspects of a would-be immigrants life.<p>Right. This utterly corporate self serving H1B guest worker visa system that undermines markets and is an affront to freedom did terrible damage to the public perception of skilled immigration.<p>Want to be clear, I don&#x27;t blame anyone for working on an H1B, this wasn&#x27;t your choice, and it was your only option. Don&#x27;t blame you for going to Canada, either. But I just don&#x27;t buy it from the corporate lobbyists. This was hardly a bug, to the companies that make heavy use of the H1B, the control over the worker&#x27;s right to live int the US is a feature, and they lobbied hard for it."],"time":["2020-02-04 23:24:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AzzieElbab"],"id":[22234566],"kids":[22235200],"parent":[22232036],"text":["What boom?

I do not think they are getting comparable scrutiny from researchers, seeing as BLAKEx hashes are ARX, and also changed considerably since the SHA3 contest (so it is far from clear that the scrutiny that BLAKE did receive translates to BLAKE2 or BLAKE3)."],"time":["2020-02-05 00:15:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zackmorris"],"id":[22237159],"kids":[22238511],"parent":[22233295],"text":["Summary of hashing function security in bits, for convenience:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secure_Hash_Algorithms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secure_Hash_Algorithms<\/a><p>Since collision resistance is roughly half the number of bits, it seems unconscionable to me that anything below 256 bit hashes even exist, because 64 bits is crackable but 128 bits effectively never will be.

To put the entire blame on management consultants for wealth inequality and then to say, btw, Pete is one of them - it reeks of agenda politics and a hit piece.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about the actual substance of the article, which there is surprisingly little. First, the author claims that managers used to come from the working class before 1955, and that the managerial consultant class made it so that working class people could never become managers.<p>A more plausible explanation is that in the older days, planning capacity was more evenly distributed among the working class and as the education system in the US matured, smarter people with the capability for planning and strategy were less likely to start off as a clerk or factory worker.<p>Second, the author claims that the managerial consultant class is responsible for wealth inequality by systematically reducing middle management and pushing the &quot;profits to shareholders&quot; maxim that has dominated corporate America. He implies that America would be just as wealthy and much more evenly distributed if they didn&#x27;t exist.<p>As much as I would love to pull out a torch and ascribe blame the way the author does (blissfully), it&#x27;s just not what is happening. No one wants to hear this, but middle managers were cut out not because of an agenda but because they were over payed and inefficient, as measured by the economic system.<p>It&#x27;s popular but unfair to say that companies benefit the shareholders at the cost of society. Companies benefit the consumer the most through better products and lower costs, which is a tenant of globalism and largely true, as we&#x27;ve experienced a consumption boom that we&#x27;ve never experienced in the history of mankind. Standard of living is incredibly high as consumers.<p>However, consumers are also the employees of companies, and wages have been stagnant for a long time. But it&#x27;s not that smart, rich, capable people steal from poor, middle class, working people, but rather the systemic properties of capitalism make wealth unequally distributed as a byproduct of producing value efficiently. If you must scratch the itch to blame something, blame the system, not the people in the system.<p>This problem of growing inequality existed for a long time but the lack of visibility and ultra cheap consumption by companies exploiting global opportunities to temporarily reduce cost of goods placated most Americans. Employees (consumers) still get gains from the economy by benefitting from stuff being either cheaper or continually better quality. As long as we can continue to reduce costs or improve quality at same cost, then stagnant wages is not an issue because standard of living is still rising.<p>(Yes, I know standard of living as a metric has been constant or falling since forever, but you can&#x27;t compare telegraphs to iPhones).<p>Well, after employing cheap labor from 3rd world countries and making possibly the cheapest produced goods in history from China, we&#x27;ve mined out all the global opportunities. Going even cheaper is no longer an option (although there is no lack of trying) - that bandaid is no more, and now people want a stronger fix - this has been the conversation topic of the election and for most America for about 5-10 years.<p>To do what the author does - imply that people, not systems, are to blame - is a step back in terms of discourse. It indicates to me that the author puts blame and agenda politics over a desire to understand and solve issues, and cleverly masks it by sounding intelligent."],"time":["2020-02-04 05:44:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22232381],"kids":{},"parent":[22231579],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-04 05:23:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["jshaqaw"],"id":[22232163],"kids":[22232548,22233115,22232238],"parent":[22231579],"text":["American democracy, the left believes, cannot be rejuvenated by persuading elites to deploy their excessive power somehow more benevolently.

To explain lift intuitively we need two ingredients: the Laplace equation and the Kutta condition.<p>Most people have an intuitive understanding of the Laplace equation. For example lightning usually hits the peak of mountains. The reason is that in solutions of Laplace equations, field gradient is proportional to curvature. In fluid dynamics, this field is called the stream function. The top of airfoil is more curved than the bottom so the stream function gradient is higher on top which results in higher wind speeds over airfoil.<p>But the second ingredient is the Kutta condition which represents viscosity.

There is a second, nontechnical level of analysis that is intended to provide us with a physical, commonsense explanation of lift.
