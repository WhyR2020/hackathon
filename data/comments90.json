I&#x27;m scared of it becoming another one of these, &#x27;John Conway, inventor of the celebrated Game of Life...&#x27; I told you, every time I turn to a book, a new math book, I look up the sacred name and it says: &#x27;Conway, Game of life, pages 34 to 38.&#x27;  And that&#x27;s roughly all it says.  And how can I say it---it&#x27;s not character assassination, exactly, it&#x27;s quality assassination.  I regard Life as trash, and frankly.  I mean, it was a real part of my life to have discovered it and so on.  And I don&#x27;t think it should be totally removed.  But it seems to be all that I&#x27;m known for, among the general public. ... This was never a big deal as far as we were concerned.  This was just a recreation, a game we played.  Somehow it became a bit more important later on, or at least it did in the eyes of other people.  I never thought of it as very important, I just thought of it as a bit of fun.  In fact, in a way, I felt ashamed of it.  I don&#x27;t think it counts in the mathematical community, or at least in the serious mathematical community.  I don&#x27;t think any of my Princeton colleagues think this Life game is of any importance.  I don&#x27;t know.

In increasing order of difficulty, you need to:<p>1. make a set of dynamical rules that matches general relativity in the low energy limit, such as recovering Lorentz invariance and the Einstein field equation (this is supposed to be the easiest part -- without at least doing this, a theory of everything is worth less than the graph doodles in my middle school notebooks)<p>2. demonstrate that you can add something that looks like matter<p>3. reproduce effects that we know have to appear in quantum gravity in the semiclassical limit, such as Hawking radiation and black hole entropy<p>4. demonstrate that you can add matter that behaves like the Standard Model<p>5. make specific predictions that we didn&#x27;t already know from purely semiclassical considerations<p>6. find a way to verify those predictions<p>7. have the predictions actually be correct upon verification<p>These 7 steps are hard, which is why nobody has managed to do them. But it looks like Wolfram hasn&#x27;t even bothered to start on step 1. His new book is just hundreds and hundreds of pages of pretty graphs and big words.

This coming from a pre-version 1 user of terraform (when pretty much the only support was the AWS provider). For me HCL was never the killer feature of Terraform, I personally think it was the resource abstraction and providers that made it the best choice at the time. Chef&#x2F;Ansible runs were always dangerous because as most of us will know from hard learnt lessons, &quot;what you see isn&#x27;t necessarily what you get&quot;. Having a DAG, tracking dependencies between resources, and getting a &quot;this is what you have, this is what you&#x27;ll get&quot; when you apply a change is the core of what makes terraform great... but this isn&#x27;t the language, I&#x27;d actually argue HCL is where most of it&#x27;s problems were. The hacks one had to make before HCL 2.0 to get any type of reuse were to be frank, awful. They were also non-obvious, so you had to either pass the knowledge on in your team like a &quot;sage&quot; which isn&#x27;t scalable for smaller&#x2F;midsize teams, or let people hit those walls and waste more collective time. Writing languages is hard, and it took Hashicorp years to get it &quot;mostly&quot; right. Though the ergonomics of HCL I would still say aren&#x27;t very nice or very developer friendly.<p>Now to Pulumi&#x27;s merits, if you dive into it&#x27;s architecture you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s actually users from terraform providers under the hood (very well tested code bases). So it will do things like build a DAG, track dependencies, and give you a diff before you apply anything. From what I can tell it&#x27;s just changed how you interact with the terraform internals (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more complicated than this, but this is my simple understanding of it). Sure you can get code ordering problems, like any imperative language but it doesn&#x27;t make it any more unsafe to run as you&#x27;re protected by the same plan&#x2F;apply type setup as Terraform. You can also rely on the same language specific quality controls you already rely on. Things like unit tests, integration tests, code coverage, IDE integration etc. Personally I think a better use of time is teaching team members about the infrastructure fundamentals who have an interest in learning them, over getting them to also split focus on a language they will only use in one situation."],"time":["2020-04-15 09:57:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["beders"],"id":[22872299],"kids":[22872331,22872462,22877596],"parent":[22866714],"text":["Can your DevOps read and manipulate code?\nIf no, don&#x27;t adopt a tool like this.\nYour Ops guys will hate you.<p>Furthermore, the code can&#x27;t be analyzed very well with tools.\n(aka gradle vs. maven)<p>You want to make the same change to 20 scripts?\nTrivial with a declarative language you can parse easily.<p>Non-trivial if you have code.\nYou better have those re-factoring tools at hand.<p>If you environment requires complex scripts to get up and running, that is a strong hint that you are not done yet. \nCan it be simplified further?"],"time":["2020-04-15 00:32:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AaronFriel"],"id":[22868556],"kids":[22868656,22869738],"parent":[22866714],"text":["I&#x27;ve been using Pulumi for about a year for deploying stateful and stateless services on Google Cloud Platform, AMA."],"time":["2020-04-14 19:13:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sandGorgon"],"id":[22869102],"kids":[22869532],"parent":[22866714],"text":["Since Pulumi extends to the k8s configuration world as well - i wonder what the Pulumi devs think of jsonnet and cue (previous discussion here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20362951\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20362951<\/a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20847943\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20847943<\/a>)"],"time":["2020-04-14 19:52:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Sytten"],"id":[22871850],"kids":{},"parent":[22866714],"text":["How is the support for AWS ECS?

We needed a solution that could enable collaboration among a highly distributed team on a shared database whose primary function was the curation of high-quality datasets with a very rich structure, storing information about everything from religious practices to geographic extent.<p>The historical databank was a very challenging data storage problem. While the scale of data was not particularly large, the complexity was very high. First there were a large number of different types of facts that needed to be stored. Information about populations, carrying capacity, religious rituals, varieties of livestock etc. In addition to this each fact had to be scoped with the period over which the fact was likely to be true. This meant we needed to have ranges with uncertainty bars on each of the endpoints. Then the reasoning for the data point had to be apparent on inspection. If the value for population was deduced from the carrying capacity, it is critical for analysis to understand that this is not a &quot;ground fact&quot;. But even ground facts require provenance. We needed to store the information about which method of measurement gave rise to the fact, and who had undertaken it. And if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, we needed to be able to store disagreement - literally the same fact might have two different values as argued by two different sources, potentially using different methods.<p>On top of this we needed to be able to allow data entry by graduate students who may or may not be reliable in their transcription of information. So additional provenance information was required about who put the fact into the database.<p>Of course, all of this is possible in an RDBMS but it would be a difficult modeling task to say the least. The richness of data and the extensive taxonomic information makes using a knowledge graph look more appropriate. Given that Trinity College Dublin had some linked data specialists we opted to try a linked data approach to solving the problem.<p>Unfortunately, the linked-data and RDF tool-chains were severely lacking. We evaluated several tools in an attempt to architect a solution, including Virtuoso and the most mature technology StarDog, but found the tools were not really up to the task. While StarDog enforced the knowledge graph or ontology as a constraint on the data, it did not provide us with usable refutation witnesses. That is, when something was said to be wrong, insufficient information was given to attempt automated resolution strategies. In addition, the tools were set up to facilitate batch approaches to processing data, rather than a live transactional approach which is the standard for RDBMSs.\nOur first prototype was simply a prolog program using the prolog database and temporary predicates which could be used within a transaction such that running updates could have constraints tested without disrupting the reader view of the database. (We thought that over time the use of prolog would be a hindrance to adoption as logic programming is not particularly popular – though there are now several green shoots!).<p>Not long after this we were asked to attempt the integration of a large commercial intelligence database into our system. The data was stored in a database in the 10s of gigabytes keeping information about all companies, boards of directors and various relationships between companies and important people over the entire course of the Polish economy since the 1990s. This, unsurprisingly, brought our prototype database to its knees. The problem gave us new design constraints. We needed a method of storing the graph that would allow us to find chains quickly (one of the problems they needed to solve), would be small enough that we didn&#x27;t run out of main memory and which would also allow the transaction processing to which we had grown accustomed. \nThe natural solution was to reuse the idea of a temporary transaction layer, but to keep them around longer - and to make these layers very small and fast to query. We set about looking for alternatives. We spent some time trying to write a graph storage engine in postgres. Ultimately, we found this solution to be too large and too slow for multi-hop joins on the commercial intelligence use-case. Eventually we found HDT (Header-Dictionary-Triples). On evaluation this solution seemed to work very well to represent a given layer in our transactions as well as performing much better and so we built a prototype utilizing the library.<p>Unfortunately, the HDT library exhibited a number of problems. First it was not really designed to allow programmatic access which was required during transactions and so we found it quite awkward. Second, we had a lot of problems with re-entrance leading to segfaults. This was a serious problem on the Polish commercial use case which needed multi-threading to make search and update feasible. Managing all of the layering information in prolog was obviously less than ideal - this should clearly be built into the solution at the low level. We either had to fix HDT and extend it. Or build something else.<p>We opted to build something else and we opted to build it in Rust. Our specific use cases didn&#x27;t require a lot of the code that was in HDT. We were not as concerned with using it as an interchange format (one of the design principles for HDT) and in addition to the layering system, we had plans for other aspects to change fairly drastically as well. For instance, we needed to be able to conduct range queries and we wanted to segment information by type. HDT was standardized for a very different purpose and it was going to be hard to fit it into that shoe. The choice of Rust was partly one borne of the pain of tracking down segfaults in HDT (written in C++). We were willing to pay some upfront cost in development time not to search, oft times fruitlessly, for segfaults.<p>At this point our transaction processing system had linear histories. The possibility of tree histories, i.e. of having something with branching was now obvious and relatively simple to implement. It went on to the pile of things which would be &quot;nice to have&quot; (a very large pile). It wasn&#x27;t until we started using the product in a production environment for a Machine Learning pipeline that this &quot;nice to have&quot; became more and more obviously a &quot;need to have&quot;.<p>As with any technical product of this nature there are many different paths we could have followed, after spinning out from university and attempting to pursue a strategy of implementing large scale enterprise graph systems with some limited success, we decided to shift to open source and become TerminusDB (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;terminusdb&#x2F;terminus-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;terminusdb&#x2F;terminus-server<\/a>). Potentially a long road, but a happier path for us. We also decided to double down on the elements in TerminusDB that we had found useful in project implementation and felt were weakest in existing information architectures. These are the ability to have very rich schemas combined with very fine-grained data-aware revision control enabling the types of Continuous Integration &#x2F; Continuous Deployment (CI&#x2F;CD) used extensively in software engineering to be used with data. We think that DataOps, basically DevOps for data or the ability to pipeline and reduce the cycle time of data, is going to become more and more important for data intensive teams.<p>The name ‘TerminusDB’ comes from two sources. The Roman God of boundaries is named Terminus and good databases need boundaries. Terminus is also the home planet of the Foundation in the Issac Asimov series of novels. As our origin is in building the technical architecture for the Global History Databank, the parallels with Hari Seldon’s psychohistory are compelling.<p>To take advantage of this DataOps&#x2F;’Git for data’ use case we implement a graph database with a strong schema so as to retain both simplicity and generality of design. Second, we implement this graph using succinct immutable data structures. Prudent use of memory reduces cache contention while write-once, read-many data structures simplify parallel access significantly. Third, we adopted a delta encoding approach to updates as is used in source control systems such as git. This provides transaction processing and updates using immutable database data structures, recovering standard database management features while also providing the whole suite of revision control features: branch, merge, squash, rollback, blame, and time-travel facilitating CI&#x2F;CD approaches on data. Some of these features are implemented elsewhere, the immutable data structures of both Fluree and Datomic for example, but it is the combination that makes TerminusDB a radical departure from historical architectures.<p>In pursuing this path, we see that innovations in CI&#x2F;CD approaches to software design have left RDBMSs firmly planted in the past. Flexible distributed revision control systems have revolutionized the software development process. The maintenance of histories, of records of modification, of distribution (push&#x2F;pull) and the ability to roll back, branch or merge enables engineers to have confidence in making modifications collaboratively. TerminusDB builds these operations into the core of our design with every choice about transaction processing designed to ease the efficient implementation of these operations.<p>Current databases are shared knowledge resources, but they can also be areas of shared destruction. The ability to modify the database for tests, for upgrades etc is hindered by having only the single current view. Any change is forced on all. The lack of fear of change is perhaps the greatest innovation that revision control has given us in code. Now it is time to have it for data. Want to reorganize the structure of the database without breaking all of the applications which are using it? Branch first, make sure it works, then you can rebase master in confidence.\nWhile we are satisfied with progress, databases are hard and typically take a number of years to harden. It is a difficult road as you need to have something which works while keeping your options for progress open. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.<p>We hope that others will see the value in the project and contribute to the code base. We are committed to delivering all features as open source and will not have an enterprise version. Our monetization strategy is to roll out decentralized data sharing and a central hub (if TerminusDB is Git for data, TerminusHub will be the ‘GitHub for data’) in the near future. Any cash that we generate by charging for seats will subsidize feature development for the core open source database. We are not sure if this is the best strategy, but we are going to see how far it takes us."],"time":["2020-04-14 18:16:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tlowrimore"],"id":[22870244],"kids":[22870623],"parent":[22867767],"text":["This looks really great.

Here is small excerpt.<p><i>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner\nexpect as his reward?<p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights\nin his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially\nthings of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of\nGod&#x27;s delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness\nand newness of each leaf and each snowflake.<p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to\nother people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and\nto find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not\nessentially different from the child&#x27;s first clay pencil holder &#x27;&#x27;for Daddy&#x27;s office.&quot;<p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like\nobjects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in\nsubtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in\nfrom the beginning. The programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried\nto the ultimate.<p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the\nnonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.<p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable\nmedium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly re- moved from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air,\nfrom air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of\ncreation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily\ncapable of realizing grand conceptual structures.

My first piece of advice is that nobody here knows who you are, nobody here knew you as a teenager, and nobody is going to understand what &quot;love programming&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t enjoy it&quot; actually means for you. The point is: anybody who claims that they got de-burned-out with this one trick isn&#x27;t necessarily dishonest or naive, and if something in the comments here resonates, then by all means try it out. But they might be offering a good prescription for the wrong diagnosis.<p>This may sound dismissive or condescending and I promise it isn&#x27;t my intent: have you considered speaking with an actual therapist? As a society we tend to think of therapists as something you do when you&#x27;re mentally ill, but you don&#x27;t just go to the dentist when you suspect you have a cavity: mental hygiene is important, and humans are universally bad at self-diagnosis, either physiological or otherwise.<p>In my current job I write Python, which I really don&#x27;t like very much and I get burned out on Python-specific things. But I know my feelings of burnout are due to things that would be true regardless of the technical environment - and that an overall job with Python is far preferable to my previously miserable job with F#. And there&#x27;s a lot of non-job stuff going on - such as the historic pandemic, and domestic stresses from being cooped up at home.<p>So speaking with a therapist about what&#x27;s actually eating you might be quite worthwhile. If it is just burnout with programming, there really are specialists out there who might give well-informed, non-anecdotal advice. If it&#x27;s something else, then having a professional suss it out means you can make better decisions about major aspects of your life. Plus, therapy is something that&#x27;s easy to do over videochat.

Now that I&#x27;m older (I can drive and I have money) I&#x27;m more at risk of stopping everything to fix the power tools in the name of quality.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on contract and it has felt like an uphill battle. On reflection, I see that only a small fraction of my time is spent making the software that I was hired to build. The rest goes into fighting with the stack and the business side of the job.<p>The hobby project that I have on the back burner is a single page of javascript (which I am learning) with a horrendous 500 line function that draws stuff. It pays no regard to web development best practices. These are intentional constraints that limit what the output can be for the sake of my enjoyment. It&#x27;s a ragged, broken mess, but it holds my interest. If I can just get it working, my friends will appreciate it!

I spent all my time doing it, constantly learning new things, breaking into new areas of discovery and then finding still more interesting thing. I wrote code for entertainment, I wrote code to relax, and sometimes people even <i>paid<\/i> me to write code.<p>Fast forward 20 years and I felt like it <i>hurt<\/i> to write code. So many things were in your way between the writing and the running, useless hoops to jump through, arbitrary changes to things that used to work just fine and now worked in a different way, why? why? WHY? I was pretty burnt out about it.<p>That lasted for a few years (okay probably closer to six or seven years) when I got a chance to help a teen learn to program who was super excited about it. I showed them the opaque APIs and they were thrilled, I showed them the crappy IDEs that prevented you from seeing what was really going on and they loved it, I showed them tool kits that created guard rails around what you could and could not code and that was just fine. They wrote line after line of code and marveled at each new thing.<p>It struck me that they were me and I was them and why were they so excited about this when I was so offended? After a lot of introspection I came to realize that the answer for me was that nothing had changed.<p>The reality I was missing was that computers haven&#x27;t changed a whole lot since the IBM 360. The <i>only<\/i> thing that changed is that they got faster, smaller, and way cheaper. But their <i>nature<\/i> hasn&#x27;t changed at all. They have registers, they have machine code, they have fast I&#x2F;O devices and slow I&#x2F;O devices, they have memory and displays and peripherals of various kinds. But at the end of the day, and this is especially obvious with various recreations and emulators, the computers of today are not really all that different in nature from the ones I learned programming on.<p>That in itself might not have been a killer, but the killer was <i>software<\/i> was by and large unchanged as well. After 20 years of programming, every single programming task felt like a <i>remake<\/i> of something I had already done. And for what? To implement it in the language of the day? Because you couldn&#x27;t get the source to one version so you rewrite it from scratch to get better licensing terms? Lots and lots of software was <i>done<\/i> in the sense that there really isn&#x27;t a good reason to re-<i>design<\/i> it, but there are a zillion reasons while you might be asked to re-<i>write<\/i> it.<p>Imagine if you were a screenwriter or a songwriter and someone said, &quot;Ok we need &#x27;Gone with the Wind&#x27; but now its going to have a gay couple, take place during the Syrian Civil war. Don&#x27;t change any part of the plot or the story or the relationships, just swap Arabs for Southerners, Syria for the South, and have the love interest die of MERS or something.&quot;<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that be a crappy job? What can you do with that? Where is the creativity? Where is the opportunity to express a fundamental truth in a new way?<p>I realized that I had come to hate programming because everyone was asking me to program the same stuff that had been written before but now in the Fluff Framework. I could do that with my eyes closed and so could any teen fresh out of college. What did they care that it had been implemented twice, three times, maybe five times previously in different ways?<p>Once I understood my problem I could start working on the solution. I decided to start writing software in areas where I had never written code before (like DevOps), or in areas where hardly anybody had re-written code before (like software radios). I also started to meticulously develop a workflow that ran on every operating system I might have to work on (Linux, Windows, and MacOS) that worked for me and saved me from having to relearn a new thing &quot;just because&quot; someone got it in their head that they could &quot;improve&quot; text editing for coders. When the friction between thoughts and code and execution are low, and the problems being coded or solved are novel, I <i>love<\/i> programming. Because I know what to avoid (arbitrarily complex tools and rewriting CRUD code again and again) my level of joy has gone up significantly.<p>I don&#x27;t know if any of this will resonate with your question but it worked for me."],"time":["2020-04-14 05:43:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sebastien_bois"],"id":[22862329],"kids":[22863417],"parent":[22860682],"text":["A few things to consider...<p>Try side projects.

The second one is out of my &#x27;comfort zone&#x27;, and is forcing me to learn some new unfamiliar frameworks that need to replace the old code.<p>Initially, I wanted to only allow myself to start on them once I had completed doing a lot of other things that needed to get done (being such a procrastinator) - but I found that just doing them without those restrictions relaxed me more, and allowed me to get those things done more easily anyways (it served as a diversion, but a good one that I didn&#x27;t need to feel guilty about).<p>If you&#x27;re coding day-in day-out, doing the same routine, think about &#x27;tuning out&#x27; at night - leave the computer off, and do something else altogether; take up a new hobby, or read some books, or anything that interests you. The point is to change the scenery a bit to recharge.<p>If it&#x27;s available to you, you might consider taking on (or asking for&#x2F;seeking) something that&#x27;s new to you at work, that opens up new opportunities, both for learning and potential advancement. Any good employer should recognize and appreciate that.<p>As others have noted, 20 years is fairly long time, especially if you&#x27;ve only done the same general thing; as such, it might also be worth considering a bigger change. Maybe it&#x27;s time to take on something else that&#x27;s more challenging, that can help you grow. That could be something along the tracks of a more managerial nature (or simply taking on more of a leadership role, if that sound too scary), or perhaps something in an entirely new direction.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of good feedback here - soak it in, think about it, and consider what might help you get that excitement back. Making changes doesn&#x27;t mean you give up what you love doing - it might be simply the thing you need to rekindle your interest in it."],"time":["2020-04-14 04:54:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mikekchar"],"id":[22861648],"kids":[22863180],"parent":[22860682],"text":["I wasn&#x27;t 20 years into my career when I did this (more like 10), but at one point I had a serious &quot;lapse of faith&quot; with regard to my career.  I was working for a terrible company with an even worse manager and I was miserable.  I didn&#x27;t know if I wanted to be a programmer any more.  I quit my job and didn&#x27;t look for another one.<p>Instead, I wrote free software -- initially just for a month.  I got up in the morning, had a shower and worked on whatever project seemed interesting to me at the time (which was actually the GNOME Corba ORB -- that&#x27;s how long ago this was ;-) ).  At first I was pretty unproductive (and I&#x27;m not sure I ever actually made a contribution... can&#x27;t even remember).  I watched the stock market go up and down on the TV and occasionally turned the channel for more educational content (I invented the &quot;Teletubbies Drinking Game&quot; -- Drink whenever they say &quot;eh oh&quot; and drink twice whenever they say &quot;again!&quot;... which is to say that I don&#x27;t think I ever lasted an episode).<p>Anyway, one day I was having a shower and I had an idea about programming (I can&#x27;t remember what it was).  I ran out of the shower and started typing away.  Every day after that I had a similar experience.  It took me a week before I realised that I was so preoccupied that I often wasn&#x27;t wearing any clothes. (Actual awkward conversation: I was chatting with a woman who was moving out of the apartment.  She recognised me: &quot;Oh you are that nice man who programs by the window every day.  Such a shame I will miss that from now on&quot;...)<p>After about 6 months of doing this, I realised that I loved programming.  I <i>hated<\/i> my job.  The hatred of my job so overwhelmed my natural love of programming that I got to hate it too.  But, like a starving man, as soon as I had the time to get back to my passion, I was ravenous.  After that, I was much more careful to take jobs that I liked.  I often worked for incredibly low salaries just because I liked the people or I liked the project.  I was also careful to save enough money so that I could always take a &quot;sabbatical&quot; -- just quit my job and spend half a year writing code that <i>I<\/i> wanted.  I was single (despite&#x2F;because of my proclivity for exhibitionist programming), so it was easier, but I think it can be made to work in a family setting too.<p>I think the best thing I can say is that when taking a job, it&#x27;s important to find a win-win situation.  I find that when I get in trouble it&#x27;s because I end up doing things that I think are important for the company, but which I don&#x27;t want to do.  Often these are things that my management don&#x27;t want me to do either, which leads to a bad relationship with the management.  I usually think, &quot;Oh this is crap!  They are totally dropping this stuff on the floor.  Someone has to clean up this mess&quot; and then get trapped into doing lots of stuff that saves the company, but destroys my soul (and somehow makes me an enemy of many of the people around me).  So instead, I just try to do the things that <i>both<\/i> my management and I want me to do.  Usually there is <i>more<\/i> than enough stuff that I want to do that we can find a mutually beneficial overlap.<p>The most important point: I let the company burn down around me as I play my fiddle.  Um... Maybe not the most apt analogy.  But I hope you get the point.  I only do the non-fun parts of my job, if I really get the impression that somebody wants me to do it!  That makes such a massive difference, it&#x27;s incredible (although I often make the same mistakes of the past, but I try to correct it).  When the company is intent on flying into a wall at 1000 miles an hour, I don&#x27;t stop it.

While there are times, tasks and aspect which I don&#x27;t like too much, or which can be depressing, overall I still enjoy it.<p>But maybe let me add some random points:<p>- I do side projects from time to time. All of the open source on GitHub. Either in some new programming language which I want to learn about and just try out, or some preferred well-known programming language but a new fun (maybe challenging) task. Or maybe not challenging but actually easy but still fun, e.g. like writing a small game. There are many possible variations and options for side projects, and each case can be rewarding. As you start from scratch, you can try out whatever you want. If you set the scope small enough, you can soon get some nice results. Maybe really the most fun side project is to write some small game. Side projects is also one of the best ways to widen your scope to new areas. Maybe also the only option. In some cases (but this should not be the focus), you can integrate the side project back into your day-to-day work.<p>- Maybe the project you currently work is too big, buggy, unorganized, and annoying to work with. Take a step back and think about ways how to solve some of the annoyances. Maybe some subsystem can be rewritten. Maybe the startup time is too long and this can be solved somehow. Invest some work in making your workflow easier. Turnaround time for development is important. Maybe you can develop a testing environment where the turnaround time of development and testing can be much faster. There are many options here. Many of the will require some initial work but this can be greatly rewarding. In general, for me the most annoying thing is when something is slow. When I need to wait too long until I see the result of sth I just tried out. It could also help to get some better hardware.<p>- Other hobbies despite programming can be important too. Probably most relevant is some sort of sport, or any activity for the body. Hiking in the nature can be nice too. Take frequent off-times. Make this regularly such that it becomes a routine. E.g. I have a couple of sport courses, some in the mid of the day (so this is my extended lunch break), some in the evening. They force me to stop the work I&#x27;m doing right now. This is often a good thing because it forces you to take a step back and rethink about what you are working on right now, if you really tackle it from the right angle, or if you maybe should shift your priorities on other things. And also this gives you time in developing some new ideas, maybe about your work, or also new fun side projects, or new other unrelated hobbies.<p>- Socialize. Talk with other people. If you live alone, maybe change that. Talking can also be technical. I enjoy it, to get some new input, or talk about some new technical thing I read about, or maybe also something I don&#x27;t know too much about. Talking can also be non-technical, about random stuff, about your hobbies, etc. If you are in a group with other shy people, just talk whatever is in your mind right now, even if the other people might not have a solution. Just talking about your programming problem, or whatever, helps."],"time":["2020-04-14 12:51:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mattlondon"],"id":[22862640],"kids":{},"parent":[22860682],"text":["For me, I needed to treat programming at work and programming at home as two different mental &quot;things&quot; that have zero correlaton. Programming is a skill like reading - you can do it at work and you can do it at home.  Do people get burnt out from reading emails or whatever at work so much that they don&#x27;t get enjoyment out of reading books or whatever in their own time? Perhaps, but it feels to me that reading is too much of a &quot;core&quot; or &quot;fundamental&quot; skill that you cannot allow your job to come to &quot;dominate&quot; or &quot;own&quot; that - it is a universal part of your life and education that it needs to exist separately from your day job - programming is the same.<p>Also I feel that there is a lot of pressure within communities like HN that implicitly (... or outright explicitly) makes you feel like you <i>should<\/i> always have a side project on the go, or you <i>should<\/i> be working on some amazing start-up idea, or you <i>should<\/i> be contributing to open source etc.  All of that is basically a second job I&#x27;d say - you need to apply the same mental energy and rigor doing that sort of thing as you would in your job. I feel like this is an unhealthy mindset and unfair expectation.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you but when I was a kid just starting out in programming I just messed about doing whatever I fancied without any expectations of &quot;releasing&quot; anything or turning a profit etc - I just scratched my own itch and left a chain of unfinished ideas and projects behind me as my mind wandered and I had <i>zero<\/i> mental attachment to any particular idea or objective.  I was free to follow my own path without feeling that I needed to give an idea justice and see it through to some kind of release or public distribution etc.<p>I now personally try to do the same now too - I try to avoid letting any ideas about &quot;releasing&quot;&#x2F;sharing&#x2F;distributing any of my spare-time work from creeping into my mind. If I go into something knowing that I might close the IDE the same evening and never ever open the file again, or I can write hideous hacky messes because why the hell not, or I can just forgo any kind of tests or repeatable builds etc etc then that is freeing and removes a lot of the mental baggage of doing a &quot;good job&quot; and let&#x27;s you concentrate on satisfying <i>your own<\/i> needs.<p>Oh and also unlike other people on here, I personally recommend JavaScript as a great language to use for personal messing about - flexible, universal, performant, and most importantly it has absolutely zero barrier to entry - you can litterly just open your browser&#x27;s dev console right now and you are up and running, or just create a .HTML file and you are up and running that way too without any joy-&#x2F;motivation-sapping bullshit or ceremony related to setting up build files&#x2F;python anaconda bollocks&#x2F;environment variables&#x2F;installing compilers or other nonsense - it just works right now with what you already have on any computer you sit at (... or you can go deeper and install typescript compilers or node+npm etc if you want to)  Ignore comments about churn or change-fatigue regarding JavaScript - the language itself is separate from the libraries people use and you can go a <i>long<\/i> way with the core language and modern standards-based APIs without ever touching an external library.<p>Good luck!"],"time":["2020-04-14 05:59:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ChrisMarshallNY"],"id":[22864648],"kids":{},"parent":[22860682],"text":["I deleted my rather cynical post, about how we can &quot;age out&quot; of frontline programming, and will replace it with this rather sunnier treatise:<p>Open source work.<p>I was a manager for over 25 years.

In the beginning (about 25 years ago), there wasn&#x27;t a good infrastructure for shared configuration management, so most of the work I did was published &quot;after the fact&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;deliverable&quot;).

Hundreds of thousands of lines of crafted, artisanal, small-batch, single-source code, in dozens of repos.

If you&#x27;re curious, you can see Xcode debugging an ARM64 app from the App Store here -- all of their inspection tools work out of the box! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;daeken&#x2F;status&#x2F;1242684576738271233\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;daeken&#x2F;status&#x2F;1242684576738271233<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-15 05:02:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kodablah"],"id":[22872057],"kids":[22872159],"parent":[22870905],"text":["I would think there&#x27;s value in wrapping up all of these steps into an easy-to-use CLI (that check for deps, download things as needed w&#x2F; opt-in custom paths, etc).

This led me to the belief that fear of death is really just a biological impulse, and that pressing that mental button that says death is scary is just... not actually a reflection of your mentality but a biological response which can be dulled by physical circumstances like illness.

The doctors all say, &quot;We can&#x27;t find anything wrong with you&quot; (apart from you heart racing randomly, your blood pressure spiking to dangerous levels, heart paplitations and various other problems).  But what if they missed something?  It&#x27;s pretty hard to gamble your life on this stuff.  I was absolutely fine until one day I wasn&#x27;t.  <i>Something<\/i> must have changed.<p>One of the problems with getting symptoms and not being able to diagnose the illness exactly is that you will never know.  Pain in your chest.  Difficulty breathing.  Complete lethargy.  It could be corona virus.  It could be a panic attack brought on by worrying about the corona virus.  You will never know unless you are tested (and even then it might not be right).<p>My experience has been that sometimes I take comfort in imagining that I have some strange disease that nobody knows about.  It certainly feels better to me than, &quot;My nervous system is making me ill through stress that I don&#x27;t know how to relieve&quot;.  But, I&#x27;ve also found that if I believe I&#x27;m ill, then the symptoms feel worse as well, even though I get some psychological relief from the stress of experiencing the symptoms.<p>The best way that I&#x27;ve come to deal with the problem is simply to believe that I will feel well again soon.  I may feel bad <i>now<\/i>, but <i>soon<\/i> I will feel better.  I may have an illness.  I may not have an illness.  It may be life threatening.  It may not.  Even if it is life threatening, there is nothing more I can do.  So it is best to believe that I will feel better soon.  This has helped me immeasurably, even though it is quite difficult to do.<p>I recently (and as a last resort) had a sleep test.  I averaged 52 apnic arousals per hour.  In other words, at most I was sleeping for a minute or so at a time.  They gave me a cpap machine and while I would be lying if I said all my symptoms are magically going away immediately, I <i>do<\/i> feel a lot better now that I&#x27;ve started to get used to the machine.<p>But the reality is that your belief is powerful medicine in an of itself.

She and 7 other doctors (8 in total) all fell ill in the same week. This was about 3 weeks ago.<p>My wife had a bit of fever for the first 2-3 days (~38C), and she mostly suffered from a bad headache for about a week, and a cough (mild) for about two weeks and a sore throat (mild) for the first few days. After a few days she also lost her taste and smell of food which all came back on day 12 roughly. She is also in her super early 30s and never had shortness of breath or other issues with the lungs. After 7 days she even returned to work as her body has fought off the virus by then (even though some symptoms might remain like a cough).<p>I contracted the virus from her obvioulsy whilst she was quarantined at home for 7 days. After 5 days I also started to get my first symptoms. It started with a lot of fatigue, a sore throat and really high fever.

When my fever soared I felt totally shit, but as soon as the paracetamol kicked in and my fever declined I was feeling better and was even able to do minor tasks at home.<p>My sore throat lasted for about a week, it first got worse and then disappeared. I also developed an annoying dry cough after 5 days which stuck with me for about a week. Today I have a mini cough left a bit, but that is normal again, just like with a normal cold a cough can stick with someone for weeks after being completely fine again.<p>My fever disappread after the first 2 days. I also had terrible headaches, which were the worst and lost my smell and taste, but no shortness of breath.

It was honestly a really mild flu after all. The actual flu which I had earlier this year was much worse if I&#x27;m honest. Not even two weeks after I got my first symptom I was working out in my garden and doing some mild cardio exercises again. Normally when I get a cold it affects my sinuses which means that I can&#x27;t do cardio for at least two full weeks as I always struggle to breath through my nose for quite some time, but COVID-19 doesn&#x27;t normally give you a runny nose and it didn&#x27;t give me one indeed which means that in my case COVID-19 was even much nicer to get than a regular cold.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of bad stigma and panic around COVID-19, but after all it&#x27;s just a new repiratory coronavirus, just like colds and the flu your body should be able to fight if off normally without any real issues, unless you already have some serious problems.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that COVID-19 is not a lottery or survival by <i>luck<\/i>.

NO EVIDENCES , rather the other way round, THAT A UNTREATED sever &quot;COVID&quot; is as deadly as a treated, no evidences at all..... but the suspect thats the other way round......"],"time":["2020-04-14 06:59:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["garganzol"],"id":[22863993],"kids":{},"parent":[22861403],"text":["To those scientific minds who enter the symptoms of Covid-19: if you find a desire and ability to experiment, you may find the courage to try a light ozone generator in a mostly closed room.<p>Healthcare systems of many countries are cornered by these assumptions: 1) light ozone generators cannot do a thing because they produce tiny concentrations of gas 2) the ozone is toxic.<p>While both of those statements are somewhat true, here is the thing.<p>The dangerous side of Covid-19 is its ability to target lungs in a fraction of patients. While this is a dangerous situation, it also makes it potentially susceptible to inhale treatments.<p>Now back to ozone. It is basically a recombined atoms of oxygen, but instead of ubiquitous O2, ozone is O3. As you might expect, it has higher oxidizing ability. Human can safely breathe ozone as long as its concentration goes below 0.2 mg&#x2F;m3.<p>Ozone is not only a breathable gas. It also has an ability to disinfect. For example, it deactivates the viruses by over-oxidizing its surfaces.<p>Regarding the concentrations. It was shown that to kill 90% of SARS-CoV you would need an exposure of 20-112 mg &#x2F; m3 during one minute. Which sounds like a lot but bare with me.<p>A disinfection with ozone has an accumulative effect, pretty much like with UV or radiation. For instance, a home ozonator (ozone generator) typically produces a concentration of 0.02 mg&#x2F;m3. It would not kill the virus in a minute. But it will start to do so in 17 hours of exposure (20 mg&#x2F;m3 &#x2F; 0.02 mg&#x2F;m3 &#x2F; 60 min&#x2F;hour = 16.6 hours).<p>Ozone can be generated in several ways. One of those is by exposing the air to UV-C. This is a preferable method for virus situation, because not only the desired gas is generated, but also because UV-C light has an ability to disinfect the air and surfaces by itself. A win-win.<p>Please note that UV-C may be critically dangerous to skin and eyes. To overcome that problem, UV-C lamp should be placed in a black or UV insulating box, where only a small laminar flow of air produced by the fan is exposed to UV-C. The suggested power of such a lamp would be something &lt; 10W where 3W looks like a sweet spot for a 18 m2 room.<p>Now to effects: tiny fractions of ozone would cause a small sedative effect. If the breath is difficult then you may find a tiny amount of O3 more supportive comparing to conventional air mixture which is already a big bonus.<p>In 17 hours or so of exposure, you are going to feel better, as the consumed concentration is already promises to deactivate a substantial amount of exposed virus material (like 90%).<p>The good things do not end here, as deactivation rate is exponential and in 34 hours you are going to get 99% of exposed virus material deactivated.<p>Now to the not so good things: ozone is slightly toxic and you would not be able to use it for too long. 3 days of presumably safe concentration is already close to a stretch. It not only damages viruses and bacteria, it also over-oxidizes human cells which leads to their eventual damage. It is usually felt like a soar throat.<p>The important points to consider when trying to implement the experiment like this: 1) safe O3 concentration 2) no direct human exposure to UV-C 3) room should be on a smaller side, as it is easier to control (8-20 m2 is a sweet spot) 4) the room should be mostly closed, do not ventilate the room more often than once or twice per 24 hours for short periods of time like 5-10 minutes; note, that you still need an air to breathe, so a &quot;mostly closed room&quot; would not mean a &quot;scientifically firmly closed room&quot;.<p>Did I try this extreme idea myself before publicly suggesting it? Yes, I did. Though for more conventional viruses like seasonal flu. I was never officially diagnosed with Covid-19, but I&#x27;m pretty confident I went through it in the middle of February when nobody had a test yet.<p>The idea may sound controversial to the most of population nowadays. But it surely is effective on viruses as I&#x27;ve experimented with it for 7 years.<p>I am putting this publicly to spark the minds of  researches, including professionals. This is a low hanging fruit so I&#x27;m surprised to admit that nobody had tried it before in scientifically controlled environment, with control groups and stuff.<p>DISCLAIMER: If you do this you do it on your own risk. The large dozes of ozone and UV can be extremely dangerous and may lead to fatal consequences or even death. This is not a scientifically proven treatment of Covid-19."],"time":["2020-04-14 11:10:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sabujp"],"id":[22862283],"kids":[22862393],"parent":[22861403],"text":["the word mask only comes up once in the entire writeup, when he went to the hospital.

It&#x27;s improbable CA still had an Rt above 1 the first week of April with covid deaths linear by the second week. More likely Rt was 1 about a week after the SIP (late march).<p>* Ignoring &quot;herd immunity&quot; effects of Rt. Some of the &quot;under control&quot; states (NY, Louisiana) have had very high infection rates which in their own end has dropped Rt down.  NYC is a strong example of this - with &gt; 20% of the city having been infected, well, Rt will drop dramatically just by so many contacts already having immunity.<p>* Implying this argues for states locking down now.  I agree there is heavy evidence favoring lockdowns weeks ago to have avoided many deaths, but at this point, any lockdown is going to take a week to have an impact on even confirmed cases.  The most susceptible populations (essential workers) are the very ones exempted from lockdowns (and less susceptible ones have already voluntarily socially distanced), so there&#x27;s likely not much gain to be had. Sweden is conveniently our low density control group using mostly voluntary measures (WA State is similar through March 23) and its peak passing a week ago is a sign that Rt drops under 1 faster than you think."],"time":["2020-04-14 17:48:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["birdyrooster"],"id":[22863230],"kids":{},"parent":[22861640],"text":["I also would like to see this broken down by city because the state highly dilutes the signal when trying to rate the responses of major metropolitan governments."],"time":["2020-04-14 08:26:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["standardUser"],"id":[22865367],"kids":{},"parent":[22861640],"text":["Are there similar calculations for European countries?

Economists widely endorsed eugenics in the first half of the 20th century, for example.  And many modern economists endorse a minimum wage, as eugenicists did then, but with even less regard for the harm it causes.  Personally, I find it hard to entertain an economist&#x27;s morality argument unless it goes something like, &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t do that because it could harm people.&quot;<p>In this article, The Economist is telling governments to force companies to produce &quot;large supplies at fixed prices&quot;.  Even if governments had that kind of authority in free countries, and they probably don&#x27;t, that sounds like a policy that could easily cause harm.  Companies can&#x27;t just push one lever to maximum and expect nothing else to change.  But most importantly, we don&#x27;t need it.  Yes, we&#x27;ve seen some small-time punks buy up too much hand sanitizer, but the big manufacturers are being decent.  As The Economist pointed out, &quot;3M, one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of high-end masks ... has stuck to its list prices and doubled its production.&quot;  So there&#x27;s not very good empirical or theoretical support for this idea.
