In the past, I spent over 7 years working on Apple Mail, and today I am really excited to share a new email client I&#x27;m building: Mimestream, a native macOS email client for Gmail.<p>Mimestream is written in Swift, and uses AppKit+SwiftUI for a clean, stock appearance. It&#x27;s designed to be fast, lightweight, and use a minimal amount of disk space. Mimestream&#x27;s advantages over using the Gmail web interface includes features like multiple accounts, a unified inbox, system notifications, swipe actions, dark mode, (some) offline support, tracker prevention, multiple keyboard shortcut sets, and more.<p>Mimestream differs from other email clients because it uses the Gmail API rather than IMAP, so it supports more Gmail-specific features like categorized inboxes, Gmail&#x27;s search operators, first-class labels support (apply multiple via <U+2318>L, set colors, etc), synced aliases, synced signatures, etc. I&#x27;m planning a lot more work in this area, including server-side filter configuration, Google Drive support, G Suite directory autocomplete, and more.<p>The app is a traditional email client that makes direct connections to Gmail and stores your data on your Mac. There are no intermediary servers with access to your account or copies of your messages. Mimestream is free for a limited time during the public beta, but will eventually be a paid app by the time it gets to the Mac App Store.<p>I hope you enjoy trying out the beta, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!"],"time":["2020-09-09 18:04:02"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["dugmartin"],"id":[24426291],"kids":[24428985,24429652],"parent":[24422432],"text":["Interesting to see the Gmail API being used for a general purpose email client when Google has a very visible note on the overview page that says:<p>&gt; Note: The Gmail API should not be used to replace IMAP for full-fledged email client access.

Spends ages perfecting her vim config file, and looks down on anyone that doesn&#x27;t use Arch Linux and some form of a window manager.<p>Perhaps there is a sweet spot between Joe and Jill&#x27;s philosophy towards useful, easy to learn and efficient software that doesn&#x27;t require an obsessive linux nerd to use.

I&#x27;m picturing a pipeline from science research, to exploratory&#x2F;researchy content creation, to deliverable content creation, where the middle bit gets little attention.  For examples...<p>Most intro astronomy content, K thru undergrad, gets the color of the Sun either simply wrong, or handles it misleadingly.  Resulting in even first-tier astronomy graduate students likely knowing it wrong.  Clips from Tappity show false color photos and art of the Sun.  Which if not handled carefully, is setting kids up for this morass of common misconceptions around Sun color.  What might &quot;handled carefully&quot; look like?  Good question.  Do you know of any context where that gets discussed?<p>Similarly, the Tappity &quot;exploded&quot; layers of Earth graphic[3] is variously misleading and aphysically colored (better than many).  Which is pervasive for such graphics.  Do you know of any community which might say &quot;variants of this common graphic abound, variously wrong - let&#x27;s put in the collaborative effort necessary to create one correct, and open license it&quot;?<p>Education content for kids often says the Sun warms the Earth.  But that&#x27;s only half the story, and I&#x27;ve never seen content which does the whole.  Earth is doing a bbq roll between too hot Sun and too cold deep space.  Even young kids might grasp the concept that with something uncomfortably hot, and another uncomfortably cold, you can attain comfort by alternating.  But we don&#x27;t say that.  Does anyone know of a setting for &quot;here is a commonly taught story that&#x27;s incomplete - let&#x27;s create exemplar content that fills it out&quot;?  Cold at night, at altitude, with cloudless skys, especially when dry... it&#x27;s a story that&#x27;s actionable, if not cut short.<p>Chemistry education content is famously bad.  Chem ed research describes it using adjectives like incoherent, leaving both teachers and students steeped in misconceptions.  But now XR content is coming.  And some of it is nifty.  But much of it is the usual wretched, now in 3D.<p>There seems a body of <i>badly<\/i> needed effort and work, very poorly incentivized, that&#x27;s not getting well addressed.

The universe cycles unevenly through phases of motion, it doesn&#x27;t magically start from nothing and then &#x27;die.&#x27; The conventional big bang theory is as bad as any other children&#x27;s tale going, it&#x27;s up there with Santa Claus.<p>We&#x27;re going to find a lot more supposed abnormalities like this over time. They&#x27;re not abnormalities, it&#x27;s the entrenched incorrect theories that are the problem.<p>The universe (everything that exists) is drastically larger than we already think it is. Humans are arrogant, we didn&#x27;t realize the extent of the micro world, and the same exact mistake is being made at the macro scale. What they think is a singular ~14-15 billion year old universe, is nothing more than one collection of galaxies, there are many more like it nearby (many as in trillions and trillions). The micro world was far smaller than we imagined; the macro world is far larger than we&#x27;re imagining. It&#x27;s the same mental mistake playing out, caused by the same arrogance. What&#x27;s beyond the &#x27;universe&#x27; that we can see so far? More massive collections of galaxies, similar to the one we inhabit that we mistakenly call the universe."],"time":["2020-09-09 18:58:07"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["codezero"],"id":[24427918],"kids":[24428425,24428322,24430152],"parent":[24426407],"text":["I am on the fence on this.<p>Culturally, it&#x27;s my feeling that funerals are not for the dead, they are for the living, and this is a way for the dead to cut into the lives of people who now get to move on.<p>The &quot;zing&quot; element of it is just a way for someone to be hurtful to people who can never have closure on that...<p>On the flip side - not everyone is cynical, they may say some of the things they had a hard time saying when they were alive, affirmations that maybe made them uncomfortable, or admitting wrongs that may have been too difficult to do when alive.<p>I&#x27;d hope that a service like this would be thoughtful, and pensive, and think of those who are left behind as a primary focus.<p>Edit: and this is all possibly moot as it sounds like this person isn&#x27;t even real (I get that this is speculation, but I&#x27;m just sharing it because I agree, this story is questionable): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24427464\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24427464<\/a><p>Edit 2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24428153\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24428153<\/a><p>Pretty good evidence this is actually real, so, yeah, my comment stands though :)"],"time":["2020-09-10 03:20:42"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["AndrewKemendo"],"id":[24426863],"kids":[24426955,24426952],"parent":[24426407],"text":["One of my first &quot;startups&quot; was basically this as a service in 2006 [1] and the Houston Chronicle did a brief story on it under &quot;Get the Message&quot; in 2007[2].<p>The idea was basically that anyone could pay to get any message delivered anonymously using our service as a cut out [3].<p>1.

And I&#x27;ll answer 2 questions, not 1.<p>1. Why do we need Bayesian estimation? Can&#x27;t we just all use MLE, and live in harmony? If MLE was good for Gauss and Laplace and Fisher, why isn&#x27;t it good for me? Answer: for many problems the likelihood function is unbound. In fact the cases where the likelihood function are bounded, so the MLE makes sense, are few and far between. But if you think of the likelihood as a function with a hump somewhere, you have several choices for a single number that best describes the function: mode, mean, median for example. MLE corresponds to mode, can we use the mean instead? Also, does it not even make better sense to use mean rather than mode? Sure it does, and if you use mean you become a Bayesian. But can the likelihood be unbounded and have a finite mean, you ask? Yes, it happens quite often, sufficiently often that in practice people don&#x27;t worry about that.<p>Once you start using mean instead of mode (and therefore you can proudly call yourself a Bayesian), you get a number of side benefits: you get parameter uncertainty estimation for free, and you can start multiplying your likelihoods with various functions that make your life easier. You can interpret those functions as regularization functions, or prior, you can even start talking about expert knowledge, and delve into philosophical meanderings. No need to do that , there are enough people on the internet who do that.<p>2. Why Monte Carlo? Because calculating means of high-dimensional distributions is not easy. In most cases you are hit with the curse of dimensionality. Separately, the distributions that you work with are not known only up to a multiplicative constant. So the problem is how do you estimate the mean of a vector (v1, v2, ...., vn) when you know its distribution, but only up to a constant? The answer is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and if you learn that, you get special powers.<p>So why do Bayesians need Monte Carlo? Because they like to be like super-heroes and have special powers."],"time":["2020-09-10 00:02:24"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["baxtr"],"id":[24418282],"kids":[24419136],"parent":[24416908],"text":["Any article with “Bayesian” in the title gets upvoted these days :)"],"time":["2020-09-09 09:27:15"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["abeppu"],"id":[24422084],"kids":[24422470],"parent":[24416908],"text":["I think maybe a more interesting question is how to explain the extreme disconnect between data volume and confidence in the two examples compared.

I don&#x27;t know what the net figures are, but what I&#x27;m trying to say is that purchases of MBS != growth of MBS holdings.<p>I seriously think this author has somehow conflated the size of the SOMA assets with the size of the MBS market - continuing growth of MBS at $100 billion for the rest of the year, leaving all else equal, will give us about $2.4 trillion of MBS over a denominator of $7.4 trillion - which would give us about 1&#x2F;3.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sifma.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;research&#x2F;fixed-income-chart&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sifma.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;research&#x2F;fixed-income-chart&#x2F;<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;releases&#x2F;h41&#x2F;current&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;releases&#x2F;h41&#x2F;current&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-09 16:47:05"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["coronadisaster"],"id":[24421141],"kids":{},"parent":[24416807],"text":["The homes around here (suburb) fly off the shelves even if prices are higher then the last bubble (~2007)... not sure what is going on.

No &quot;this&quot;, easy reuse of logic via react-like &quot;useXYZ&quot; hooks and a general fast development. But two things really bugged me:<p>* You need to be really careful when passing around values and how you handle them. Destructure a Proxy object? You instantly lose reactivity. Not using a reference to proxy object in computed? Changes won&#x27;t trigger the computed function. There is a lot of magic involved and while it may seem that it takes a lot of &quot;thinking&quot; from you, once it doesn&#x27;t work you will have to rethink and maybe even ditch some of the underlying language&#x27;s features.<p>* &quot;ref&quot; vs &quot;reactive&quot;, where &quot;ref&quot; is used for primitives which need a proxy object wrapper and &quot;reactive&quot; is used for objects&#x2F;arrays. Now, my primary problem is that you again have to use specific operations based on whether your using ref or reactive. A &quot;ref&quot; array can be easily set to an empty array via `arr.value = []`. If you try this with a &quot;reactive&quot; array, you will lose reactivity; you would have to use `arr.length = 0`.<p>TypeScript detects a lot of those pitfalls and, IMO, it is essential when using the composition API.

The reality is, most farmers in Xinjiang are independent entities. They are the little guys. They grow cotton or any other produces on their land, and sell the produces to distributors. Many of these farmers are minority ethnicity, Uighur included, but there are others as well. These people lived in villages and in the country side for generations.  Farming and the &quot;primary&quot; sector of the economy is how they make a living for generations. They are the low to middle income bracket of the society. They depend on agriculture to raise families, provide food on the table, raise children, and take care of the elderly in the family. A blanket ban of all cotton produced in this region will devastate the life of these people. Think about it from the perspective of these people. They grew cotton on their farm, and one day they are told &quot;The U.S. stops buying your product because they want to protect you from forced labor&quot;, and because of that, you will be out of work. The farmer sits there and think &quot;Wait, I am farming because I need money to feed my families&quot;. This ban sounds like its standing with the Uighur people, but in reality, it hurts them the most. Rights to live, rights to livelihood, rights to income and bringing food to the table is also human rights.<p>Target companies or organizations that actually committed forced labor and present concrete evidence. Maybe require a document of the name of the farmer, require disclosure and certifications of the practices of the producers. There are many ways this could be done to both protect legitimate producers, farmers, and rule out the bad actors. Or at least act like you are trying. A blanket ban blew the covers off of the PR statement this is about protecting human rights and stand with the people. Instead, the actual intent is to suppress the Chinese economy, and prevent the people living there from getting richer and achieve a better quality of life. Its sad that there are people in the world who don&#x27;t really care about other people&#x27;s quality of life. They can enjoy themselves a good paying job, nice cloths, good cars etc. While for other people, farming, doing hard, manual and labor intensive work on the farm is all they can ever dream of.

Turns out that Murakami&#x27;s prose is highly structured, with subtle cross-refereces that, if translated differently will &#x27;de-sync&#x27; and leave the reader of a translated version without the clues to understanding the real structure of the novel.<p>While an example of a structurally meaningful cross-reference escapes me at the moment, I do remember a different example of a structural clue. It occurs in the &#x27;Hear the Wind Sing&#x27;, the first book of the Sheep Trilogy, which ends in the much-recommended &#x27;A Wild Sheep Chase&#x27; (technically it was later followed with a 4th book in &#x27;Dance, Dance, Dance&#x27; so it&#x27;s a 4-book trilogy). In the very beginning of the &#x27;Hear the Wind Sing&#x27; there is a small unassuming line: &#x27;This story begins on August 8, 1970, and ends eighteen days later — in other words, on August 26 of the same year&#x27;. If you follow the other time references given in the book -- such as days of the week mentioned on the radio etc -- this time frame given cannot possibly be true. The assumption that it is not an author&#x27;s mistake gives a hint that there is a hidden structure to the novel, which on its face looks fairly simple and linear.<p>I personally think that it is very difficult to get to like Murakami if you start with &#x27;Kafka&#x27; or, god forbid, the &#x27;Wind-up Bird&#x27;. These are hard books and they require a specific mindset to enjoy. &#x27;Sheep&#x27; into &#x27;Dance&#x27; is much easier to enjoy and &#x27;Norwegian Wood&#x27; and &#x27;South of the Border&#x27; both provide a large tractable multi-layered experience that can be explored up to an individual desire for complexity in undertones.<p>According to Kovalenin, Murakami himself refuses to elaborate on his books&#x27; structures and recommends instead to &#x27;understand [the books] via the way you feel about them&#x27;."],"time":["2020-09-10 03:13:50"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["wk_end"],"id":[24427076],"kids":[24430144,24429849,24427664],"parent":[24409543],"text":["Let&#x27;s see.

He wrote the novel in English first, and translated that English version into Japanese. His reason being &quot;if it is English, my vocabulary is not that great, so I&#x27;m forced to write in short sentences, which creates this natural rhythm. Kind of like an 8 beat.&quot; [1]<p>Being bilingual, I often find myself pondering whether I should write something for myself in English or in Japanese for tasks such as note taking or journal&#x2F;blog entries for myself. More and more, I&#x27;m finding that my writing in English is clearer, and more to the point. Not only that, but my thinking is structured in a more productive way, so I can write at a faster pace.<p>This was not meant to be a comparison of languages. We have enough of those discussions with programming, why would we talk about Natural Languages and risk angering a whole nation, instead of just Java programmers. Maybe my Japanese is no longer at the level of my English. But when somebody like Murakami also says that he wrote his first novel in English because it was easier for him, I feel there might be something there besides my English being better than my Japanese. Something worth exploring at least.<p>There are many great things about Japanese writing, the kanji characters bring about conciseness to the writing. I can glance at a page and quickly get a sense of the contents from the face of the characters much easier than English text. The characters feel closer to pictures. I also love the style of the &quot;Bunkobon&quot;, which is a smaller sized book, which can fit inside a pocket. I used to carry those everywhere with me and pull it out when I had a moment.<p>The novels and stories are great. People like Haruki and Souseki and Ranpo are my heroes.<p>I guess my Kokugo teacher would have liked for me to mention the beautiful poetry that arises from Haiku and the seasons, but those things are no longer practical use to me.<p>On the other hand, there are also many mental blocks and barriers that I face when writing Japanese. Finding the right Kanji characters is one thing. That&#x27;s probably attributed to my poor memory of kanji characters. Another thing is sentence endings: Desu&#x2F;masu and dearu&#x2F;da. The Desu&#x2F;masu is a more respectful tone. Dearu&#x2F;da is authoritative and sometimes regarded as casual. So now in addition to wondering whether I should write in the first person or third person, I have to worry whether my reader will be offended by my writing.<p>Anyway, would love to hear from other multilingual people on their views of language preference and differences.<p>[1] This was from an interview he did with a magazine called &quot;Kaie&quot;, The New Yorker also mentions this <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;page-turner&#x2F;lost-in-translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;page-turner&#x2F;lost-in-translat...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 01:31:14"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["willyg123"],"id":[24418055],"kids":[24420879,24422061,24429797,24418986],"parent":[24417015],"text":["Out of college I worked on the finance side of a self storage investment company (thank god I left after 4 years), so I know the ins and outs of the business.<p>The number one deciding factor for customers is location.

This is admittedly more rigorous work than previous efforts to train language models to perform automated theorem proving and it&#x27;s admirable that the authors have actually reached out to the community around Metamath (the classical automated theorem prover used in the paper) to understand the extent to which their work is useful to that community.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t understand the motivation of the work. Why is it necessary to teach a language model to perform automated theorm proving, when there are already approaches that can perform automated theorem proving, that outperform language models in theorem proving and that do not have the high costs associated with training language models? Indeed, Metamath is based on an extremly simple principle of variable substitution, which is just what it sounds like and comparing the complexity of a modern, GPT-based language model to such a simple approach is not flattering for the language model approach. Besides if I understand correctly, Metamath, was used as the &quot;ground truth&quot; for evaluation and testing of the trained language model and the language model didn&#x27;t get anywhere near 100% performance, meaning it&#x27;s far behind the ability of Metamath in automated theorem proving. So we have a very simple approach that works very well on one side and an extremely complex approach that doesn&#x27;t work very well on the other. The comparison is, again, not flattering for the language model approach.<p>I can see that GPT-ƒ (the language model in the paper) has contributed some shorter proofs to some theorems in Metamath&#x27;s database, which seems to be very much appreciated by the Metamath community, but on the other hand, it seems that GPT-ƒ was not able to prove <i>new<\/i> theorems (and a shorter version of a theorem proved by GPT-ƒ was found by hand, by one of the Metamath users, a little after the GPT-ƒ results were announced on the Metamath google group).<p>It seems to me it would be a long and arduous road for language models to achieve parity with classical automated theorem provers - if indeed such parity can be achieved at all. And all this hard work- for what, when there already exist perfectly serviceable automated theorem provers with none of the drawbacks of language models)? Why reinvent a wheel, only to come up with a new wheel that can only roll one way and only on Tuesdays?<p>Finally, despite the more rigorous approach in this paper, the trend of only comparing neural net approaches to other neural net approaches continues. An automated theorem prover approach of any stripe should be compared to the state of the art in automated theorm proving, not just to other efforts using a similar approach!

In the vast majority of OOP languages, instantiated classes are mutable-by-default and can be mutated by multiple concurrent operators (threads, coroutines, etc). This makes them actually quite similar to the underlying computing model - even though they&#x27;re a high-level abstraction, they force you to deal with the knowledge that the memory at any address can be modified at any time with no warning. [1]<p>Classes in most languages also offer implementation inheritance, which boils down to an approach to &quot;rebundling&quot; the constituent functions in ways that are arguably simple enough, but generally in practice it has been found to be hard for programmers to reason about. Dynamic dispatch is very powerful, and the way that most inheritance mechanisms expose this seems to be a model that programmers understand in theory but fail to consistently remember in practice.<p>In my opinion, the fundamental difficulty with classes is that in most languages, you get all of these tools bundled (complected) into the same toolbox without any say in the matter. If you didn&#x27;t want inheritance, too bad. If you didn&#x27;t want concurrent mutability, you&#x27;re now being asked to design a complex state machine to prevent it, rather than it being excluded off the bat by most functional approaches. Functional approaches force you to opt in to most of the footguns that are included &quot;out of the box&quot; in OOP.<p>Classes will remain the best approach in many OOP languages for RAII-shaped problems, where some part of an application needs to encapsulate and manage a limited, shared, and potentially mutable resource (such as a file handle, a database connection, or an in-memory cache), because classes are an abstraction that maps cleanly to shared mutable state with locking mechanisms.<p>[1] You can of course also shoot yourself in the foot with closures that themselves contain mutable state (e.g. some kind of mutable container), and I think this is a rarely-considered danger for functional paradigms in languages that default to mutable data structures."],"time":["2020-09-09 19:34:09"],"type":["comment"]}]
