The long-form stuff takes us 10x the time to write, but is consistently responsible for the increase in audience size. If you&#x27;re going full-time, this is the place to invest. Particularly because Substack is so bad at reader Discovery, you need to invest in getting people onto your publication in your own way (original content), because Substack only really helps the biggest creators drive traffic.<p>It&#x27;s why the I think the idea of bundling is going to be so big with newsletters, akin to how traditional newspapers started through a bunch of independent writers coming together.

Ballots are flats. Magazines are flats. Letters are flats. Anything non-bendable isn&#x27;t.<p>This is what has been happening to USPS, folks:<p>1. Because of COVID19, flats volume has collapsed, while package volume has skyrocketed. Flats sorting machines can do absolutely nothing for packages for reasons that are left up to the reader, so USPS has been shutting them down and moving them out of processing facilities in favor of package sorting.<p>2. Because USPS is losing lots of money overall (higher package volume doesn&#x27;t make up for the collapse in flats volume)[1], it has been cutting back on overtime, just like any other employer would.<p>3. People hear about 1 and 2, hear about&#x2F;experience packages being delivered more slowly, and think that this surely means that &quot;the Trump administration is trying to sabotage the post office to suppress voting!!!!&quot;. They do this without thinking about it at all:<p>3a. As stated, flats volume has collapsed, so there is still a <i>lot<\/i> of excess capacity.<p>3b. Even if every single voter were to vote by mail only, this would mean at most two additional flat pieces per voter (one ballot to the voter, and one ballot sent back). Think about how much mail (not packages, mail) you already receive daily on average. Do you really think two additional pieces would collapse the system? Of course not, any more than the USPS collapses every January when the IRS and every single employer, bank, and other financial institution sends out tax-related documents. (The USPS hires seasonal help in December for packages, not for Christmas cards.)<p>3c. If this really were a sinister Trump administration voter-suppression scheme, it&#x27;s a pretty weak one that can be defeated by dropping ballots off in person, and&#x2F;or voting in person.<p>4. An actual serious issue is states and counties that aren&#x27;t like Oregon (which has been 100% vote by mail for two decades) trying to convert to vote by mail without preparation. Think of how much mail your home receives for the previous tenant (and the one before that, and the one before that). Think of this all having to be done by early October, to give voters about a month to receive and return ballots. This is what the administration has been pointing out, something rarely heard amidst the nonsense about mail-vote suppression.<p>[1] Congress mandating the USPS to prepay pensions is a <i>good<\/i> thing. The postal service is an industry that is, by definition, in secular decline (barring unusual events like COVID19) because of the Internet.

When a value is accessed, it is promoted to the front of the list. So the last item in the list is least-recently accessed.<p>In a LFU cache, you might try the same idea, except each node also has a counter. When an item is accessed, increment its counter, and then swap with previously-higher-counter items to keep the list sorted. In this way an infrequently accessed item does not get promoted.<p>However this has a problem for certain access patterns. If every item has the same counter value, then accessing the last item in the list will force it to migrate up the whole list - O(N). You could use a heap instead, and get log time, but that&#x27;s still not the constant time that LRU provides.<p>What&#x27;s proposed here is to bucket items by counter. Each bucket has a linked list of entries, and each entry knows its bucket. The buckets themselves are arranged in a linked list. When an item in the N bucket is accessed, it conceptually unhooks itself from the N bucket and adds itself to the N+1 bucket, creating it if necessary.<p>Incidentally, a tip for writing this sort of cache: make your list circular, starting with a sentinel node (I call it the &quot;mouth&quot; since it eats its tail). This eliminates all the null checks in the linked list manipulation."],"time":["2020-08-28 00:02:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["NightMKoder"],"id":[24299174],"kids":{},"parent":[24298803],"text":["In practice I think cache eviction policies have trended to optimizing _memory_ usage.

I&#x27;m a product designer specializing in software prototypes and MVPs. I&#x27;m on a mission to unlock and share the full potential of nocode tools.<p>Unfortunately, they are often viewed as primitive website builders. So I rebuilt Civilization VI&#x27;s entire UI and UX to demonstrate how far you can push nocode today. This is the largest cloneable Webflow project ever released featuring 12,400 elements, 1800 styles, 1200 assets, and 400 interactions. The interface can easily be hooked up to a backend to incorporate functionality. This is not a playable game but a demonstration of how far we can push nocode. It took roughly two weeks during my spare time.\n<U+200E>\nThis prototype is a loving tribute to Sid Meier and one of my favorite games of all time. I&#x27;ve integrated all 46 leaders along with their soundtracks and nearly every feature in the game. The project stands at a whooping 124GB and runs on one single screen. So yes, you may notice lags from time to time depending on what machine you&#x27;re using.\n<U+200E>\nThe next time someone tries to dismiss nocode or asks you what&#x27;s possible, just ping them this link.<p>Civilization.webflow.io<p>Learn more on Webflow.com&#x2F;sarkis<p>Follow my work on Twitter.com&#x2F;sarkisbuniatyan<p>Watch the masterclass tomorrow on YouTube <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZXAGmosa7R8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZXAGmosa7R8<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 09:35:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wazoox"],"id":[24295100],"kids":[24303402],"parent":[24294450],"text":["My desktop PC is a ~2009 dual core machine, but this is actually almost usable, the main annoyance being the slow mouse cursor.

Light speed sets a maximal boundary on how much of the universe may be &quot;intertwined&quot; with the observable, but even if the data is sitting on the computer next to me, until I take a peek (or otherwise subject myself to any consequences stemming from them) those constraints haven&#x27;t yet permeated any of the bits of the universe that make up me.<p>Akin to how relativity permits two different observers to hold differing views of some phenomena (eg. silmultanaety) this worldview allows me to imagine the cat is both dead and alive even though my computer or the Geiger counter may know the correct answer.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from real quantum physicists whether this interpretation is bunk or has some validity (and if so, whether someone else arrived at it before me and gave the theory a name)."],"time":["2020-08-27 17:45:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["galaxyLogic"],"id":[24332670],"kids":{},"parent":[24293087],"text":["This is a good new theory which makes SENSE as far as I can understand.<p>But, if we apply Occam&#x27;s Razor then isn&#x27;t the explanation to all quantum weirdness simply that we live in a simulated universe?"],"time":["2020-08-31 17:53:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hleszek"],"id":[24294811],"kids":[24294952,24295784],"parent":[24293087],"text":["So, I am missing something, how does it work with the double slit experiment ? the result should never act as a wave without observation if we have spontaneous collapse all the time ?

And 80% of panelists indicate there is at least a one-in-four chance of a ‘double-dip’ recession.\n“The panel is split in its view on Congress’s fiscal response to the recession, with 40% calling the response insufficient, 37% indicating the response is adequate, and 11% saying it is excessive,” Hunter continued. “Nearly three out of four panelists believe the optimal size for the next fiscal package to be $1 trillion or greater, compared to 17% who favor a smaller package.”\n“More than three-quarters of panelists believe that the current stance of U.S. monetary policy is appropriate, the largest share holding this view since 2007,” added Survey Chair Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist, Oxford Economics. “The majority of panelists—58%—expects the federal funds rate range to remain unchanged at 0-0.25%, or even drop lower, by the end of 2021. Most participants—84%—expect that the funds rate target will be higher by year-end 2022, but still within 100 basis points of where it is currently."],"time":["2020-08-27 19:20:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Guzba"],"id":[24296064],"kids":[24296418,24296183,24296136,24296892,24296313,24296198,24296315,24296266,24296293,24296348,24296530,24296437,24296205,24297036,24296762,24296450,24296906,24296520,24296656],"parent":[24295559],"text":["Economists are as effective as astrologists at predicting the future.

Health data is encrypted in transit and in the cloud, and customers can download or delete their data at any time directly from the app. Body scan images are automatically deleted from the cloud after processing, so only the customer sees them. Tone is enabled by creating a personal voice profile, after which it begins capturing short samples of speech and providing insights and daily recaps. Speech samples are always analyzed locally on the customer’s phone and automatically deleted after processing—nobody, not even the customer, ever hears them.

Would like to know your thoughts too.<p>0. Lower rate from 30% to 15% -Apple still has monopoly, nothing changes.<p>1. Side loading apps: Not good! malicious apps can run amok, eg. $BIG_CORP$ will say - you will get 20$ credits if you sideload our app, and then surveil everything that is possible on the device. Here, we expect an average user to give all the permission that the app requests for.<p>2. allow secondary app stores: -not good as it depends on the quality of enforcement in secondary app store. For Apple, it is in their interest to maintain app quality in their appstore to maintain overall good user experience in their device, but motivations are not same for secondary app store. May allow malicious apps which deteriorate the user experience&#x2F;privacy similar to 1. And there will be a state where you will have to install 10s of app store just to install specific programs which is also not ideal.<p>3. Allow secondary payment methods: -Average user will have to give up their payment info to everyone who asks for it. Most of them will not be trustworthy nor we can expect all of them to maintain good security standards for saving payment info.<p>The biggest culprit of all this drama is Apple does not allow secondary payment inside apps AND also, if you have secondary payment outside of app, they do not allow that price to be lower. There is no competition, thus Apple can get away with whatever it chooses to. Thus the monopoly.<p>4. SOLUTION:<p>a) charge a flat fee for reviewing&#x2F;serving apps. If necessary, linearly increase it based on daily active users if they need more resource to support that app.<p>b) allow whitelisted secondary payment providers. Only whitelisting few payment methods which are trustable eg applepay, googlepay, paypal, stripe, etc will maintain security of payment data.<p>c) allow secondary payment price to be lower than Apple.<p>With this solution, there will be competition between payment providers which will drive the price down."],"time":["2020-08-27 02:18:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aaronbrethorst"],"id":[24288876],"kids":{},"parent":[24288315],"text":["<i>We are committed to securing lasting freedoms for all.

For a long while now, iOS has been the mobile accessibility leader, and unless you as a blind person have some specific reason to use Android, you&#x27;re encouraged to use iOS.<p>Back in 2009 when Android accessibility was a joke, by which I mean as a developer I found major API issues within a few hours of development, I wrote one of the first and most popular Android screen readers. I think it was at least the first to be publicised even before TalkBack, where by &quot;publicised&quot; I mean TalkBack wasn&#x27;t in Android&#x27;s release notes, but I at least had an APK installable via tinyurl and posted to a mailing list. I quite literally had nothing else to do with my time at that point in my life, and Android 1.6 had an accessibility API, so on a lark I started writing a screen reader. The project has since died out, but for a long while, Spiel was a thin on Android.<p>iOS won&#x27;t let me do anything like that. Further, iOS won&#x27;t even let me code for it unless I use MacOS, and while MacOS has some decent accessibility features, it&#x27;s been a royal pain in my ass to code on. I could elaborate, but to keep this comment brief, take it as a given from a subject area expert that developing on MacOS as a blind person is worse than any other platform I&#x27;ve used to date. And that&#x27;s saying something, since Linux is my primary platform, and there are a number of blind developers who won&#x27;t touch it with a 10-foot pole. I don&#x27;t want to claim that coding on MacOS under VoiceOver isn&#x27;t possible, but it&#x27;s more difficult than it needs to be.<p>Yes, these are two huge corporations slugging it out, and it&#x27;s hard to muster much sympathy for Epic. But I wouldn&#x27;t be the developer I am today if it weren&#x27;t for Android&#x27;s openness letting me build a screen reader, and its further openness letting me build an accessible GPS navigation app which I&#x27;ve hacked on in some form for around a decade now, and which I&#x27;ve come to rely upon. It bugs me to no end that the more accessible mobile platform is so locked down such that a budding blind software engineer handed an iPhone can&#x27;t code for it using JAWS or NVDA. So Apple is handing blind people internet-connected mobile computers with all sorts of sensors, and telling them the only way they can develop for these devices is by using a sub-par development environment that&#x27;s going to fight them every step of the way and, likely, turn them off of software development more broadly. Then maybe we wonder why we don&#x27;t see more blind software engineers?<p>So, go Epic. If they start being asses later then of course I&#x27;ll oppose that, but if they have a big enough saber to start breaking up Apple&#x27;s stranglehold on the most accessible mobile platform, they&#x27;ve got my support 100%. Hell yeah, the web wouldn&#x27;t have been possible under Apple&#x27;s rule. And while I respect those of you who want more secure devices and a curated experience, don&#x27;t under-estimate the harm caused by locking blind developers out of one of the most accessible computing environments they&#x27;re ever likely to get. No, jumping through certificate hoops to install something that will expire after a week isn&#x27;t anything near what I&#x27;m asking for.<p>And to those of you who say &quot;Just tell your blind friends to use a Pinephone,&quot; I wish I could, but Linux accessibility infrastructure has no support for touchscreens and touch events.

The solution to this is to start with &#x27;why&#x27; - having a core purpose that will drive all other aspects of your product&#x2F;service and delivery.<p>The author of this article asserts that this leaves out a &#x27;who&#x27; - the customers that you are selling to. He says that one needs to begin by choosing your target market and aiming all efforts tailoring the experience to them.<p>I think this is a bit backwards - especially when he is trying to suggest that Sinek is &quot;fundamentally wrong&quot;. To me, it would seem that if you start off with a higher level purpose, then the &#x27;who&#x27; will fall out of that. I want to manufacture and sell a completely open source mobile phone because I believe that all humans should have access to commodity communications devices that aren&#x27;t tied to a proprietary OEM or service carrier. The &#x27;who&#x27; from this will come out as either &#x27;people who have an interest in open source and freedom&#x27; or &#x27;people who want a cheap commodity device&#x27;. How do I pick between these groups to focus? I go back to my &#x27;why&#x27; and elaborate it. I don&#x27;t pick one arbitrarily (i.e. start with &#x27;who&#x27;) and then pick a raison d&#x27;etre based on that choice.<p>I think it&#x27;s also fair to point out that Sinek seems to have a weird fascination with trying to back up his points with Bullshit science (the TED talk mentioned in the article tries to assert that his methods are correct &#x27;because of biology&#x27; which is tenuous at best.

For example, SpaceX cockpit design and the amount of sci-fi influence with touchscreens vs. say F-15 Cockpit (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23702560\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23702560<\/a>) which I personally consider as the epitome of interface design.
