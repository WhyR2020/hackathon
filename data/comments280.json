(It&#x27;s not just HN.)<p>The net lets us see all the great output from the most talented writers, thinkers, doers of their fields -- including people who we could imagine to be our peer group. But what we see is not an accurate sample -- it&#x27;s dominated by the most remarkable, outliers by both skill and luck. (That is, there&#x27;s massive survivorship bias; see Taleb&#x27;s Fooled by Randomness.) Still, if we choose to look, it&#x27;s in our face every hour of every day, in our news feeds, our Twitter streams, our Facebook statuses.<p>(Compare also: the quality of social networks whereby for almost everyone, your friends will have more friends than you [1]; the Matthew Effect, whereby small changes in initial endowment of power&#x2F;fame&#x2F;success can compound [2]; and how viewing top athletes can actually decrease someone&#x27;s coordination in following challenges [3].)<p>In the plant and insect world, sometimes as one organism thrives, it sends off chemical signals that suppress the growth of its siblings&#x2F;peers&#x2F;neighbors, in an effect called allelopathy.<p>Information about others&#x27; great works and successes, transmitted by the net, may sometimes serve as a sort of memetic negative allelopathy. The message is: this territory is taken; you can&#x27;t reach the sunshine here; try another place&#x2F;strategy (or even just wither so your distant relatives can thrive). This can be be the subtext even if that&#x27;s not the conscious intent of those relaying the information. Indeed, the reports may be intended as motivational, and sometimes be, while at other times being discouraging.<p>What to do? Not yet certain, but awareness that this mechanism is in play may help. You can recognize that what you&#x27;re reading is not representative, and that comparing yourself against prominent outliers -- or even worse, vague composites of outliers who are each the best in one dimension -- is unrealistic and mentally unhealthy.<p>Actual progress for yourself may require detaching from the firehose a bit, picking a narrower focus. (HN&#x27;s eclectic topic matter can be inherently defocusing.)<p>And remind yourself that despite various reptilian-hindbrain impulses, most interesting creative activity today is far from zero-sum. The outliers can win, and you can win too (even if you don&#x27;t achieve outlier-sized success). Their success can expand your options, and they may wind up being your collaborators (formally or informally by simply participating in a mutual superstructure) moreso than your &#x27;competitors&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-scientific-fundamentalist&#x2F;200911&#x2F;why-your-friends-have-more-friends-you-do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-scientific-funda...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Matthew_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Matthew_effect<\/a><p>[3] Can&#x27;t find the reference at the moment, but the study I recall showed people video of a top soccer player, and subsequently they performed worse on tasks requiring physical coordination.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-08-24 23:06:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m1117"],"id":[24264740],"kids":{},"parent":[24261826],"text":["I&#x27;m extraordinarily good at procrastinating!"],"time":["2020-08-24 21:52:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["weregiraffe"],"id":[24268432],"kids":{},"parent":[24261826],"text":["Buy can you be extraordinary with not being OK?"],"time":["2020-08-25 07:50:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["S_A_P"],"id":[24271511],"kids":{},"parent":[24261826],"text":["I read the title as &quot;Boeing ok with not being extraordinary&quot;.

We agree more on sharing things in common than we ever have. There are still outliers like the plans coming out of Apple and Microsoft we hear about in the news, where they&#x27;ve sought to pivot PCs towards ARM.<p>[...]<p>&gt;If a microprocessor architecture consensus finally exists, then I believe we should be focusing on building better tools that help software developers benefit from it<p>Considering ARM an outlier in a world were smartphones outnumber desktop PCs and where the x86 stronghold is under attack from several sides seems like a strange take to me.<p>Also, there&#x27;s more to portability than managing to run a hello world from the same binary on Windows and Linux. I used to use FreeBSD a lot on the desktop, which usually involved using Linux binary compatibility to run Linux closed source binaries that weren&#x27;t available on FreeBSD. It worked generally pretty well, but it wasn&#x27;t without friction at times even though it was coded by very smart people and between two systems that were overall very similar.<p>These &quot;compatibility&quot; applications often end up as 2nd class citizen that don&#x27;t integrate well with native applications, or at least not as easily. See Wine for instance, managing to run Windows applications on un*x is a huge undertaking.<p>&gt;One of the reasons why I love working with a lot of these old unsexy technologies, is that I want any software work I&#x27;m involved in to stand the test of time with minimal toil. Similar to how the Super Mario Bros ROM has managed to survive all these years without needing a GitHub issue tracker.<p>I love emulation, so I definitely understand where this is coming from, but I don&#x27;t really see what that has to do with the rest. In particular if you&#x27;re willing to go down the emulation route, why do you care about everybody running x86? Super Mario Bros was not written to run on a Celeron.

As an example, one of the images tries to highlight Asana&#x27;s timeline and their achievements [1]. One of the things they mention is opening an international office with ~100 employees and &lt;11k customers. Based on their current figures of 75,000 paying customers and revenue of $142,606,000, you would expect a revenue of ~$19 million for 11k customers. Why is a company with 100 employees &amp; &lt;$19 million in revenue opening international offices? Likewise, why is the company spending 74% of revenue on sales and 63% on R&amp;D? How are they managing to lose 83% of revenue? It seems like the company has 0 responsibility with how they spend their cash and beyond that, it&#x27;s unclear whether they even have a path towards profitability if they&#x27;re spending 75 cents on the dollar just to make a sale and throwing almost $100 million at R&amp;D every year. Despite substantial revenue growth y&#x2F;y (~70%), they&#x27;ve managed to outpace it by growing losses twice as fast at ~140%.

It basically described how the focus of the platform would evolve with how effectively users would be able  to share their lives with their network, in progression with technology, or - more specifically - the price of bandwidth. Let me explain:<p>FB early years was very text-centric. I recall not &quot;getting it&quot; because it was effectively a tricked-out twitter. Kinda like Asana vs Clickup today - more features doesn&#x27;t directly translate to &quot;better&quot;. I of course didn&#x27;t factor in the &quot;network effect&quot;. I digress. Early years was text-centric.<p>When internet speeds picked up (without much of an increase in price to the end user), photos became more of a focus. The Instagram acquisition happened around this timeframe<p>At the time I found this graphic, The same price&#x2F;data speed phenomenon was in effect and FB was transitioning to video as its core sharing focus. Facebook acquires Occulus, which leads into the last part of the graphic -<p>VR. I remember MZ&#x27;s Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s virtual Puerto Rico jaunt. New tech is often akward, but knowing Facebook a player in an industry typically &quot;beyond gaming&quot; is in line to blur that line, is one good example of the viability of Unity as a real revenue producing entity.<p>This is getting a little long winded, but I think this next part drives the point home.<p>I&#x27;m a real estate agent, and I used to work at a brokerage called Exp (NASDAQ: EXPI).

I was (and am) quite healthy, and coupled with the fact that I&#x27;m not really allergic to anything this took me by surprise.  It got bad enough that I had allergy panels done, which unfortunately came back with allergies to all sorts of things and the docs put me on anti-allergy medication (Zyrtec, along with stronger Rx only stuff).  I was quite discouraged, esp when the docs told me that one can become allergic to anything at any point in one&#x27;s life, and I was slowly starting to accept it.  The Zyrtec seemed to help, not 100%, and I didn&#x27;t seem to have to take it regularly, so it wasn&#x27;t the end of the world.

I figured it&#x27;d be like $25-$100 a month or something just because of all the bandwidth someone could probably burn building random&#x2F;broken shit over and over.<p>I&#x27;m mostly curious because I&#x27;ve considered using Docker recently for personal projects and my home server; but I&#x27;d rather not invest a bunch of time porting things only to find out it&#x27;s gonna be way more than $5 (not including my time).<p>Or is it that hard to just build your own images? To be honest, I&#x27;ve never really understood that part of Docker (using other folks images)... It always seemed like an enormous security risk[1]. FWIW, I still deploy my personal projects using chef&#x2F;ansible, shell scripts, and systemd units like some sort of curmudgeon-y monster...<p>[1] Everything is a security risk (APT, source, etc), I know, I get it.

If the docker build command finds an image tagged &quot;latest&quot; in the local registry, it stops there.<p>The only way to get docker build to always use the &quot;actual latest&quot; version of the base image is to add the &quot;--pull&quot; parameter to the docker build command.

This allows an analysis to be verified after the fact, which increases trust and helps figure out what happened when contradictions appear between experiments.  However, if the original work involved physical experimentation or any non-automated steps (as is the case for most science) the ability to run the original code provides only partial replication.  Overall the ability to re-run old code is a fairly low priority.<p>From the perspective of someone who primarily uses computers as a tool to facilitate research, the priority list is closer to:<p>1. Retain documentation of what was <i>meant<\/i> to happen. Objectives, experimental design, experimental &amp; analysis protocols, relevant background, etc.<p>2. Retain documentation of what actually happened, usually in terms of noting deviations from the protocol.  This is the purpose of a lab notebook.  Pen &amp; paper excels here.<p>3. Retain raw data files.<p>4. Retain files produced in the course of analysis.<p>5. Retain custom source code.<p>6. Version control all the above.<p>7. Make everything run in the correct order with one command (i.e, full automation).<p>Only once all the above is achieved would it be worth ensuring that the software used in the analysis can be re-run in 10 years.  Solving the &quot;packaging problem&quot; in a typical scientific context (multiple languages, multiple OSes, commercial software, mostly short scripts) is complex.  When the outcome of an analysis is suspect, the easiest and most robust approach is to check the analysis by redoing it from scratch.  This takes less time than trying to ensure every analysis will run on demand even as the computing ecosystem changes out from under it.<p>Most of the time spent writing analysis code is deciding <i>what<\/i> the code should do, not actually writing the code.

The other against opponents who can hit back, where the battle will be won or lost in space, cyber, economically, and possibly through nuclear warfare.

I believe it was Freedman[1]  A key thesis is that as a predominant weapon system becomes more vulnerable, it becomes more expensive, as it’s burdened with more defensive measures to survive from cheaper more expendable systems.  In World War 2 the canonical example was the battle ship and the aircraft.  Now it’s the fighter jet and the missile (or drone) etc. Just look at the ridiculous state of the JSF.<p>Manned missile trucks are valuable for countering electronic attack, but not dogfighting.

The same house that cost my parents a ridiculously high mortgage (10% was pretty normal in the 70&#x27;s here) can now be had for a fraction of the inflation adjusted wages today. Even though the on-paper value of the house is roughly 10x what it cost back then.<p>To fix the rental market a lot of new housing would have to be built, but then you run into zoning issues, transportation issues, the price of land and other limitations that make it hard to expand affordable housing for cities. Historically institutional investors (for instance: pension funds) would fund these developments but since they now have shorter time horizons for their ROI and want higher returns they are not as interested as they used to be to pick this up.<p>This problem will not resolve easily or even at all as long as people are willing to pay high rents and the market is as restricted as it is I would expect rents to continue to go up. Even an increase in interest will likely not return all that many houses to the rental market because that would require the sticker price of houses to come down, which hardly even happens.

In software development, this can be seen by an increased focus on frameworks, statically typed languages, 100% test coverage, CI pipelines, code analysis tools; all designed to relieve developers from a sense of responsibility and ownership over the code and to give managers extra visibility.<p>&gt; Why is US GDP growth so weirdly constant?<p>Because there is no growth. What looks like growth is just inflation of the dollar relative to the value of goods and services which underlie the GDP calculation.<p>&gt; How do you ensure an adequate replacement rate in systems that have no natural way to die?<p>Abolish the Federal Reserve, introduce UBI.

Complex programming environments will create more reliance on tools which will pull back the sense of responsibility from developers which will make them produce inferior work.\nNo amount of tooling can make a developer care more about the work; the more you automate a developer&#x27;s work, the less they will feel as if it is their own work and the less they will care.\nNo tool cannot ever compensate for lack of care.<p>&gt; What does religion cause?<p>It&#x27;s a very positive force. People need to share ideals related to altruism and fairness in order to allow social contracts to remain coherent. People need to believe that if they do nice things for others, they will be rewarded with eternal life. Without this, most people will work only in their own self-interest and the whole capitalist system, which is rooted in the exploitation of the altruism of others, won&#x27;t work.<p>Pervasive, single-minded self-interest is not compatible with capitalism.

Some (eg the inflation question) have answers were sustainable 10-20 years ago, but grew out of them. Some have cliched or even ideological answers. Again, time has changed the strength of these answers. Time to re-ask and re-answer.<p>Some (eg progress in science) have no obvious or common answer, but are commonly discussed at a smaller scale. Academic incentives, publishing &amp; such are commonly discussed, but no ways forward seem to emerge.. even rhetorically.<p>In any case, I think the first one (inflation by sector) hits squarely at a major blindspot in most economic thinking. I think it&#x27;s responsible for a lot of the divergent views of economists (relying on measurements) and non economists relying on intuition.<p>Your answer to this question may relate to GDP growth consistency. Again, I feel this is a blindspot in most theoretical economics. One of Thomas Picketty&#x27;s controversy bombshells was treating GDP growth and rate-of-return (r&gt;g) as basically constant. Almost all other theories (even Marx) treat these as determined by everything else in the theory.

He has a book about it [1]<p>This aligns well with Patrick&#x27;s graph: healthcare, college, childcare are all labor intensive and have seen little to no productivity increase in the last 23 years.<p>The story for housing is different, though. We are consistently concentrating economic opportunity in the urban centers. However, through NIMBYism, we have made it very difficult to build new housing. The &quot;surprising&quot; result: very expensive housing. Relatedly, Matt Rognlie found out [2] that the increase in the capital share of income since 1970, as noticed by Piketty, can be mostly explained by the housing sector.<p>The solution to both, in my view, are related. We need to reduce barriers for labor movement. We can reduce labor cost by liberalizing immigration to the USA and by liberalizing (re-zoning) and incentivizing (via Land Value Taxation) housing production within the main US urban areas.<p>&gt; Why do there seem to be more examples of rapidly-completed major projects in the past than the present?<p>My suspicion is institutional ossification in the USA. With time we accumulate rules &#x2F; regulations &#x2F; procedures that increase the complexity of the task at hand. Eventually, the marginal procedure increases complexity such that our competence is exceeded, making the task impossible.<p>I think the solution is related to his other question &quot;How do you ensure an adequate replacement rate in systems that have no natural way to die?&quot;. We should have a way to replace these institutions. Market forces are a great way to do so for private endeavors, startups being the prime example. But for public institutions, it is less clear what could be the proper approach. If there was a way to have states compete for citizens in a non-violent way, that may help.<p>&gt; Why don&#x27;t we build nice neighborhoods any more?<p>I think it is a mixture of i) survivorship bias (as he suggests), ii) car-oriented development (as he suggests), and iii) the fact that attractive neighborhoods have an organic feel to them that only time can give. Thus, in the car-era we built new neighborhoods but they were car-oriented so they never aged into nice, walking neighborhoods. We are trying to rectify that with new walking-oriented developments, but they have a synthetic feel to them that will only go away with time.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s going on with infrastructure?<p>I would say this is a combination of the Baumol cost disease and the ossification of our institutions (both mentioned above).<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol%27s_cost_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol%27s_cost_disease<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;46013009-why-are-the-prices-so-damn-high\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;46013009-why-are-the-pri...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;2015a_rognlie.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;2015a_r...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-24 12:30:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nzdhandala"],"id":[24256869],"kids":{},"parent":[24256676],"text":["Regulations are out of control.

Lets cut it down to 2TW because we don&#x27;t know how much of that infrastructure is actually utilized. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m sold on nuclear and want 2TW of installed nuclear plant capacity. Each power plant should be able to generate 700MW. This means we have to build 2857 new power plants. Half of them need to be done by 2050. The other half should be in construction by 2050 but are allowed to take 10-15 years to be built. Surely economies of scale should be able to reduce nuclear plant costs to around 2 billion USD per plant [1] but that would still cost 5714 billion USD.<p>Open questions:<p>Which nuclear technology is available today that can be deployed 1400 times today as soon as today without any massive safety flaws? Theoretical reactor designs may sound cool but nobody is going to wait for them.<p>Who is going to pay for the prototypes and first dozen plants? How are you going to convince the rest of the planet to install your nuclear plants?<p>Is this ambitious timeline even possible? Can you train enough people and build an extensively optimized nuclear supply chain that can scale thousands of reactors?<p>What happens once the &quot;building&quot; rush is over? Will the supply chain die again and be hard to start back up?<p>Can every country be trusted to operate their own nuclear plants? Will they openly report flaws and safety problems in the power plant and take those reports seriously by turning off defective or unsafe plants until they restored the safety of the plant? Fukushima was easily preventable but there was no accountability and no incentive to prevent an accident. Nobody in charge felt responsible to actually add adequate safety measures.<p>Can we mine enough fuel to power these plants? Will mining activity have to increase to meet the new demand? Can that mining be powered by nuclear energy? Is mining for nuclear fuel worse than coal?<p>Is waste disposal feasible today in every country? Can this cost be reduced through economies of scale or is it fixed per unit of waste?<p>None of these things are impossible but they require time, money and trust.<p>People who don&#x27;t care about climate change are not going to give you money for nuclear or renewables.<p>Time isn&#x27;t exactly on our side.

It is very challenging and expensive to scale an app rapidly when the folks who have installed it get large bursts of success without any forewarning. If a DTC brand launches their store with some cheap &#x2F; free apps and their product goes viral, that means the indie solo app developer has to scale to meet the demand. These new DTC merchants often don&#x27;t understand very much of the business of maintaining SaaS and aren&#x27;t very forgiving when an app fails to keep up with the demand put on it.<p>The challenge is if an inexperienced developer offers the app for free or a nominal fee like $50&#x2F;mo that means they have to scale up infrastructure and support and often re-write the app for a small number of merchants who are still only paying $50&#x2F;mo. This happens to more Shopify app developers than I want to admit, and many many bootstrapped folks are operating at a substantial loss, looking for a way out without irking customers who depend on their app.<p>With that in mind, be very careful if you enter any type of SaaS marketplace.

For example, one of our apps gets between 25k to 100k webhooks per hour and the spikes are unpredictable.

(In cases like HBO and AT&amp;T, where the company paying for the data and the ISP are part of the same company or subsidiaries of the same company, I&#x27;d count that as a form of disguised zero rating rather than sponsored data).<p>The case for regulating zero-rating is much stronger than the case for regulating sponsored data.<p>Note that a company could in effect do sponsored data without even having an arrangement with an ISP. E.g., a company could keep track on its end of how much data from them each customer used each month, map that to ISPs based on IP address, and then give each customer a discount on their monthly bill based on that ISPs rates and that customers use.<p>Let&#x27;s call this &quot;manual sponsored data&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s hard to make a case that manual sponsored data is automatically bad, of even usually bad.

More concretely, if we say that there are some underlying factors which correlate to both student &quot;quality&quot; and to admissions scores, and some random factors, we&#x27;ll find that score and quality are correlated, but the highest quality students and the ones with the highest scores aren&#x27;t the same ones.

If we instead set the cutoff at 23, we get 47 students (labelled B for students above the average of the originally selected ones, and C for the ones below that average) -- if we then pick among them randomly, we&#x27;ll get a flatter distribution ranging from a low score of 6 to a high score of 15, with an average of 10.98. The distribution of scores looks like<p><pre><code>    Score | Strict | Cutoff&#x2F;\n          | Cutoff | Random\n    ------+--------+--------\n       15 |  0.00% |  8.51%\n       14 | 10.00% | 10.64%\n       13 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n       12 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n       11 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n       10 | 20.00% | 12.77%\n        9 | 10.00% | 10.64%\n        8 |  0.00% |  8.51%\n        7 |  0.00% |  6.38%\n        6 |  0.00% |  4.26%\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSo if you care a lot about simply not getting bad students, and not very much about getting the very best ones, you should do a strict cutoff, since that will give you the highest possible average. If you care more about getting the very best students, and are ok if you let in a few relative duds, you&#x27;ll do better to lower your cutoff and select randomly from everyone who passed your cutoff.<p>Elite colleges get their reputation from having students who go on to do great things, so I&#x27;d argue that at least for them, the &quot;cutoff plus random selection&quot; makes sense."],"time":["2020-08-25 02:39:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Melting_Harps"],"id":[24259263],"kids":{},"parent":[24246002],"text":["I recently heard a podcast with Andrew Yang and Scott Galloway (professor at NYU) [1] and the summary was pretty much that he attended UCLA at a time that it was not only affordable, but also when they were willing to take on local students with less than stellar or &#x27;good enough&#x27; backgrounds, in order to remain apt to the articles title, as the lower acceptance rate wasn&#x27;t something that added to the institutions supposed prestige.<p>I think this underscores what happens when a supposed Social Good (which is funded as such at both a State and Federal Level) is used to primarily serve as a state-subsidized monetization scheme on it&#x27;s Brand which will bend backwards to maximize its profits with International Students. I sincerely believe this is what inevitably comes when Education is centralized and is reduced to serve as an expensive commodity in the form of virtue signalling rather than serve as an actual institution of Higher Education for it&#x27;s populace. And this needs to be understood before any reform to accommodate people who really shouldn&#x27;t be there, which is quite honestly a large percentage of students with University degrees, before anything is undertaken.<p>I personally wanted to walk away when I realized what a farce University had become and I had to be talked into going back to class after I got Honors in Philosophy and told I&#x27;d get all expenses paid to debate moral ethics, all while I was a Biology major struggling to get classes to advance to Junior status and transfer to a CSU campus with more STEM based offerings only to get hit with budget and strikes when I transferred that resulted in even less course availability due to the financial crises.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m really enjoying seeing how quickly the disruption has occurred to Higher Education in the US, and the UK as you can now get some degrees for pre-2000s prices on Coursera. College of London offers an Online Bsc CS degree for $17k, and CU Boulder offers an MSc EE for ~$20k. I paid 65k for BSc at a CSU and graduated in 2009. And while I&#x27;d love to see a further race to the bottom in terms of pricing, I take solace in that they know that its inevitable.<p>CU Boulder recently allowed students to move in last week, and in that time 13 people have tested positive for COVID on campus, and one has died in the county in that time [2]. But it must be said, if you&#x27;re really thinking going for the &#x27;Campus Life&#x27; during this pandemic than I&#x27;m afraid to say no prestigious degree is going to save you from the Real World when it comes crashing down and you have no real understanding of cost-risk-benefit analysis. It must also be noted that the only classes offered on campus right now are for things like Latin according to an interviewed student.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gESwwG9sa2Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gESwwG9sa2Y<\/a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timescall.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;cu-boulder-now-up-to-13-positive-coronavirus-cases-for-move-in-week&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timescall.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;cu-boulder-now-up-to-13...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-24 12:33:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["eagsalazar2"],"id":[24267427],"kids":{},"parent":[24246002],"text":["<i>ALL<\/i> schools should pick randomly from all applicants.

But they often ignore the bad side effects of the idea when it comes to putting it <i>into practice<\/i>.<p>First, let&#x27;s not mince words here -- this suggested policy is about lowering the bar for admission to top universities so that some previously unqualified tier of applicants has a better shot at getting in.  These lower tier students get a better chance in a lottery, at the expense of people who through better work&#x2F;aptitude&#x2F;achievement&#x2F;(and no small amount of luck, finance, or legacy also) would otherwise usually get in with high likelihood.  (Note, those last exceptional categories are a small portion -- something like 10%.)<p>So what&#x27;s one of the side effects here?  Or let&#x27;s call it incentives produced by such a system?<p>Well, perhaps it&#x27;s that students, who throughout school are taught to study hard, do well, apply themselves, at the end face a selection that tosses that out the window and says, well, everyone is equally good and we&#x27;re going to do a lottery.   We&#x27;re lowering the bar so that everyone who got above a B average has an equal chance of getting into Harvard.<p>Is that teaching them the right lesson?  Is that incentivizing people to excel and be really good at something?  How would you respond at work if at the end of the year, everyone doing a minimum amount of work were given the same salary?<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d actually like that (most people reading these forums, at least).  Now, I don&#x27;t dispute that there&#x27;s a lot of unnecessary pressure on students today.  And part of it is a bigger problem that the population has grown while top spots have stayed relatively constant.  So people are trying to fix this.<p>But I disagree with attempts to create artificial equality at the last step.  We wouldn&#x27;t accept this for anything else that matters -- you wouldn&#x27;t prefer to be treated by a doctor who was just &quot;good enough&quot;, or be flown by a pilot who barely passed the flight exam.   In the name of lowering their level of stress, or making the doctor &#x2F; pilot population look a certain way.   And by the way, to make a difference in college admissions (according to the function I can imagine the author desires), you really have to lower the bar a lot.<p>I don&#x27;t want these kinds of distortions for a system that my kids will be subject to.  That&#x27;s not the lesson I want them to learn.  Students in other countries have a far harder and more competitive time than ours.

The amount of web traffic that SQLite can handle depends on how heavily the website uses its database. Generally speaking, any site that gets fewer than 100K hits&#x2F;day should work fine with SQLite. The 100K hits&#x2F;day figure is a conservative estimate, not a hard upper bound.

If you underpay on some trips and overpay on others and it is a net wash, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter for the couriers if the payment algorithm is on the low side on some trips so long as it is on the high side on other trips.<p>Under or overpaying on trips is more of an interest to those engineers trying to optimize marketplace efficiency. Meal delivery businesses have as much of an interest in not underpaying as doing so reduces supply availability and therefore reliability and they have also an interest in not overpaying as that reduces profitability. The ultimate goal is optimal pricing in a three sided market to maximize liquidity as the business model does best when you optimize for volume of transactions. Maximizing liquidity amortizes fixed costs over more transactions. This applies as much to the meal delivery companies as to the restaurants involved.<p>At the end of the day, distance driven is very imperfect as you have issues like poor GPS signal and in cities you have the dilemma of urban canyons and tunnels. Also, drivers don&#x27;t always take the suggested route. At vehicle speeds, it&#x27;s hard problem to solve due to time between GPS pings. Another issue besides GPS inaccuracy is clock inaccuracy, especially with round-trip times between server and client and client and server aren&#x27;t always symmetrical, especially on cellular networks, and this messes up all sorts of clock synchronization strategies. The peanut gallery on HN is seriously underestimating the complexity of measuring distance using GPS. It&#x27;s pretty darn good when conditions are ideal, but when they aren&#x27;t, good luck.<p>Another question is the magnitude of the underpayment in the 21% of trips.

Think deeply on the implications of that.<p>Growing beyond this kind of tribal denial of humanity has always been one of the proudest achievements of the West.

That might be a link between Africa and<p>“ &quot;Ubuntu&quot; as political philosophy encourages community equality, propagating the distribution of wealth. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African Intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued however that this ideal of &quot;collective responsibility&quot; must not be understood as absolute in which the community&#x27;s good is prior to the individual&#x27;s good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community&#x27;s good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference.[12] Audrey Tang has suggested that Ubuntu &quot;implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves.&quot;[13]<p>&quot;Redemption&quot; relates to how people deal with errant, deviant, and dissident members of the community.

The first digital tool I recall using was CmapTools, and it&#x27;s still pretty good.<p>Nowadays I use mostly LiquidText for reading notes, on books and articles (but there are other similar products). It lets you build something similar to a mind map, and it&#x27;s really convenient to select a piece of text or image on a pdf and make it a node in a map. It&#x27;s especially convenient if you have an iPad Pro with a Pencil. However, I could still not find any single tool that encompasses all my &quot;learning modes&quot;. For instance, if I am playing with some OSS project and want to take note on something interesting, I have to use a different product."],"time":["2020-08-24 18:05:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["keiferski"],"id":[24261005],"kids":[24261667,24263668],"parent":[24251068],"text":["Admittedly I haven’t tried either of these methods, but just from reading this post, they both seem prohibitively over-complex.

I tend to split it into two spectrums, the reference spectrum and the recall spectrum.<p>The reference spectrum ranges from looking up a small, discrete nugget of information to restoring a complex mental context.  At the &quot;small nugget&quot; end of the spectrum could be a command line invocation for a specific task, or your mother&#x27;s birthday.  In my experience, search works fine for this if you put in minimal effort when recording the information.<p>At the &quot;complex mental context&quot; end of the spectrum could be a project that you were immersed in six months ago and had to set aside.  Documentation for this purpose takes a lot of care; it&#x27;s essentially writing for another person.  If you&#x27;re not careful and systematic, you can end up accidentally taking a crucial aspect of context for granted and leaving it out.  To choose how to structure notes for this purpose, I think of myself as a consumer.  I have a lot of experience with consuming information, and I know what I like.  I don&#x27;t like mind maps.  I like complete sentences of clear, well-structured prose, with an occasional diagram, lightly hyperlinked where it&#x27;s helpful.  All I need is links, basic formatting, and occasionally embedded media.<p>The recall spectrum ranges from memorizing specific factoids to trying to cement more complex ideas so they&#x27;re available for thought later.  At the factoid end is anything that could fit on a flash card, such as the definition of a word or, whoops, my mother&#x27;s birthday, which probably belongs here under recall instead of under reference!  At the complex end of the recall spectrum is where I would like to put the best books I read.<p>Again, when taking notes for recall, I think of what helps me in my experience.  I like studying Anki cards for factoid recall.  For the complex end, I find the effort that is best rewarded is the work of writing straightforward, well-structured prose.  It&#x27;s very easy to sketch graphs and diagrams that <i>feel<\/i> meaningful, but the ease is a giveaway that you aren&#x27;t really mentally engaging.  Writing is much harder work, because it forces you to engage with the subject in a deeper way than just splashing a vague intuition down on the page.  The value is reflected in consumption:  well-written prose is invaluable, while most of the images that feel like they capture part of the mental context when I have it are no help in restoring it when I don&#x27;t.  (Technical subjects are an outlier; diagrams are often helpful.)  To be clear, since recall is the object, consumption is secondary; what is most important for me is that the act of <i>writing<\/i> well-structured prose helps cement the knowledge in my mind.  It&#x27;s just a nice bonus that if it doesn&#x27;t stick the first time, I&#x27;ll have exactly the kind of notes that are good for refreshing myself later.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I think discussions of note-taking techniques and structures are skewed by the desire to create something visually impressive.  Nobody who is a professional at communicating information to others is using these techniques.  I&#x27;ve never heard anybody say, I need to find a mind map to improve my understanding of the French Revolution, or Franz Kafka, or Apache Kafka.  Mind maps and similar techniques have been around for many decades and have yet to prove themselves as a medium for teaching or communication.  I&#x27;m <i>very<\/i> skeptical of the idea that they have some great yet-to-be-exploited utility for communication, and I&#x27;m also skeptical of the idea that their value for personal use vastly exceeds their value for interpersonal use.  But this is subjective, and perhaps not everybody is the same as me."],"time":["2020-08-24 15:57:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["john4534243"],"id":[24284924],"kids":{},"parent":[24251068],"text":["emacs users check org-roam its quite nice"],"time":["2020-08-26 19:37:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["spicybright"],"id":[24258954],"kids":{},"parent":[24250858],"text":["Reminds me of the Digicomp 1!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digi-Comp_I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digi-Comp_I<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-24 11:38:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bregma"],"id":[24259642],"kids":[24260829],"parent":[24250858],"text":["If I had found one of those when I was a kid I would have been in heaven.<p>What I did have was a CARDIAC [0] computer.
