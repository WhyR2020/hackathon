Between 2018 and 2019, this number jumped from $67 (In line with the rest of the region) to $244.<p>I feel like this statistic was trotted out and means something different from what I&#x27;d casually read it as.<p>Iranian exports fell significantly between 2018 and 2019 [2], it seems because of the fallout of the Iran nuclear deal and resumed sanctions [3].  There was a 69% decrease (1800 units to 570 units), which, means the calculated number would be ~3x higher, or about $211 a barrel.  Which means the &quot;statistic&quot; doesn&#x27;t really tell us what we think - that Iran can only profitably produce oil at &gt;$200 a barrel - but that US sanctions have crippled Iran&#x27;s ability to use oil as a primary source of national income.<p>To be fair, I&#x27;d love to see the author do the math on US oil. Actually, I&#x27;ll take a stab at it.  If the US tried to balance its physical budget (Let&#x27;s say $984B in 2019 [3]) based entirely on increasing the price of current US oil exports (770,000 barrels a day [4]), how much would the price of oil need to rise?<p>770,000 barrels a day * 365 = 280M barrels of oil<p>$984B&#x2F;280M barrels of oil = $3,514<p>The US would need to make an additional $3514 per barrel of oil to balance its physical budget, which is an increase from $63 a barrel to $3,577 a barrel.<p>Can you imagine a journalist writing this as a supporting figure?  &quot;US, implied to be a failing state as it is the largest number here, requires $10,000 a barrel oil to balance budget&quot;.  Yes, that statement is a bit biased, but I&#x27;m willing to defend that this is how the US media most often interfaces with Iran.<p>One critique I would expect is along the lines of &quot;Iran is more dependent on oil for its economy&quot;.  Iran&#x27;s GDP is 23% oil [6], whereas the US is around 8% [7].  I think the story still stands out as a bit insane, even if we adjust for &quot;Expected contribution by GDP %&quot;, which would still put us well-north of $1,000 a barrel oil.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to state that this is my fully-formed opinion, yet, but I think it is worth discussing these either (A) misleading (B) uninterpretable without far greater work &quot;data facts&quot; actually add little value to the story, and instead (seem to) further a narrative.  This is in opposition of the traditional scientific approach, where we state our expectation and validate or invalidate that conclusion, with the author being expected to prove instead of just say something with &quot;QED&quot; implicitly attached.

You have to buy a stack of them for around 10,000 bells and then wait all week for the market to pop. Let&#x27;s say you see it pop to 130-160, which is a fairly common range in my experience. For all the hassle of buying and storing turnips (AC&#x27;s inventory management is high effort and turnips have additional restrictions) you might net 6,000 bells per inventory space. Thing is, Animal Crossing regularly generates bugs and insects which sell for 2,000-8,000 bells. They are also one inventory space, and they are available all the time with no expiration or holding strategy needed. There are also abundant resources like iron ore, where a crafted stack of 30 ore in one inventory space will net you 22,500 bells in profit. Turnips are low value per inventory slot.<p>To get around this, players coordinated online. Sometimes turnips hit a jackpot price in the 300-600 bell range. So that stack is suddenly worth 60,000 and now we see inventory efficiency worth playing with turnips. All you have to do is join an online group and someone will be having a jackpot day every day. You do have to share profits with the host but the scheme is still worth it.<p>This is a big economy mistake. 60,000 bells is quite a lot of money in AC, and a backpack full of turnips turns into 2,400,000 bells which is enough money to bypass most of the game. Avg item price is magnitude 3-4 so these are effectively free now. All from doing a single turnip scheme. Of course players will do this with multiple backpack loads and become deep millionaires living off bank account interest.<p>Nintendo&#x27;s second mistake was to fix this exploit by attacking a symptom and not the root cause. They reduced interest rates by a magnitude, making it balanced for ppl with huge savings accounts and worthless for anyone playing the game as intended. We of course see the folly in this approach in OPs blog where his wife was punished for playing the game as intended. She is now incentivized to join the turnip schemers, making the problem worse.<p>Nintendo should either cap the amount of turnips you can sell on a friend&#x27;s island, reduce the turnip value for island visitors, or disallow visitors selling turnips altogether. Then the bank accounts can remain as is.<p>Anyone with experience tuning f2p economies would have seen this leak a mile away and prevented it from ever happening.

Having say 6 months industry experience as a developer can already easily outweigh all your github projects.<p>- Try to find a job, where your specific background gives you an edge over others. For example instead of going straight into a developer job, you could find a role as a mechanical engineer that can code and from there slowly transition into software engineer. Or a developer job in a company that deals with mechanical engineering one way or another. Domain knowledge can be a huge bump in hiring considerations.<p>Lastly regarding github profile.

My degree was in humanities. Degree might matter for entry level jobs at established companies, but skill and hustle can get you in the door at smaller companies which you can then leverage to go bigger if you want. In my experience, after you get past the junior&#x2F;entry level barrier, nobody cares about your degree after that. As an anecdote, one do the premier Ruby on Rails guys, one that literally wrote the definitive books on it, only graduated high school. My advice — dig deep and become an expert in something rather than trying to be good at everything. “Well rounded” might sound good on paper, but when I need an expert on a particular thing, I am looking for an expert in that particular thing — not simply a generalist. If you are really great at build systems for instance, I’ll hire you without any consideration as to degree or school. If I have an itch, I need to scratch it as quickly and skillfully as possible. If you are a great scratcher, I don’t care how you got there. I got my start at being really good with fixing test suite technical debt in Rails. I developed a minor reputation as someone who could rescue Rails projects that, pun intended, went off the rails. I had a profile on Dice.com and pretty soon, I was flooded with inquiries for high paying contract work. One of those contracts was to fix some esoteric thing for $major_tech_company — that then turned into a full time offer.<p>Be fearless.

I&#x27;ve had a total of about 4 CS courses throughout 4 years of undergrad and 3 years of grad school.  My first software role was 6 or 7 years ago, in SoCal, at a salary of $70k with no stock options or RSUs.  I did have a bit of an advantage in that I had been playing with computers since I was 7, and started using programming as a tool in my 20&#x27;s.  I also had a copy of CLRS that I had studied large portions of, and that helped quite a lot, especially with concepts like Big-O notation.<p>If you&#x27;re going to follow my example (and I&#x27;m not necessarily suggesting you do -- my path did not feel close to optimal), then you should start applying for those &quot;junior for some super low pay&quot; jobs, for at least a year or 2, as long as it&#x27;s enough to support yourself.<p>What I did after that was move to the Bay Area and ended up taking a job at a startup for $105k and some worthless options.  From there, it was a steady progression.  Next job was $140k and some probably worthless options, until now where I&#x27;m over $200k total comp at a public company.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of this to brag, either.  If anything, compared to online salary and comp resources, I&#x27;m probably around the median for 6 YoE in the Bay Area.  But, the median SWE comp is still really good, and you can live quite well on it while maxing out 401k&#x27;s, paying off student debts, or whatever your financial priorities are at the moment.<p>If you go this route, be prepared for a lot of rejection looking for that first job.  Some companies will see no CS degree, no tech internships, and no coding-related work experience, and just bin your resume.  Even on my second job, I was finding myself getting rejected or ghosted for positions where I felt my resume was nearly a perfect match to the job description [0].  Persistence is the only way through.<p>Stuff I would advise you to do that I didn&#x27;t do so well would be things like get a LeetCode premium subscription and start solving the problems.  I don&#x27;t mean &quot;grinding LeetCode&quot; like you see people bragging about on &#x2F;r&#x2F;cscareerquestions; I mean start with the easy problems and use those to learn more about programming, then move on to medium problems and use those to learn about CS, while also gaining insight into interview questions you&#x27;ll see in the wild.<p>If you have friends in the tech industry who are at companies you&#x27;d like to work for, try and get some referrals.  This can get your resume looked at, even if you wouldn&#x27;t appear qualified on the surface.<p>If you land a position that&#x27;s primarily coding&#x2F;software-oriented, but it&#x27;s not literally called something like &quot;software engineer,&quot; consider putting it on your resume like &quot;$ACTUAL_TITLE (software engineer)&quot;.  Part of my problem after my first job was that the position title wasn&#x27;t called &quot;software engineer&quot; even though writing software was literally all I did.<p>There&#x27;s probably more, but those are the main things I can think of right now."],"time":["2020-05-04 00:29:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amatecha"],"id":[23066176],"kids":{},"parent":[23061236],"text":["Generally speaking, yeah, without directly-relevant industry experience you&#x27;ll get stuck entering a more junior or intermediate role.<p>The vast vast majority of job postings are looking for experience in particular areas, such as programming langauges, game engines, commonly-used libraries, software suites etc.  Some places will literally not even consider candidates who don&#x27;t match some of the stricter requirements, like a certain number of years writing C++ or whatever.  Fortunately, many places will overlook a &quot;miss&quot; in key categories if there&#x27;s a lot of good stuff elsewhere.<p>As someone who has been programming for work for over 20 years, I&#x27;m going to disagree with some suggestions you got on here about getting a master&#x27;s degree.  My personal advice, based on my own experience, is you&#x27;re better off getting in the industry as soon as possible.  You will be literally getting paid to learn, and making contacts who can inevitably be your &quot;in&quot; at other companies over the years (if necessary).<p>Everyone&#x27;s experience is different of course.  I&#x27;m one of very few people at my job who are at my level and have no degree at all.  On that note, I know many people who say their degree was completely useless for getting to where they are now (other than maybe looking good on the resume).<p>I think most places will look at your Github profile if you link it -- depending on the company.  Even if I didn&#x27;t mention it to them, I&#x27;ve looked at the open source contributions of every single candidate I&#x27;ve ever evaluated, if they linked it.<p>From what you&#x27;re summarizing, you can absolutely put &quot;software developer&quot; on your resume.  It sounds like you&#x27;ve done a bunch of programming over multiple years and built a bunch of real, working projects.  Though unfortunately, those are not usually given much weight because most companies want to see your experience building shipped products, with a team, over some period of time.  Regardless, you&#x27;re applying for a certain role, so tailor your resume (skillset and experience) to correlate best with that role.<p>Anyway, yes, search around for places that seem interesting and look for the roles they have open.  You may have to apply for many!  There were many places I was so sure I&#x27;d get an interview at, who didn&#x27;t even respond -- even when I had quite a bit of experience.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, just keep trying man.<p>When you get asked about stuff you don&#x27;t know in interviews, don&#x27;t worry about it - just say something like &quot;Ahh I don&#x27;t know about that, but I&#x27;d love to learn about it&quot;.  I mean, assuming you actually would like to learn more stuff, and excel at new programming&#x2F;technology skills! :)<p>If you want to discuss further I&#x27;m actually totally glad to talk, though my experiences might not be directly relevant to where you&#x27;re living.

If you work hard enough there, and you actually market your projects and your own brand, you will have a chance at getting hired. I was offered my first job at a very, very low salary and I took it. After a year, they realized I was worth my salt and they wanted to keep me, so I got a hefty raise.<p>If you want into this industry, I recommend you do the same. Make some open source projects which are useful and market them. Make them look good, visually, and do the same with your own website. Meanwhile, apply places and talk to recruiters. If you get an offer and it&#x27;s a low salary, you should probably take it. The only reason you shouldn&#x27;t would be if your personal expenses require a higher salary (i.e. you have a kid); you may need to lower your class of living, if you&#x27;re single and used to making a lot more. However, once you get that first job, do everything you can. Learn everything you can. A couple years in, people won&#x27;t know you don&#x27;t have a degree; you&#x27;ll just be another dev.<p>There&#x27;s one key thing about practice that I&#x27;ll mention here, though: stick with one thing, at the start. You need to make up for your lack of credentials and experience, so it would be good if you&#x27;re very comfortable with <i>something<\/i>. For me, it was C++ and game engines.<p>With that said, the lack of degree still bites when it comes to job changes. Even later in my career, I&#x27;ve had teams give me the &quot;okay&quot; and even welcome me to the company before someone higher up sees I don&#x27;t have a degree and calls the whole thing off. That primarily happens with larger companies, though, so you&#x27;re better off sticking with smaller companies until you have enough work experience to make people no longer care where&#x2F;when you went to school.<p>Lastly, I mentioned this above, but it&#x27;s the most useful point here and it&#x27;s worth saying multiple times: market your fucking brand. Firstly, if I spent a weekend making a FOSS project, I&#x27;d spend the next week adding documentation, CI, code coverage tests, and everything else which people expect from a Github project these days. Why? Because it looks better and it makes you look better. Secondly, if I make a ray tracer or game engine, I&#x27;m not going to show it rendering some spheres; instead, take the time to parse some file formats to show a whole scene. This is because people make up their mind about something they see in the split second when they first see it. It doesn&#x27;t matter how slick your code is; make it look good to recruiters, team managers, and passers by. Thirdly and finally, know your audience when you&#x27;re making things look good. When you build your website, build it not for super technical people, but for the most average mouse clicker you can imagine. That&#x27;s who you need to impress in order to get your résumé in front of a dev."],"time":["2020-05-04 03:46:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bubba1236"],"id":[23063435],"kids":{},"parent":[23061236],"text":["People are being gatekeepers here.

It truly enables the creation of computational solutions for complex problems at the speed of thought once you learn to think in APL (which likely takes about a year to fully internalize).<p>During the 80&#x27;s I often dreamed of designing a purpose built computational engine (hardware) specifically designed to execute APL commands in one clock cycle.  Hey, I was young and stupid.  While I was using APL I was also coding embedded systems in C and assembler.  I would often wonder &quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be amazing to be able to execute this APL statement in one clock cycle, like some of these assembler instructions on this tiny little MCU?&quot;.<p>Anyhow, let&#x27;s end this on a positive note.  Here&#x27;s a list of language improvements I authored a long time ago.  This list isn&#x27;t exhaustive (it was a five minute stream of consciousness exercise).  Also, some of what&#x27;s on this list might already exist in modern variants of the language.  Feel free to criticize, no problem, and comment. Understand I am issuing advance notice that this is not a perfect list or even a current one.<p><pre><code>  APL should go FOSS or adoption will forever be limited to esoteric high-ROI\n  applications where it might make sense or legacy APL code already exists.\n  \n  The option for compilation would be very interesting.\n\n  Within a function, variables are global by default.  Huge pain in the ass.\n\n  Objects. Yet be careful to avoid the mess OOP can (and often does) become.\n\n  A language-defined interface to C (or some other suitable language) for \n  when you need to speed things up.\n\n  Inline C or Python, or both, as a first class citizen. Make it first \n  hybrid high level language.\n\n  An extension to nested arrays that allows you to create C-like structures.\n  I am going after the self-documenting nature of having structure members \n  have name-based access.\n\n  An extension to function definition to allow for more than two arguments. \n  This would require a little language re-thinking.\n\n  I would also look into making a hybrid that includes some C-like syntax\n  with an APL core.  C&#x2F;C++ -like comments and conditionals with bracketed\n  groupings of APL code would go far in making code easier to read and \n  organize.\n\n  Native C-like switch() primitive with APL-inspired extensions.  For example,\n  switch could take a vector argument.\n\n  APL-run-time-definable comparison operator.  Sometimes I want to apply a complex\n  evaluation function to data rather than the simple equal, not equal, grater&#x2F;less\n  than, etc. operators.\n\n  The ability to enforce data types if desired.\n\n  A means of telling the compiler&#x2F;interpreter to optimize code \n  --at the statement level-- for speed or resource (memory footprint) and \n  other criteria.  Certain operations can explode into huge multidimensional\n  memory-sucking arrays which isn&#x27;t always the best idea.\n\n  Real-time extensions integrated into the language.\n\n  Ability to use and request GPU resources for computation.\n\n  Ability to use and request CPU cores for computation.\n\n  A simple-minded example of the above two would be wrapping a code\n  section with &quot;CPUn{}&quot; or &quot;GPUn{}, where &quot;n&quot; is the core or GPU number.\n\n  Standard interface for custom hardware-based acceleration (read: custom \n  FPGA boards). FPGA&#x27;s are amazing, make them first class cititzens.\n\n  True binary vectors and arrays.\n\n  More flexibility in multidimensional array indexing.\n\n  A rethinking of the workspace model to better support multi-developer \n  environments.\n\n  Genetic and Evolutionary computing primitives built into the language.\n  \n  Neural Network primitives built into the language.\n  \n  Language native image processing (think OpenCV integrated right into the language as a first class citizen)\n  \n  Same with NumPy. APL should be able to do all of this and more.\n\n  Built in primitives for multi-threaded&#x2F;multitasked computing.\n\n  Built in primitives for network access and processing.\n\n  Built in primitives for multi-core and distributed computing.\n\n  Built-in primitives for data exchange.  For example, ingest or output \n  nested array data from&#x2F;to JSON, SQL, XML or other modern data formats.\n\n  Better pattern-matching primitives.  I&#x27;m thinking at least regular \n  expressions. \n\n  A general cleanup of the notation to remove lame text-based &quot;fixes&quot; \n  from an era when rendering non-ascii characters required custom ROMs \n  on the graphics card.  All APL notation should be symbolic.  ASCII \n  should be limited to strings, function, variable, object and other \n  constructs that require text. I&#x27;m talking about a lot of the quad\n  stuff, etc.\n\n  Make it open source and make the open source version far superior to \n  any available commercial version.\n    \n<\/code><\/pre>\nI&#x27;ll end with a slightly edited portion of one of my HN posts from about seven years ago:<p>One of the reasons I abandoned languages such as APL, Forth and LISP, languages that I used extensively for many, many years is that they became less and less practical and relevant.<p>I can apply C to nearly everything from embedded to workstations&#x2F;servers and even in modern hybrids where FPGA&#x27;s are integrated with capable microprocessors.  I can hire people, even entire teams, both locally and around the world to work on anything from embedded to web projects in many of the the C-like languages.  Trying to do the same with APL, Forth or LISP is very close to impossible (and the quality and capability choices you have are much reduced).<p>On the hardware front languages like Verilog are very reminiscent of C and, as long as you understand that you are actually describing hardware and <i>not<\/i> writing software, are easy to pick-up with the appropriate background.<p>You move up to languages such as C++ and other layers open up. PHP, Python, Objective-C when I absolutely must and Java if I have no choice.<p>All of these are very flexible and relevant tools that have, for the most part remained relevant and useful for years. This range of applicability will never be achieved with something like APL.<p>If an APL-like language is going to come to the forefront it will be for very specialized applications where it makes sense. It will not be to run a shopping cart on a website or control a servo on a robot. That&#x27;s just reality.<p>I love APL. I devoted a huge chunk of my professional life to it.

If you move your mouse too quickly, the low polling rate of events becomes evident because rather than showing a smooth curve, you see straight lines that are drawn between the two points that were captured for each event.<p>This is my white whale.<p>I don&#x27;t currently have the math chops to fix this in my own implementations, but there are others who have succeeded where I have failed.  For example, the web client&#x2F;controller thingy for the game Drawful 2 by Jackbox has addressed this.  Since you can&#x27;t increase the polling rate in the browser and you can&#x27;t arbitrarily read the mouse position during things like requestAnimationFrame, you&#x27;re forced to interpolate the movement of the mouse given the past few events.  They&#x27;re using curves in Drawful 2 instead of straight bitmap-style canvas drawing like in the first Drawful.<p>But beware, this has a downside.  It&#x27;s very easy to incorrectly interpolate the movement and exaggerate the curve, making it curvier than the actual movement of the mouse.<p>I guess the web browser just wasn&#x27;t designed with precision input capture in mind.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t still aim for improvement.  For a game like Drawful, more options are probably overkill.  (They don&#x27;t allow you to erase by design.)  But for an art tool like this, it might be worth adding an option for input smoothing along with knobs to tweak to adjust the smoothing amount.  Or not.

I ended up selling it for scrap.<p>The general way that you make power supplies smaller is by increasing the frequency they run at. For SMPS, this means increasing the switching frequency, but there are also some AC standards that run at higher frequencies in places where space and weight is at a premium.

If done wrong it can look like the art of making the easy hard.<p>One good use of category theory is: admitting there are composition patterns other than function composition. For example: in scikit learn the fit_transform interface has composition.  When you wire up compatible classes in a pipeline they lash together the fit, transform, and fit_tranform methods in a simultaneously useful and consistent manner.  With category theory you can say this is a nice form of composition, even though it is not mere composition of functions.<p>Another idea that can be made clearer is: separating a function&#x27;s identity from its action. This lets us claim code optimizations are correct. That is f1 := x -&gt; 2.0 x can be thought of as doubling every real number. Now for real numbers (unfortunately not for mere floating point numbers!) we have an inverse f2 := x -&gt; x&#x2F;2.0.  Under a very narrow view of composition we might force f1(f2(x)) to be realized by code such as 2.0(x&#x2F;2.0). If we think of composition as different than action, we might say f1(f2(x)) is just x (though again, this is true over the real numbers- not over the floating point numbers)."],"time":["2020-05-03 17:10:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ssivark"],"id":[23057961],"kids":[23058566,23058425,23058546,23060433],"parent":[23048149],"text":["The concepts are intuitive enough, and make sense.

It outlined some of the requirements for  developing strong friendships and community. The ones that stood out to me are:<p>-shared experiences<p>-social bonding (knowing the basics of others lives, casual conversation, etc...)<p>-regular serendipitous interactions with people you know<p>It seems to me that current online services do a great job with the first element, have mixed results with the 2nd, and fail at the 3rd.<p>The shared experience is amazing- games transport you to new worlds and give you something to do.<p>The social bonding aspect varies wildly by game and play context. I haven’t chatted socially playing an FPS online for at least 10 years, but I don’t play with real life friends. I know some guys in clans who do.<p>The last one, regular serendipitous interaction seems a hard fail. Basically what this means for friendships and community is that you run in to people you know unintentionally. In real life, I finally started feeling a part of my new community when I started to run into people in knew at the grocery store. I’ve started to recognize some user names on HN, which thrills me (including identifying an old college buddy I hadn’t talked to in years.) My gaming experience? I’m tossed into an experience full of 20-100 random people from all over the world, and then 15 minutes later (or at best the next day) it’s the same all over again.<p>A game looking to increase the social aspect of their wares should look to this third of interaction- repeatedly seeing the same people over and over again. Interestingly, back in the early days of multiplayer the constraints made this better- you had to pick a server to play on one your own, and there was generally only a dozen or so with great latency for your computer. You got to know the user names of people playing there, and technical limitations kept everything human scale (16-32 players at a time, so maybe a couple hundred regular players at most.)"],"time":["2020-05-03 21:39:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["troughway"],"id":[23060113],"kids":{},"parent":[23059797],"text":["Sure, I agree with the basic premise of the article but we already had that, and it’s more complicated than the article suggests it to be.<p>What the article wants are more MMOs where your identity is more closely tied with your in-game avatar, akin to a character in Ultima Online that you spent months working on so that you have enough of a personalization applied to bond with it, and also with the people you’re playing with as a result of having spent a long enough period of time doing things with them (quests, raids, RPing events, etc).<p>Would VR help?

This economic crisis will only make this more apparent.<p>A non-insignificant number of people have grown up in early 2000s on MMOs, so they can understand through experience the psychological power of both healing and destruction (mostly through bullying, griefing) that these games hold. But I am not sure if the contemporary world of gamers can step back in time to a more innocent period of the Internet where it was more about communicating with people you’d see every day on forums, MSN&#x2F;AIM&#x2F;ICQ and less about random sniping comments on Reddit and Xbox.<p>I also want to make it apparent to the slightly older HN crowd that we are the last generation of people who had a childhood without internet and always-connected computers, and an adult life being surrounded in technological marvel from them.

Congrats.<p>So, my major concern with OrbitDB is the use of in-memory indexes to hashes. It&#x27;s a very naive approach for multiple reasons. It just doesn&#x27;t scale well. Node.js handles these particularly poorly, and develops memory leaks in my own experiments with AOILs (append-only immutable logs) inspired by Secure Scuttlebutt.<p>What I mean is, take a look at this code:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db-kvstore&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;KeyValueIndex.js#L5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db-kvstore&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;...<\/a><p>And this:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db-docstore&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;DocumentIndex.js#L5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orbitdb&#x2F;orbit-db-docstore&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src...<\/a><p>I&#x27;d suggest perhaps building that in SnapDB:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ClickSimply&#x2F;snap-db\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ClickSimply&#x2F;snap-db<\/a><p>Though, there are some really hard limits to file locks &#x2F; mutexes that are needed for a decent persistent K&#x2F;V store. Since, pretty much any database is going to need an index, and an index is just a K&#x2F;V store. So, in essence, if your platform can&#x27;t be relied on to implement a good embedded K&#x2F;V store, it can&#x27;t be relied on to create anything other than toy databases.<p>I considered adding SnapDB to OrbitDB, but it would&#x27;ve required a lot of refactoring to support asynchronous lookup. I eventually realized I could do a lot of what I wanted to accomplish without the elaborate CRDTs like OrbitDB employs to keep an ordered log of information.<p>I would also add that, although it should be obvious, just in case it isn&#x27;t, AvionDB now builds on OrbitDB which itself builds on IPFS. So, that&#x27;s a big consideration for those looking to work with this.<p>(The below is mostly from personal experience and not terribly relevant to AvionDB and OrbitDB)<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to do a more formal post-mortem on the project, but haven&#x27;t gotten anything fully organized yet. I discovered all this after creating a project a while back for what was essentially a P2P image gallery built with IPFS and Electron. I wrote it in TypeScript, React (with Hooks), Redux Toolkit (which makes Redux a lot less insufferable than it used to be, my god), and SnapDB and OrbitDB (but not together). I also had go-ipfs running in a process managed by the Electron client, and included it with the build.<p>As a result, the app image binary would generally be in excess of 500MB. And this was just our 0.1.0, we hadn&#x27;t gotten to the really good features yet. The performance was decent in the UI, but the app itself couldn&#x27;t scale very well past 1000 images. go-ipfs was the real limiting factor at the time; it would just fail in really bizarre ways, and I&#x27;d have to not only write code for restarting the go-ipfs process in case it died, but also retry requests that didn&#x27;t go through. I suspected it might&#x27;ve been due to me having pubsub enabled, but my ability to debug that was hamstrung by the fact that OrbitDB hard fails without pubsub enabled. I haven&#x27;t tried it with go-ipfs 0.5.0, I think pubsub is enabled by default with that now, and I&#x27;ve already moved on from that implementation.<p>My biggest concern in terms of performance aside from go-ipfs (which was disappointing and unexpected), was the fact that due to the design, there would be multiple copies of the same data in-memory everywhere: the in-memory indexes used by OrbitDB, the data in Redux, the data in the DOM, etc. I&#x27;m able to effectively integrate all of those using a Rust desktop binary. I&#x27;m using Iced for the UI, and I&#x27;ve moved on from bundling IPFS entirely. It allows me to build desktop and WASM binaries from the same codebase.<p>It&#x27;s possible I could probably make the Electron app work better at this point, but there are still the fundamental limitations I pointed out earlier.<p>For me, content-addressable hashes and IPNS signatures are perfectly fine. I value performance (CPU, RAM, and disk) over anything else, primarily because I&#x27;m developing P2P apps, and without a server, the nodes have to do all the work itself, including the UI. That&#x27;s why I moved off of TypeScript and into Rust. PubSub would be nice, and OrbitDB has a decent implementation of Lamport Clocks and CRDTs for decentralized ordering of events, but it&#x27;s just often overkill for most things that could just be content-addressable.<p>---<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;ve made a lot of claims here, and I&#x27;m hardly an expert on any one of these things, so if I&#x27;ve gotten any of this wrong, I&#x27;d really like to know more. Also, the code I wrote earlier isn&#x27;t available to the public. If I have any say in the matter, it will be locked away within an enormous warehouse, Indiana Jones style, hopefully never to see the light of day again."],"time":["2020-05-03 14:42:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["uberdru"],"id":[23060590],"kids":[23060641],"parent":[23058070],"text":["I don&#x27;t get it.

I will probably get downvoted for saying this, but Jordan Peterson&#x27;s writings on serotonin comes to mind here.<p>This piece can somewhat be forgiven, because it takes the view on dopamine that almost all pop-sci writing takes, which is that it&#x27;s &quot;the pleasure chemical&quot;, i.e &quot;The level of the neuroinhibitor dopamine in the human&#x27;s brain rises. This induces a subjective experience of self-absorbed well being, while rendering the human quiescent&quot;. A more accurate view of dopamine&#x27;s function is that it controls incentive salience or &quot;wanting&quot;, and that wanting vs. liking are distinct attributes of our reward system [1][2]. Dopamine causes the seeking of pleasure. Pleasure itself is caused by something else. This view that the high dopamine state is associated with quiescence and satiety are in direct contradiction with observations. It is well known that amphetamines raise extracellular dopamine in the brain. Folks who take amphetamines become highly motivated, active, aroused, excited, etc. Conversely, there is a class of drugs (dopamine antagonists) which block the action of dopamine. Side effects of these include sedation and lack of sex drive.<p>I would have to agree with the authors in the conclusion section that &quot;this reinterpretation hangs on the specific assertions as to the function of dopamine..&quot;, and unfortunately, these assertions don&#x27;t seem to be evidence based.<p>I feel bad for ragging on this paper so harshly, but it struck me that their starting point was that &quot;hackers&quot; in the HN sense, and a select few other small groups of folks on Earth, are special, different, and enlightened, and that the vast majority of other humans are defective and afflicted with a sort of mind-virus. This is such a dark worldview, and it reeks of the kind of silicon valley exceptionalism that is spoken about on this site often.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motivational_salience\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motivational_salience<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5171207&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5171207&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-03 18:15:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["emmelaich"],"id":[23061692],"kids":{},"parent":[23057700],"text":["I had some memory of this from slashdot, a long time ago.\nIt became a curious little online mini-cult.<p>Found it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;99&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;0914253&#x2F;the-programmers-stone\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;99&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;0914253&#x2F;the-program...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;99&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;137207&#x2F;beyond-the-programmers-stone\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;99&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;137207&#x2F;beyond-the-p...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-03 22:40:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["daneel_w"],"id":[23060549],"kids":[23061093],"parent":[23057700],"text":["M0 = laziness, dejection, lack of motivation etc."],"time":["2020-05-03 19:39:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nickpinkston"],"id":[23059671],"kids":[23059910,23059729,23059803,23059809],"parent":[23059233],"text":["I still think this known military plasma laser tech is the highest likelihood of being the explanation:<p>&quot;Researchers working with high-power laser weapons discovered that they could create a glowing ball of fire in the sky by crossing the beams of two powerful infrared lasers…By moving the laser beams around the sky, the researchers found they could shift the plasma ball back and forth at very high speed….

If you have a head for technical reading, you can have this patent: US20120105181A1. That is a rundown of the mathematics involved. You will also need to know about Radiatively Induced Fermion Resonance. Studying this secret relentlessly for years, I have found little bits of the puzzle. They are nuclear powered aircraft. They utilize a mercury-thorium solution as a fuel source and working fluid. Not a nuclear reactor, but a generator, directly converting the exploitable thorium beta decay chain, to a nuclear magnetic moment. The torus configuration is a self driving EM pump that then creates a force normal to gravity, like a super maglev. This is gimballed to achieve flight and maneuver. Many people have independently reversed this design, and the math is solid. I myself have collected documents to support every claim I just made. There is OPINT, SIGINT, HUMINT in there too. You dont see any Homer Hickam or North Korea types building them because they require literal tons of mercury, and the nuclear material. Mercury is very well controlled on a global scale, just like uranium, all kinds of environmental regulation.<p>The reason this tech will never be publicly released: they are flying nuclear hazmat nightmares. They put out an identifiable form of radiation when they operate. They can be detected, once you know how they run.<p>And we already have something better, there are rumors about newer ones with a better tech, but I dont quite understand the technical claims they make for how those work.

There is an assumption that if an architectural pattern has endured for hundreds of years then its longevity is evidence enough of its universal application.<p>I&#x27;m particularly interested in what Alexander has to say about residential housing, and this strongly-worded opinion from <i>A Pattern Language<\/i> in particular has always intrigued me:<p><i>“In any urban area, no matter how dense, keep the majority of buildings four storeys high or less. It is possible that certain buildings should exceed this limit, but they should never be buildings for human habitation.”<\/i><p>Alexander goes on to argue that high rise living can be socially isolating:<p><i>“High rise living takes people away from the ground and away from the casual, everyday society that occurs on the sidewalks and streets and on the grounds and porches. It leaves them alone in their apartments. The decision to go out for some public life becomes formal and awkward; and unless there is some specific task which brings people out in the world, the tendency is to stay home, alone.”<\/i><p>The arguments sound quite convincing, but I’m not sure I agree entirely with the four storey limit. I think there are also cultural and social factors that contribute to whether high-rise living is a success or a failure. For example, how well are housing blocks stitched into the fabric of the urban landscape (instead of situated, isolated, outside of urban centres)?<p>And in some countries (e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore) high-rise living is a necessity. Having said that, it is also a mistake to assume that high-rise building is the only answer to high-density development e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;LmJ1tTg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;LmJ1tTg<\/a> (from a book called <i>At Home in the City: an introduction to urban design<\/i>)"],"time":["2020-05-03 12:40:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anm89"],"id":[23060805],"kids":{},"parent":[23057298],"text":["Pattern language is one of the the books that influenced me most in my life.

If someone gets $100 of value per seat and you charge $15&#x2F;seat, that&#x27;s great. If you charge $15&#x2F;seat for a product that creates value per gigabyte, people start gaming the system. E.g. they&#x27;ll buy one seat for their company and ask that person to be the proxy user for your product. Or if you charge $10&#x2F;GB and people get $20&#x2F;GB of value of the first few gigabytes and then $5&#x2F;GB of value after that, you&#x27;re going to run into problems.<p>So figure out how users perceive and quantify your value to themselves, and then try to come up with a simple pricing scheme that captures 10-25% of that value. That way every time someone pays you $1, they get $4-$10 of value, and that&#x27;s a no brainer purchase.<p>Getting pricing right has a huge ROI across the board.
