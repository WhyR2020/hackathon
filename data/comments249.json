The reason why I&#x27;m not adopting it for the projects I maintain is as follows:<p>* In library projects, many Dependabot PRs are just increasing the patch version of the library. Unless they require new features added in the new version, I think libraries shouldn&#x27;t do this. This does actually more harm than good because sometimes, downstream might not want to update the patch version of a dependency but might want to update your library. The only argument in favour is that you might miss it if your library requires a new version, but in general, libraries should strive to require a larger range of versions. A hammer is only more useful if it works with nails bought 30 years ago.<p>* In application projects, I prefer doing dependency updates in bulk rather than as soon as possible: Replacing a dependency high in the tree causes all its dependents to be rebuilt, which causes CPU overhead for everyone who is building my code: Sometimes you need to rebase a PR and you shouldn&#x27;t have to wait for the dependencies to compile because master branch had to do some update. Similarly, when you bisect some regression it&#x27;s annoying if you have to rebuild the dependencies of the project on every bisection step. Thus I&#x27;m generally waiting to do dependency updates (cargo update as well as semver-noncompliant version updates) once per month. It&#x27;s no strict rule but still a rule. Exceptions are e.g. when a dependency fixes a bug that affects my code or when a dependency update requires nontrivial work.

Huh?&quot;. But whenever I think someone is being that stupid, it&#x27;s always worth a second look, and it turns out the reality is more complex.<p>This article[1] linked off of the OP goes into detail about their crashes. It describes a design philosophy that pushes robustness fully onto the pilot, expecting him to flawlessly stitch together independent automated systems and unreasonably rapidly interpret and react to  their error modes. In the case described in the article, separate automated systems had contrasting views of the world, and shouted their contradictory errors at the pilots, relying on them to be able to instantly reconcile these models and figure out what the root problem was. (In this case, a specific sensor failure made a single system think the plane was pointed up, and this system made the isolated decision to push the nose downwards while warning that the nose was too high. Naturally, other systems simultaneously complained about the nosedive).<p>One solution, of course, is to remove automated systems from planes. But assuming they provide any value (I don&#x27;t think this is in dispute?): another, more reasonable strategy is to commit more fully to an automated system design that is intentionally fault-tolerant, robust to system and sensor errors, and has a more complete view of the plane&#x27;s world. Instead of requiring the overall state of the meta-system to be lossily communicated to humans in a time-critical emergency, the newer designs are intended to use all the information available to the plane&#x27;s systems to reconcile subcompoments&#x27; contradictory view of the world.

Already Alois Alzheimer, when first describing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, noted amyloid-beta plaques as a key pathological finding. Amyloid-beta plaques are a characteristic of the disease, and a proper Alzheimer diagnosis requires the presence of amyloid-beta plaques.<p>Many variants of early-onset Alzheimer are caused by mutations either directly in APP (the precursor to amyloid-beta) or genes intimately involved with APP-processing (e.g. PSEN1 and PSEN2). These mutations often cause extreme levels of amyloid-beta and amyloid plaques.<p>Raised levels of amyloid-beta and amyloid plaques is a necessary condition for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, both early- and late-onset.

Ideally have a set of visual regression tests just to be safe<p>* Profile your NodeJS code just like you do with browser code. Sometimes the bottleneck could be in an Express middleware or in reading a massive Webpack manifest file<p>* If a component doesn&#x27;t need to rendered on the server, don&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t waste CPU cycles (for ex, out-of-view content). Just make sure you got your SEO meta tags right<p>* Don&#x27;t load more data than you need. It takes time to parse, it takes time to loop through and it takes time to stringify for rehydration<p>* Enable BabelJS&#x27;s debug mode and remove unnecessary plugins<p>* Don&#x27;t import more stuff than you need. Tree-shaking is important on the server-side too<p>* If you&#x27;re using CSS modules, use the Webpack loader `css-loader&#x2F;locals` on the server so that it doesn&#x27;t emit CSS files (useless). The client compiler should do so<p>* Monitor your server-to-server requests. They&#x27;re usually what take the longest, so cache the most important ones<p>* As with the majority of websites, cache is king<p>* Properly serialize your JSON strings. That&#x27;s what we use: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;eliseumds&#x2F;6192135660267e2c64180a8a9cdb7dd1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;eliseumds&#x2F;6192135660267e2c64180a8a9c...<\/a><p>* It can be worth it to return a dangerous HTML string from a component instead of a tree of React nodes.

The evidence in humans is mixed, but it either shows no effect or a tendency in the other direction. There is a study in the same issue (Spitschan) that says there is no effect in humans.<p>1. First, the study does not question the contribution of melanopsin (the blue-cyan opsin that got everyone talking about &quot;blue light&quot;) - it asks a more subtle question: when you hold melanopsin stimulation constant, what does the <i>remaining<\/i> light do and why? Here they are finding whether the cones oppose or boost melanopsin based on color signals. But regardless of how this works in humans, we should still expect bright-enough blue light at night to be stimulating, because of the response due to melanopsin.<p>2. Holding the melanopic portion of a light constant is not something we usually do. For most lights we have today, the &quot;blue&quot; lights would be considerably dimmer than the &quot;yellow&#x2F;red&quot; ones if we did this. When we compare lights of equal visible brightness, the yellow ones are known to have less effect on human melatonin suppression [Chellappa 2011].<p>3. The evidence in humans is mixed, but it actually goes the other direction (saying blue is more stimulating), or there is no clear effect. In the same issue, a <i>study on humans<\/i> by Spitschan found a negative result on whether or not S-cone contrast has an effect: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(19)31501-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(19)...<\/a><p>3b. Other research (in monochromatic and polychromatic light) finds that humans are <i>more<\/i> sensitive to blue light than melanopsin would suggest. See a list below.<p>4. We&#x27;re all still trying to explain how the transition to dusk is blue&#x2F;purple, while our own lighting doesn&#x27;t do that. We have built our lighting to be relatively bright, but warm. It is not &quot;natural&quot; to extend the day like we do, but it likely would not help anything to make the lights more blue, unless they were quite a lot dimmer, or used very novel spectra.<p>Here is a list of references for the evidence +&#x2F;- blue sensitivity (not melanopsin) in humans:<p>1. The Thapan study from 2001 indicates extra blue-light sensitivity in addition to melanopsin. Lights are seen for a half hour at night. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00261.x\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00261.x<\/a><p>2. The Spitschan study <i>from this same issue of Current Biology<\/i> says there is no effect in either direction when comparing 83x S-cone contrast. The lights here are &quot;pink&quot; (which has a lot of blue) and &quot;orange&quot; which has very little. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(19)31501-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(19)...<\/a><p>3. The Brainard 2015 study compares 4000k to 17000k lights: at the same &quot;melanopic&quot; level the 17000k lights do a lot more melatonin suppression: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdc.jefferson.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&amp;context=neurologyfp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdc.jefferson.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&amp;c...<\/a><p>4. There is one important study in humans (Gooley 2010) that says we can be more sensitive to 555nm light after two days in dim light, so that mirrors this study. But this is not exactly comparable to the study cited here due to sensitization: it stands on its own due to the duration of the experiment.<p>It would be interesting if we could find some &quot;truth&quot; to the idea that twilight colors affect human circadian entrainment - it has been a recurrent idea for many years. We finally have the technology to target melanopsin separately from the S-cone (see Spitschan&#x27;s work for an example).<p>For the press these results get, you&#x27;d be surprised that there has been extremely little research funding for most of these things in the last ten years. In a way, I hope that mixed results like these might help! How light affects us at lower levels, and how different we are from each other is not &quot;solved&quot; at all, so there is still a lot of work to do."],"time":["2019-12-30 22:00:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mgraczyk"],"id":[21915970],"kids":[21916820,21916305,21916037,21917939,21916950,21916371,21917002,21916797,21919213,21917435,21919248,21916227],"parent":[21905138],"text":["Anecdotally, I can pretty reliably trigger a migraine by staying up 2-3 hours later than normal staring at a normal LCD screen.<p>With flux&#x2F;redshift on, that doesn&#x27;t happen.

I think much of the disagreement in this comment thread is based on a tacit assumption that everyone works on the same kinds of code bases. A web app is not the Linux kernel, and the priorities and concerns in development when annotating code will differ.<p>For example, in much of the database code I work with, TODO is used for <i>optimization banking<\/i>. In performance critical applications, this is the practice of pervasively tagging (often with TODO) micro-optimization opportunities in the code. When a bug fix or new feature unavoidably creates a significant performance regression (I use 5%), you implement several of the &quot;banked&quot; optimizations documented as TODO in order to bring performance back to parity. For this reason, a TODO may linger in the code base indefinitely <i>and that is okay<\/i>. It is a searchable annotation for code work that may never need to be done.<p>You do not put these kinds of TODO items in an issue tracker because they are extremely local and contextual to the code they apply to. Filling the issue tracker with thousands of these kinds of issues which can&#x27;t be understood without looking at the specific lines of code the comment was applied to has high overhead with negligible value. You <i>do<\/i> open an issue in the tracker for performance regressions in a subsystem, or if you want to improve the performance by some metric, which directs a developer to start looking at the banked optimizations in the TODO comments inside the code.<p>Another rarely discussed use case for TODO is assumption verification around the internal behavior of external dependencies. Developers make assumptions about code dependencies (e.g. Linux syscalls or compiler code generation) based on trivially observable and testable behaviors. For code that needs to make strong assumptions about dependency behavior for robustness, it is frequently impractical at the time of writing code to verify that assumptions hold under all conditions or that they will remain true over time (see: Linux fsync() behavior). This becomes an issue that is never &quot;resolveable&quot; in a meaningful sense because it is a moving target and time-consuming to research for any particular case. The TODO is a reminder to re-verify behavior if anything has changed in the software environment or a new bug has shown up and usually notes what <i>has<\/i> been verified in the past.<p>Feature and bug work belongs in an issue tracker but there are many &quot;issues&quot;, particularly ones that are non-functional and require extremely local context or can never be properly resolved, that are often best served in direct code annotation."],"time":["2019-12-30 18:25:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jbaudanza"],"id":[21910445],"kids":[21911155,21910792,21910468,21910953,21910908,21913634,21910968,21910684,21910761],"parent":[21910391],"text":["I use TODO in my code all the time as shorthand for: &quot;This code is functional, but if you are going to do another iteration you may want to consider the following improvement or optimization.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not at all meant to be to be like an item in a TODO list.

It doesn’t mean cost-efficiency. It means the ability to solve scalability issues at 10x, 100x, 1000x load by throwing money at it (aka buying more instances&#x2F;machines).<p>Yes, John Carmack is right that a bunch of scaleable systems that see reasonable load, with well-understood traffic requirements could be rewritten more efficient ways. But how long would it take? How much would the extra work cost? And what would happen if traffic goes up, to another 10x, 100x? Can you throw still throw money at that problem, with this new and efficient system already in-place?<p>One of my memorable stories comes from an engineer I worked with when we rewrote our payments system[1]. He told me how at a previous payments company, they had a system that was written in this kind of efficient way, and needed to run on one machine. As the scale went up, the company kept buying bigger hardware, at one point buying the largest commercially available mainframe (we’re talking the cost being in the multi-millions for the hardware). But the growth was faster and they couldn’t keep up. Downtime after downtime followed at peak times, making hundreds of thousands of losses per downtime.<p>They split into two teams. Team #1 kept making performance tweaks on the existing hardware to try to get performance wins, and increase reliability during peak load. Team #2 rewrote their system in a vertically scaleable way. Team #1 struggled and the outages kept getting worse. Team #2 delivered a new system quickly and the company transitioned their system over.<p>What they gained was not cost savings: it was the ability to (finally!) throw money at their growth problems. Now, when traffic went up, they could commission new machines and scale with traffic. And they could eventually throw away their mainframe.<p>Years later, they started to optimise the performance of the system, making millions of $ in savings. The new system - like the old one - cost millions to run. But that was besides the point. Finally, they stopped bleeding tens of millions in lost revenue per year due to their inability to handle sudden, high load.<p>It’s all about trade-offs. Is cost your #1 priority and are you okay spending a lot of development time on optimising your system? Go with C++, Erlang or some other, similarly efficient language. Is product-market fit more important, with the ability to have high uptime, that you can buy? Use the classic, horizontally scaleable distributed systems stack, and worry about optimising later, when you have stable traffic and optimisation is more profitable over product development.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;distributed-architecture-...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-30 08:15:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["coderunner"],"id":[21910709],"kids":[21911583],"parent":[21907517],"text":["What about in the context of trying to get to an MVP?

Now I only pay that much for games I know I&#x27;ll like, and otherwise wait for the inevitable deep sales.<p>I would also not be surprised is Steam sets things up so that they collect a sizable transaction fee like the iOS app store for such transactions, and that publishers demand a cut of those proceeds as well in order to publish on the platform.

I could easily add a third stream for an aux-in line dangling off the machine, for people to plug in to for parties&#x2F;hardware players&#x2F;etc<p>- Most clients are Raspberry Pis with USB audio DACs.  My macOS machines also run snapclient.  I only have one Windows machine (my TV box) I wanted to include, and ended up just running a Ubuntu VM with snapclient to make that happen.  (The other option is to use pulseaudio in a VM, and then also an ancient Windows port of pulseaudio to actually take the pa data out to the speakers, but ugh)<p>- Including all computers, I have 8 clients, I think?  You can enable &quot;send audio to muted clients&quot; to avoid a re-buffer delay when rooms turn on and off<p>- You can push latency quite low if you want, especially if everything in your house is hardwired.  My desktop audio is almost always Spotify now, out of laziness, and really when I&#x27;m using the desktop client I&#x27;m actually controlling the remotely-playing VM.  The latency doesn&#x27;t bother me, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to that kind of thing<p>- I use cheap 10-button RF remotes as &quot;light switches&quot; in all rooms.  It&#x27;s nice to have that many buttons to standardize some things.  For music, two buttons are play&#x2F;stop spotify, with some overloaded functions (pressing play while music is already playing skips to next track)"],"time":["2019-12-30 22:02:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jrobn"],"id":[21916259],"kids":[21916355,21916529],"parent":[21905120],"text":["I have an extensive sonos setup for my business.

Elemental Design Patterns [1] shows a way of relating the formal lambda calculus of OOP relationships to design patterns by defining the set of the core operation relationships between types&#x2F;objects&#x2F;fns&#x2F;etc. If you treat all objects&#x2F;types&#x2F;functions&#x2F;etc as a cartesian grid, those core relationships define a basis vector that allows you to combine different operations that create the famous OOP design patterns. And in fact I&#x27;ve always thought of that basis vector the same way as the movements of a chess board, and I&#x27;ve wondered if there&#x27;s other moves you could add to provide an easier way of hitting all squares.<p>Since a programming language selects specific syntax to navigate these relationships, if you could describe a language in terms of a lower level basis language, would it make it easier to see which patterns are missing from a language to help move from one concept to another? Could this help design committees select better language constructs that don&#x27;t do the same things, or conflict in some way? And I&#x27;m going to go out here on a limb and hypothesize that a language is Turing Complete if it provides language constructs to allow you to hit every square on the grid, but again not enough skill to prove it myself.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ve never thought about the modulo math of these operations like in the case of a Knight&#x27;s move, so this was super interesting!

Alchemy and humors and the four elements all had some amount of observation of outcomes which lead to those theories, and later on evidence disproved them and a new theory took hold. There’s no need to talk about how silly and wrong those people were—rather, more so just how much more we know about the world.<p>Additionally there’s a hidden assumption that introductory chemistry should be teaching people what chemists do.

In fact, it&#x27;s just a rant.<p>Maybe I should let this pass but this essay really rubs me the wrong way. I would like to stress that the author is _not_ a chemist. That was obvious before he wrote it in his text. He does not have formal training in the discipline (art?) and thus his opinion should be taken with serious skepticism.<p>On the other hand, I am a (published) college trained chemist, specialised in computational&#x2F;theoretical chemistry in grad school but I did go through a very good program with anywhere between 10-15 hours of lab work every week, every year. Contrary to the author, I remember the names of all the textbooks I used because I spent so much time with them. Really, the author seems frustrated with his own _very_ limited experience of chemistry.<p>There is a reason why we &quot;follow recipes&quot;. Mishandling of chemicals can and do cause injuries. Labs do get blown up. For all of my education, entrance to any laboratory was conditional on passing a test. Every time. One would be evaluated by either graduate students or professors before being allowed in. If you did not know what you were going to do, how you were going to do it, why you were doing it, what you should expect to happen, along with any other necessary information deemed essential by the instructors, you would be refused access to the lab and consequently get 0 in the mandatory laboratory report. And accidents _still_ happened, sometimes innocuous, sometimes dangerous to the point of having to evacuate the lab for a few minutes.<p>Not all experiments were &quot;cookbook laboratory work&quot; either. From the very first lab session, students had agency in how you plan and execute your experiment. No two students held notes exactly the same, for example. And no two students researched the subject as much beforehand, something which was _very_ obvious during lab work. Sharing a laboratory with students who did not prepare properly is dangerous in a way you can&#x27;t really grasp until you&#x27;re three hours into a multi-step anhydrous synthesis, you need to act fast to add a reagent in your air-free setup and the student next to you flushes a syringe of oxalyl chloride[1] in the sink beside you.<p>We _did_ have to analyse unknown compounds. We _did_ have a lot of liberty in how we conducted experiments, as long as we prepared well and acted safely. Practicing balancing chemical equations is NOT useless as the author suggests. Contrary to what he seems to believe, empirical evidence is _all there is_. Theories have to conform to reality, not the other way around.<p>All in all, this is a very bad argumentation that _completely_ misses the point. The author is talking about general chemistry as if it defines a complete chemical education. In actuality, general chemistry is only the very most basic knowledge one needs to have to be allowed in a lab. Chemistry doesn&#x27;t stop there.<p>I was ready to give the author a chance but he has shown himself to be unqualified to discuss the topic. Being a dilettante is fine but there is a mountain of work separating a dilettante and a professional. Nobody on HN would seriously consider a rant about the current state of Medical education written by someone who had 2 semesters of biology.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oxalyl_chloride\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oxalyl_chloride<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-31 04:17:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["User23"],"id":[21918140],"kids":[21919035],"parent":[21913566],"text":["My high school chemistry teacher opened with the thermite reaction experiment.

There are plenty of algorithms that <i>have<\/i> been broken over the years, and there is no mathematical proof that the current set are unbreakable. Sure, the algorithms they listed aren&#x27;t broken yet, but that&#x27;s a carefully crafted list. In any case, &quot;not broken yet&quot; is a far cry from &quot;unbreakable&quot;.<p>Another problem is that if a crypto algorithm is broken, there&#x27;s a significant risk that the users of the algorithm will not be informed until possibly decades later. Many countries dedicate serious resources to attack, and would want to exploit those advantages if they could find them.<p>Finally, if a major algorithm (e.g., AES) was broken, it would take many years (probably more than 10) to replace it. The reality is that software systems are often hard to upgrade. Yes, that&#x27;s a problem, but ignoring reality doesn&#x27;t make it go away.<p>The only solution we know of is to have large margins.<p>In the physical engineering world, where we have far better understanding (due to physical models), smart engineers include significant margins when designing things.

Hence MCAS. This is because the landing gear can&#x27;t be lengthened without expanding the gear bays, which would void the type certificate AFAICT.<p>Second, the larger size of the plane means that a single pilot cannot be guaranteed to be able to use the manual trim wheels in all flight modes. The force required is extreme, weaker pilots may not be capable of trimming the aircraft. This can&#x27;t be fixed without changing the trim wheel size (which requires a new cockpit layout) and&#x2F;or the horizontal stabilizer, both of which would void the type certificate.<p>Third, critical flight control systems need to be triple-redundant, and there are only two AOA sensors. Since the plane cannot be certified without MCAS (point 1) and MCAS can command a catastrophic failure (see two craters) it should be a triple-redundant system. A new AOA sensor would void the type certificate.<p>Canada stated that they would certify the MAX without MCAS and with required pilot training, if its performance characteristics were acceptable. Boeing has made no attempt (AFAICT) to try this, which raises suspicion that MCAS is in fact required for certification, which would make it a Fly-By-Wire system (and subject to appropriate regulations, requiring hardware changes) and not just a stability augmentation system.

A little software routine was added to an existing computer to add nose-down trim in situations of higher angles of attack, to counteract the nose-up aerodynamic moment of the new, much larger, and forward-mounted engine nacelles.”<p>“Apparently the risk assessment for this system was not commensurate with its possible effects on aircraft behaviour and subsequently a very odd (to a safety engineer&#x27;s eyes) system design was chosen, using a single non-redundant sensor input to initiate movement of the horizontal stabiliser, the largest and most powerful flight control surface.

I really think that starting from first principles allows one to end up with an elegant solution, regardless of whatever errata is present in a language. A good framework is the elucidation of an idea with the edge cases covered so that you don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel. It should give you the tools you need to integrate with your code and then get out of the way.<p>Specifically, take something like Laravel. It&#x27;s based on Ruby on Rails, which borrows heavily from .NET. Personally I think that Ruby is a decent language that gets a few things right, despite some early compromises to get closer to the metal which caused some unwieldiness down the road. However, Ruby on Rails has a brutal learning curve unmatched by just about any other framework that I&#x27;ve learned. And the end result unfortunately succumbs to being too opinionated due to emphasizing convention over configuration too much IMHO. I think that&#x27;s why it fell from favor, and personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for new development.<p>Whereas Laravel does a lot of what Rails does, despite using the &quot;hackier&quot; PHP language and less syntactic sugar or magic under the hood. The companion Laracasts are mostly exceptional. I would even go so far as to say that if you want to learn Ruby on Rails, learn Laravel first. That way you can build on context and be comfortable with Rails in a few weeks rather than the months it would take to learn it from scratch. You&#x27;ll also notice the inconsistencies in Rails more and be able to work around them so your code is conceptually correct, rather than evangelize why their existence is needed or that they&#x27;re the &quot;one true way&quot; to do something.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that after using Ruby on Rails, I&#x27;m still not sure what problem it&#x27;s trying to solve half the time. It seems to be structured in a way that solves issues encountered late in a project, but it&#x27;s never really clear why one path was chosen over another. Like I solve a problem in my head, then have to translate it to the Ruby on Rails way. I don&#x27;t get that as much with less-opinionated frameworks like Laravel. I think the best approach is to provide as much functionality as possible with sane defaults but not force the user into a paradigm.<p>Simplifying from Angular to Vue is another example of this. There are many others, but to play on this, it&#x27;s one of the reasons why I&#x27;m uncomfortable with stuff like Kubernetes. Or even Unity for that matter. The more monolithic&#x2F;enterprisy&#x2F;opinionated something is, the more I&#x27;m skeptical of it.<p>This idea of working from first principles (the way a new user might) is a way to think about how to go about writing code that junior developers can use, even if the concepts involved are senior-level. I practice this technique but it easily gets lost in translation and I find myself explaining the easy vs simple dichotomy a lot. It&#x27;s probably even cost me jobs to be honest. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong."],"time":["2019-12-30 21:51:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["3fe9a03ccd14ca5"],"id":[21910866],"kids":{},"parent":[21899636],"text":["&gt; <i>The project can’t really grow anymore.

This setup helps me focus on what I need to knock out without too much mental overhead, and is especially helpful when I come back to a project after a break.

The linking UX between the 3 features I use (issues, projects, and milestones) makes navigating the project convenient, without feeling like I am locking myself into github as a vendor. I avoid putting too much work into the kanban backlog beyond what’s in progress or next up for this reason, and releases are kept small so I could recreate them in a few minutes in a text file if I moved to another platform like sourcehut.
