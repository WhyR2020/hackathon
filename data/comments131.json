Apart from improving upon ML, can more sensors and physical modeling get us past the AV plateau?<p>An example of an additional sensor would be an infared camera. I don&#x27;t know how well infared cameras work during the day or when they are occluded, but they seem like they can provide an additional datapoint to classify an object as &quot;person&quot; for example. That way, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re wearing a paper bag Halloween costume, the car still knows what&#x27;s underneath.<p>Physical modeling seems like it would help with prediction. If a deer is idle on the side of road ahead, a car with a physical &quot;deer&quot; model would account for the probability that the deer will suddenly dart across the road and the speed at which it can possibly do so. It will slow down and watch for certain behaviors, such as the deer standing up from a prone position, and modify its probabilities accordingly. That is, after all, what we humans do. The ML wouldn&#x27;t need to perfectly model all animals. Some animals would be put into a &quot;mammal&quot; class or more vague &quot;animal&quot; class, paying special attention to size and stature.<p>Additionally, depending on how long it might take to develop truly autonomous self-driving cars, we might want to develop self-driving car friendly infrastructure. I&#x27;m talking about AV-only lanes with safeguards in place to minimize variability, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, infrastructure-to-vehicle communication, and better than average maintenance. It seems like it might be worth it, given the gains to be had.<p>Here&#x27;s an underappreciated angle to the AV-friendly infrastructure: it&#x27;s a hedge against incorrect predictions. What if truly autonomous vehicles are actually 15 years away? In that case, if an &quot;AV heaven&quot; is developed in a corridor somewhere in Los Angeles 5 years from now, that&#x27;ll be the only place where the AV dream is realized for the ensuing 10 years. The profit from &quot;AV heaven&quot; can be reinvested into AV development. It can also be used to expand into other areas. Moreover, AV heaven might galvanize the government, public, academia, and investors to eliminate any bottlenecks in AV development. There&#x27;s no immutable stone tablet, only viewable by God, that says &quot;AV development must take X years.&quot; We can modify the timeline to some extent. Lastly, AV heaven would allow us to observe the true value of self driving cars. What if they&#x27;re better than we ever imagined? What if they radically change human behavior? What if they increase development in surrounding areas by a lot? What if they change the nature of work and where people live by more than we even expected? What if self-driving trucks + last mile bot delivery radically push down prices on everything and enable previously impractical business models or behavior?

We should recognize that it&#x27;s the result of how they&#x27;re set up, and not a reflection of human behavior as a whole.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9rvroo&#x2F;most_of_what_you_read_on_the_internet_is_written&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9rvroo&#x2F;most...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-19 01:30:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thedogeye"],"id":[22623357],"kids":[22623553],"parent":[22622574],"text":["Commenting just to mess with the ratios on this rule."],"time":["2020-03-19 02:18:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yamrzou"],"id":[22627121],"kids":{},"parent":[22622574],"text":["Related discussion: &quot;Most of What We Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People (2019)&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18881827\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18881827<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-19 14:12:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dredmorbius"],"id":[22624709],"kids":{},"parent":[22622574],"text":["For Google+, by one measure (all registered profiles), the &quot;1%&quot; were actually the 0.16%<p>When considered against all profiles <i>which had posted at least once<\/i>, which gets around the forced-account dynamic, the comparison of 0.16% vs. 5.09%, is ... approximately p%:  3.1434185%  Much closer to the 1% rule, and probably more accurately reflecting actual lurkers, which should bring it even closer in line.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.perficient.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;real-numbers-for-the-activity-on-google-plus&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.perficient.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;real-numbers-for-the...<\/a><p>NB:  The research above was based on methods I&#x27;d developed, and reached results quite similar to my own, though it was done independently and I had no idea it was performed until Eric Enge published it.<p>Communicating just how thin active G+ usership was, to many of those active I=users, proved surprisingly hard.

This way, the kernel&#x27;s interface can change as needed without breaking existing userland binaries. Windows gets this right: system calls go through ntdll.dll.

There are many other use cases across the Foundation where heavy interactivity is needed. Even within Wikipedia, there are cases like the editor &#x2F; edit mode which can be considered non-trivial JavaScript applications.<p>- Adopting a new framework !== More JavaScript.

Recently I had to do some development with MS Powershell. I was very reluctant at first, but after getting familiar with the technology, I almost fell in love.<p>&quot;Cmdlets&quot;, basically commands used in Powershell, output &quot;objects&quot; instead of the streams of text used in a more classical shell. Powershell has built-in tools to work with these objects. For example, you can take the output from one Cmdlet, pipe it through `SELECT` with a list of fields specified, and get a stream of objects only containing those fields. Other operations can be performed against those objects as well, such as filtering and whatnot.<p>Back to normal <i>nix commands, we&#x27;re starting to see more and more commands introduce direct JSON support [1]. There are even tools to translate output from common commands into JSON [2]. We&#x27;ll probably see `jq` shipped directly with modern distros soon. Eventually we&#x27;ll reach a tipping point where it&#x27;s expected that command supports JSON output. Tools like `awk`&#x2F;`sed` might get updated to have a richer support for JSON. Finally, we&#x27;ll have ubiquitous Powershell-like capabilities on every <\/i>nix machine.<p>Powershell _is_ available on Linux. The model of piping objects instead of JSON is both powerful and more efficient (For example, there&#x27;s no redundant keys like in a stream of JSON objects, leading to less moving bytes, like how CSV headers aren&#x27;t repeated with every row. Plus, binary data is smaller than text.) But, most developers are hesitant to switch out their shell and existing workflows for a completely new tool, which is why Powershell will likely only be adopted by a small subset of sysadmins.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daniel.haxx.se&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;curl-write-out-json&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daniel.haxx.se&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;curl-write-out-json&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kellyjonbrazil&#x2F;jc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kellyjonbrazil&#x2F;jc<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-19 19:05:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["onion2k"],"id":[22626628],"kids":{},"parent":[22626080],"text":["If you&#x27;re not aware of what jq is, it&#x27;s &quot;JSON Query&quot;, a cli tool for filtering JSON streams - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stedolan.github.io&#x2F;jq&#x2F;manual&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stedolan.github.io&#x2F;jq&#x2F;manual&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-19 12:58:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gklitt"],"id":[22628839],"kids":{},"parent":[22626080],"text":["Very neat project!

The defaults that the website creators have selected seem pessimistic on average compared to even the source research which can have the effect of misleading users as to what the expected outcome of the pandemic is.<p>Since under-reacting and over-reacting to this situation both have huge real-world ramifications, making assessments based off of even a fully valid and well-designed model can lead to incorrect decisions being made if its parameters are set unrealistically.<p>----<p>First of all, there are a TON of variables and many of them pull values from extremely thin data.  Although it looks like the researchers didn&#x27;t just make up any of their values, there are several instances of very impactful parameters being hand-waved:<p>## MITIGATION CURVE<p>The &quot;Mitigation&quot; ratio curve, an unsurprisingly critical variable for the simulation, seems too high even for the &quot;strong&quot; mitigation preset.  Even after looking extensively, I couldn&#x27;t find any explanation or justification from the simulation&#x27;s creators as to how they created their default curve.  As this is possibly the most impactful parameter in the entire simulation, that just makes it more critical to correctly pick its value.<p>Judging by the degree of dramatic measures that society has taken so far and the actions of people that I&#x27;ve observed, I&#x27;d personally estimate that ratio to be much lower than even the one included in the &quot;strong&quot; mitigation curve.  Of course this is random guesstimation of my own here, but it goes to illustrate the massive changes in results that can stem from small changes to the input values they&#x27;ve chosen.<p>After starting at default settings, setting population to USA, and setting mitigation factor to &quot;strong&quot;, further adjusting the March 15 mitigation factor value down 10% from 60% to 50% (a value that seems extremely reasonable and even generous to me) causes the total number of cases to drop by nearly 66% holding all other values constant.  Adjusting it to 40% reduces the total infections by another nearly 50% from there.<p>Another paper that is cited by the simulation&#x27;s authors writes that &quot;[...] by taking drastic social distancing measures and policies of controlling the source of infection, with the tremendous joint efforts from the government, healthcare workers, and the people (Fig. 1), Rt was substantially reduced [from 3.58] to 0.32 in Wuhan after February 2, which was encouraging for the global efforts fighting against the Covid-19 outbreak using traditional non-pharmaceutical measures [...]&quot; [4]  This would seem to represent a mitigation ratio of 0.1 after just around a month.  Clearly there are differences in the way that the pandemic was handled in China compared to how it&#x27;s being handled now in the rest of the world, but China&#x27;s ability to combat it that effectively seems to lend credence to the idea that mitigation ratios of less than 0.5 are possible if not already in place in the US and across the rest of the world.<p>In any case, claiming nearly 80% of the transmissibility of this virus remaining at this point in time and maxing out at 60% as the &quot;moderate&quot; case seems dangerously exaggerated to the upside and potentially skews the results of the whole simulation due to how critical this one variable is in determining the output.<p>## ANNUAL AVERAGE R0<p>Another foundational variable is R0: The number of additional infected individuals per infection. The linked research paper states &quot;the early human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV was characterized by values of R0 around 2.2 (median value, with 90% high density interval: 1.4–3.8)&quot; [2]  Although the distribution from the research paper has a long tail towards higher values, setting a value of 2.7 for &quot;Moderate&#x2F;North&quot; feels somewhat disingenuous given that the mean is 2.2.<p>Of course other research papers list a wide range of different values for this variable, so perhaps expanding the range of the presets would be a better option.  In any case, this variable is dominated by the mitigation factor in cases of high mitigation, so its precise value may not matter as much in those situations.<p>## SEASONAL FORCING<p>The &quot;seasonal forcing&quot; factor varies from 0 to 0.2 in all of their &quot;Epidemiology&quot; presets.  On their about page, the example they provide in their graph seems to have a value of ~0.6, but that may just be an illustration using non-realistic values for visual effect. [1]<p>One other thing to note is that their implementation uses the selected R0 as a mean value for their function, meaning that at the peak month the true R0 is `(1 + &lt;seasonal forcing&gt;) * R0`.  This doesn&#x27;t agree with the data from the research paper, which estimated their R0 value using data from the most infectious period (winter).  Assuming a seasonal forcing factor of 0.2, that means The R0 values they provide are actually 20% inflated in January on top of their already high values.<p>Of course, their very choice of a cosine wave to model that impact seems largely unfounded, but of course given a lack of data pointing to a more accurate option it&#x27;s as good as any.  That being said, even a small change to that function could have massive impacts on the simulation&#x27;s results.<p>## ICU OVERFLOW<p>In the most pessimistic scenarios, their implementation of additional fatalities caused by ICU overflow fail to take into account potential measures such as emergency hospitals, things like the hospital ship being sent over to New York by the navy [3], and temporary increases to hospital capacity.  In most cases, the peak of ICU overflow doesn&#x27;t occur until months down the line, giving a lot of time to scrape up resources to increase capacity.<p>Perhaps providing an additional value to adjust the hospital capacity over time would be useful for accurately representing the impact of ICU overflow.<p>## OTHER VARIABLES + NOTES<p>- &quot;Imports&quot; is held constant through the entire simulation.  It seems unlikely that it would remain this way; setting this as a curve instead would make more sense in my opinion.  Also, I couldn&#x27;t find any justification or explanation for the values they picked for that parameter.<p>- Improvements to treatment causing ICU&#x2F;hospital stay time to go down aren&#x27;t accounted for.  Of course there&#x27;s no guarantee that it will change significantly as the pandemic progresses (or even that it will not get worse due to some mutation of the virus or other circumstance), but recent research and experimentation seems to already be making progress in creating more effective treatments for the virus.<p>- Due to how incredibly vast the system this model models is, there are an uncountable number of possible external events that could, in some situations, invalidate the whole thing entirely.  At least mentioning the possibility of things such as a vaccine being released in the coming months, mutations with developed antiviral drug resistance, etc. seems prudent to me.<p>----<p>NOTE: I&#x27;m not a trained statistician or epidemiologist - I just have experience working with data and compute models.  I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback about the accuracy of my comments here or expansions&#x2F;refutations of my thinking.<p>[1] Link from about page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neherlab.org&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;assets&#x2F;seasonal_illustration.151cec1.svg;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neherlab.org&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;assets&#x2F;seasonal_illustration.15...<\/a> Screenshot at time of writing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ameo.link&#x2F;u&#x2F;7pk.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ameo.link&#x2F;u&#x2F;7pk.png<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7001239&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7001239&#x2F;<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnewyork.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;navy-medical-ship-coming-to-relieve-nyc-hospitals-amid-virus-was-last-in-city-after-9-11&#x2F;2333767&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnewyork.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;navy-medical-ship-comi...<\/a>\n[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.03.20030593v1.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.03.20030593v...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-20 08:48:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["llamataboot"],"id":[22629859],"kids":[22629918,22630232,22630139,22629970,22632789,22629905],"parent":[22616456],"text":["The biggest thing I&#x27;ve been trying to get friends to understand (from 2 weeks ago on the we have to shut things down train, and now on the opposite &quot;look not interacting with any other human being for 2 months might not be the best course of action train&quot;) is the non-linearity of how infection rate responds to decreasing the amount of social contacts.<p>ie; in most models you can get about a 50% gain with just a 25% reduction in social contact, after that it is diminishing returns all the way down to the bottom of trying to wring small population level effects out of reducing contacts from &quot;very little to very very little&quot;<p>In my mind, people are still underestimating the effects of large gatherings (and by large here I even mean 100 people in a nightclub) and overestimating the effects of seeing one friend in your house that sees another one friend the next day etc.<p>Don&#x27;t want to get into an overall debate here about what level of distancing is appropriate or acceptable, would like to see an interactive model that does a good job showing how different types of distancing interventions have very different effects and that once you get to a certain point it gets very hard to get much more overall connection out of the system..."],"time":["2020-03-19 18:51:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ouid"],"id":[22630154],"kids":[22630570],"parent":[22616456],"text":["I closed this after &quot;based on data from China&quot;.

The cops decided Serrano&#x27;s reluctance was an invitation to throw him on the ground and reopen his wound. Once they were done brutalizing Serrano, they decided this might pose less of a problem for them if they came up with something they could bust him for.<p>&gt; As Serrano curls up on the sidewalk, bleeding from his wound, and as more officers and bystanders gather on the scene waiting for an ambulance, Pastran searches Serrano’s jacket. “We gotta find something,” Erickson tells him. [...] Erickson again returns to the car and continues to meticulously search it, while Pastran briefs a supervisor who has arrived on the scene. Erickson then appears to place something in the car’s drink holder, before opening the front seat’s console and a small toiletry box. Erickson then says “I smell a little weed” just as he appears to pick up and move the little bud he seemed to have dropped in the drink holder moments earlier. Erickson then searches the back of the car, and when Pastran approaches, the two exchange a charged look as Erickson tells Pastran “I see nothing. … You know what I mean?” He then returns to search the front seat area for a third time, this time dropping a larger bud in the drink holder and saying, “There’s a little bit of weed.”<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the end result of the NYPD&#x27;s internal investigation deciding two years ago that planting evidence was no big deal.

Fowler’s active record is about having data access methods on the data objects. The article says whole object access and access by id, so something different. Probably would have been a lot better not to reuse the term.<p>Whole-object access is very typically part of ORMs. The article raises an issue this way: “Retrieving whole rows is hugely wasteful when only part of the row is required to resolve a user request.”<p>But note that you can control what’s included in the object. In other words, if you are running into problems due to getting too many columns because your object has too many properties... then change your object. An ORM giving you what you asked for isn’t a problem with the ORM. I think when people run into this kind of thing, I think they are usually stuck in a situation where they can’t express queries in a reasonable way. (Could be due to complexities or limitations of a specific ORM, or could be silos between front end and back end development.)<p>Getting objects by id is very typically part of ORMs as well. But ORMs very typically include a mechanism for queries as well, so I don’t even know why that came up. Maybe again the problem the author is trying to get at is lack of reasonable flexibility to express queries.<p>Now, a general issue with ORMs is that they tend to bury queries under an extra layer of abstraction. I think there’s an article to be written about that.<p>The article does go on to say a data access mechanism should have first class queries and first class transactions.

Most of the articles are behind paywalls, don&#x27;t have enough data to replicate their results (even economists much more often than not won&#x27;t include their raw data or algorithms or both).

For the upper range, 219 USD doesn&#x27;t sound to abusive, depending on service levels and support. I would just add a couple of tiers between hte free version and the Pro one. And maybe limit functionality for the free version instead of tables, by limiting tables lacals with less than 10 tables will never convert to paying customers. And you are incentivizing toying the set-up to work with 10 &quot;tables&quot;, depending on what exactly is a table.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that a table based solution is dead on arrival, een if restaurants are forced to close.

I applaud that you are productizing a barebones MVP-level application. You have initial users, definitely pay attention to their feedback. Both for technical improvements, but more importantly for any tips on how you can market this.<p>As many other commentators have pointed out, you face an uphill battle. The incumbents have way more features than you do and they handle more use cases out of the box. They also offer support. Still it&#x27;s important to not compete on price - you need to differentiate your service, find your initial market and aggressively pursue those customers. This is more marketing than anything technical.<p>Some constructive criticism:<p>On the demo:<p>1. It is not clear from the demo itself if the demo is for self ordering or for waitstaff ordering. I would like to know how my waitstaff will manage multiple tables? How do I switch tables?<p>2. How does my kitchen or food runners mark an order as done? I try to click on the order in the status page and it only opens the accordion.<p>3. How do I input my menu? What is the admin panel like?<p>4. If I run out of fries, can I scratch the item from the menu in real time?<p>5. Feels like managing each location in a different instance will be a pain point for multi-location customers. I would test this assumption with market research. If the market share of multi-location users is small, and multi-location management is painful I would recommend not targeting those customers until you get traction and can afford to fix the problem or handle supporting the customers.<p>On performance:<p>My load times for the status page were about 2s - which is still too slow. Given that pupdogg experienced 4s load times, I am guessing that your backend did not handle the HN traffic spike well. Definitely look for ways to speed this up - most of your app&#x27;s traffic will be concentrated within a few hours.<p>On pricing:<p>I agree with the other commentators that the pricing makes no sense.<p>Right now you have a freemium model, tiered by # of tables. \n1. Freemium is great when you can tier by feature offerings or when you can tier by resource allocation. For the former, a SaSS will offer Single Sign On for paying users only. For the latter, the SaSS may give a free tier for personal use, (e.g. a single user account).<p>2. When we delineate by seats (in your case tables), we are making a bet that as the customer scales up, our product will become essential to our customer working at scale so they see the value in converting to the paid tier. This has an assumption that our customers will scale up.<p>as fapi1974 pointed out, restaurants don&#x27;t scale up like this. Their tables are, for the most part, fixed.<p>Restaurants with more than 10 tables will likely not try the product, and restaurants with less than 10 won&#x27;t add more than 10.<p>Instead a free trial makes a lot more sense. Your product is not one-shot, it is recurring. If a customer does the trial and invests the time to input their menu and train their staff then there is a good chance they may convert after the free trial ends. (in fact you can and should track free-trial  usage and an leading indicator of whether the customer will convert)<p>I would also think about unit pricing. $219 for 10 tables is very steep. $219 for 100 tables is a bargain. However, I would guess that the market skews closer to the 10 table capacity.<p>Final thought. Think about how this helps your customers. Does it save more than $219 a month? Does it increase value for their offerings (probably for event organizers) When you sell to businesses remember they are economic buyers - they need it to make business sense first and foremost.<p>Best of luck!"],"time":["2020-03-19 20:32:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hoten"],"id":[22627575],"kids":[22627894],"parent":[22615569],"text":["How does this integrate with the inventory management restaurants require?"],"time":["2020-03-19 15:04:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["curtisspope"],"id":[22627564],"kids":{},"parent":[22615569],"text":["Great work.

(Much less waiting&#x2F;doing nothing)<p>* More near future with current nations represented at places<p>* Fewer religious overtones<p>* Bladerunner&#x2F;Manga aesthetics<p>* Smaller company, but much more community driven<p>* Played with fewer figures.

You only want 2 ~ 3 maximum outputs at the end. Mass Effect was good about being more complex; they had to plan for certain characters simply not being in future games -- but Bioware too ultimately collapsed the story down into very few possibilities by the end anyway).<p>Finally, Quantic Dream does a super good job of this (Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Detroit). They&#x27;ve been PS4&#x2F;Sony exclusives for a while, but I heard some of these games are making their way to PC.

It is management that will cancel the project, after all.  Much more than 90% of the time, they will cancel it because they are feeling uneasy about the progress.  Your job, if you don&#x27;t want a cancelled project, is to deliver regular progress that feels tangible to the stakeholders.  Every company is different in terms of how often they need that shot of &quot;we made progress&quot;, but every company is the same in that the longer you make them wait, the more likely it is that your project will be cancelled.<p>&quot;Smallest thing that could possibly work end-to-end&quot; is a very good strategy, if the &quot;smallest thing&quot; is small enough.  If it&#x27;s not, then you have to get even more creative.  Whatever you deliver, though, it has to feel real and tangible to the stakeholders.  Usually specs and design docs do not fill the bill.<p>It is critically important that if you want to &quot;do it right&quot;, whatever that means to you, that you interleave the quality oriented activities within a deliverable matrix.  Good specification, good design, testing, refactoring, monitoring, configuration management, etc, etc, etc are things that are invisible to stakeholders from a tanglible delivery aspect (unless you are incredibly blessed).  Thus, these activities must be similarly invisible from the external view of development.  Shining a spotlight on how much time you are spending on these quality aspects of development will only hasten the demise of your project.  At the very best, they will be used as points of negotiation from the business side - &quot;Could you deliver faster if you didn&#x27;t test this part?&quot;.  The business should be so preoccupied with looking at <i>what<\/i> you are delivering that it doesn&#x27;t notice <i>how<\/i> you have delivered it.<p>The biggest mistake I see from developers is the idea that the business must buy into the developers&#x27; sense of values.  It is, of course, wonderful if that happens, but it is rare in the extreme.  Most businesses do not understand those values.  To be fair, given the amount of internal bickering we tend to have as developers with respect to &quot;doing it right&quot;, I have to say that even <i>we<\/i> do not fully understand our own values.<p>It is important, though, that development be able to use the practices that will give them the best shot at success.  Just like a developer should not be calling the shots for strategic business direction, so too must the business stay out of our strategic development decisions.  To ensure this, you must create a development process that is largely boring for a person from the business side.  As soon as you link your development process with the stategic success of the company, you invite the business side to feel as though they should be calling the shots.  This is almost always a mistake in my experience.<p>Deliver early.  Deliver often.  Make each delivery contain something that has tangible results for the business.  Make your process boring without exceptions: &quot;This is just how you do it&quot; rather than &quot;We need more time for analysis&quot;.  Refactor your code when you need to without asking for permission rather than creating a task to refactor your code.  Improve your build system with every small step rather than spending a month up front creating the perfect build system.  However, no matter what you do, always remember that there must be delivery.

And it is a fundamental component in microservice world, otherwise we would be paralized by operations at each deployment.\n&quot;You spin up a linux box and call it a day - done&quot;. Seriously? Is this really the whole understanding of the world of operations?\nI&#x27;ve been in ops for 12 years and I&#x27;d never want to go back to the old bad days of 2008, where most of us managed an handful of servers and services and, yet, datacenter ops were at one with deployment ops. That was the very world of manual and error prone ops.\nOrchestration has been a bliss but requires a unit of scheduling. A container, in this case. But it may be a VM as well.<p>So, the saddest thing here is that NanoVMs could be a perfect replacement for containers while retaining the benefits of orchestration (as in Kubevirt, for example), but the CEO prefers to throw away the dirty water along with the baby for marketing hype."],"time":["2020-03-19 21:29:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Eric-Guo"],"id":[22633292],"kids":{},"parent":[22628274],"text":["Why should I click the LinkedIn URL to read a tech article?"],"time":["2020-03-20 01:29:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arpa"],"id":[22631323],"kids":[22632101],"parent":[22628274],"text":["There is no way to secure k8s.

Consider how this evolved.<p>The traditional model was that companies would make a profit and would return some or all of that to shareholders in the form of dividends. Retaining profits, generally, doesn&#x27;t help anyone.<p>Some investors like dividends but some don&#x27;t. Some use stocks as an income-generating stream. Some don&#x27;t need or want the income as it generates tax events.<p>So the share buyback was born. This allows a company to return profits to shareholders who want to sell while generally helping the share price as the supply of stock is decreasing. This is kind of a win-win for shareholders.<p>What&#x27;s different in that post-GFC we had zero or near-zero interest rates on corporate bonds such that what companies would do is borrow money for buybacks. Now this is a little different but I&#x27;m not sure I have a problem with it either. If the interest rate is fixed, this is essentially free money and it&#x27;s really the government&#x27;s fault that exists.<p>What I do have a problem with is retaining profits overseas (to avoid US taxes) and then borrowing money to pay for buybacks and general operations. If your interest rate is near zero this is essentially deferring taxes indefinitely. Combine this with moving IP overseas and paying &quot;royalties&quot; to further reduce US profits (and thus taxes) and your tax bill essentially goes to zero.<p>What I think should happen is that every dollar borrowed counts as a dollar of foreign profits repatriated to the US (and is thus taxed). If the company has no foreign profits retained offshore then no problem, it&#x27;s not a taxable event.<p>Executive pay is another matter. It&#x27;s clearly out of control. I&#x27;m honestly not sure what you do about it however.<p>Another thing that should change is that when a company goes through bankruptcy, there is a pecking order for creditors. Secured creditors are first, then bondholders, then preferential shareholders and then ordinary shareholders. There may be other classes too.<p>Top of that pecking order should be non-executive worker pay and benefits.<p>Additionally, pension funds should be held in trust such that they can never be spent by the company or claimed by creditors."],"time":["2020-03-19 01:42:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thrill"],"id":[22623131],"kids":{},"parent":[22622698],"text":["Telling companies how to operate, other than health directed concerns such as during a pandemic, when their operations are not the reason they are in a bind is a great way to destroy process and effectiveness of companies.
