But docker is way better then most of the other tools I used for this (vagrant and whatnot).<p>A main problem in my opinion is, that old images are no longer published (or removed from dockerhub). I doubt very much, that you can build docker images that are written now in 2030.<p>But I assume the same happens with Packer + Terraform. In both cases you need to make sure the image is saved and accessible at a place you control, because the build will stop working at some point in time. Also the nice thing about docker is, it runs local (developer machine) and in production. I am not sure how you archive that with AMIs.<p>Building fat binaries is only easy for some specific languages and tools. In docker, it is easy for everything. At the end docker gives you a standardized way to deploy (image, environment variables, network, volumes and off you go!).<p>Now about docker in production. I had lots of problems with that. But if you use docker for local and don&#x27;t have a ops department, it is the natural way to go. You run your integration tests with the same image that later runs on prod, so you don&#x27;t need to worry, what stack is running on in a different environment. As a developer with a fully automated CI chain, I can control the entire deployment from my IDE (Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, ...). My college can review the entire deployment in the PR (code-changes and infrastructure changes). And also docker has for most external software a ready to use image. Those are big benefits for small dev teams in small companies.<p>Also cloud providers offer docker tooling like a private image repository and docker support in most CI tools. I mention all of this, because the tooling around a container solution is important. You may dislike docker, but it integrates in most cloud providers and has images for almost everything.<p>The argument about complexity is true. If something doesn&#x27;t work and you have no idea about the parts under the docker layer then its game over. But this is a very general argument against complexity. Complexity in software makes everything easy until you need to go down an abstraction layer. Nobody forces you to run your MySQL or Elasticsearch in docker container. This is definitely an unnecessary (and potentially dangerous) layer of complexity.<p>But to run the 10 years old PHP 5 application that needs memcached version 0.1.5, docker is very very useful: you spend a week to put all that legacy stuff in an docker image, push the image and all the team members can run it locally.

I&#x27;m currently following a course created by Dr. Elaine Ingham, who is a microbiologist that studies soil biology and has done some really amazing research. She also worked at Colorado State University, which can&#x27;t be a coincidence!<p>Here&#x27;s the lowdown of what happens, because we&#x27;ve been getting this wrong for centuries in agriculture. The nutrients (N, Ph, Mg, K, etc) are bound to materials in the soil ranging from rocks to pebbles, to sands, silts and clays. We have been destroying the soil by tilling practices and large machinery which are creating compaction layers that lead to anaerobic conditions causing the &quot;good&quot; biology in the soil to die and also preventing roots from growing to the depth they need. It turns out that the way that the nutrients become available to the roots of the plant is by means of the bacteria&#x2F;fungi breaking their bonds from the previously mentioned materials (rocks, etc) and then, even more interestingly, they get eaten by higher trophic level predators who shit out the nutrients in plant available form!<p>Some fun facts:\n- The roots release sugars (photosynthates) into the soil which attract particular bacteria&#x2F;fungi based off its needs for nutrients AND pH requirements (bacteria release substances which raise pH and fungi acids which lower it, and the pH can vary on the scale of micrometers based off this)<p>-Bacteria and particularly fungi (if you haven&#x27;t studied fungi, go watch Paul Stamets on Joe Rogan, cause they&#x27;re incredible organisms <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ<\/a>) create symbiotic relationships with the plant, each one feeding and protecting the other.<p>- Many tests which tell you your soil is low in nutrients can be complete bullshit. Extracting agents will yield different results, and if, for example, you&#x27;re only looking at soluble nutrients, you&#x27;re missing the fact that they&#x27;re available but just bound up chemically and require the biological activity.<p>- dousing your soil w&#x2F; inorganic fertilizers are hardly short-term solutions because 1) if the soil has no structure to it, then they will wash immediately out with rain and 2) you&#x27;re literally dissolving salts into the water of the soil, making the water unavailable to the plant and can stress the plants more. Sure, they might get a quick dose of nutrients but you&#x27;re playing a losing game.<p>- there&#x27;s a whole bunch of other stuff. Elaine&#x27;s course available on www.SoilFoodWeb.com, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I find it fascinating and I&#x27;m barely halfway past Ch 2. She basically gives you all the science behind it and the know-how of how to address the problem yourself, not rely on a product. She&#x27;s a total G, it&#x27;s really fun listening to her and hearing about the history of her research. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elaine_Ingham\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elaine_Ingham<\/a><p>I&#x27;m not sure what this Rhizolizer brand is, but I presume it&#x27;s not far off from a &quot;tea&quot; made from vermicomposting (i.e., you feed your compost to worms and they shit out a magical biologically rich and diverse &quot;casting&quot; which you can utilize to put the healthy biology back in your soil)"],"time":["2020-01-28 01:56:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["olliej"],"id":[22165075],"kids":{},"parent":[22159107],"text":["This seems like an ad&#x2F;sponsored article, not an actual report"],"time":["2020-01-28 00:49:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["coldtea"],"id":[22158501],"kids":[22160020,22158827,22159132,22159937,22159666,22161623,22158561],"parent":[22135114],"text":["&gt;<i>I&#x27;m guessing below 5%, but I think this level of preparedness would be a good goal for most people who can afford it.<\/i><p>I never understood this attitude (very common in the US popular culture for one), or the same idea about stocking food, utilities, ammo and such, and taking of to some kind of bunker for emergency scenarios (from a storm, to &quot;when the government comes&quot;, to the zombie apocalypse or similar).<p>While it&#x27;s prudent to be prepared as a family, it&#x27;s even more prudent (and it&#x27;s always missing even as a though from such descriptions, posts, etc) to push and make sure your country&#x2F;city&#x2F;community is prepared.<p>It&#x27;s the complacent &quot;everyman for themselves&quot; mentality I don&#x27;t understand.<p>And with such a mindset, most of these &quot;everyman for themselves&quot; won&#x27;t last a day.

So, first, here&#x27;s the major disasters I&#x27;ve been through:<p>* I was on a ship in 1999 that lost all engines in the middle of the Pacific. Waited 2 days hot and quiet in the sun waiting for repair parts to be airdropped.<p>* 9&#x2F;11 (and the response thereto)<p>* Hurricane Katrina (bought a house in New Orleans 5 weeks before, evacuated; let people we still have never met live in our house because we couldn&#x27;t go back for a year. They stole nothing.) Went back shortly after, SMS worked.<p>* Hurricane Rita (no direct impact, but ran a packed-to-gills special needs shelter as a first year medical student -- mainly because ex-military and had accidentally evacuated from Katrina into Rita&#x27;s path). Ran the shelter with 184 patients, 30 other medical students on shifts, a secretary, and an Open Office spreadsheet. The network worked, but the county&#x27;s emergency shelter patient tracking software could only do input, no output. And it was to be sent to a central database, but they had never plugged in an ethernet cable, so I guess all the data went to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null. Didn&#x27;t matter, couldn&#x27;t read it. When I left, I wiped their system and moved the patient database (i.e. spreadsheet) to their brand new Ubuntu desktop.<p>* Hurricane Isabel (flooded our basement, lost power for about 48 hours - sump pump no good if no power. Oh ... someone had stolen our generator. Keep those things locked up).<p>* The 2007 Witch Creek fire (San Diego) burned the house directly behind ours.<p>* 2011 Southwest blackout in San Diego. In the middle of the blackout I was still able to send an editorial project back to client in Tokyo.<p>* Fukushima Daichi. Volunteered to deploy for Operation Tomodachi because my brother lived between the reactors and Tokyo. They were happy to send me. Aftershocks for over a month.<p>* The 2014 Bernardo fire. I watched this one from the Canyon rim before fire fighters arrived, fire planes so low they were below me. Nothing between the fire line and my house except fuel and favorable winds.<p>* Typhoon Mangkhut (lost power for about 4 days, lots of trees down)<p>We currently own a generator and we keep some extra bottled water and batteries on hand. We have UPS units on the router&#x2F;modem cluster and a couple others around the house (network usually survives power outages, if you can connect). I have stabilized gas for the generator. Regularly check the generator. A couple of hand crank radios just in case. We probably round up a bit on paper towels and canned goods and dry pasta. We have two propane tanks for the grill (power outage = time to grill all the meat in the freezer).<p>Basically, even on a third world island in the middle of the Pacific with the worst storm in a generation, we didn&#x27;t run out of fresh water or food, and nerves were much calmed by the readily available network. I have universally found network to be more reliable than power.<p>Could something worse happen? That never occurred to me (like the worst interpretation what (1) could have been). If it&#x27;s markedly worse than what I&#x27;ve had to deal with so far, evacuation is generally the best viable option. If the situation is so bad that evac is not an option, my experience is that you&#x27;re just going to have to deal with it.

If you look at what most preppers are doing, not very.<p>As an avid hiker and rock climber, when I watch a lot of prepper videos on YouTube, I find a lot of laughable ideas.<p>* About 50% of the preppers I see have seemingly no concern for cross-contamination of their water system, and no anti-diarrheals in their med kits to deal with the giardia they aren&#x27;t preventing.<p>* Paracord is popular among preppers, but it&#x27;s pretty unclear why. I&#x27;ve literally never seen a prepper demonstrate hanging a bear bag, which is literally the only reason I&#x27;ve ever used paracord in the wild. Lashing together structures boy-scout-style requires a lot more cord than they are carrying, and having hiked a few thousand miles in my hiking career, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever felt that lashing together a structure was necessary or even worth the effort, despite that being a skill I&#x27;m proficient at. The fanciest paracords out there have metal wire (for electricity) and fishing line inside the paracord--maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I would rather just carry the fishing line separately, and I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where I have access to electricity and not wire. It&#x27;s also unclear to me whether any of these preppers actually have any skills as electricians.<p>* Knives: the number one item I find left behind on trails are these giant Bowie knives. People buy them at an army surplus or sporting goods store, and then a few miles onto the trail they realize their pack is really heavy, and the item that stands out as the most weight with the least usefulness is the 3 pound knife. I carry a CRKT NIAD[1] when rock climbing, and a Snow Peak knife (part of a cutlery set--I think an older version of this[2]). What these knives have in common is that they are extremely light. But what do preppers have? In some cases, the Bowie knives aren&#x27;t even close to the largest things.<p>* Guns: while preppers seem unconcerned with the weight of their knives, when it comes to guns, weight suddenly seems to be a concern. To achieve low weight, it seems most preppers are willing to settle for the idea that they&#x27;re never going to hunt for, or defend themselves from, anything larger than a jackrabbit. Almost all the popular &quot;prepper guns&quot;, i.e. this Henry AR7[3] are in caliber .22LR, which beyond being a tiny round, has reliability issues. Of course, there are also preppers who go to the other extreme[4]; if you&#x27;ve got your 9mm handgun, .22LR rifle, 12 gauge shotgun, .308 bolt action, and .223 AR15, I hope you&#x27;re in your gun bunker when the apocalypse happens, because you&#x27;re not moving anywhere with a quarter of of a ton of firearms and ammo. Personally, I think fishing would be far more consistent for food, and I don&#x27;t have the stomach for violence even in self-defense (maybe once, but on a consistent basis?) so I&#x27;d probably rather use the weight for carrying a light fishing kit and more food.<p>I don&#x27;t mean all of this to come across as super harsh on the prepper community. If you enjoy collecting this stuff, do it. I&#x27;m not criticizing what anyone does for fun, and it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that you&#x27;ll ever have to rely on this stuff, so there&#x27;s no real harm.

Here&#x27;s an issue I recently ran into.<p>When I was tasked to increase performance of a legacy web app, I thought there were so many &quot;quick wins&quot; that I could take a VERY slow application (we&#x27;re talking 10s long requests for most pages) and get most pages down to less than 3s per request, and at MOST 5s for all of them<p>One example was permissions being stored in a long &quot;bitmap&quot; string of 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s that was being parsed on each page load (it was hundreds of &quot;bits&quot; long). The code to handle this was beyond awful complexity wise and added 2s per page load to parse. Some simple refactors and 2s removed from each and every page load. There were a bunch of things like this too, I was on a roll fixing these things.<p>In my dev environment I set up some performance test harnesses (replaying real world traffic from a representative amount of users) and got benchmarks indicating that i&#x27;d increased performance by about 4 times on average. It was still sluggish, but no longer unusable. When I deployed, I found the site was only 1.5 to 2 times as fast. Not quite enough to hit my very modest goal of &lt;5s per request. What the hell happened?<p>Turns out the site was so slow, but we had so many active users that needed to use it, we were suffering something you&#x27;d normally only observe in real life automobile traffic, a phenomenon called &quot;induced demand&quot;. When a site is really slow users won&#x27;t use it unless they absolutely have to. So as you make the site faster they will subconsciously start doing more things things beyond the absolute bare minimum they would normally do. You get stuck fighting some weird kind of &quot;equilibrium&quot; where as the site gets faster you start going below the level of &quot;do what I need and get out&quot; threshold of more and more users who push back by adding more traffic until the site reaches a new equilibrium.<p>So we made the site 4 times as fast, but the amount of requests more than tripled and negated half our gains.

There are various misunderstandings, which lead to incorrect assumptions which lead to introducing complexity (which is likely to be counterproductive, potentially performance-<i>killing<\/i>) too early in the development process.  I consider the following quote to be key:<p><pre><code>     &gt; It’s never too early to start measuring and working on performance.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nPersonally speaking, when I start feeling this way, I see it as a <i>strong signal<\/i> that I&#x27;m engaging in optimization too early.  I&#x27;m guided by the idea that time spent attempting to improve performance at early stages is more often wasted, or even self-defeating, than it is useful.  Knowing exactly <i>when<\/i> is the right time, though, is extremely tricky.<p>Most languages&#x2F;frameworks have a set of &quot;don&#x27;t do this&quot;-es that fall into the performance category -- knowing these and implementing them when the probability that they will reduce a bottleneck vs. overly-complicate code&#x2F;implementation is important.  Too often, though, the &quot;performant implementation&quot; is used because other developers are familiar with it -- not because it necessarily helps anything (i.e. using StringBuilder in C# for string concatenation -- in many common implementations, the result is <i>slower<\/i> but people are so used to seeing it that it becomes &quot;something many developers just do&quot; even though it is substantially uglier).<p>Performance shouldn&#x27;t be an <i>after-thought<\/i>.  If I&#x27;m expecting that my application <i>must<\/i> support 10,000 concurrent users on a single host and the work its performing couldn&#x27;t be achieved by a single-threaded server, I&#x27;m going to write the implementation thread-safe from the start.  That&#x27;s not premature optimization, that&#x27;s designing an application.  Provided the hosting constraints are not as rigid, it may make more sense to single-thread the back-end on multiple hosts.  Neither of these are as easy to reason about as a single-threaded, single-host, blocking implementation, but the alternative is &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work at all&quot; (under load, anyway).<p>The problem with measuring&#x2F;working on performance too early is that the measurements are measurements of code in isolation.  You can&#x27;t measure what isn&#x27;t written and once the various dependencies are introduced, your initial measurements&#x2F;adjustments for performance may be pointless.  Yes, you sped up the acquisition of a small blob of JSON that takes a notoriously long amount of time to produce, but because you hadn&#x27;t completed the rest of the app, you neglected the fact that another request with 250MB of JSON ran at exactly the same time.  You traded off memory for CPU to speed up the first implementation, but now you need a lot more memory for the one running in parallel and the lack of resources caused swapping, slowing <i>everything down<\/i> to the point that the original, slower, less-memory-consuming option for your first request was a better choice.<p>The &quot;Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil&quot; isn&#x27;t a phrase meant to say &quot;Optimization is unimportant and you shouldn&#x27;t waste time on it&quot;.  It&#x27;s a recognition that optimization is <i>extremely important<\/i> and will almost certainly <i>never happen<\/i> due to resource exhaustion.  The confusion is about what resource is being exhausted -- the resource is <i>time<\/i>.  We&#x27;re all constrained by having to write functionality and make it work.  If you want to make it perform well, you&#x27;re going to burn a lot of time on optimization.  You will burn <i>far less time<\/i> there if you optimize your code when those optimizations are going to have the greatest benefit.  Optimizing <i>too soon<\/i> means you risk spending a lot of time measuring&#x2F;tweaking with a result that will not improve performance, or worse, has to be undone.  &quot;Optimized&quot; code is usually more complex&#x2F;more difficult to reason about, which makes completing the underlying feature-set more difficult.<p>Measuring and optimizing <i>at the right times<\/i> (and identifying the correct &quot;right times&quot;) maximizes the positive effects of the optimizations and reduce the likelihood that those optimizations will make writing the rest of the code more difficult.  Every program (and kind of program[1]) has a different &quot;right time&quot;.  Determining that &quot;right time&quot; can simply be a matter of planning your hardware &#x2F; code architecture early enough to know what is actually <i>needed<\/i>[2] and identifying when one should start reviewing the application for bottlenecks.<p>[0] I have much the same problem that I have with the biblical roots of that phrase and its misunderstanding.  People will often repeat &quot;Money is the root of all evil&quot; but miss the first part of that phrase &quot;... <i>the love of<\/i> money is the root of all evil.&quot;  With appropriate context, its meaning changes dramatically.<p>[1] Library code vs. a complete program -- My &quot;general libraries&quot; are often micro-optimized to seek the greatest performance while maintaining a balance between memory usage and CPU.  This makes them maximally useful to the vast majority of my consumers.  I might end up ripping those out of an implementation if I find a better trade-off given a complete program&#x27;s function, but most of the time it reduces the need for me to optimize around common bottlenecks<p>[2] Regular check-points &#x2F; proper planning are as close to a cure for &quot;the roots of all evil&quot; as you can get.  Performance is <i>always a feature<\/i> in that you know in advance what your applications constraints are and what its requirements are.

What you really need is a knowledge management tool that is easy to use. You&#x27;ll get a ton of other benefits too.<p>As it is right now, Histre aids the casual online research we all do (ie the explore -&gt; filter -&gt; decide loop). For example, it removes friction in taking notes on links you&#x27;re looking at, with free-form tags that you don&#x27;t have to create first and other such niceties that add up. And it easy to group notes into notebooks and share. In short, when you have to look at a bunch of links for something (decide on AirBnB, people to hire, material for your next blog post, etc) Histre makes your life easier. But this is just the starting point for what Histre intends to do.<p>IMHO the biggest problem with apps like Evernote, Notion etc is that it becomes digital hoarding, and not a knowledge base. And the knowledge base focused apps out there involve a lot of manual upkeep, which almost never happens, especially at work. Things start out okay and quickly fall into disrepair. I&#x27;m differentiating from the other note taking apps by automatically putting together a knowledge base (grouped by topic etc).<p>One idea I&#x27;m excited about and I&#x27;m working on right now is: Histre automatically fetches updates from the websites you visit, ranks the websites with things like lack of ads &#x2F; referral links and ranks the new posts with your &#x27;revealed preferences&#x27; of what you tend to actually read from the list of updates previously shown etc. Personally I think this is will be what replaces social news sites, which are too sensitive to people who bother to go upvote on &#x2F;new and has to cater to the lowest common denominator.<p>Automatic Upkeep (WIP): Histre detects links&#x2F;notes related to your existing notebooks and offers to update those notebooks with the new links and notes. This is similar to how Google Photos suggests new photos for your existing albums. This solves the upkeep problem. Currently people create knowledge bases with good intentions and it becomes stale and useless quite fast.<p>Exports: I&#x27;m working on org-mode exports, as I&#x27;m an Emacs user myself. Other export formats coming soon.<p>Integrations: There is Hacker News (import and optionally share your upvotes) and Telegram (take notes using the Telegram app) integrations now. I&#x27;m working on Twitter next (lists of Twitter profiles -&gt; follow all &#x2F; block all)."],"time":["2020-01-27 16:17:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mmerlin"],"id":[22158439],"kids":{},"parent":[22158218],"text":["Pinboard.in and&#x2F;or Trello"],"time":["2020-01-27 12:40:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["iamarsibragimov"],"id":[22158515],"kids":{},"parent":[22158218],"text":["I use Notion for this kind of stuff.

Even if you are building a webapp it helps to think in terms of something more general. HTTP becomes just another channel over which messages move. Your app can (and probably will) become sensitive to other channels: email, SMS, webhooks, etc. If you embrace message-level security then you can <i>ignore the channel and deal with the message<\/i>.

If you&#x27;re not end-to-end encrypted and don&#x27;t use 3rd party resources at all (its possible!) then the naive solution is fine. The most robust solution is to use a browser extension to isolate the private key. The site requests encryption services from the extension.<p>Another fun and interesting problem is the multi-device user. Do we allow copying the private key, and if not, how do we associate private keys together?

Doing this wrong (or naively), can have catastrophic effects for your app!!<p>Let me provide an example: It&#x27;s common knowledge that JWTs are very common. A lot of people who use JWTs, implement them as access tokens for their APIs. JWTs also require a shared secret key - what if this is stolen? Then an attacker can use that to hijack any user&#x27;s account very trivially, and you may not even realise that it&#x27;s happened! This is far worse than anyone getting hold of hashed passwords from your database.<p>That being said, I use the following flow for session management:\n- User logs in, the backend issues a short-lived (~1 hour) JWT and a long-lived refresh token and sends them to the frontend.\n- The frontend sends the JWT for each API call while it&#x27;s still valid\n- In the event that the JWT has expired, the frontend should then use the refresh token to get a new JWT AND a new refresh token (rotating refresh token - see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6749#section-10.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6749#section-10.4<\/a>)\n- If the refresh token expires, then the user has to login again.<p>While this sounds quite straightforward, the key here is to use rotating refresh tokens - that&#x27;s what actually makes it fare more secure than just using simple refresh tokens (i&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s almost the same level of security as just using a long lived access token)<p>Some of the benefits of this approach:\n- You can detect token theft! If an attacker gets hold of the refresh &#x2F; access token, because they keep changing, you can detect if an old token is used which is a strong singal of theft (see the RFC link above)\n- You can change the JWT secret key without logging any users out: Once you change the key, all JWTs are instantly invalidated. But then your frontend client can simply use its refresh token to get a new access token signed with the new signing key (along with a new refresh token).\n- Allow your users to be logged in for however long you want without compromising security.<p>Some implementation gotchas:\n- When changing the refresh token, be sure to not invalidate the older token unless your backend is sure that the frontend has received the new token. This can be confirmed by the frontend using the new access &#x2F; refresh token. This is important since if not done, and if the user is in a bad networked area, it can lead to them being logged out.\n- See this blog and specifically this race condition: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hackernoon&#x2F;the-best-way-to-securely-manage-user-sessions-91f27eeef460#e81c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hackernoon&#x2F;the-best-way-to-securely-manag...<\/a><p>If you do not want to implement this on your own, you can also check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supertokens.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supertokens.io<\/a> - It provides an end-to-end implementation of the above taking care of all race conditions and network failure issues. It also prevents other common web attacks which are on the OWASP top 10 list.<p>-----------------------<p>In terms of user authentication for the login part, I prefer using a no-password method - email or SMS OTP. The reason for this is that I do not have to care about managing user passwords (though that&#x27;s not too difficult), I do not have to build forgot password flows, and most importantly, users don&#x27;t have to remember yet another password.<p>I also only allow 3 attempts for OTPs per OTP. So after sending the OTP, if a user fails to input the correct one 3 times, then I revoke the old OTP and send a new one (this is so that someone can&#x27;t simply brute force their way into an account). If the user login is successful, then I revoke all OTPs for that user. If the user clicks on sending the OTP again, then I send a different OTP (but the old one is still valid). This allows me to have a an OTP timeout of say 1 hour - which is more than enough!<p>According to me, this coupled with the above session management flow, is perfect!"],"time":["2020-01-27 10:57:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pushpop"],"id":[22157643],"kids":[22159349],"parent":[22157166],"text":["Another thing to bare in mind, for those who are rolling their own, is how you caress those passwords from the DB.<p>The common approach is a simple DB SQL select.

There is less upstream frequency available in the upstream. 42 MHz is the standard upstream&#x2F;downstream split, 85 MHz is a midsplit, 200 MHz is a high split, and the downstream goes up to 1Ghz or even 1.2Ghz. The upstream modulation runs at 64 QAM (~27Mbs) and downstream modulation runs at 256 QAM (~38 Mbps). The upstream is also more sustainable to interference and impairments. So the technology is inherently imbalanced.<p>From a business prospective it is very difficult to cost justify. Moving the upstream&#x2F;downstream split and&#x2F;or upgrading to DOCSIS 3.1 is very expensive. The reality is that the typical customer use very little upstream bandwidth. It isn&#x27;t uncommon for me to see a node with 24 or 32 downstream channels at 80% usage and 4 upstream channels are at 25% utilization or less.  We see a downstream to upstream usage ratio of about 15:1.  If you move the US&#x2F;DS split that means you are taking away from available downstream frequency which means less DS data bandwidth or fewer video channels. It&#x27;s hard to make a business case to invest in increasing upstream bandwidth when the data says people aren&#x27;t going to use it.<p>Newer technology like DOCSIS 3.1, Docsis FDX, Remote PHY and modern plant designs like N+0 or N+1 (which means fewer customers per node) will bring higher upstream bandwidth, but it will be awhile before we see anything close to symmetrical speeds."],"time":["2020-01-26 02:19:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["christocracy"],"id":[22149155],"kids":[22149224],"parent":[22147549],"text":["While I stewed after the dotcom crash during early 2000s, I had a short 2-year gig working as a headend tech for a small cable company.<p>It’s not about demand, it’s about climbing poles and rolling bucket-truck crews to replace filters and other expensive equipment on a massive scale.<p>The top comment in the link there is spot-on.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1519918\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1519918<\/a><p>I was involved with the “digital switchover”, moving the traditional analog channels over to the digital QAM channels, potentially freeing those now duplicated analog channels for upload channels.

The issue is not the media per se but the concept of shared media.  Take any media, wireless, coax, fiber, even copper (ADSL) you have X amount of spectrum to work with so you have to decide how allocate said BW. Since most users demand is higher for downstream than upstream (typically you are downloading a lot more than uploading) it makes sense to allocate more to downstream. Of course it is possible to have full duplex symmetrical speeds. Say you want to allocate 2 fibers, on for upstream and one for downstream, then you can have symmetrical speeds. But typically due to costs, you want to have one fiber shared between a large number of users (e.g. GPON or NGPON, aka FiOS) or one coax shared amongst many users, or some set amount of RF spectrum, in any case you need to make the same type of trade off choice that the cable provider makes or that the DSL provider makes or wireless providers. In the case of wireless the reason that uplink is so much weaker is due to the limited power of the user equipment, also smaller antenna etc. refer to Shannon&#x27;s law, uplink will be weaker.

I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would manually trudge through modules.dep files when that is the main objective of the &quot;modprobe&quot; command, as opposed to &quot;insmod&quot;, which does no dependency resolution. (modprobe also supports config files, aliases, and some other things, but the main and original objective is dependency resolution.) it&#x27;s also a bad idea to reimplement libblkid: it supports a ton of filesystems, many of which one might actually want to use as a root filesystem, but are not supported by this basic implementation, including xfs, btrfs, or zfs. it also doesn&#x27;t appear to support LUKS2. libblkid isn&#x27;t even necessary: busybox findfs works perfectly well for most common filesystems, and runs very quickly (0.02 seconds on my machine). but, again, the main cost when booting with a necessarily cold cache is likely to be I&#x2F;O, not spawning a process. I don&#x27;t understand why someone would faff about with manually parsing ELF files when ldd works just fine with simple text parsing and handles interpreter, rpath, and transitive dependencies built-in.<p>this all just seems overly complicated to me. my initramfs generator is 77 lines of code, including automatic ldd dependency generation, and init is 37 lines, including LUKS decryption, dropbear for remote password entry, and e2fsck with automatic reboot if requested by e2fsck, for a total of about 110 lines.

Much of what unixsheikh describes has been said before however I think it still remains true today.  I am currently using Linux and open to being persuaded otherwise.  I want to learn &quot;the Linux way&quot; if there is such a thing.<p>That said, I always found booting to ramdisk, &quot;root on mfs&quot;, &quot;mfsroot&quot;, or whatever people might call it, very straightforward on BSD.  They maintained and provided all the necessary tools, some of them have no Linux equivalent.  Things stayed more or less the same so once the process was learnt, there seemed little chance of the goalposts moving.  One did not need to be a contributor to understand these processes.  Sometimes I get the feeling I am just not smart enough for Linux, and it <i>seems<\/i> like these processes are constantly subject to change.  (I hope to find the truth is otherwise.)<p>As a BSD end user, I found it relatively easy to compile a custom kernel and a custom, statically-linked, multi-call binary as a userland, like busybox but using utilities &quot;as is&quot; not pared down with features missing, to be inserted into the kernel.  I could boot from USB stick^3 to ramdisk root, pull out the USB stick, e.g., if I needed the USB port, then chroot into any userland.  This was extremely flexible and allowed for easy experimentation.  Sometimes I might have that userland prepared on internal media, the USB stick, or some other external media, or I might create it dynamically by downloading and extracting binary sets.  This &quot;targetroot&quot;^4 userland might be mounted, usually r&#x2F;o, on HDD or it might just be mfs&#x2F;tmpfs.<p>Apparently, the author was inspired to make his own distribution because he found the package installation process too slow for large packages, e.g. qemu.^5  He tried using SquashFS images to speed up the process.  I did the same thing in 2012 using cloop2 compressed filesystem images for large packages, e.g. ghostscript, on NetBSD.  I would keep them on the USB stick and just mount them over an executable directory as necessary.  I was not using these large programs too frequently and I was running entirely from tmpfs, no HDD, so I did not want them occupying space and depleting RAM.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=unixsheikh.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=unixsheikh.com<\/a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;front?day=2020-01-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;front?day=2020-01-20<\/a><p>3. Thanks to the excellent BSD bootloaders I could manually choose the kernel during boot.  I would have several kernels on the USB stick.  Of course the kernel did not have to reside on the USB stick, I could load it from any connected media.  At one point I was able to boot NetBSD kernels using the FreeBSD bootloader.<p>4.

Also there&#x27;s almost no meat at all, so the restaurant doesn&#x27;t appeal to those who come in to eat a pile of steaks. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone come and just eat plate after plate. People come because they can get good vegetarian food quickly for lunch.<p>High quality buffets will likely survive, but there&#x27;s less of a market for them.<p>A successful hybrid model might be that of Olive Garden, which mixes reheated frozen food with unlimited breadsticks and salad, both which are extremely cheap to provide unlimited quantities of."],"time":["2020-01-27 02:57:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bobosha"],"id":[22151980],"kids":[22152024],"parent":[22151891],"text":["Makes me wonder how the &quot;Paradox of Choice&quot; works in this situation since the customer is already committed to purchasing.

It was trained on absurdly huge amounts of data with absurdly huge amounts of compute at a fairly large cost.<p>- GPT 2 is pretty impressive in many ways in that the stuff it predicts is syntactically correct, relevant to input, and very versatile (it can handle and complete text on any subject you can think of). But, its predictions often exhibit a lack of basic common sense.<p>- Since it lacks common sense and a ton was invested it, the piece posits it is evidence in favor of &#x27;empirical&#x27; approaches to intelligence seemingly being wrong and alternatives being a good idea from now on.<p>To be fair GPT-2 does have some innate built in structure (it&#x27;s not just a fully connected neural net, it has the popular Transformer architecture which relies on the fairly recent idea of self attention as a core building block). And it&#x27;s fair to argue that GPT-2 is just evidence training on word prediction conditioned on input is not enough to get to common sense; perhaps a different task&#x2F;loss built on top of Transformer model would work just fine. But really the whole research project of Deep Learning has been an exercise in nativism (since most research is trying to find new and better neural net architectures, ie priors for learning, for various tasks), aside from OpenAI which is much bigger on just scaling existing stuff up, so this agrees with current AI trends more or less."],"time":["2020-01-26 00:54:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loopz"],"id":[22151583],"kids":[22151601],"parent":[22148365],"text":["<i>In a town there was a baker&#x27;s son.

Why does that need to have the exact same syntax? This is the root cause of why bash (and batch and etc etc etc) are so terrible to script in (and why powershell is so terrible to type into a terminal). This weird shit like [ being a command, and having to think long and hard about exactly when variables are replaced and when globs are executed and how errors happen.. It&#x27;s just pretty pointless.<p>Like, if you write a script using Python or Ruby or Perl or whatever, there&#x27;s easy ways to call into the shell. Often it&#x27;s even built-in, like using backticks `echo like this`. These languages aren&#x27;t designed for shell scripting but even they are often easier and cleaner than a bash script. It could be much better thoughk I bet.<p>I&#x27;d love to have a language that is easy and familiar to type into a terminal (and thus, sufficiently bash-like probably), while being significantly easier to write scripts in. You could require the script to have a bit more syntax, a bit more structure, but essentially have the same semantics as what you&#x27;d type on the command line, and you&#x27;d have the best of both worlds. If well designed, it&#x27;d still &quot;feel&quot; like the same thing (much like how all JS programmers immediately grokked Coffeescript when it came out, because it really was just JS); everything you&#x27;d learn on the command line, you&#x27;d be able to apply in a script and vice versa. The script would just require more structure and thus provide more comfort (good error messages, editor support, etc).<p>For example, globbing. The idea that the shell expands &quot;<i>.foo&quot; into a list of files, before evaluating the command, is handy, but it&#x27;s also an enormous footgun. What if on the terminal it would do that, but when scripting, you&#x27;d be required to write `glob(&quot;<\/i>.foo&quot;)` or else it&#x27;d error out? THat would force you to clearly control when the expansion happens, it would let you assign it to a variable in a readable way etc. Imagine similar stuff for argument lists, escaping, variable substitution, etc - all the magic available on terminal, but contained in the script.<p>Does this exist?

Thanks to everyone who read and commented! To answer a couple of questions:<p>Mimix doesn&#x27;t force to you reveal everything included in your work (&quot;how the sausage was made&quot;); it&#x27;s simply there if you want to. This feature is mostly for <i>you,<\/i> the author, to get to your &quot;ah-ha&quot; moments as Vannevar Bush called them. Right now, we don&#x27;t have software that does a good job of connecting facts inside documents.<p>MSL is a language for building tools which we hope can eventually replace the word processor. We are at an early stage with that software which will be open sourced once it&#x27;s ready.<p>The hybrid database on which MSL relies could be viewed as the ultimate version control system because it allows rewinding any single variable (a semantic assignment statement) to any value it had in its history.<p>Mimix certainly draws from the semantic web, but that&#x27;s not our secret sauce. Today, Google and Stanford already have good libraries for figuring out what is a noun, what is a verb, etc. Where MSL shines is, as @MiniMax42 pointed out, in marking up that text so that it can later be analyzed or transformed in ways that are difficult with word processing documents.<p>While we hope to see this technology become ubiquitous, the best early use case is high-value documents like medical, scientific, legal and financial papers, as @jpalomaki said.<p>Thanks again!\n-- D"],"time":["2020-01-27 14:05:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["forgotpwd16"],"id":[22152105],"kids":{},"parent":[22150332],"text":["Minix seems to be a system that incorporates word processing, AI-based (machine learning?) fact checking and bibliography management.

Both internally, and in the API used by games on top.<p>We used Emacs-Lisp to generate a collection of C++ classes with all of the arithmetic operaters that were allowed, and only those.  &quot;friend&quot; is your friend for this in C++.<p>We mostly used floating point to represent values, but could also use integers with scale factors (automatically applied in the operators), which is nearly equivalent to fixed point.<p>For things where vectors made sense, 1d, 2d and 3d vector types were available.  So Position2d and Position3d.<p>Absolute and relative values were distinguished: You could substract two absolutes to get a relative, but you couldn&#x27;t add two absolutes.  You could add a relative to an absolute to get an absolute.<p>And for time intervals we used wraparound arithmetic and comparisons, like the Linux kernel has the time_before() macro, so absolute times could continue &quot;growing&quot; without overflow in a running game.<p>Using the classes looked like a bit like this:<p><pre><code>    Position3d p1, p2;\n    Direction3d d = p2 - p1;\n\n    Absolute_Time t1, t2;\n    Time_Interval t = t2 - t1;\n\n    Velocity3d v;\n    object.set_position(p1 + t * v);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThese types were used pervasively throughout all the game engine, gameplay logic, &quot;AI&quot; and so on.<p>The constraints provided great type-checking and effectively documented a lot of code as well.<p>This being a game engine, they had to be fast.  So they were all inline methods, in classes containing just a number, or up to 3 numbers for vectors.<p>Using GNU C++ this compiled down to the same machine code as if we hand-coded the arithmetic in the traditional way; we checked.  So there was no runtime cost.<p>It was very satisfying to use."],"time":["2020-01-26 22:43:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
