I believe this is what applies when a company acquires another company.

I knew about Teletypes from being a ham radio operator, but I thought they were just for sending and receiving text over the air or over a phone line to another Teletype. You could either connect to the other Teletype and type in real time, or you could punch a paper tape first and then send it over the air or across the wire at the full speed of 10 characters per second.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teletype_Model_33\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teletype_Model_33<\/a><p>This Teletype was special, though.

This wasn&#x27;t just text scrolling on a screen, it printed out line after line on the roll of Teletype paper. Had to hang up the dialup modem fast.<p>That summer I got a job as &quot;night operator&quot; at the timesharing company (Transdata in Phoenix, AZ). The great thing about this job was they shut down the timesharing service at night. So I had their SDS Sigma 5 all to myself. My first personal computer!<p>I found a copy of the Algol-60 Report and taught myself Algol. And then Sigma 5 machine language. It was great fun to see how much of a program I could write on a single punch card (80 bytes).<p>We had a nice single-card program that you could put in front of a deck of cards to print out the whole card deck. But it was kind of slow, because it would read a card, print the card, read the next card, print that one, etc.<p>There were a few bytes left on that print program card, so I squeezed in code for a double buffer. It would read the first card, start it printing, and then <i>while it printed<\/i> read in the next card, overlapping the reads and writes so it printed twice as fast.<p>That fall I went to Caltech, lasted a year and flunked out. I loved science and math, but when we got to partial differential equations my mind just couldn&#x27;t handle it. But there was a systems programming class, and the final project was to write an infix expression parser and evaluator with operator precedence in assembly language.<p>I was the only person in the class to turn in a complete working program with test cases. I could probably tell you exactly where I was sitting when the instructor announced the results. I had found my calling, and have been at it ever since.<p>My secret weapon: while everyone was punching cards with their program, submitting the batch job, and waiting hours or overnight for the core dump when it crashed, I found an <i>interactive console<\/i> on campus where I could code and run and test my program in real time. Just like the Teletype I learned on.<p>Moving forward to the present, I interviewed with a FAANG company last week. It reminded me a bit of the discouraging experience the article&#x27;s author initially had with LOGO and competitive programming.<p>Everyone I interviewed with, and the company recruiters, were all super nice and supportive. But the gist of the interview process was to tackle four medium to hard algorithm problems and come up with not only a working solution but a perfectly optimized solution, in 15 minutes each!<p>The recruiters advised me to spend at least an hour or two every day for two weeks on LeetCode banging through as many algorithm problems as I could, timing myself to see if I could solve each one with optimized code in that 15 minute time limit.<p>There was also a system design interview focused on scaling out a backend system to support a billion users. I explained to the recruiter and the interviewer that this wasn&#x27;t my forte, but I had a lot of experience with low level hardware interfaces and was really interested in a job in their hardware group. They don&#x27;t hire for a specific role like that, though, they hire &quot;generalist engineers&quot;, which means being able to come up with a fully optimized solution for any algorithm in 15 minutes - and without the ability to <i>run and test your code<\/i>.<p>In fact, they used an online code editor that normally lets you do just that, but this capability was disabled. I suppose they were trying to limit the online editor to match the capabilities of what you could do scribbling code on a whiteboard.<p>This all reminded me of what discouraged the OP&#x27;s author so much about his initial foray into programming: the competitive coding competition with LOGO. That is fun for some people, but not for him and not for me. I would rather learn how to <i>cooperate<\/i> with other programmers, not compete with them.<p>One of the algorithm problems stuck in my mind. Of course it was a LeetCode problem that you can read about here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;valid-palindrome-ii&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;valid-palindrome-ii&#x2F;<\/a><p>&quot;Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character.

Most of my friends were lucky to own a NES at that time. But I never got the idea to learn programming.<p>Even as I was super interested in games and game programming (idea eventually hit), I again decided NOT to take CS as my major back in the university. It looks like I&#x27;m trying to stay away from my hobby. No idea why.<p>Then finally a few years ago I suddenly decided to teach myself C++ and from there I gradually built up my knowledge here and there. C++ hit me as a very good language to begin with (not a good idea btw), at least on the side of game programming. As I&#x27;d like to program retro RPGs, custom engine came as a natural thing as the earlier games were very easy on graphics. Anyway I did program a half done map editor and game for an Ultima spin-off and that was pretty much it. Eventually I got myself a couple of nice jobs so I didn&#x27;t have much time for programming at the moment, but still trying to get a bit done here and there, mostly data structure and algorithm as I want to get a bit deeper before working on any medium size game project.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t want to turn this into a professional job as that might be tedious (I work in a game dev company).

It&#x27;s a super rewarding skill to have and I&#x27;m grateful to be a programmer myself.<p>Turning that skill into your profession is going to be tough. I say this because I&#x27;ve been programming professional for 20 years or so and I&#x27;m currently interviewing. The process of getting a coding job has gotten extremely hard and demanding. 5-8 years back it was solely based on the interview; if you knew your stuff and could talk-the-talk, they&#x27;d generally take a chance you could walk-the-walk.<p>Now, it&#x27;s gotten extremely unreasonable. Mostly in the &#x27;code-challenges&#x27; being asked. I recently was given an challenge and after they gave me a small overview of it, I asked roughly what the time-box should be to get a feel for what they thought the effort take. The hiring manager said to me &#x27;it shouldn&#x27;t take more than 8 hours&#x27;. I was shocked. I&#x27;ve been given many coding challenges, they generally fall into the 2 hours or less category. 8 hours is a serious time commitment. I ended up passing because if this is what they find reasonable during the interview I can&#x27;t imagine what kind of demands they&#x27;d place on me day-in-day out.<p>That&#x27;s just one recent example. Before that I was asked to write a simple todo list, and given a time box of 2 days. In that case I chose to do it because I knew I could do something like that in way less than 2 days. I ended up using the full 2 days just sprucing up the UX.  I ended up not getting an offer from that company because I bombed the 2 hour group interview which I knew would happen; our family pet had been suddenly ill and in the ICU for 4 days straight and my wife and I had maybe 8 hours of sleep over the previous 5 days. Of course I tried to reschedule but the technical recruiter was adamant this last interview was just a formality, they loved my star-wars themed todo list (Jedi-Do, it&#x27;s on my github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LowRezSkyline&#x2F;Jedi_Do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LowRezSkyline&#x2F;Jedi_Do<\/a>) and an offer was pending.<p>So it&#x27;s one thing to learn programming and quite another to get through the crazy gate-keeping happening these days and land an actual job.

We pushed extremely hard to get into new markets, and while strategically this worked out extremely well for us, it meant that later development was hamstrung by earlier decisions. Any iteration on old features almost always meant rebuilding it entirely, and we&#x27;ve only just started to get to a place where previous efforts to do this are now paying off in increased velocity.<p>I think there&#x27;s an argument that this <i>could<\/i> be good, since you&#x27;re only improving features when there&#x27;s some other value you can ship. However, I think it&#x27;s short-sighted, because it means prioritizing small iterations has an unnecessarily large cost, simply because that cost wasn&#x27;t paid down slowly over time. While I do think prioritizing new markets early on was a good call, that mindset bit us in the ass in a big way when we tried to ship a very flashy new feature later in our growth cycle that crashed and burned because of tech debt, and it took us over a year to fix everything to release it.

I&#x27;d argue that the success of your initial customers is more important than the features for your next deal, and that feature investments should reflect that.<p>The problem, as the OP said, is in estimating the difference between the incremental feature requirements of your initial customers and what your strategic feature set will be. There may be no difference, and your strategy is to ship features in order satisfy each new customer as you get it. Perhaps you can design for that.

Ultimately I believe the outcome of this case will depend on two questions:<p>1. Can Epic establish that iOS app distribution is in fact a valid antitrust market that Apple has monopoly control over?<p>Epic argues that Apple is abusing its &quot;monopoly&quot; over the iOS app distribution market. However, in an antitrust case you cannot simply declare an arbitrarily narrow market where the defendant is the only participant and expect the court to accept it. iOS app distribution is an &quot;aftermarket&quot; of the smartphone market, and as a general rule, US courts do not permit antitrust markets to be based on a single brand&#x27;s product unless specific exceptions are met.<p><i>&gt; &quot;In general, a manufacturer&#x27;s own products do not themselves comprise a relevant product market..... [A] company does not violate the Sherman Act by virtue of the natural monopoly it holds over its own product.&quot; Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i><p>The circumstances in which the courts have allowed a single brand&#x27;s product to be treated as a valid antitrust market have usually involved situations where the customer purchased a product <i>not knowing<\/i> they would be locked into some aftermarket restriction, for example due to a change in contract or company policy. If, on the other hand, customers knew about the restriction ahead of time, could have purchased an alternative product without restrictions, and went ahead and purchased anyway, the market power deriving from that restriction is generally not considered a valid basis for an antitrust claim.<p>Of particular note is that courts routinely reject market definitions based on restrictions stipulated in EULAs that customers voluntarily agreed to when purchasing the original product. For example, in <i>Blizzard Entertainment Inc. v. Ceiling Fan Software LLC<\/i>, the court rejected the defendant&#x27;s claim that Blizzard held monopoly power in the &quot;WoW add-on software&quot; aftermarket, because WoW customers explicitly agreed to WoW&#x27;s EULA stipulating they would only used Blizzard authorized WoW add-ons when they purchased the game. Similarly, in <i>Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i>, the court rejected Psystar&#x27;s claim that Apple held monopoly power in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket because customers <i>&quot;knowingly agreed to the challenged restraint&quot;<\/i> when they purchaed Mac OS.<p>Interestingly enough, I double checked and surprisingly the iPhone EULA does not appear to have language restricting app installation to the &quot;App Store and other authorized sources only&quot;. If it did, I believe Epic would have trouble getting past here. However, even in absence of an explicit contractual restriction, the court permits an analysis of <i>&quot;whether a consumer&#x27;s selection of a particular brand in the competitive market is the functional equivalent of a contractual commitment&quot;<\/i>. This analysis is explained in <i>Newcal Industries, Inc. v. IKON Office Solution<\/i> which describes four relevant aspects to consider:<p>a) The existence of two separate but related markets. Epic alleges these are &quot;smartphone OSes&quot; and &quot;app distribution&quot;. It&#x27;s not clear to me whether these two markets need to be economically distinct (more on the meaning of this below), but it could be problematic for Epic if they do.<p>b) The allegations of illegal monopolization relate only to the aftermarket. (This is a given.)<p>c) Whether the source of the company&#x27;s market power is based on contractual provisions obtained in the initial market or based on the company&#x27;s relationship with its customers. Epic argues that in the absence of a EULA there is no contractual relationship, while Apple will presumably argue that there is a quasi-contractual agreement in place because they made the app installation policy very clear at the launch of the App Store and it has never changed.<p>d) Whether market imperfections prevent customers from realizing their choice in the initial market will impact their freedom to shop in the aftermarket. In other words, did customers <i>&quot;make a knowing choice to restrict their aftermarket options&quot;<\/i> when they decided to buy an iPhone instead of a different phone that allowed side-loading?<p>I think Epic is going to have a particularly tough time establishing (c) and (d). If the court concludes that customers purchased iPhones knowing that they would be restricted to installing apps from the App Store, then Apple&#x27;s &quot;monopoly&quot; over iOS app distribution is based on the customer&#x27;s knowing consent, and therefore will not be a valid basis for an antitrust claim.<p>We&#x27;ll see what the court decides. But in any event, even if Epic succeeds in proving that Apple has a monopoly over iOS app distribution, the job is not done. They then need to prove that Apple used that monopoly to illegally restrain competition in another market, which brings us to question 2.<p>2. Can Epic establish that iOS app payment processing is a separate and distinct product from iOS app distribution?<p>In order to prove Apple illegally tied app distribution and payment processing together, Epic will need to show that the two are actually economically distinct products.<p><i>&gt; &quot;[T]here must be a coherent economic basis for treating the tying and tied products as distinct. All but the simplest products can be broken down into two or more components that are &quot;tied together&quot; in the final sale. Unless it is to be illegal to sell cars with engines or cameras with lenses, this analysis must be guided by some limiting principle. For products to be treated as distinct, the tied product must, at a minimum, be one that some consumers might wish to purchase separately without also purchasing the tying product. When the tied product has no use other than in conjunction with the tying product, a seller of the tying product can acquire no additional market power by selling the two products together.&quot; Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde<\/i><p>In <i>Jefferson Parish<\/i>, the Supreme Court ruled anesthesiological services were <i>not<\/i> economically distinct from hospital services because anesthesiological services were always sold in conjunction with other hospital services, and therefore tying the two together was not illegal. In <i>Rick-Mik Enterprises, Inc. v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC<\/i>, credit card processing was considered an essential component of a gas station franchise and therefore was not economically distinct from the sale of the franchise itself. The legal test for whether two tied products are economically distinct has historically depended on whether consumer demand exists for the tied product separate from the tying product, but it&#x27;s not clear whether that test is appropriate here.<p>For the case of paid apps, there clearly <i>aren&#x27;t<\/i> economically distinct products. If Apple distributes a paid app on behalf of a developer and collects a fee in exchange, the fee is the cost of using Apple&#x27;s distribution service. Distribution and payment happen simultaneously, they are not separate services, therefore there is no tie between them.<p>Now, what happens if Apple initially distributes the app without a fee and (later) takes a fee when an in-app purchase is made? Does the act of deferring the payment from the download create two economically distinct products when before there was only one? Apple argues that it does not, and similar to <i>Rick-Mik<\/i>, in-app payment processing is simply a component of its app distribution service.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this argument will hold up in court but it&#x27;s certainly very interesting and probably venturing into uncharted territory as far as existing precedent is concerned. But if the court does decide that in-app payment processing services are not economically distinct from app distribution services, then Epic is going to have difficulties with their tying claim.<p>Overall these are very tough questions and as the judge said, it&#x27;s not a slam dunk for either side. I tend to think Epic is fighting the uphill battle here, as existing US antitrust law seems like it favors the defendant in cases like this. If Epic does win, it&#x27;s certainly going to open up a lot of similar questions for other companies that sell tightly controlled hardware and software.

I doubt this time will be different, though the brief renaissance will doubtless be appreciated.<p>Charles Perrow wrote of this in the mid-1980s:<p><i>After the critical period from about 1956 to 1960, when tastes were unfrozen, competition was intense, and demand soared, consolidation appeared. The number of firms stabilized at about forty. New corporate entries appeared, such as MGM and Warner Brothers, sensing, one supposes, the opportunity that vastly expanding sales indicated. Some independents grew large. The eight-firm concentration ratio also stabilized (though not yet the four-firm ratio). The market became sluggish, however, as the early stars died, were forced into retirement because of legal problems, or in the notable case of Elvis Presley, were drafted by an impinging environment. Near the end of this period the majors decided that the new sounds were not a fad and began to buy up the contracts of established artists and successfully picked and promoted new ones, notably The Beach Boys and Bob Dylan. A new generation (e.g., The Beatles) appeared from 1964 to 1969, and sales again soared.<\/i><p><i>But now the concentration ratios soared also. From 1962 to 1973, the four-firm ratio went from 25 to 51 percent; the eight-firm ratio from 46 to 81 percent, almost back to the pre-1955 levels. The number of different firms having hits declined from forty-six to only sixteen. Six of the eight giants were diversified conglomerates, some of which led in the earlier period; one was a new independent, the other a product of of mergers.<\/i><p><i>How did they do it? The major companies asserted “increasing central control over the creative process”[352] through deliberate creation and extensive promotion of new groups, long-range contracts for groups, and reduced autonomy for producers. In addition, legal and illegal promotion costs (drug payola to disc jockeys, for example) rose in the competitive race and now exceeded the resources of small independents. Finally, the majors “have also moved to regain a controlling position in record distribution by buying chains of retail stores.”[353] The diversity is still greater than it had been in the past, and may remain high, but it is ominous that the majors have all the segments covered. As an executive said, “Columbia Records will have a major entry into whatever new area is broached by the vagaries of public tastes.” But for a concentrated industry, the “vagaries of public tastes” are not economical; it is preferable to stabilize and consolidate them.

And that’s probably understating it.<p>It’s really something to see the entire west coast on fire right now. We live up in a forested valley in northwest Oregon, and got blanketed with smoke yesterday. Happened quickly and was the worst smoke I’ve experienced since the Camp Fire blew into Los Altos, CA, a while back. Our area of Oregon hit the top of the wildfire risk chart yesterday for the entire west coast, at “critical” — hot and dry with gusts of winds reaching 65MPH.<p>Happily woke up to relatively calm, clear-ish skies today.<p>We’ve spent a decent amount of money getting rid of brush, and trees, to create a “defensible zone” around the home. That’s one of the most impactful things that can be done to mitigate the risk — make sure flammable plants and trees are far from the house, use hardscaping (stone, gravel) around the foundation, and keep anything within 30-100’ well irrigated. Also, don’t allow leaves etc to gather under porches, gutters. Make sure vents are well screened.<p>The forest becomes more wilderness but we’ve been doing a bunch there as well: limbing trees up to reduce the risk of “ladder fires”, getting rid of brush, cleaning up old access trails in case a fire crew needs to come through.<p>Fires are pretty awesome events — experiencing them first-hand gives you a sense of scale that’s impossible to convey through pictures alone. The people in this story had quite an experience, and it’s fortunate how many people escaped that fire.<p>But fires are both natural, and increasing in destructiveness due to a combination of factors (including climate change).

This is going to kill people.  A lot of people.<p>Look, the <i>usual<\/i> situation with vaccines is that we are weighing (1) the danger posed to the few people who get sick while the trials are going on; vs. (2) the risks taken on by <i>everybody<\/i> who gets the vaccine.  The vaccine might have a small likelihood of triggering reactions or otherwise having adverse effects, and spread over the entire population these edge cases can add up to do more damage than the disease itself.<p>Again, that is for typical vaccine situations.  A pandemic is totally different--the number of cases is exponentially increasing and ripping through the entire population.  So our options are:<p>1. Wait the additional 6-12 months it would take (even accounting for the immense investments that have been made) to get a vaccine to go through all the normal regulatory hoops we would demand of vaccine development outside of a pandemic. During which time COVID-19 rips through the population leaving potentially millions dead and hundreds of millions of recovered with disease-related tissue damage.<p>2. Wait, but stay in lockdown to keep the disease at bay, but in the process massively drive up suicide, domestic violence, and divorce rates, wreck the economy, and force people to spend their savings and&#x2F;or trigger massive inflation through pandemic relief.<p>3. Some horrible compromise between the above two extremes.<p>4. Roll out the vaccines as quickly as they can be manufactured, starting now. Don&#x27;t wait for Phase III results.<p>The Phase I and Phase II trials tell us that the vaccine successfully generates antibodies.  The group sizes so far have been large enough to know that the risk of fatal interactions is less than the risk of dying from COVID-19 itself--indeed, for the most part there haven&#x27;t been ANY severe reactions, at least in the major vaccines.<p>This &quot;wait until the vaccine is proven safe!&quot; is politically generated nonsense. There is no data-driven argument supporting it.  Ideologues on the left assume that Trump wants a vaccine ASAP to win reelection, don&#x27;t trust is understanding of the science, and therefore assume that early administration of a vaccine would be some sort of unsafe political compromise.  Ideologues on the right believe COVID-19 is a hoax anyway.  But even a broken clock is right twice a day, and the fact that Trump wants a quick vaccine approval has no bearing on whether it is a good idea or not; and in this case it very clearly IS beneficial to distribute a vaccine as quickly as it can be manufactured."],"time":["2020-09-08 21:57:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kippinitreal"],"id":[24412000],"kids":[24412025],"parent":[24411540],"text":["Seems like a smart decision by those businesses to team up (collude?) here both for business and public health reasons.

Various administrations have touted these investments as a solution to the city&#x27;s high crime levels, notoriously poor performance of APD (in terms of both crime reduction and compliance with a Department of Justice consent decree), and chronic understaffing of many area police organizations but especially APD.<p>There has, of course, been no real evidence of success. A promising change in local crime trends seems to be more a result of significant reform of the DA&#x27;s office than anything APD has done. APD&#x27;s main contribution to the effort has been harassing anyone who happens to be near downtown at night, including people who live and work there. That and shooting someone on occasion.<p>What is perhaps most surprising about these programs is how little attention they have received from the public. While APD&#x27;s abuse of force and corruption problems are widely known and one of the area&#x27;s foremost political issues, there is almost no discussion of APD&#x27;s mass surveillance programs even among police abolition groups. It seems to reflect the general trend that mass surveillance is a much great topic of discussion in the tech community than outside of it.<p>All that said, my real comment is that this program seems unsurprising and of little import compared to the real-time crime center, its privacy implications, and ongoing internal problems including chronic high turnover and sudden dismissals (which tends to suggest problems that were not publicized), hiring a director with a history of internal affairs problems, etc. And then even that seems like a small matter in the context that APD has been under a department of justice consent decree resulting from a pattern of excessive force for six years now and has only just in the last few months finished making the policy changes required by DoJ, with the independent monitor reporting that compliance with those new policies is extremely poor.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just hard to get too fired up about APD being run by major retailers when it&#x27;s been clear for years that APD does not answer to the people, the city government, or the federal government. Being in the pocket of Target is downright wholesome compared to what we expect from APD.<p>Look on the bright side: APD has it together compared to BCSO. Sheriff Gonzales resisted implementation of body cameras for years until the state legislature took the matter into their own hands and mandated cameras for all law enforcement agencies. After a series of gaffs including Sheriff Gonzales announcing that he thought officers owning smart phones was sufficient to meet the mandate, the media has enjoyed discussing what will happen when they blow through the deadline and BCSO no longer meets statutory requirements to exercise law enforcement authority."],"time":["2020-09-08 06:49:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rshnotsecure"],"id":[24407199],"kids":[24408238],"parent":[24402937],"text":["The City of Albuquerque&#x27;s site was maintained by Netsential, who in turn used &quot;Data Foundry&quot; in central Texas as their colo &#x2F; cloud provider.<p>It appears that the specific colo being used was also a major NSA bulk intel collection point.

In the aughts, a number of startups tried to take on that space (notably Odeo, which incubated and then pivoted into Twitter) and all of them failed. Apple has been largely an absentee steward, which has worked out well for podcasting. It wasn’t until Google decided to take podcasts seriously about five years ago and launched its own podcast directory. Spotify’s podcast directory started about five years ago too, though took longer to build momentum.<p>All three are largely copies of one another — although Spotify has exclusives in its directory that can only be played in its app — and most major podcasts choose to submit their RSS feed to those directories, with some also choosing to share with other services (Stitcher, Luminary, etc.) that can do some fucked up stuff with the audio. It’s all a game of reach for a podcast publisher, unless you choose you don’t want Luminary or Stitcher to insert their own ads into your content — or you have an exclusive with some service or another.<p>So now there is ostensibly yet another podcast directory, except it can’t offer a good value prop for existing except that it is “open” — which sounds good if you’re Alex Jones or you make content that has been kicked out of the other directories — but will realistically impact only a small number of podcasters.<p>The target audience, I assume is podcatching apps. Right now, most of them scrape the Apple or Google podcasts directory to save the insanity of trying to maintain their own directory.<p>So what value is there for this “open” directory to someone who has a podcatching app? Well, nothing unless there is a critical mass of podcasts submitted. Moreover, the service says it’s free, but is also asking for donations, which makes me worry about the viability of the index longterm. Given how difficult the market is for creating a third-party podcasting client when Google, Apple, and Spotify exist with their own apps and established indies (Overcast), I would strongly discourage anyone from building their own podcatcher as anything more than a hobby project.<p>So what’s the point? Podcasters will still have to submit to the major indexes anyway and podcatchers or client apps already have enough problems without having to worry about a little-used alternative that doesn’t have a business plan associated with it.<p>I’m all for open and I’m not mad this exists — but I certainly wouldn’t build my app off its API."],"time":["2020-09-08 15:28:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["css"],"id":[24407956],"kids":[24408177],"parent":[24407674],"text":["I wonder how The Podcast Index will handle fraud.

I know when I say that people are thinking of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, but it goes deeper than that. Even if you somehow manage to stay on-schedule, human communication around innovation stops working at a certain scale, and that looks like a hard limit. There are ways around it, using things like Code Budgets, following CCL, layers and DSLs, but nobody does that, so it doesn&#x27;t matter. We, as an industry, have absolutely no idea how to staff or run projects.<p>ADD: One thing that was quite profound that I discovered late: if you code well, the simple <i>act<\/i> of programming can tell you something about the way you&#x27;re reasoning about the problem that you couldn&#x27;t learn any other way. Programming is by no means a simple one-way street where ideas come out of the head of the programmer and end up as bits on the tech stack. It&#x27;s very, very much bidirectional. Our programs influence us as coders probably much more than we influence them."],"time":["2020-09-08 10:27:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lioeters"],"id":[24403503],"kids":{},"parent":[24397272],"text":["A few that come to mind:<p>- Implementing small languages, and how it inevitably leads one to a deeper understanding of all the layers that make computing and programming possible<p>- The Make-a-Lisp project and the language-agnostic conceptual design at the heart of it - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kanaka&#x2F;mal&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;process&#x2F;guide.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kanaka&#x2F;mal&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;process&#x2F;guide.md<\/a><p>- Declarative nature of React (the view as function of state); using centralized unidirectional state management and actions<p>- Test-driven (and, similarly, type-driven) development<p>- TypeScript - Benefits and costs of type definitions, dynamic&#x2F;gradual and structural typing; power of a language integrated with the editor environment<p>- Virtual machines, QEMU, and later Docker - Commoditized, reproducible builds for applications and their environments<p>- Build pipeline scripts"],"time":["2020-09-08 00:31:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cafemachiavelli"],"id":[24407442],"kids":{},"parent":[24397272],"text":["1.

Learning how to learn, in my case, by writing down stuff in my own words as if I were teaching someone else was probably the most important thing.

Don’t try to learn all the niche technologies you see in job listings expecting you need to know those things in order to qualify for the position. If you just do dozens of tutorials, you’ll end up knowing a lot of things very superficially.

I got started with programming via BASIC (various forms), none of which supported recursion. I didn&#x27;t really <i>know<\/i> what it was, but knew that I just wanted to call into the same routine again from itself or via mutual recursion (again, didn&#x27;t know the term). This didn&#x27;t work as expected, however. Either the program wouldn&#x27;t compile&#x2F;execute (threw an error at the recursion) or the recursion just corrupted the data (each call shared the same local data, so they&#x27;d clobber each others&#x27; work). While playing around on a TI calculator I programmed (something, can&#x27;t remember the details) but created a stack using the list data structure. I then looped (versus recursed) but pushed a data element onto the stack or popped elements off of it. The program quit when the stack was empty.<p>Later, in college, we were learning lower level programming details (like what C translated to in assembly and how it managed calls and the stack frame). Despite this being my third CS course in college, I hadn&#x27;t really <i>grokked<\/i> recursion yet. But I had a flashback during one of the classes to the TI-BASIC programs I&#x27;d written using a stack, and realized I&#x27;d recreated recursion (but manually). After that recursion and loops were synonymous in my mind (as they should be, at least in many cases) since I knew how to translate between them. Whenever I saw someone managing a stack and looping until it was empty, I knew both that it could be and how it could be translated into recursion (and vice versa).<p>It seems to be one of the hardest topics for many of my colleagues (especially those without a CS degree, so lacking practice with recursion) to understand or ever use. But I can usually get them to understand it once I draw a few things out on paper and show the two solutions to a problem (recursive or iterative). This doesn&#x27;t mean they like recursion, most still avoided it, but they started to understand that it wasn&#x27;t magic, it was just the computer managing the same data structure they were manually managing."],"time":["2020-09-08 19:21:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["animesh"],"id":[24402044],"kids":[24402131],"parent":[24397272],"text":["1.

See [1]. Newer language wars center of safety and bug creation, so maybe this point is dating me.<p>- Programming languages are more about human psychology than about some mathematical proof of correctness. Programming languages are designed as a compromise between how a computer needs to be told to operate and how humans communicate. All the theoretical and mathematical infrastructure around language design are there to justify decisions once the language has passed the &quot;psychology&quot; test. This is the same idea between JPEG, MP3, etc. compression. Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms don&#x27;t inherently create a saving, it&#x27;s only when we can throw away higher order coefficients because the human perceptual system isn&#x27;t as sensitive to them as lower order coefficients, does it give benefit. That is, JPEG and MP3 are specifically tailored to the human perceptual system. The math is there as the building block but which bits&#x2F;coefficients to throw away are determined empirically. To belabor this point a bit more, programming language discussions arguing over functional vs. imperative, type safety, etc. that don&#x27;t try to determine measurable metrics of success, preferably through testing their hypothesis with data collected on actual usage, are expressing an opinion only.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200407014302&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gmarceau.qc.ca&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;speed-size-and-dependability-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200407014302&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gmarc...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 11:34:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kangnkodos"],"id":[24409253],"kids":{},"parent":[24397272],"text":["When I first started compiling code, there were often pages and pages of compiler errors.

When going through a textbook explaining how relational database engines were implemented and seeing that they&#x27;re essentially just using disk-persisted hash tables and self-balancing search trees to build indices on columns and make `select`s O(1)&#x2F;O(log) time (I wasn&#x27;t taught this in my uni&#x27;s database course and assumed there was some fancy magic going on to make queries fast)<p>6. Realizing that I could just do a form of graph search&#x2F;dependency resolution when learning a new codebase&#x2F;trying to understand how a function works. I think before seeing someone do this in front of me I would usually just panic at the thought of &quot;thousands of lines of code&quot; rather than just &quot;keep iteratively diving into the functions being called&quot;. Whenever I&#x27;m learning a new language, the first thing I&#x27;ll do is setup the LSP plugin in vim so that I can quickly navigate up and down call graphs. Tbh I don&#x27;t understand how some developers claim to not need this and instead just manually grep+open file in order to &quot;jump to definition&quot;.<p>7. Forcing myself to derive the rotation logic for AVL trees. I was curious if, given just the high level properties of how an AVL tree behaves in order to guarantee O(log) time lookups, if I would be able to figure out all the rotation cases.

Clean is when you don&#x27;t have to make many decisions to get things done.<p>Example decisions, I&#x27;d say I spend at least 90% of my time developing on these decisions:<p>- What feature would be good to have?<p>- Is the feature worth the effort to build?<p>- Is the feature worth the compute costs?<p>- What language&#x2F;framework should we use for this feature?<p>- How should we structure persistent data related to this feature?<p>- Where should the code for this feature live?<p>- How should we test this feature?<p>- How performant should this feature be?<p>- What name should this helper function&#x2F;variable have?<p>The more of those you have to think about when developing the slower you will make progress. Therefore the main productivity hack is to write down guidelines or roadmaps or design documents for all of those so you don&#x27;t have to think much about it when developing. This means don&#x27;t be a manager when coding, let someone else do that work or do it before you start programming.<p>Things you can do to reduce mental cost of above decisions:<p>- Product roadmap with features that would be good to have.<p>- Discussions in the roadmap related to how much value said feature will provide and the effort to produce it.<p>- Discussions in the roadmap related to how expensive the feature will be to run.<p>- General guidelines on what language&#x2F;framework you use.<p>- Have a very good architectural document describing how you structure persistent data.<p>- Have list of example commits showing where to put code for different features.<p>- Have a well documented testing strategy with examples pointing to commits with good integration and unit tests.<p>- Have guidelines on how much typical actions are allowed to take, like &quot;page update should take 100ms at most&quot;.<p>- Try to write code where you don&#x27;t need a lot of long superfluous names, namespaces and anonymous functions are your friends.<p>- Lastly, as much as possible try to make reasonable defaults for shared code. If you have to make 20 configuration decisions in order to use a library then you wont save a lot of time using it, and likely people will just copy the configuration from other places anyway since making 20 decisions is too much work. For example, lets say your library have a flag that can speed up processing 2x in some cases but with extra overhead most of the time. You could think that forcing the developer to decide in each case to ensure we aren&#x27;t missing any performance improvements would be a good thing, but in reality a 2x performance improvement rarely matters. So the cost of having every developer making this decision outweighs the performance benefit. Instead have it as an optional config that they can set when they actually need the performance."],"time":["2020-09-08 14:00:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throw0101a"],"id":[24414952],"kids":[24417270,24416565],"parent":[24399236],"text":["A good book on how the automobile came to (the American) city streets:<p>&gt; <i>Before the advent of the automobile, users of city streets were diverse and included children at play and pedestrians at large. By 1930, most streets were primarily a motor thoroughfares where children did not belong and where pedestrians were condemned as &quot;jaywalkers.&quot; In Fighting Traffic, Peter Norton argues that to accommodate automobiles, the American city required not only a physical change but also a social one: before the city could be reconstructed for the sake of motorists, its streets had to be socially reconstructed as places where motorists belonged. It was not an evolution, he writes, but a bloody and sometimes violent revolution. Norton describes how street users struggled to define and redefine what streets were for. He examines developments in the crucial transitional years from the 1910s to the 1930s, uncovering a broad anti-automobile campaign that reviled motorists as &quot;road hogs&quot; or &quot;speed demons&quot; and cars as &quot;juggernauts&quot; or &quot;death cars.&quot; He considers the perspectives of all users--pedestrians, police (who had to become &quot;traffic cops&quot;), street railways, downtown businesses, traffic engineers (who often saw cars as the problem, not the solution), and automobile promoters.

I have two. Children ages 2 and 3 are a strong counter-example to this &quot;inmate human goodness&quot; hypothesis and Rousseau&#x27;s thinking in general. My kids at that age would often be about to trip over the last nerve with some sort of interruption only to say, &quot;Mommy and daddy, I love you.&quot; In some ways, I think the goodness that kids these ages show must be some sort of evolutionary mechanism to remain &quot;cute&quot; and keep the parents from harming them (i.e. self-interested). Thomas Sowell (whose work I submit is likely far superior to either Bregman&#x27;s or the Lancet reviewer Marmot&#x27;s) has a wonderful quote illustrating it: &quot;Each new generation born is in effect an invasion of civilization by little barbarians, who must be civilized before it is too late.&quot;<p>Bergman appears to be arguing against a straw man. I don&#x27;t think anyone would say that human beings are completely, innately and irredeemably evil. I doubt even John Calvin would have argued such a thing. People want to be loved and they want to feel they are doing good.

I&#x27;d argue that neither seems to be true, but the latter seems particularly false and fatal for the unconstrained vision. The existence of even a few unchecked malevolent attributes is sufficient to create mass suffering.

He then argues that the real problem designers and devs are trying to solve is the loss of control - that the browser controls loading, and the blank screen is &quot;bad.&quot;<p>He then says that the solution is using an iframe (called a portal.) which looks to be a proposed API. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;hands-on-portals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;hands-on-portals&#x2F;<\/a> - this is available as an origin trial in Chrome 85.<p>So, he&#x27;s saying that SPAs are bad and we should invest in a Chrome-only feature or future feature that might make it through standards?

SPAs are also used in places they shouldn&#x27;t, such as news sites, because of the page load problem as mentioned above. Portals would be useful here.<p>But it gets to the real problem: client side rendering in the past decade has had a lot more thought and effort in tooling, tutorials, and patterns on the client side than server side, especially with mixed mode. (Mixed mode: adding javascript on top of server-side rendering.) The problem is that server-side rendering and mixed mode is not a good development experience. The back button was never a fully solved problem and POST-redirect-GET is essentially an insufficient hack.<p>If someone wants to talk about making server side rendering for web applications a viable experience, we are likely going to need changes to the standards and we will need to build up a great set of tooling to solve the problem.

Jump to a new section, and the scroll position in the ToC is lost.<p>He describes how to use a portal to fix this.<p>Compare with desktop GUI toolkits. The ToC would be its own element (GtkListView or QtWhateverList or NSThisNThat). The contents would be their own element (GtkTextView or QtCanvas or whatever). Both are drawn independently of the other. You can call for an invalidation of part of the window. You do not need to consider them part of a single window rectangle that will always be redrawn in-toto for a page load.<p>Now, my (weak) understanding of why we&#x27;ve ended up with things like React is that in part they are an attempt to solve this by effectively creating the equivalent of a widget heirarchy inside the browser. When a React implementation of his example gets new content, it doesn&#x27;t invalidate or even necessarily &quot;redraw&quot; the ToC, and it tells the browser what to do by invalidating certain DOM elements (or even just one DOM element).<p>I think he misses this as a key reason for the movement towards frameworks.<p>But ... notice that the browser will probably (I&#x27;m not 100% sure about this, would appreciate comment from someone who knows), re-render the entire rectangle the contains the page.<p>Desktop applications don&#x27;t work this way. If you turn on Quartz debugging on macOS you can actually see the rects on screen that are re-rendered to reflect invalidation by the application (e.g. after new content needs to be displayed).<p>Maybe I have this wrong, and React and similar frameworks have leveraged a subtle capability in the browser to invalidate a DOM element as a way to only re-render part of the on-screen rect.<p>But assuming that I&#x27;ve have this roughly correct, this model in which the &quot;atomic, indivisible rendering unit&quot; for browser apps is the page rect seems fundamentally disadvantaged and mis-designed compared to desktop apps."],"time":["2020-09-08 19:38:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hardwaresofton"],"id":[24409906],"kids":[24409959],"parent":[24407849],"text":["I am definitely one that loves a good &quot;get off my lawn&quot; moment, but it seems like we rehash this point every few weeks (and I don&#x27;t even read frontend twitter).
