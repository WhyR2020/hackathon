That&#x27;s a huge expense.<p><pre><code>    Cat v panel heater: Which is better?\n    6:34 AM, 24 Aug 2020 James Powers\n\n    Cats are affectionate, panel heaters are not.\n    How many cats do you need to heat an energy-efficient home?\n    It’s the question on everybody&#x27;s lips. Well, maybe not everyone&#x27;s lips, and it&#x27;s possible this is a niche topic, but it is relevant.\n    A 3kg cat has a heat output of 14.8 watts, or 129.65 kilowatt-hours - the metric commonly used by power companies to show you how much energy you&#x27;re using.\n    These numbers are important when it comes to the design and building of energy-efficient homes, as the heat output of random things like cats can lead to overheating.\n    For example, to be certified Passive House, a building must have an annual heating demand of less than 15kWh per square metre to maintain a comfortable temperature.\n    For a typical Kiwi house of 150sqm, the annual energy demand would be 2250kWh. The number of cats required, therefore, would be 17.35, but let&#x27;s avoid chopping cats and round up to 18 whole cats.\n    This equates to 1 cat per 8.33sqm.\n    Easy as. Let’s bulk order a cat litter.\n    Cats cost about $250 per year to ‘operate’ which equates to a total running cost of $4,300 per year*. This is a bit more than $475 for gas or $675 for electric, although the installation cost is less for cats.\n    * The calculations have used an average heat load. In reality, the heat load will vary considerably throughout the year. You will need significantly more cats in colder weather and less during mild weather.\n    In hot weather, you can, of course, let the cats out, but this represents a significant waste of resources if you continue to feed them. And as cats cannot be used for cooling, you would also have to introduce an alternative cooling system such as lizards or other cold-blooded animals.<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-08-26 01:52:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nkoren"],"id":[24277284],"kids":{},"parent":[24276702],"text":["This surely should give some credit to the venerable old Solar Cat Book:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Solar-Cat-Book-Jim-Augustyn&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0898150183\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Solar-Cat-Book-Jim-Augustyn&#x2F;dp&#x2F;089815...<\/a><p>(Which would evidently make me an alarming amount of money if I could find my old copy of it...)"],"time":["2020-08-26 01:03:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cafard"],"id":[24282513],"kids":{},"parent":[24276702],"text":["Then there was the couple who got a kitten.

But the decrease will be much more pronounced at lower elevations, such as Toyama, where much of the city’s snow falls with temperatures near the freezing mark. A few degrees warmer here will make a big difference. Higher elevations will likely continue to have exceptionally snowy winters, at least in the short term. Still, the culture of Japan’s Snow Country may already be changing.<p>&gt; “I remember when I was in high school there was a lot more snow,” says Tanikawa, who is now 50. “In the morning snow fell and it would fall all day while we were at school. When I came back home there would be 40 to 50 centimeters of snow to clear. My children,” Tanikawa adds, “have not had that experience.”<p>I live on the west coast of Japan at the foot of the mountains, and it&#x27;s striking how much snowfall is decreasing in recent years. The last two years have been record setting due to lack of snowfall. The local municipal ski resort didn&#x27;t open at all this past winter, and for the annual snow festival in February they had to truck in some snow from somewhere else.<p>Since temperatures here tend to hover just around freezing in the winter, a small temperature difference can mean the difference between rain or 50 cm of snow. Year-to-year differences are becoming more variable, too. Three years ago we were buried in so much snow that the city had to send in a team with heavy duty snow machines to dig us out (typically neighborhoods here are self-sufficient in terms of snow removal). We had about 2 meters piled up in our yard. But these past two years it was mostly just rain.<p>On the one hand, it&#x27;s very convenient to not have to deal with so much snow in the winter. And the mountains nearby still receive plenty of snow for skiing and other recreation. But it does feel like a part of what makes this area special is vanishing. And I&#x27;m sad that my kids won&#x27;t be able to experience it to the same degree."],"time":["2020-08-25 01:05:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["malikolivier"],"id":[24267388],"kids":{},"parent":[24258675],"text":["Driving through these roads just after they open around March&#x2F;April is a blast.\nIf you look enough, you can find places where you can actually climb on the snow walls and ski&#x2F;hike on the snow slopes yourself.

This is a justified concern due to the existence of global warming and the potential loss of life and property damage generated by these immense storms.<p>I&#x27;m not a climate scientist, but I have read about climate change and hurricanes (and cyclones):<p>* In 1886 there were 7 major hurricanes that year, four hit Texas and three that hit florida. (See the hurricane tracking map for that year[1].) This was the most active year on record for hurricanes in the US, see[8].<p>* Barack Obama had the best record for hurricanes, only four hurricanes over eight years. Taft (1909-1913) had 13 in just four years over five times the rate that Obama had. Bush had 18, and Trump has had 7. The numbers are all over the place.[2]<p>* Claims that increasing ocean surface temperature will clearly generate more intense hurricane activity need to be tempered by an understanding of the energy source that drives hurricanes. It is not temperature; it is the temperature delta between the surface temperature and the overlying air that provides the energy for hurricanes, see [3], and the troposhere is warming faster than the surface according to climate scientists [4]. Wouldn&#x27;t this mean that there should be less powerful and or less frequent hurricanes.<p>* Global climate-related deaths have dropped <i>dramatically<\/i> over the last century according to data from Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters [5] and cited with a figure on p. 74 of [6].<p>* The IPCC 5 Summary Volume Final report technical summary (TFE.9, Table 1 on page 110) has this to say concerning the statement: &quot;Increases in intense tropical cyclone activity&quot;. &quot;Low confidence&quot; that changes occured (since 1950), &quot;Low confidence&quot; of a human contribution to observed changes, and &quot;Low confidence&quot; of further changes in early 21st century. See p. 110 [7].<p>The IPCC, in general, has <i>low confidence<\/i> that climate change is currently responsible for changes in hurricane intensity.<p>* We can&#x27;t rely on our own personal experience for understanding hurricane frequency, obviously.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhc.noaa.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;tracks&#x2F;tracks-at-1886.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhc.noaa.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;tracks&#x2F;tracks-at-1886.png<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;rogerpielke&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;us-hurricanes-by-president-since-1900-trump-tops-obama-but-bush-beats-them-both&#x2F;#74647be821d0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;rogerpielke&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;us-hurri...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tropical_cyclone\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tropical_cyclone<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washington.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2004&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;troposphere-warming-faster-than-earths-surface-new-measurement-shows&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washington.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2004&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;troposphere-warmi...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emdat.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emdat.be<\/a><p>[6] Bjorn Lomborg, False Alarm, Basic Books, NY, 2020.<p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;site&#x2F;assets&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;WG1AR5_SummaryVolume_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;site&#x2F;assets&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;WG1AR5_Summa...<\/a><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rogerpielkejr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;global-tropical-cyclone-landfalls-updated-1970-2018&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rogerpielkejr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;global-tropical-cyclone...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-25 19:32:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ghostcluster"],"id":[24269867],"kids":[24270896],"parent":[24268479],"text":["Fukushima would be a better metaphor because it was triggered by a natural disaster"],"time":["2020-08-25 12:33:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["johnohara"],"id":[24271534],"kids":{},"parent":[24268479],"text":["One would think Deepwater Horizon would be mentioned by comparison.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-25 16:14:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryanmarsh"],"id":[24272374],"kids":{},"parent":[24268479],"text":["If you&#x27;re interested in sane weather reporting on Houston you can do no better than Space City Weather <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacecityweather.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacecityweather.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>Also of use, the Space City Weather Flood Scale, now widely in use. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacecityweather.com&#x2F;the-space-city-weather-flood-scale&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacecityweather.com&#x2F;the-space-city-weather-flood-sc...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-25 17:31:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simplecto"],"id":[24269398],"kids":{},"parent":[24268479],"text":["Brooklyn has many issues with the Gowanus canal, also a Superfund site.

As secret projects go, the Prime team was brought in very late and given a very short integration window (2-ish weeks, maybe) to determine if that feature would make the cut for launch.<p>Part of the user experience was getting a &quot;personalized&quot; letter delivered through the Kindle delivery mechanism that included the Prime logo and JeffB&#x27;s signature. This letter was effectively a Mobi ebook dynamically generated before being pushed to the device. This functionality previously existed and was how notes indicating that lent items had expired were generated, however, those were plaintext and used a custom templating system that the Kindle team (justifiably) didn&#x27;t want to expose to external teams. The Kindle team wanted us to generate a Mobi that they would pass along, which would have required a bunch of new infrastructure and technology we had no experience with. A former teammate who was now in Kindle made the case for us continuing to use the extensive HTML custom messaging infrastructure we had, but the Kindle team&#x27;s capability limited them to hitting a single endpoint and we didn&#x27;t have a nice way to bundle all of our resources (images, content, etc.) into a single file (e.g. zip, tarball). On a call one afternoon I suggested adding data URL support so we could continue to leverage our infrastructure, they could continue to leverage their&#x27;s and only this small tool they shelled out to would need to change.<p>Of course, the kindlegen team was not involved in the discussion initially, their code did not use the tools the rest of the company used, for whatever reason they were unwilling to accept code contributions, and they wanted several months to implement the feature.<p>Being young and without kids at the time, I went home, knocked out a wrapper that would convert data URLs to external resources and replace the references, and then call out to kindlegen to generate the mobi, and had a working tool the next morning. The whole thing went (almost¹) flawlessly, allowed Prime to test and debug with the tools they knew, allowed the Kindle distribution team to swap out one piece transparently, and the Fire launched with that implementation in place. And like most stop-gap solutions, it was in place for several years before kindlegen finally supported data URLs natively.<p>This was all running on Linux hosts, and that was many many years ago now. It&#x27;s a good reminder that code is like a sandcastle. It will be gone tomorrow, but the tide will continue.<p>¹ sure, there may have been a small bug or two, but I stabilized a bunch of their tests in the process, so I consider it a win."],"time":["2020-08-25 22:30:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ggm"],"id":[24278149],"kids":[24279400],"parent":[24275231],"text":["I feel strongly that Amazon can sell kindles and we&#x27;re ok, and amazon can sell content and we&#x27;re ok but having amazon able to sell both kindle and content, and direct IPR outcomes across the platform and the content, is actually pretty bad.<p>This is not a real substitutable space.

The hole apparently allows for two different properties: stiffness above it and flexibility below. According to Bauer, this produces a slingshot effect -- almost like a smaller version of the stick’s shaft (which, as explained in this video, bends almost unbelievably to whip the puck forward). These days, ‘twigs’ are made of carbon fiber, though as the hockey lingo suggests, wood used to be the material of choice. The evolution of the hockey stick from wood to carbon fiber gives us insight into a material property called resilience.\n&gt;Resilience is basically the opposite of damping. High resilience materials bounce back with most of the energy that you put into them. As Stevel Vogel illustrates in Cats’ Paws and Catapults, spider silk is a great example of low resilience material. “A web of high resilience would, like a trampoline, tend to fling the prey back out.” Vogel goes on to note that “resilience management highlights the dichotomy between nature and human technologies.” Natural materials, like wood, tend to have lower resilience whereas man-made materials, like carbon fiber, tend to have higher resilience.\n&gt;You can see why carbon fiber, with its higher resilience, has overtaken wood as material du jour; more of the energy you put into the stick comes out on the puck for a faster shot. But a stick can be too resilient&#x2F;springy -- when receiving a pass, you don’t want the puck to bounce off the stick away from you. Players call it “feel”.

The primary complaint with Web Bundles is &quot;they make the web like SWFs&quot; - last I remember, people LIKED the fact that Flash content could be bundled that way. You actually were able to distribute Flash content like a normal web application, broken up into multiple SWFs, images, and so on. The vast majority of Flash content was a single file, because it&#x27;s easier to distribute that way.<p>With WebBundles, if you want to deny specific subresources, you can still have the browser block them by identifier or hash, which is the same as you can do with a regular web request. The reason why there are no content blocking tools for PDFs is because nobody&#x27;s bothered to write a PDF reader with that capability. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t see how putting the resource identifier in the content of a bundle makes it easier than changing the URL. Both of those will either defeat or be defeated by caching.<p>If you have a CDN that generates random URLs for a single cached resource and serves them on the same domain as user websites, then identifier-based blocking won&#x27;t work with or without WebBundles. You can do this today with Apache rewrite rules and PHP, which are about as economical as you can get. If your threat model is &quot;people who just know how to SFTP a handful of JavaScript files&quot; then yes, WebBundles makes things &quot;easier&quot;. But I&#x27;d argue your threat model is laughably unworkable if that&#x27;s the case. The state-of-the-art in adtech is to smuggle your fingerprinting platform as a randomized subdomain of the client site - how do you even begin to block that with identifiers alone?"],"time":["2020-08-25 23:33:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pes10k"],"id":[24276819],"kids":[24277061],"parent":[24274968],"text":["Again I wrote the piece but…<p>Folks &quot;who are well actually, you can already make URLs meaningless&quot;&#x27;ing are missing the point of how practical web privacy tools work, including the ones you all have installed right now.<p>There is an enormous, important difference between:<p>i) circumventions that are possible but are fragile and cost more, and\nii) circumventions that are effortless for the attacker &#x2F; tracker<p>Every practical privacy &#x2F; blocking tool leverages that difference now, the proposal collapses it."],"time":["2020-08-26 00:12:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Sephr"],"id":[24276499],"kids":[24279852],"parent":[24274968],"text":["&gt; WebBundles Allow Sites to Evade Privacy and Security Tools<p>I completely disagree.

I&#x27;d never really looked into it recently, as I&#x27;d never done anything that needed a cross origin request.<p>But recently I wanted to make a little web page that could control my Denon A&#x2F;V receiver. The receiver has two or three different network APIs. There&#x27;s one that uses telnet, and a couple of different HTTP ones.<p>You can point a browser at the receiver, and it gives you a page for controlling the receiver using one of the HTTP APIs. The API is reasonably fast, but the control page itself is glacial. A bit of poking around in the browser looking at requests and responses in the network monitor in the developer tools told me how to use that API.<p>The other HTTP API is used by the Denon mobile app. A bit of packet sniffing while using the mobile app told me how to use that API. Like the other HTTP API, that one is fast. The mobile app is also responsive, once it launches, but sometimes it takes a fair bit of time to find the receiver.<p>What I wanted was a simple web page, that I could stick on my website on Amazon Lightsail, which would just tell me the current source and volume, have buttons to switch between sources, and buttons for setting the volume. The page would use JavaScript to talk to the Denon.<p>Well, this was fine for changing inputs and volume, because those were simple GET requests. The Denon&#x27;s web server doesn&#x27;t implement CORS at all, so the responses lack any CORS headers, and the browser rejects them...but by that time the actual desired action has taken place on the server so I can just ignore the error.<p>For source and volume, that doesn&#x27;t work because I need to get the returned data.<p>I flailed around for a while trying to find a way around this. Finally I ended up giving up on the original place of having my page on my outside website. Instead I stuck it on an RPi that is in my living room controlling a space heater and doing temperature monitoring, and put some server side code on the RPi to control the Denon. The page then invokes that code on the RPi to do the actual commands to the Denon. The web page is only interacting with the RPi, so no CORS worries.<p>I probably got a bad impression of CORS from all this, but I can&#x27;t figure out what it actually helps. Lets say we have a site that came from site S, running on the browser  of user U, and from there is trying to do a cross-origin request to site C.<p>It&#x27;s not protecting C from anything I can see, because any restrictions C specifies in the CORS response headers depend on U honoring them to do anything. Someone trying to do something malicious with C could just ignore them.<p>It&#x27;s not protecting U from scripts sending out personal information to C, because CORS doesn&#x27;t block <i>sending<\/i> information if you do your sending in a way to not trigger the preflight check, which is easy to do. It just blocks your browser from doing anything with the response.<p>If a bad guy is able to get scripts to run U&#x27;s browser for a site from S, it does block those scripts from getting data from C (unless C says it is OK). But if the bad guy really needs their script to get data from C, they could just go through an intermediate server they control that relays data from C. They control the CORS headers on their server, and can strip the CORS headers that come from C.<p>What am I missing?<p>PS: the Denon control page came out nice, I think [1] (well, except the centering of the &quot;Recheck status&quot; button looks off a bit...never noticed that before). It&#x27;s all flexbox layout that resizes reasonable, so it is quite usable on my iPhone, iPad, Surface Pro 4, and iMac.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;3tIhXUE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;3tIhXUE<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-25 19:53:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["minhoryang"],"id":[24273254],"kids":{},"parent":[24269609],"text":["Awesome work!

People then too thought that &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc was for the operating system manufacturer, and &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local was for the system administrator.  But in practice operating system <i>resellers<\/i> ended up putting their stuff in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local making it <i>also<\/i> something that system administrators touched at their peril, lest they break operating system upgrades.<p>Fourth, the article says &quot;You might even want to support a separate location for user-created services&quot;.

Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see much of a solution offered in the statement.<p>The biggest obstacle is not only eas of use. Companies as FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google etc solve also other problems, they also select and filter information for you. They don&#x27;t do it flawlessly, but still do quit a good job. One so far nobody else offers, because they are first movers in the space and now own the biggest networks.<p>Unfortunately their big centralized systems also creates the danger that comes with any big centralized source of information. There are always people that want it to put to good use for noble goals. And as it the human condition all power corrupts.<p>So in my  opinion it is never good to concentrate too much power in the hands of too few people. It does not really matter if it is big government or big business. It will always start working for conformity and limit free speech.<p>We already see this totalitarian nature in the censorship around Covid information. It started as a way to surpress legitimate misinformation. But it is now actually preventing and surpressing new research that challanges current medical dogmas. Big tech, is like big government. It just does not work that well, is risk averse and is favouring stability over inovation.<p>The question then is, how can we revitalize the old decentralized web ideal, with all it&#x27;s free information published  for all individuals? The old web only solved standardization of content with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It did not solve relationships and privacy between people.<p>Now has the time come to work on standards that connect people. To build networks of friends and to build trust networks like all social media now already does.<p>Technology is also still improving. While all people can&#x27;t type more stories, they only have each aimited amount of time for doing that, computers keep getting faster and faster, storage is keep getting cheaper and cheaper. So computer power is becoming a commodity with less and less value. Every day, it gets easier and cheaper to host data and search it.<p>Web space is cheap, so take Twitter, is it really that hard to publish a Twitter feed in a JSON file, use encryption to allow friends access to your feed data and publish that all on your own rented space that you fully control? Is it that hard to rank your own friends tweets in your own feed that runs on your rented computer power?<p>Advertisment as financing the computer rent is an option as well. Third parties can build services on top of the standardized data sets. Except that they can not lock you in, as it is your data. They just unlock it by providing search and filtering services while also include ads to make some bucks.<p>This open technology could also benefit existing alternative social networks, because it creates the needed network effect they need. Because by letting smaller parties work together without even knowing or agreeing with each other. Nobody controlls the network as everybody owns his own dataset. But can still connect to all other people who use the same data standard.<p>What is keeping us from building something like this?

Then we started working on the problem and realised we couldn’t possibly raise enough money to do so, then we did a crowdfunding campaign that never included the phone (we promised the alpha of an initial peer-to-peer Mac-based social networking client and promised to keep working on the problem, both of which we delivered on). Also, anyone who asked for a refund from the crowdfunding for any reason got one. If I could do it again, we wouldn’t have held the crowdfunding and I wouldn’t have started on Mac. But this was all part of the process of us learning about the problem.\n\n  - It wasn’t on Kick Starter, we built our own crowdfunding system because I wasn’t happy with how Kick Starter, etc., were gathering data (we didn’t want your privacy violated for trying to support us)\n\n  - Since then, I’ve sold the three family homes we had (apartments in Turkey, total worth about ~€200,000 or so) and we’ve kept working on the same problem for the past six&#x2F;seven years with the the initial crowdfunding + those funds + sales of our tracker blocker (Better Blocker) on Mac&#x2F;iOS + professional speaking fees when we speak at conferences, etc. + donations to our not-for-profit (which basically pay our hosting fees every month).\n\n  - Unless IndieWeb is suddenly about building single-tenant web nodes as part of a peer-to-peer future &#x2F; topologically decentralised Web for everyday people, I don’t see how it’s the same as Small Web. If that is what they’re about now, then sure but, last I checked, they thought we were deranged zealots for publicly calling out Google, Facebook, etc., for being surveillance capitalists. \n\n  - Re: not having done anything since: we created Better Blocker, I personally spoke at over 50 events to raise awareness of the issue, including three times at the European Parliament, I spearheaded the creation of progressive tech policy at one of Europe’s most progressive political movements, and we worked with the City of Ghent on evolving what is now Site.js and the Small Web initiative.\n\n  - Finally, someone mentioned that some “privacy projects” say “Don&#x27;t trust others, trust us.” If anyone tells you that, don’t trust them. We know how to, can, should be (and are) building technology where you don’t have to trust us.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAlso, PS:<p>Small Web is not about having your own Static Web page or having yet another tool for geeks. It’s not about going back to the 90s (been there, was fun, wouldn’t want to go back), it’s about taking the best of that ethos and implementing it for 2020 and beyond. Right now, I’m trying to build a tool for developers (including us) so that we can use it to build everything things for everyday people that don’t require a Faustian pact to give up your privacy, freedom of speech, or your personhood to use.<p>Whether or not this “succeeds”, who knows? But we’re sharing everything we make under AGPL and trying to share every brick in this bridge we’re trying to build between where we are (the sewer that is surveillance capitalism) and where we want to be in hopes that if the stuff we build doesn’t work, at least others can use the tools to build other solutions.<p>Here’s a recent talk if you’d like to learn more about what we’re working on:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;small-tech.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;eastern-partnership-civil-society-online-hackathon-2020&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;small-tech.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;eastern-partnership-civil-soci...<\/a><p>You don’t have to like what we do and you definitely don’t have to like me but I do hope that you will consider the ideas (and ideals) we’re working towards."],"time":["2020-08-25 12:24:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["renewiltord"],"id":[24275127],"kids":[24275193,24275182,24275827],"parent":[24273851],"text":["He genuinely seems like a guy who was just trying to help.

There is no way this will be economically viable in the short term.<p>Here&#x27;s what this is competing with:<p>Driving from Edmonton to Calgary, downtown to downtown, takes about 3 hours.  My car can do a round trip on a single tank of gas with enough left over to do a little running around.  The cost is about $60 in fuel, an unknown amount of wear-and-tear on the car, and three hours of time.  I&#x27;ve done this trip with four people, so that works out $25&#x2F;person assuming $40 worth of wear-and-tear on the car.  The depreciation and insurance costs are not a factor here since those happen regardless.<p>If you don&#x27;t own a car, but have a driver&#x27;s license, you can pick up a Communauto (our version of ZipCar&#x2F;Car2Go&#x2F;etc) and drive it down there.  This would probably cost less than $100, and Communauto includes fuel, insurance, and maintenance, but the cars in their fleet aren&#x27;t necessarily ones that I&#x27;d choose for a road trip.<p>The flight from Edmonton to Calgary takes about 45 minutes from takeoff to landing.  You need to arrive at the airport 1.5-2 hours before takeoff.  Plus you need to get to the airport at the start of your trip and to your destination at the end.  The cost is between $100 and $300 depending on how far you plan ahead, plus three hours of time.<p>There is currently no passenger rail service between Edmonton and Calgary.<p>There is bus service between the two cities.  Red Arrow runs between Edmonton and Calgary and isn&#x27;t too bad.  You still have to get to the bus terminal at the start and your destination at the end, but the terminals may be in walking distance if you&#x27;re going downtown to downtown.  The cost is $172 plus three hours of time.<p>To work, this needs to find the sweet spot of taking less time than driving, being less of an annoyance than air travel, and priced right to make up for its own set of shortcomings.  $25 per person plus three hours is a really tough price to beat."],"time":["2020-08-26 01:05:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GaryNumanVevo"],"id":[24276855],"kids":[24276984,24277968],"parent":[24276330],"text":["The Saudi funded Hyperloop project should be a good litmus test for Hyperloops around the world.

For example, the eigensystem of its adjacency matrix provides powerful understanding of a graph — but how much accuracy do you need in order to trust that understanding? If you need arbitrary precision because of the pathological features of a particular family of graph (expander graphs, say), and the scaling of the needed precision links directly to aspects of that graph pathology, this is really telling you that the eigenvector computation is not the most natural “computation basis” to approach this phenomenon — and some explicitly discrete algorithm would make this latent complexity relationship manifest. Probably individual instances of this kind of phenomena are well known to those who study the relevant structures, but I’m not sure if the general phenomena is described or modeled anywhere.<p>In some weird sense you can link this to a kind of “computational curvature” — ala some of Wolfram’s metamathematical musings. If one’s prior is to distrust continuous mathematics and see only discrete computational processes as “real”, it’s exactly the kind of phenomena one will be on the lookout for. Anyway, the curvature analogy is that as you attempt to maintain a particular computational basis for computing a phenomena of interest as its complexity scales, other typically-uncorrelated complexity requirements that are normally treated as constants will explode.

Many people are comparing themselves to the most privileged of backgrounds - where they were at the top from birth and only had to get a bit higher. I&#x27;m considered extraordinary in comparison to the place I grew up - just because of my background and where I am now.<p>On top of this - I am wary of being singly great at something. Living in Silicon Valley has reinforced this hard. I&#x27;m obviously comparing myself (unfairly) to people who are incredibly well compensated, maybe with some bullshit job title, and so forth. I&#x27;ve learned that - usually - those people are fucking terrible at everything else but that one thing they do. (Sometimes I&#x27;m not even sure what that one they do good at is - kiss ass?) I&#x27;m talking <i>really<\/i> bad at everything else. They might be an excellent programmer and think up some fancy architecture or whatever - but they don&#x27;t know how to install an app and follow some directions of their phone without some hand holding. Could they even build a computer from parts? Nah. Change oil in their car? It ain&#x27;t happening in a million years. COOK!? Sorry - I only order out, my nanny cooks for the family, eat company food, or put pizza rolls in the oven. Take care of my kids and be an inspiring role model?! No - no, sorry, I didn&#x27;t sign up for that... I had kids because I was bored after my second startup.
