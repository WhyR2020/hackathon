Where I worked in south London there was a junction on a hill where traffic coming down the hill wasn’t allowed to turn across the traffic coming up. There was a sign, but it wasn’t especially obvious. On a weekly basis there was a surveillance van with a camera that sat the fining people (later, through the post) if they broke the no turning rule.

How old? Partway down the page there&#x27;s a link called &quot;new developments&quot; that cites GHC 6.12, a version that came out in 2009!<p>Some thing it cites are still reasonably true, but others are complaints that reflect the Haskell of a different era. For example, it says, &quot;Even more unfortunate, the applicative functors were introduced to Haskell&#x27;s standard libraries only after monads and arrows, thus many types are instances of Monad and Arrow classes, but not as many are instances of Applicative.&quot; This has not been true for about half a decade, when Applicative was made a superclass of Monad. The article follows with: &quot;There is no special syntax for applicative functors because it is hardly necessary.&quot; This is also no longer true, since the introduction of ApplicativeDo: even if you don&#x27;t like it (and I confess I&#x27;m not a huge fan of ApplicativeDo myself!) it turns out that many people do find that sugar easier to write.<p>However, I think the key point I&#x27;d make is: all the advantages listed here of using monad without do-notation are real in some cases, but there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from <i>not<\/i> using do-notation sporadically! Occasionally a snippet that uses do-notation can be made much clearer by using &gt;&gt;= or some other monadic function, and occasionally a snippet that uses &gt;&gt;= can be made much clearer by using do-notation, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with Haskell keeping both. To make a Python analogy: sometimes you can express a given construct more clearly with a loop than with a list comprehension, but I don&#x27;t think that list comprehensions should be considered harmful: just use those tools when you need them, and don&#x27;t use them when you don&#x27;t need them!"],"time":["2020-04-29 09:34:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alephu5"],"id":[23016877],"kids":[23019082],"parent":[23015593],"text":["In terms of pedagogy I think there&#x27;s a valid argument that we shouldn&#x27;t teach beginners about the do notation until they&#x27;re comfortable with monads.

It&#x27;s probably better to use pure instead of return but that&#x27;s another debate.<p>In the same way I never tell python beginners about list comprehensions, we just do pedestrian loops.<p>In both cases, as you get comfortable and learn more you&#x27;ll naturally stumble across these features and a myriad of others.

So it doesn&#x27;t matter if the code above uses applicatives or monads, that&#x27;s just an optimization, as for all practical purposes the result should be the same, order of execution included.<p>Of course, code using Applicative instead of Monad is more generic, since you have less restrictions, you can work with more types and the function signatures become more clear in what they do (the more abstract they are, the less they can do), so that&#x27;s the primary reason for why Applicative is recommended whenever you can get away with it.

This had the obvious advantage that, combined with normalised state flowing downward through the component tree, you would never end up with stale bits of UI, as everything would all always be kept up to date.<p>However, tearing down and re-creating the whole DOM for every single render was prohibitively expensive, so the virtual DOM was born. But, and this seems to get lost in a lot of discussions of React, VDOM wasn&#x27;t some magical leap forward in UI rendering performance. It was a performance technique to make React&#x27;s paradigm possible. Possible, but not inherently fast, because there is still a cost to re-rendering every component for every event. Any React developer who&#x27;s had to add React.memo to half their components, and add visualisation to lists of just a few hundred items should know this.<p>Having written several substantial apps with both React and some of its competitor frameworks, I&#x27;m always amazed to see React-only developers continue to labor under the delusion than it is the fastest framework out there. It is not. Its paradigm is a beautiful one to develop with in most ways, but there is a significant price to pay in terms of performance."],"time":["2020-04-29 10:31:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davedx"],"id":[23016931],"kids":[23017156,23017640,23017013,23018050,23016979,23017023,23017252],"parent":[23004848],"text":["The React premature optimization train is leaving platform 1, all aboard for how to save 30 CPU cycles in your super complicated single page web app!<p>Memoizing a leaf component probably isn&#x27;t worth doing unless it has some incredibly complex logic in it.<p>Just like memoizing a single reduce operation probably isn&#x27;t worth it either.<p>The React community is the absolute worst offender for premature optimization.<p>Measure first, then optimize."],"time":["2020-04-29 10:50:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dham"],"id":[23018537],"kids":[23021477,23018559],"parent":[23004848],"text":["This is just crazy React devs have to think about this.

This is how it’s been from the beginning. It’s the first stage. Like we had with America Online &#x2F; MSN &#x2F; Compuserve.<p>But eventually organizations want to host their own software and own their own brand, database, relationships and so on. Maybe customize the experience and integrate it into their website.<p>In fact the Web itself came and replaced AOL and others with an open protocol (HTTP) where anyone can permissionlessly set up their own domain and host their own website.<p>The Feudalism of rentseeking corporations has been replaced with a free market of hosting companies, and trillions of dollars in wealth were unleashed.<p>Today, Wordpress plays that role for Web 1.0 (publishing) powering 34% of all websites. But what is out there that will power even Web 2.0 ... namely all the social networking and interactions we have come to expect from Facebook, Google, Telegram etc.?<p>Web browsers alrrady have all the front end capabilities including Web Push notifications and WebRTC videoconferencing and even PaymentRequest for payments etc.<p>There just needs to be a platform that lets people take ready-made components, like wordpress plugins, but Web 2.0  (chatrooms, events, etc.) that are all based around the same standardized unified core (user accounts, permissions, etc.) and are user friendly enough.<p>That’s basically an operating system. For example before MacOS&#x2F;Windows developers all built their own buttons&#x2F;menus&#x2F;windows etc. Before UNIX people built their own file management etc.<p>These OSes standardized the layer 1 so developers can just use standard buttons and reason on higher layers. Developers of Photoshop for Windows did not have to implement custom menus and buttons.\nAnd because of the standardized components, the users across apps were used to a common language, they knew what buttons and menus did, and even if the app used a custom version it had to be close enough to be recognizable.<p>So in this same way we need a social operating system for the web. Like Wordpress for Web 2.0 — open source and let anyone build their own Facebook or Google Meet out of reusable components. Ideally the core should be all designed together, like BSD, so the underlying OS is a good extensive foundation and not a hodgepodge of components.<p>Ok.

And if you want to have a secure user signup, forgot password, account management you just do:<p><pre><code>  Q.Users.login(options)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf you wanted to have events and schedule videoconferencing for various apps you build (eg group dating or collaboration) you would use<p><pre><code>  Q.Calendars.addToCalendar()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nReusable tools are placed like this:<p><pre><code>  Q.activate(\n    Q.Tool.setUpElement(\n      element,\n      “Streams&#x2F;chat”,\n      options\n    );\n  );\n<\/code><\/pre>\nor with jQuery:<p><pre><code>  $(element).tool(name)\n  .activate(options)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYou can have tools and subtools and pass options similar to React etc. <i>Our goal is to build a growing ecosystem of well tesed reusable components that anyone can use, even if they are not very technical<\/i>.<p>Check out the GitHub link. And especially the videos there. It’s totally free and open source. You can build something like Yang2020 in a day. We are using it for our clients, who want custom work done.<p>If you run into a snag or want to ask anything, just hit me up at <i>greg<\/i> at the domain <i>qbix.com<\/i><p>Finally... if you are a PHP or JS developer, and want to contribute to the project, please first try to install it yourself and play with with it. (We have tutorials but we are making more.) And email me. We have lots of clients who want these custom online communities right now, and we are looking to equip developers in diff countries to build them using this platform.<p>Oh and last thing... it’s interoperable with everything else so you’re not locked in. You can take a wordpress site that uses React and drop a chatroom or videoconferencd in there and gradually start to build community features, an app in the store and reward people for inviting others etc."],"time":["2020-04-29 15:44:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["draw_down"],"id":[23017809],"kids":{},"parent":[23017478],"text":["This is a space they probably should own by now, but they blew it by not having their messaging story together.

Here are some counterpoints:<p>1. Looking at NYC, the fatality rate is roughly 0.5%. This is based on a 20% positive antibody sample, which is getting large enough that the false positives aren’t overwhelming the data any longer.<p>2. If we take that as a given, then if 100% of the population becomes infected, we will have 1.5 million deaths. If we assume something more like 60%, then just one million people will die. If we lower the mortality rate to 0.3%, then maybe we are more like 750,000. I have a hard time believing it will be much lower, considering that 0.1% of NYC’s population has already died from covid-19<p>3. Additionally, if we give up on social distancing, then those people will die in a large wave, overwhelming our hospitals.<p>4. I would love to see a plan that keeps seniors safe and lets everyone else out. So far, that plan is not forthcoming. It’s hard to see how we keep them safe if their family living with them and their caregivers are all infected. So far, we’ve done a piss poor job of keeping them safe in senior living facilities, even with a lockdown.<p>5. On the comment that the same number of people will die with a flattened curve - that’s only true if hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, which may well still happen. Additionally, it turns out that the herd immunity point, where transmission drops below 1, is actually a function of the base transmission rate. We can actually reach herd immunity at a lower infection percentage if we are socially distanced, and thus avoid some of the deaths.<p>Ultimately, I think we will find ways to back off the lockdown, but health departments will be on the look-out and will be titrating the degree of lockdown as cases rise and fall. It’s hard to see e.g. restaurants getting back to anything close to full occupancy any time in the next year, and most of them don’t make enough profit per table to operate half-full (or less).<p>EDIT: additional point to add: yes, it seems that covid deaths will be heavily weighted to seniors. But so is mortality in general. Let’s roughly assume that the mortality rate for covid is 0.08% for 25-35 year olds. Guess what? The average annual mortality for 25-35 year olds is around 0.08%, so it will roughly DOUBLE if covid sweeps through the entire population this year.

Most estimates have focused on numbers of deaths, with little direct quantification of years of life lost (YLL) through COVID-19.  As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some have speculated that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number&#x2F;type of LTCs.<p>Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using standard WHO life tables, based on published age&#x2F;sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number&#x2F;type of LTCs to model likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. From these, we used routine UK healthcare data to estimate life expectancy based on age&#x2F;sex&#x2F;different combinations of LTCs. We then calculated YLL based on age, sex and type of LTCs and multimorbidity count.<p>Results: Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (13 and 11 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at =80 years, YLL was &gt;10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and &lt;3 years for people with =6).<p>Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More comprehensive and standardised collection of data on LTCs is needed to better understand and quantify the global burden of COVID-19 and to guide policy-making and interventions.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wellcomeopenresearch.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-75\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wellcomeopenresearch.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-75<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-30 15:05:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wheelerwj"],"id":[23029948],"kids":[23030687,23030102,23030807,23030610,23030108,23031180,23038099,23035524,23038916,23030134],"parent":[23025044],"text":["&gt; I’m a software &#x2F; site reliability engineer<p>okay, thanks.<p>Seriously, the list of scientist and medical organizations advising through this period is so long, I don&#x27;t know why anyone who isn&#x27;t at equally experienced tries to counter-claim their insights.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t do our own research and arrive at our own conclusion, but if you arrive at a different conclusion, you&#x27;re almost certainly the one whose incorrect.

I think you should maybe specify (or point out to me where you state this if I missed it, i&#x27;m not a careful reader) what kind of timeframe you believe that the combination of lack of capacity and missing out on preventive measures would start to lead to more deaths and indicate where you think we would reach pareto efficiency.

Ask yourself, if the fatality rate is 1% on average, but 10% for black people, will you still call for opening the economy\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;why-its-so-freaking-har...<\/a><p>3) Repeated references to comparison with influenza, but not mention of the massive R0 differences between the two [3]. Influenza has a R0 of 1.3, while COVID is estimated to have an Ro of 5.5. And this matters, because now COVID is not only more fatal, but is also spreads faster. Both the denominator and numerator are deadlier for COVID, which is a compounding factor that the article doesn&#x27;t discuss at all. if 20% of US population get impacted, we will have a death toll of 600K at 1% fatality rate. That will be 10x than that of the worst strain of influenza. \n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;7&#x2F;20-0282_article\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;7&#x2F;20-0282_article<\/a><p>4) There are a lot of reference to negative externalities of lockdown [without much data to back-up], but no mention of the positive ones.

The linked article and current situation are very different. People are isolating from others, but they are very much spending more quality time with their loved ones. I don&#x27;t see any data on spike in depression during this period, and anecdotal evidence suggests that people are refreshing their relationship with their loved ones.<p>6) Section 4 presents a half baked plan of &quot;opening&quot; up without broader discussion of trade-offs and implications. For example, opening up but encouraging &quot;at-risks&quot; group to self quarantine. This is not how US workplaces work. Let&#x27;s stay I am a at-risk worker with chronic lung disease, but I also work at a factory floor and my health insurance is through my employer. How am I supposed to self-quarantine when my employer will simply ask me to show up and if I don&#x27;t I will lose my job and insurance ? And there won&#x27;t be any government dollars to support<p>7) There is no discussion on how we can support the re-opening without ability to test people at scale. How will you know that the server at a restaurant or your gym instructor is not infected without massive upgrades to testing infrastructure ?<p>These are some basic observations from the article. I can keep going as every paragraph in this article has some questionable conclusions.

In your comments you also seem to conflate pandemic flu with seasonal flu, so I would suggest using &quot;seasonal flu&quot; if that is what you mean to avoid confusion. I think there are compelling arguments for ending the lockdown while still believing it is 10x worse than the flu. I don&#x27;t like conflating the points myself, and rather prefer to just look at the actual IFR&#x2F;R0 numbers.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this warrants a section, but I will say that I believe that the issue you discuss in this article is the lockdown, which is a political discussion. You have a lot of people on here asking for your credentials, or asking if you are an epidemiologist or virologist. While scientists can help inform us as a society on things like the IFR and R0, at the end of the day the core item under discussion here is a societal choice. In the US as a society appear to make a decision that infectious disease deaths up to about 70,000 people annually (a bad seasonal flu)  do not warrant any official lockdown measures. The question of the threshold for various political responses is in fact a political question, not a question for virologists, therefore is the domain of all citizens.

Part of the reason is that we&#x27;re all sitting at home mildly bored and frustrated with the sudden restrictions on our life.<p>My general attitude is that I understand people are afraid and considering I don&#x27;t like scaring people, I&#x27;m open to adapting to their needs right now and am trying to be mindful. So, doing the right thing for me is not blaming people for being irrational and trying to adapt to their emotional needs.<p>However, I am very worried about the self inflicted economic pain and misery and how that is going to affect me personally as well as people I care about. E.g. my parents are retired and already had their pension devalued a few times in the last decade. Stuff like this is likely to cause more cuts. They are well off regardless but there are many pensioners who get to ride out their remaining years&#x2F;decades with a significant cut in income and no chance to fix that. Stuff like this happens when we trigger a global recession&#x2F;depression out of fear.<p>Another thing that I observe happening is that lockdown policies and the resulting bureaucracy, constantly changing rules, etc. are by and large coming from people who are interpreting what they are hearing from others. A few weeks ago when everything was extremely scary this was understandable. But we&#x27;re past that now.<p>Most of what they hear is either without much scientific basis&#x2F;merit, severely watered down&#x2F;dumbed down pseudo scientific babble, or worse flat out wrong information.<p>Also these decision makers have agendas that go beyond trying to do the right thing. E.g. a lot of politicians have enormous egos and are under a lot of pressure to be seen doing something. Add populism to the mix or overzealous anti vaxers, and you have a perfect storm of mass hysteria and a lot of completely pointless policy. Add lawyers to the mix, and you get a lot of ass coverage on top. Bureaucrats when faced with demands raining down from the top, oblige by coming up with lots of rules and demands for more budget. Politicians oblige, and you get more of the same.<p>So, a scientist might say something like \n&quot;Sure, whatever, go wear a non medical mask if it makes you feel good. It might even help though I&#x27;m not aware of any studies to that effect. But go knock yourself out. &quot;<p>In the hands of bureaucrats that turns into the police issueing crippling fines for small businesses tolerating customers without masks in their shops. This is actually happening in Germany. In France people have to print a form stating their intentions when leaving their house and the police is very busy enforcing that. In Sweden, restaurants are open as normal and the government seems to have shown some restraint with imposing measures. France got hit really hard early on but is now improving. Germany and Sweden are largely fine already. Germany has enjoyed a widely published low death rate despite being quite late with locking down. The point is, they are doing widely different things (including doing nothing) with more or less similar outcomes. It&#x27;s fine. The world is not ending.<p>IMHO we are well prepared in case this virus comes back. We&#x27;ll detect it earlier, act more decisively and hopelessly less stupidly. So, lift the restrictions and allow people to self restrain and decisively act locally based on testing&#x2F;incidents&#x2F;common sense."],"time":["2020-04-30 14:42:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sadalienvulcan"],"id":[23030081],"kids":{},"parent":[23025044],"text":["In the &quot;Debunking the claim that it’s “just the economy”&quot; section of the original post [0], the author is arguing that &quot;economic damage leads to lives lost&quot;. But the kind of economic damage this causes doesn&#x27;t have to. The reason it does is a result of the policy decisions our governments make.<p>The author references a study from LSE [1a], saying:<p>&gt; Their analysis focuses on the UK, but they conclude that maintaining lockdown in the UK beyond June 1 will lead to a net reduction in wellbeing-years.<p>The referenced paper weighs up the benefits of lifting the lockdown at a particular point in time vs the costs of extending it. They do this using a metric called wellbeing-years. They list the possible positive and negative outcomes of lifting the lockdown then convert these into wellbeing-years. These are used to calculate the total value of lifting the lockdown at the start of May, June, July and September. They summarise these findings in Table 4 of the paper [1b]. It shows that there will be negative total value to maintaining the lockdown beyond 1st June, as the original post says.<p>Table 4 suggests the highest cost of lockdown is reduced incomes and the reduction in wellbeing it brings [1b]. But surely the UK government could increase their income support so that there is no loss in wellbeing? This would change the balance of the cost-benefit analysis considerably (and maybe saving lives is worth the money).<p>So how much would this cost then? In Appendix 2 [1c], they calculate that £750,000 of lost income is worth 7.5 wellbeing-years (one year of a persons life at the average wellbeing of 7.5&#x2F;10). This implies that a single wellbeing-year is worth £100,000 of lost income. Looking at Table 4, lifting the lockdown in September instead of May would cause reductions in income equivalent to (48+66+86+103)<i>10,000 = 303,000 wellbeing-years. That represents £100,000 <\/i> 303,000 = £30.3 billion in lost income we&#x27;d need to make up.<p>Luckily, the 6 wealthiest people in the UK are worth a combined £39.4 billion [2]. Repatriating that wealth and distributing it as income relief would completely remove the negative impact of lost income. Doing so would tip the balance in favour of extending lockdown to 1st September. This is important because lifting the lockdown in September rather than May would result in 145,000 fewer COVID-19 deaths [1d].<p>Using that papers analysis to justify ending the UKs lockdown early is akin to saying: I value preserving the private wealth of 6 people over the lives of 145,000 others.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ryankemper.io&#x2F;post&#x2F;2020-04-29-the_case_for_ending_lockdown&#x2F;#debunking-the-claim-that-it-s-just-the-economy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ryankemper.io&#x2F;post&#x2F;2020-04-29-the_case_for_endin...<\/a>\n[1a]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf<\/a>\n[1b]: Results, Table 4, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf#page=10\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf#page...<\/a>\n[1c]: Appendix 2, &quot;The monetary value of Life-Years&quot;, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf#page=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf#page...<\/a>\n[1d]: Section 3.6, &quot;COVID-19 Deaths&quot;, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf#page=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cep.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;download&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;op049.pdf#page...<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;03&#x2F;uk-six-richest-[2]\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;03&#x2F;uk-six-richest-...<\/a>: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;03&#x2F;uk-six-richest-people-control-as-much-wealth-as-poorest-13m-studypeople-control-as-much-wealth-as-poorest-13m-study\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;03&#x2F;uk-six-richest-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-30 14:26:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chente"],"id":[23025540],"kids":[23025593,23025895,23028186],"parent":[23025044],"text":["Everyone is an epidemiologist in a pandemic."],"time":["2020-04-30 00:55:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sunkenvicar"],"id":[23029506],"kids":{},"parent":[23025044],"text":["Thanks for the article.

From wikipedia: Dematerialization refers to the absolute or relative reduction in the quantity of materials required to serve economic functions in society.<p>The idea is that as a country becomes more developed and prosperous, the less resources are required to serve the needs of the people. For instance: Between 1977 and 2001, the amount of material required to meet all needs of Americans fell from 1.18 trillion pounds to 1.08 trillion pounds. The incredible thing is that this seems to be a reduction in absolute resources not resources per populace. Much of that reduction is due to technology (e.g. a cell phone replaced plastic from camcorder, camera, computer etc). The other is due to production efficiencies and migration to cities . A similar trend can be seen with carbon reduction in developed parts of the world.<p>I&#x27;m not 100% convinced by this idea, but it&#x27;s enough for me to question the premise that economic growth leads to more resource consumption.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dematerialization_(economics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dematerialization_(economics)<\/a><p>[Edit] There&#x27;s a great interview with Andrew McAfee on this concept at EconTalk.

It&#x27;s hard to learn something in your own time if you&#x27;re not feeling excited or motivated about it.<p>For myself, I started with HTML and CSS, and had a lot of fun with that. Then when I decided it was time to learn JS, I hit a brick wall. I almost quit then and there thinking programming was not for me. But I was also determined to do something different with my life than I was currently doing. So I switched gears and jumped into Ruby on Rails. Ruby really clicked with me in a way that JS did not, perhaps because it was somewhat more readable and less syntax getting in my way. I got into it enough that I signed up for an online bootcamp. That&#x27;s a whole different story but the short of it is I learned Ruby on Rails and that enabled me to get a job at some point soonish thereafter.<p>And you know what? In the end I came back to Javascript and I actually enjoy working in the frontend (with typescript mostly now) more than the backend side of things. I think maybe Ruby taught me how to rewire my brain for programming and then Javascript felt a lot more friendlier than it had previously. It&#x27;s a lot of the same paradigms, just re-wrapped in different syntax.<p>I guess, my point is, try to start somewhere, but don&#x27;t be afraid of exploring.

Along comes company B, which needs to fill a Position A which you perfectly fit in. And assume they can pay $150K&#x2F;yr to fill this position. But if you are like any average employee, a 10-15% increase in your salary can and will make you jump ship.<p>So, if they announce $150K&#x2F;yr compensation on the kb listing, your brain will switch to 50% increase mode and knowing that you can get this much from them, you will most probably not settle for something less. On the other hand, let&#x27;s assume the salary is not in the job listing and you get to the interview and asked the dreaded question, &quot;What is your expectation of a yearly compensation for this position?&quot; I am sure you will dance around a bit saying things like &quot;Market rate&quot; or &quot;I am sure you will pay me in accordance with industry norms&quot; etc. but when the push comes to the shove, you will give them a figure like $120K, a 20% increase if you will, on your current salary, to give yourself a wiggle room. And if they are like any average employer, they will low-ball you a bit to see what you are amenable to and come back with something like $116K. You are happy that you&#x27;ve got 16% raise while 10% would suffice you to jump ship. The new employer saved $34K&#x2F;yr on you. Only you by the way and this practice can be multiplied many, many times, ending up with a huge chunk of change.<p>On the flip side, let&#x27;s assume you were making $160K at your current position and you came to the interview to wrangle say, a $175K salary. When you say that, first they will dismiss your candidacy and look for someone cheaper.

That said, the things I&#x27;ve seen defy description.  Things like your entire product line suspended overnight without cause, recourse or a clear and immediately actionable path to recovery.

Even better:  People leaving reviews <i>before<\/i> they receive the product they purchased, then they cancel the order and it never goes out.  I mean, think about it, as an example, say you buy a weight loss product.  How can Amazon&#x27;s software allow <i>anyone<\/i>, even an actual buyer, to leave a product review <i>before<\/i> they receive it?  How can they allow it a week after they get it?<p>Here&#x27;s a nice one:  You manufacture your own product (not a Chinese one-in-a-thousand-copies private label product).  In other words, you are the sole source and the sole retailer of the product.  Nobody else makes it and nobody else is authorized to sell it.  Amazon has no protections against some scammer claiming they sell your product.  What happens is someone buys from one of these scammers and either get a box full of rocks, something totally different or a bad quality copy of your legitimate product.  Whats worse is <i>you<\/i> are left to answer for what happened and <i>your<\/i> reputation, seller and product scores suffer due to the bad reviews.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of no protection against competitors attacking your ads within Amazon.  They have a pay-per-click system.  You set a daily budget.  Competitors will pay offshore click farms to click on the competition&#x27;s ads while everyone in key markets are sleeping.  By the time your potential customers wake up your ad budget is gone and you produce zero sales for your money.<p>I could go on.

There are many new Iterm2 features over the last few years that make tmux unecessary IMO.<p>- Iterm2 can now restore sessions, even partially after a reboot (attempts to recreate workspaces). This was the main benefit of tmux for me.<p>- Iterm2 can also have a visual mode to browse your scrollback buffer, and there are some shortcuts similar to vim. This was the second main benefit of tmux for me.<p>- It&#x27;s less keybindings to remember and configure.<p>- Iterm2 can better size your split panes. You can also change text size per pane. Useful for wide text.<p>- A bunch of other things that iterm2 does better when tmux is not open. Autocomplete. Paste history. Instant replay. Some of these are quite gimmicky TBH, but could be useful for some.<p>- Text, colors, etc... appear sharper without tmux. I think. There are antialiasing configs you can mess around with in Iterm2 at least.<p>- Shell integration. Jump to your last shell prompts in scrollback. Highlight all your prompts in all your panes. \nThen move to those panes with your mouse without clicking.
