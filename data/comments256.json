If there&#x27;s only light rain I&#x27;ll open pockets to get unimpeded air flow, which makes a big difference.

In addition, breathability is hampered by the fabric&#x27;s pores being clogged by dirt, body oils, and just the fabric wetting out. As such, most fabrics are treated with some DWR coating. But the DWR coating wears off over time and at-home treatments never seemed to match what came from the factory.<p>Roughly a decade ago, eVent was supposed to be the wünderfabrik; and it did offer more breathability than Gore-Tex by omitting a PU layer. However the PU layer also prevented body oils from logging up the breathable membrane, so ultimate eVent jackets would stop being breathable if you didn&#x27;t keep them clean.<p>Polartec Neoshell was also a runner up, but it never caught on big time; I think due to durability issues.<p>Right now, Gore-Tex Shakedry is the talk around town, but I haven&#x27;t worn anything using it and stopped caring.

In C. Why? Because I&#x27;m quite familiar with it and because it allowed me to focus on the problem rather than on the language that I was writing in (the problem is - for me at least - a very hard one). The codebase has steadily grown, at some point it was 7K lines, then I cleaned it up and refactored it back down to about 5500 right now. At some future date it will be - hopefully - finished and I may use it to power applications and&#x2F;or services. It&#x27;s super efficient both memory and speed wise compared to what the competition is doing but that&#x27;s just a side effect. That side effect does allow for some applications that would otherwise be impossible.<p>The code takes one file and outputs another, it&#x27;s a classical &#x27;unix filter&#x27; and it relies on a couple of very high performance libraries that others provided, battle tested and ready to be plugged in. As the project matures I come across the occasional wart in the language, something that I know I could have done more elegantly in a language with richer constructs (lists, list comprehensions, that sort of thing).<p>What surprised me most after working on this project for a couple of months though is how well the language fits the problem, that&#x27;s something that I did not really think would be the case when I started out with it. But as time passes and things &#x27;find their place&#x27; it is indeed just like the author writes, I - still - love coding in C.

I&#x27;m currently in a C phase after having spent quite some time writing interpreters in C++.<p>The most common issue I see in C codebases is excessive memory allocation. In most other languages, allocating a chunk per instance is the only way, though the  implementation likely does some kind of pooling&#x2F;slab allocation behind the scenes. In C you have the freedom to arrange your allocations any way you feel like, and treat any segment of N bytes as a value of size N. As an example, most collections (vectors, sets, maps etc); tend to only work with pointers; which is a huge missed opportunity.<p>My two favorite kinds of collections in C are embedded linked lists [0] and deques. One reason is they both provide stable pointers (which is the main disadvantage of vectors), the other that they minimize the number of memory allocations.<p>I recently implemented a pool allocated deque library [1] in C that uses embedded linked lists to keep track of memory blocks and provides value semantics, which I hope will make my interpreters easier to implement as well as increase performance.

For the Koch curve, the Hausdorff dimension is ln(4)&#x2F;ln(3) = log_3(4) approximately 1.2619.[2] This is because for each iteration of the curve&#x27;s construction, the perimeter of the curve grows by a factor of 4 while the area enclosed by the curve only grows by a factor of 3.

The article, incidentally, notes this for Edge, then suggesting using `@supports not (background-blend-mode: normal)`. I would suggest considering (whether you decide to do it or not) using progressive enhancement rather than graceful degradation, putting any necessary fallback in place by default, and adding the blending functionality in `@supports (background-blend-mode: normal)` instead: this will make it work for IE, which doesn’t support @supports. Plenty of people still use IE, and it’s generally desirable to structure things to support it where there is no particular cost to doing so. (I’m <i>not<\/i> suggesting pandering to IE; for my own stuff now, I make sure the content will still be accessible, but care naught about the accuracy of its formatting.)<p>Next, blending is one of the buggier areas of browsers, an area where it’s common to encounter serious bugs (because GPUs are awful, mostly).

I&#x27;ve always liked that definition, and it seems accurate to me based on historical evidence (PCs - definitely a platform. Smartwatches - definitely not).<p>In this test, the airpods fail abysmally - not only do they not allow for revenue generation today, they don&#x27;t even allow for third party developers to use their hardware features in any capacity. In fact, the main use-case for airpods appears to be efficiency and convenience when combined with Siri. All three &quot;sources&quot; described by the article fail to define for me the benefit users will gain from airpods as a platform, and instead have done an excellent job of convincing me that users will benefit far more from treating airpods as a product.<p>Compounding this is the fact that most computing platforms are primarily visual in their interactions with their users - this is clearly no coincidence. Visual interfaces allow developers to surface many pieces of information at once, and they allow users to absorb information at a pace that is variable (based on context) and comfortable to them. Aural platforms don&#x27;t have this capability, and the context that they assume is often wrong. For example,  I&#x27;ve been driving a lot these past few days, and one of the worst Apple-built experiences I&#x27;ve ever had occurred when I needed to stop for gas. Not only was I directed to a gas station I had already passed (driving on the freeway), but when I wanted to navigate to another gas station there was no way (obvious or not) for me to tell Siri to find me a gas station ahead of me. In fact, there was no way to confirm where any of the gas stations Siri found me were in relation to me, without looking at my screen.<p>One more thing: Aural platforms are exclusively serial. They surface one piece of information at a time, and in fact they would be less usable if they surfaced any more than that (or surfaced each piece of information any quicker).

I call it the TKPV ladder. Each letter represents what you provide in return for compensation.<p>T stands for time. At this level, your client pays you by the hour, day, week, or even minute. Your value is measured by the time you put in. This is the lowest rung of the ladder. While you have some control over your allocation of time (as opposed to with an actual job) this is not really much different in principle than working at Walmart or Starbucks. You are a wage slave.<p>The next step up on the ladder is K, which stands for knowledge. If you can promote your relationship with your clients to this rung, your value becomes the knowledge, experience and ability you bring to the table, which is measured by its value to the company, not by the number of minutes you&#x27;ve slaved at a task.<p>The next rung on the ladder is P, which stands for product. At this stage, you transition from selling knowledge and talent to selling a specific product or service that wraps up the knowledge and talent that you and your team have acquired into something you can sell to a customer, hopefully without too much customization. And then sell to another customer, and so on. If you reach this stage, you have productized your value in such a way that you can produce and sell it at scale.<p>The final rung in the ladder is V, for vision. At this level, you take your vision for future products and services to people who are in a position to provide you capital and support to expand and scale your reach to its maximum potential.<p>In my Consulting business, when I deal with clients, I try to keep this hierarchy, TKPV in mind, with the goal of moving up the ladder at every opportunity."],"time":["2019-12-26 18:25:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dustinmoris"],"id":[21890046],"kids":{},"parent":[21883625],"text":["You overthink it.

If a potential customer would only accept continuous work with no vacation, I imagine I&#x27;d pass.

Several of my aunts and uncles have been doing this for years. I grew up in these sorts of shops. You can&#x27;t do it anymore.<p>The 1980s don&#x27;t seem that long ago, but back then there was not nearly the variety of foreign cuisines that there are now in the west. At the time you could still conceivably go to a Chinese restaurant for an &quot;experience meal&quot; where you would either enjoy some slightly different cooking, or bring a date or business connection. It even felt right that the owner&#x27;s kids were running around, and there were kitsch pictures from China on the walls.<p>Back then the entry cost was very very low. You had either only family or other recent immigrant staff. You&#x27;d spend nearly nothing on the interior.<p>Nowadays that style of restaurant serves a very small segment of the market. Basically, it&#x27;s the people in the area - not the town centre - that don&#x27;t want to cook that night and didn&#x27;t have Chinese the night before. They don&#x27;t care about the decor, many of them do takeaway. They don&#x27;t care about authenticity either. And they are well aware that this style of food is unhealthy in large quantities.<p>If you&#x27;re going to open a restaurant these days, it needs a degree of slickness. People expect it, heck even I expect it. You can&#x27;t have a bunch of spelling mistakes on your self-printed menus. You can&#x27;t be showing tourist quality photos of the food, with plastic place mats and different cobbled together chairs. Plus people now care not only about general healthiness but also specific things like allergies and intolerances that your foreign chef might find hard to communicate about.<p>The competitive landscape is also changed completely. You&#x27;re not competing with just other mom and pop stores. There&#x27;s not only McDonald&#x27;s, which was always a thing, but actual Chinese food chains that do what you do, better.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t know anyone who actively desired for their kids to take over.

I do enjoy meat and cooking dishes like slow roasted meats but I started eating beyond meat&#x2F;fake meats in 2019 and loved them. In a couple of dishes I literally couldnt tell the difference. I think when things get to the point where they taste as good&#x2F;better than the product they&#x27;re intended to replace, why not embrace them? I still like meat and am not seeking to become fully vegetarian but will definitely cut down to just 1-2 times a week, high quality butcher&#x2F;organic meat and reduce my impact on the planet in some small way.<p>- Go completely cashless. I was just about there in achieving this in a couple of months in 2019. It&#x27;s not a hugely difficult challenge but I think it&#x27;s a fun one to try and it&#x27;s very doable these days. Starting Jan 1st I&#x27;m going to see how far I can make it without holding real money.<p>- Take more 3-4 day weekends and travel more. I live in a city with great public transport and don&#x27;t own a car so it can be tough to travel without thinking you have to take 2+ weeks off from work, but renting a car for a weekend is trivially cheap if you plan ahead a little bit (&lt;$100 including gas).<p>- The usuals of trying to get fit, lose a few pounds, more regular gym. Need to find some way of making the gym fun as I really don&#x27;t have any interest in it even though I know it&#x27;s good for me.<p>- Make more music.

Same for steel, dishwashing soap, telephones and shoes. Trabants instead of Toyotas, and less of them. Protectionism came with a high efficiency cost, and that meant poverty.<p>Today&#x27;s digital economy can be very different. The relationship between incoming revenue and outgoing expenses is often arbitrary and that means efficiency is squishy. If Toyota had to operate on half it&#x27;s current budget, Toyota would produce half as many cars.

It’s an incredible book and talks at length about the issue in the article.<p>A word about this:<p>“What technology and trade have done, however, is displace millions of Americans from their middle-class jobs, and send them hurtling down the income ladder into less remunerative occupations.”<p>It’s not that simple. It’s not just trade and technology.<p>The causes of the erosion of good middle-class jobs are extremely complex. I’ll talk about just one here, since I don’t have too much time:<p>Tax law works to advantage higher tier workers over middle class workers. It costs much less in payroll taxes to hire a single superskilled worker at extremely high compensation than it does to hire a bunch of mid skill workers at middle class comp.<p>Quoting from the book:<p>“A simple example illustrates the special burden that the payroll tax imposes specifically on middle-class labor. If a bank deploys midcentury financial technologies to issue home mortgages using twenty mid-skilled loan officers who each earn $100,000 per year, this costs the bank and the workers, taken together, $306,000 in payroll taxes. By contrast, if the bank were to switch to the current mode of production and displace the mid-skilled loan officers with a single Wall Street trader who earns $2 million, this would cost the bank and the trader only about $90,000.<p>“Where two technologies of production are economically equivalent, but one requires twenty mid-skilled workers while the other requires one super-skilled worker, the mid-skilled approach currently faces an average payroll tax rate over 10 percentage points higher than the meritocratic approach, which produces an aggregate payroll tax burden over three times as great.<p>“The payroll tax, in other words, substantially suppresses mid-skilled employment and wages and fosters super-skilled employment and wages. (Indeed, if the super-skilled worker can get capital gains treatment for her income, by styling it as founder’s shares or carried interest, the income tax adds a further bias, on the order of 20 percentage points.)”"],"time":["2019-12-26 22:14:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["derision"],"id":[21885587],"kids":[21885656,21888182],"parent":[21885111],"text":["I&#x27;d rather work in walmart than work in a German factory like my grandfather did.

For  example, in  2002  copyright industries alone contributed approximately 6%,  or  $626  billion, to  America’s gross  domestic product, and employed 4% of America’s workforce, according to an economic study commissioned by the International Intellectual Property Alliance. As the nation continues to shift from an industrial economy to an information-based economy, the assets of the country are increasingly based in intellectual property. In recognition of  this  trend,  the  Department of  Justice is  waging the  most  aggressive campaign against the theft and counterfeiting of intellectual property in its history. The priority of criminal intellectual property investigations and prosecutions nationwide has been increased, and additional resources on both the prosecutive and investigative levels have been brought to bear on the growing problem of intellectual property theft. Effective  prosecution of  intellectual property  crime, however,  also  requires  substantial assistance from its victims..&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;olp&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ip_task_force_report.pdf#page=63\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;olp&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ip_task...<\/a><p>From:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopfakes.gov&#x2F;welcome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopfakes.gov&#x2F;welcome<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-26 17:59:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RcouF1uZ4gsC"],"id":[21882934],"kids":[21883377],"parent":[21879882],"text":["I wonder how much Trump really hates Bezos.<p>If Trump really does hate Bezos, he could go on TV and give a national address stating that Amazon has repeatedly been facilitating the illegal import of dangerous products from China.

After getting burnt out on my startup, I spent about half a year traveling and trying out other hobbies not doing any coding at all.<p>When I got back to it I felt a little bit lost as to what to do, but doing these things helped me get back into the habit:<p>- Find a good project-oriented book and just follow along. In my case this was &quot;Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles&quot;, but according to your interests and skill-levels there&#x27;s plenty of good project-oriented books out there. I think this is good to do in parallel with your own side projects, because it gives you structure that the writers gave some pedagogical thought towards, and will thus help you gain confidence by solving problems and building something substantial over several weeks or months. This confidence will then put you in a better headspace for your self-directed work.<p>Don&#x27;t engage in the online tutorials, where the author maybe wrote in a couple hours over a weekend. Instead, find well-respected books and courses that the authors poured serious effort into and that people consistently cite as having been influential to them.<p>- Read and engage with activities besides programming. I think one problem beginning programmers have is that they get so obsessed with just consuming programming related content. While the concentrated education you&#x27;ll get out of this is great, from my experience reading about programming and tech doesn&#x27;t lead to interesting ideas about things to make. What I think does lead to interesting ideas is cultivating curiosity about the world, and feeding it through reading and exploring.<p>- Study good software. In most creative disciplines there&#x27;s a huge emphasis on studying the works of the masters of the art. This is so students can 1) understand the discipline&#x27;s history and 2) develop good taste. The creation of software, whether you view it from a coding angle or from a UI angle, is mostly a design discipline. So taste matters a lot. I recommend studying the history of computing and finding good old artifacts to study(history is good because the excitement the pioneers felt might rub off on you, and help you see the field from a fresh perspective). Any software that you personally enjoy using is worth studying like this, but I think paying attention to the classics helps too.<p>- Learn how to design. This might seem like a distraction, but improving your design skills even just a bit can really help with making your ideas more engaging. The design community also has a lot of practices and advice on how to come up with good ideas that are worth seeking out.<p>- Find creators whose work you enjoy, follow them, and study their work. The most creative and prolific people I know all have one or more creators who were massive inspirations for them, and that they obsessed over and often spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to emulate. Too much focus on the copying part can be a hindrance in the short term, but being sensitive to these chains of inspiration, and seeking out who inspired the people who inspired you, can lead you down interesting paths. Find networks of creatives locally, on Twitter, slack groups, wherever, and engage with them, and contextualize your work in their framework(whether it&#x27;s startups, art, or anything).<p>- Read up on creativity! IMO while self-help and pop-psychology books&#x2F; can be counterproductive if you spend too much time in them, in small doses they can be useful for analyzing your habits and practices. I recommend reading visakanv&#x27;s threads about these topics: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;a-list-of-visakanv-s-threads-1a6ed25cf06e49e388a303903d597b73\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;a-list-of-visakanv-s-threads-1a6ed25cf...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-25 04:57:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["santa_boy"],"id":[21876518],"kids":{},"parent":[21861412],"text":["This is a very common problem.

Don&#x27;t concern yourself with making this something that people will actually use, or something that could potentially make money, or the next Facebook. Just stop. You&#x27;re never going to actually build anything if you keep second guessing whether or not it&#x27;s a good thing to build. Instead, just acknowledge that your goal is to build <i>something<\/i> and to learn from it and have fun building it. If it turns out that your app becomes &quot;real&quot;, then that is a huge bonus! But focusing on that as a priority is just going to be a blocker for you.<p>Second, if you are in a position where you are trying to &quot;learn&quot; new skills, then I would actually advise against starting with trying to build your Spotify&#x2F;MapBox idea. Instead, pick an already existing something that either a) you already know a lot about or b) is a common app that people build (like a blog site or a reddit&#x2F;HN clone). I know that sounds frustrating and not ideal, but I went through the same ordeal and it helped <i>a lot<\/i>. The reason for this is that there are <i>tons<\/i> of good tutorials for building something like a blog or social network site with all kinds of tech stacks, so that will help. The other reason is because you already have a feature roadmap laid out for you, and this will help get past the analysis paralysis.<p>For example, you can build an HN clone and just start off small by building the front page which links to other news sites. Then you add a login system. Then add comments. Then add points and ranking. Each step is small enough to actually be feasible, but probably tough enough that it will teach you new aspects (such as teaching you how to do logins correctly, or how to store comments effectively in a database, etc). <i>And<\/i> at each step, you still have the opportunity to add your own improvements as you see fit, so even though you are essentially building an HN clone, you can still add your own flair to it and explore your own personal interests.<p>I did the above, and I found that it was <i>immensely<\/i> helpful in actually getting past the analysis paralysis stage that it sounds like you are stuck at. After I built a simple news aggregator clone, I found that the process had taught me enough to then actually build one of my own personal ideas, and because I now had the foundational knowledge from building the earlier &#x27;simpler&#x27; app, it was much easier to get a jump start on my own app."],"time":["2019-12-25 04:29:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["james_s_tayler"],"id":[21878385],"kids":{},"parent":[21861412],"text":["Something I have found really great is to purposely build something you will never ever even be remotely tempted to ship but that has some degree of complexity to it.

If there is another project that does a lot of what you want to do, porting it to a different language would be a good exercise.<p>After that, think of an idea of something you want to use, and then try to pick off a small part of it. Working with the Spotify API, maybe just try to build something that lets you list your playlists, or maybe just one playlist. Then, build out one more piece, and continue doing so.<p>Though, one thing I will say: Working with 3rd APIs is often much harder than just building out something that doesn&#x27;t rely on them, due to having to implement authentication. So if you have a hobby idea that doesn&#x27;t rely on a 3rd party API, I would bias towards that for your first project.<p>See if you can find a friend or someone to discuss ideas in more depth. Having that second opinion can help unstick you, or help refine your ideas.

If you like backend webapps, Python, Go, or JS&#x2F;Node will start to stand out.<p>If you take a left turn, and decide to instead go into desktop apps (I highly recommend making at least one or two in your life, but no rush), C# or Java might look attractive.<p>My overall point with the last two paragraphs is this: Learn tech that will let you build what you want to make, not just because it has a lot of articles written about it."],"time":["2019-12-25 04:36:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davismwfl"],"id":[21861461],"kids":[21869114,21876764],"parent":[21861412],"text":["If you are wanting to pick up Vue, choose node.js and start with the basic tutorial on setting up your project and project organization.

To get moving I like to pick a piece of functionality.  In this case, login could be a good place to start.  Whether you want to use third party auth or roll your own, it is a good place to start.  Get login and state management working because once you have that running you can start implementing other functionality pretty fast.<p>The key is to pick a piece of functionality that does two things, one: simple but once completed is a component you&#x27;ll need for your project, two: at the end of implementing that functionality there is something that works which you can build off.

For every choice you can make as a developer there are pros and cons. This language or that one. This framework or another, the list goes on and on and on. In fact making choices is a big part of everything we do. Naming variables is hard, primarily because we have to choose the best name. But how do we choose?<p>Learning how to make an informed choice is a powerful skill. The power I think, is from learning how to make a choice that once made, is satisfying to you. In other words the choices are hard and anxiety inducing: because they are choices. A silly assessment, but true. Pain is unfortunate because it hurts. Choices create anxiety becuase we have to make a choice and live with an unknown outcome.<p>So the hack, the trick, is to spend less effort on choosing and the majority of the effort on defining the context around the choice.<p>To your final statements: &quot;I just want to work without feeling bored or overwhelmed.

It’s kinda refreshing from the typical web development stuff.<p>In your case I think you’re creating a lot of anxiety by making the assumption that you need to be perfect right out the gate. I do this to myself as well, so perhaps I’m projecting. Slow down! You’ve already recognized an area you know you can improve in, that’s the first step. Don’t push yourself so hard to get everything perfect. Focus on learning one thing at a time and apply them to real problems. You’ll keep certain things and identify things you can do better in the next project. Wash. Rinse.

I had the same feeling about my jobs, also hadn&#x27;t worked for awhile, considered myself lazy&#x2F;coasting, wanted to get hobby projects going but had trouble.<p>So, having had success with my hobby projects in the sense that I reached my technical&#x2F;product goals and then ended up landing a great tech job off of them, here are my thoughts, in no particular order:<p>1. Tech stack doesn&#x27;t exactly matter. Don&#x27;t overthink it. I personally love a variety of languages and want to be fluent with django, flask, express, sinatra, node, spring,  and sails. That is, however, impractical, and comparing them endlessly is unproductive. They can all do what you need. Some are more complex than others, and learning curve is IMO the most important point of comparison. I ended up going with expressJS which is fantastically straightforward to set up and work with, and is extremely powerful and flexible and mature. That was partly because I was already fluent in JS from doing frontend work.<p>2. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend tutorials. If you wanted to build (for example) a twitter clone, you probably already know you need backend code serving HTML views. So just follow through the &quot;Hello world!&quot; tutorial on your framework of choice until you have it serving HTML views, then build off that, progressively googling things as you add complexity, e.g. &quot;how to do user login with django&quot;. If you encounter a bit of syntax or a concept you&#x27;re unfamiliar with, google the shit out of it. If you find nothing, ask on stackoverflow. I have asked like 400 questions there. I&#x27;m shameless. Stackoverflow tells me my questions have helped 3.7 million other people over the past 6 years.<p>3. If you want to do Vue, do Vue! Great! Frankly I think the prominence of react now is so great that I would be reluctant to focus energies on something else, but any good company won&#x27;t care if you already know it or not, because you can learn it on the job.<p>4. Kind of repeating myself, but don&#x27;t look for &quot;spotify vue tutorial project&quot;....that&#x27;ll get you nowhere. Figure out how to use Vue, then figure out how to use the spotify API, then tie them together on your own.<p>5. It really helps to nail down what you&#x27;re using. I did a lot of comparing for where to host my application, a lot of googling &quot;X vs Y&quot; and finally went with Heroku. It really depends whether you want to be doing your own server administration or whether you want most of that handled for you. EC2 and digital ocean will leave you managing your server, where Heroku for instance will not. I strongly recommend heroku, personally, or something similar to it, for the stage you&#x27;re at.<p>6. Once you nail down HOW you&#x27;re going to deploy your product, like with heroku, DEPLOY IT IMMEDIATELY! Deploy your first line of HTML, the one that says &quot;welcome to my website&quot; and make sure you can see it at `your-website.com`, whatever your URL is! It&#x27;s so motivating to get that link out of the way, to know you already have the setup ready to put the code into production. As you commit each new thing, keep adding it! Keep deploying! It will feel like you&#x27;re really getting somewhere and keep you motivated. If you wait until it&#x27;s finished to do all that, you&#x27;re far less likely to ever get there because mentally it will feel like you&#x27;re eons away from completion."],"time":["2019-12-25 03:23:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scottlecrab"],"id":[21876647],"kids":{},"parent":[21861412],"text":["Pick anything on here that interests you and get to it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.azure.com&#x2F;s-lambert&#x2F;_git&#x2F;Lets%20Get%20Wild!\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.azure.com&#x2F;s-lambert&#x2F;_git&#x2F;Lets%20Get%20Wild!<\/a>."],"time":["2019-12-25 04:44:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kartoniks"],"id":[21879130],"kids":{},"parent":[21861412],"text":["Go agile for yourself.

It&#x27;s both good and bad.<p>I may be coming from a very different place, so YMMV.<p>I worked as a &quot;ship&quot; programmer and manager for over thirty years. I&#x27;ve been writing shrink-wrapped software (actual deliverable) for my entire career. It&#x27;s taught me a great deal.<p>The last decade or so, my management responsibilities meant that I couldn&#x27;t code on the job, so I created a number of open-source projects. I didn&#x27;t have a &quot;We own the ideas that you come up with in the shower&quot; clause at work, so I was free to do this.<p>They have been fairly successful, in a rather limited scope. Since all the work was initially done with a &quot;bus factor&quot; of 1, the projects are not massive; but they are very, very important to a certain demographic. They needed to be done at a professional level; not at a &quot;hobby&quot; level.<p>I am now at a place where I never need to work again, if I don&#x27;t want, but I want to work.<p>During the week, I get up every morning at 5AM, do my exercise, then roll up my sleeves, and start coding. Weekends, I let myself sleep in until 6:30AM. I&#x27;ve been doing this for the last couple of years. It is now Christmas morning. I am taking my time doing my exercise, and will get back to coding the the Bluetooth OBD driver I&#x27;m making in an hour or so.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;m obsessive.<p>I write every line of code as shipping code; even if I never plan to ship. My test harnesses are fully-qualified apps that could be released to the app store, with localization and full-fat documentation.<p>Will I work again? Maybe. I certainly have skills and experience that could make folks with established corporations a lot of money, but I&#x27;ve found they are reluctant to hire folks my age; regardless of what I&#x27;m capable of doing. I&#x27;ve set up a consulting corporation, and we&#x27;ll see where that goes. If nothing else, it gives me a structure to buy the toys I want.<p>No matter. I work as if I am writing shipping code. The satisfaction of finishing a deliverable-level project can&#x27;t be replaced. I do everything as open-source. My portfolio is <i>gigantic<\/i>, and is not consistent of dozens of forked projects. Just about every line of code in it was my own. My GitHub ID is solid green. I have over a decade of commit history in dozens of repos.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that you consider establishing a portfolio. Write code that is meant to be shared and re-used. Write developer utilities, drivers and tools. Test the code well. Document it well. Craft it like you are a master goldsmith, creating royal treasuries. Establish a personal&#x2F;professional brand. Decide on what that brand means, and make all your work reinforce that.<p>The world needs high-quality software. Write as a vocation; not a hobby, and whether or not anyone else values or pays for your work. If nothing else, it will be useful as an example to others.<p>Maybe find an NPO&#x2F;NGO that doesn&#x27;t have a pot to piss in, but a cause you can support. Write pro-level code for them that they could never afford on their own. That&#x27;s what I did. I can definitely say that the code I&#x27;ve written has saved lives, and restored hope.<p>It also feels great to write beautiful code. Every project I do is completely shippable, and highly-polished, with strong branding, rich UX and a great deal of documentation. I&#x27;m a reasonably good artist. I was trained as one, many moons ago.<p>For me, doing the work is its own reward. I haven&#x27;t been paid to write code in over twenty years. I don&#x27;t care. I love coding. I&#x27;ve been writing open-source stuff for most of those decades. When they stopped paying me to write code, I didn&#x27;t miss a beat, and kept writing.<p>I also like to write articles on my personal sites and Medium. I don&#x27;t particularly care if anyone reads them or not. They give me practice doing another thing that I like to do: talk about myself ;).<p>Just my $0.02.<p>Have a great holiday season!"],"time":["2019-12-25 11:55:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sjg007"],"id":[21885912],"kids":{},"parent":[21861412],"text":["The key to treating anxiety is to confront the fear.

But I&#x27;ve always felt the microprocessor has been overstated in its importance in the computer revolution.<p>Throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s, memory was usually considerably more expensive than the CPU, for all kinds of computer system.  The majority cost in mainframes, minis and embedded machines alike was the core memory.  Early semiconductor RAM was even more expensive than core!<p>It was possible to design a simple CPU in the early 70s using a few dozen SSI&#x2F;MSI chips, and a board with such a CPU could have been done in less than 30x30 cm.  Indeed, that&#x27;s basically a description of the numerous low-end MSI-based minicomputers of the 70s.  The cost of such a design would have been in the same ballpark as many of the early single-chip microprocessors released in &#x27;74 and &#x27;75 before the 6502.<p>But what use would such a processor be, whether discrete or a single-chip microprocessor, without memory?  A mere 4 kilobytes of DRAM in 1973 would have cost over $1000, and a useful general-purpose computer really needs more like 8 or 16 KB to host an assembler and disk-operating system.<p>By late 1978, the cost of 4 KB of semiconductor DRAM fell to $60.  By 1983 a mere $2.  In many ways, that was the true revolutionary technology.  Even if no one had thought of microprocessors, and even if advances in CPU speeds had petered out, a minicomputer with 2 MB of RAM is an entirely different kind of beast from one with only 4 or 8 kilobytes."],"time":["2019-12-25 00:38:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zxcvgm"],"id":[21876881],"kids":{},"parent":[21875001],"text":["The Amp Hour podcast had Chuck Peddle as a guest a few years back.

You don&#x27;t have to build anything that cures cancer, but if you can build a reasonably complex project consisting of at least two independent modules (say, a frontend and a backend) with a modern stack, you should have a reasonable time finding a job.<p>Tech is still the place where one may find lucrative work without a field specific degree, but the part that everyone leaves out is that you have to demonstrate above average talent in some other way first. In any case the practice and knowledge will likely be useful to you. Personally I spent some 5 years building a distributed client&#x2F;server MMO in my spare time before I finally transitioned to tech and it&#x27;s amazing to continue to see how much of what I practiced applies to professional development.<p>Note that my experience is with the U.S. job market so yours may differ.<p>Edit: additional advice is to leverage your past degree and target software development in the area, if it exists. Especially if it&#x27;s a place where ML is still young. Programmers are a dime a dozen, but those who can understand and translate between code and applied science are hard to find and very much in demand, though generally at smaller outfits and especially startups. Further, a startup may be more willing to take a risk hiring you if you&#x27;re ok with sacrificing some pay for a hot resume entry.

Assume that no one will hire you and you&#x27;ll fail all interviews. Don&#x27;t even try to pass the interviews. Instead, view it as a way to extract information from the interviewer. Ask tons of questions. Ask about everything you can think of. If they mention something you don&#x27;t know, ask them about it.

It takes a while to get good reputation on upwork, but once you do, finding gigs gets much easier and protects you if you ever lose your job. So worth doing this in my opinion. Tip on finding work at upwork - look for work that is physically closer to you and then apply for it. Geographical proximity often is a good trust indicator and hence helps in winning work. And be patient, it takes a some time to start getting steady supply of gigs.<p>There is also toptal.com and few other similar sites, you will need to pass their evaluation, but once you do, they can get you some contract positions where you can work remotely for a company. They also pay well and usually there is enough work to go around.<p>I wish you the best of luck in your job search."],"time":["2019-12-25 22:11:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zubairlk"],"id":[21884186],"kids":{},"parent":[21880179],"text":["Getting a foot in the door is definitely hard. \nPlace I work at isn&#x27;t hiring at the moment.<p>Have several suggestions.<p>1- Have you considered looking at freelance platforms like Upwork?<p>There is a bit of a game that needs to be played to get the first few projects.<p>- bid quickly (as soon as job posts come up)\n- underbid\n- keep trying.<p>It&#x27;ll probably help you hone your skills and have specific projects to talk about during interviews.<p>I helped my wife step into this. Quite quickly, a few projects led to a nice part-time role with a US startup via Upwork. A while later, tried applying full time locally and the projects and work was easy to talk about during the interview.<p>2 - Have you considered going to local&#x2F;slightly distant meetups via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;<\/a> or eventbrite? Networking in person makes it easier to push the CV through HR. And in some cases, there are HR folk attending the meetup to step in. I once attended DWPs Hackathon in Leeds (which turned out to be a recruitment event basically. so sign up to those perhaps?)<p>3 - I&#x27;d recommend having a LinkedIn profile.\nSaw some questions about how to put the homeless time gap in there. Don&#x27;t have any suggestion. But I think having a profile would be better than not.<p>If you had a LinkedIn profile, I can share that easily.

The more of your own code the better. Code style and commit messages matter. Show that you can push professional code. I always looked through GH profiles of potential candidates when available.\n- Set up a LinkedIn profile. This will allow headhunters to find (and spam) you. You may not have professional coding experience yet but you have a degree and have been learning programming for a while. This is an asset. Include information about programming languages - you need keywords. And link to your GitHub profile.<p>Edinburgh (and other cities) has lots of meetups. They are free and good for making new connections. And you may hear about open positions.<p>It&#x27;s probably obvious, but so many people don&#x27;t do it: when applying for a job, triple check your CV and all communication for typos. When reviewing job applications we looked for attention to detail and professional communication. A great communicator with a strong will to learn would often be a better fit than a more experienced person who couldn&#x27;t communicate.<p>If there&#x27;s a position&#x2F;company you really want to work for, be persistent. Ask for feedback after unsuccessful applications. Some places won&#x27;t send any, but it&#x27;s always worth a try and it will help you improve.<p>It&#x27;s ok to reapply to the same place.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate covering letters - they help you sell yourself and can be the difference between you and another candidate who didn&#x27;t bother writing anything. Think about your strengths and point them out.<p>This is not an endorsement, but FYI, if you feel you need help improving your skills and making professional connections, there are coding schools available (e.g. in Scotland we have CodeClan)."],"time":["2019-12-26 00:38:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["maqqerone"],"id":[21881604],"kids":{},"parent":[21880179],"text":["We hire remote software engineers and provide the kit necessary do work.
