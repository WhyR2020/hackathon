I&#x27;ve done technical interviews with FAANG and the like and those processes actually tend to be much nicer at more mature companies because they&#x27;re actually well designed problems with people who actually understand their significance. You at least get to ask questions and not just get told to jump through the hoop like a dolphin. For the rest, you end up with interviewers who google some esoteric Python problem they think is particularly clever.<p>I&#x27;ll stop here to state that I think any adherence to being overtly clever is my first and only red flag.<p>It&#x27;s so pathetically obvious because the number of times I&#x27;ve done the exact same problem for multiple companies because it happens to be the 2nd or 3rd search result.<p>I once had someone disqualify my answer for using a DFA because it wasn&#x27;t &quot;real code&quot;.<p>To be honest, I think the technical interview actually IS important, and I&#x27;ve had numerous experiences enjoying it if only to showcase a lot of the more necessarily toxic behaviors of a company up front. Let&#x27;s be honest with ourselves, is any employer going to necessarily have the best practices with respecting your time, money and effort? It&#x27;s best to lay out those cards up front. Literally every red flag will demonstrate itself through the interviewer in most scenarios. Like any test, you get out of it what you give.<p>For example:<p>How many times do I feel this?<p>&quot;We take an extra time-slot &#x2F; day &#x2F; email chain in what is already a hypercompetitive market just to suss you out. We wait until the last stage of the interview process to do this because we still don&#x27;t totally trust you or understand anything you&#x27;ve done. We waste a lot of time creating elaborate puzzles that don&#x27;t really matter. We&#x27;re not going to pay you because our finances are already horribly mismanaged that it&#x27;s complicated to contract you out for the day and also we feel like you should be gladly externalizing your labor costs for our shiny position if you really love us. Drink the kool-aid.&quot;<p>Sometimes the technical interview surprises me. I always use it as a motivating example of myself as a candidates to work through a problem, show grit and also demonstrate when to ask for help. Ego and pride on both sides of the equation come into play and that&#x27;s always a worthwhile exercise before engaging it any longterm commitment. A good test accommodates and informs through failure. I learned this from administering the Putnam. Never got a decent score on it, but it was a worthwhile experience to fail. Interview tests are on the other hand, are not designed to teach anything except that you are unworthy.<p>My best roles have never asked for it. The company knew what they were looking for, were willing to trust me, were able to move along the interview process without losing me to a competitor and everyone was happy and they always pay competitively. Usually if there&#x27;s a technical interview involved at all, they have no idea what I can actually do. If they&#x27;re willing to waste time, effort and money on extra steps and are taking &quot;necessary precautions&quot; to subject you to what are essentially just litmus tests, then I&#x27;m sorry, that speaks to me a sense of your culture of mediocrity and dogmatic orthodoxy towards process.<p>Goodhart&#x27;s law. When a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure.\nWhen I was in school, we had other students take a year off to study for the Google interview. These were all affluent white men. At the same time, I had recruiters complaining to me that there were no decent black&#x2F;brown candidates in the pipeline. I remember hearing the same thing except as a child. Uhhh, there&#x27;s been plenty of time to invest into the local community. Recruiters would do well do understand to the history of the SAT as systemic racism, or literacy tests as systemic racism, or like any actual statistics as systemic racism. Everything that reduces candidates to numbers and quizzes feels rife for abuse. Who has the privilege to study an extra game on top of performing in a society that is already stacked against them? That&#x27;s not a question.<p>To wit, there&#x27;s the issue with a large number of candidates with junk resumes. There&#x27;s the outstanding issue of &quot;authenticity&quot; in professional acumen. There&#x27;s the whole problem with the industries underlying predatory behavior with regards to labor externalization and laundering numerical metrics, be it the rate of inclusion and diversity or the amount of hours actually demanded by management. What is so fundamentally wrong with the technical interview is that it&#x27;s just the cherry on top for what is already a miserable process. I&#x27;d so much rather just do free work for a potential client and just give it to them so it actually means something and is useful than waste any more time solving pointless puzzles, and this is from someone who specifically enjoyed studying hard pointless puzzles in school.<p>No, you can&#x27;t just show side projects. You should not be showing your work portfolio to anyone who isn&#x27;t paying you. If they were interested in open source, they&#x27;d already be paying you.<p>The technical interview is dead.

There are many good engineers who have not learned how to sell their work, themselves, or in general communicate to the intent of a question. This is an invaluable skill, largely orthogonal to writing code, but it&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s often learned with experience. Learning to ask level appropriate questions is hard and evaluating answers consistently (if not objectively) even harder. It is also largely insufficient in gauging programming ability. I&#x27;ve had co-workers who can talk about advanced architecture-y topics seemingly competently but struggle to write even relatively simple code.<p>Probationary period - I&#x27;ve never seen this implemented (excluding internships which sort of fall into this category) and it certainly sounds like a nice option to have available but I would bet many candidates would be afraid of a short probationary period (say 3 mo) especially if they have to move their family for the job. Being a professional and being told you are on a probationary period is stressful. At many large companies it can easily take more than 6wks to get up to any sort of productivity.<p>Walk through existing projects - most people (vast majority) do not have any sizable or clean or even &quot;interesting&quot; side project they would want to walk an interviewer through. Unless you worked on open-source for your previous employer (again minority of people) or on your spare time, this is not something you can get a strong signal out of.<p>Ask them to build something - err, I don&#x27;t see how this is that different than a coding challenge. And again, not everyone has personal projects ready to be shown to an interviewer. For example, the game I&#x27;m coding some nights after work does not look anything like code I write for my employer; there are no tests, there&#x27;s a lot of experimental and often dead code, functions are not neatly factored and thought out with an eye for collaboration, etc. I would not want to be judged by this code for an interview.<p>Pair programming - this sounds like a coding challenge but with a more empathetic interviewer. I don&#x27;t think this is an alternative, just a mild augmentation of a coding challenge.<p>Focus on ability to learn - companies do this but it&#x27;s usually considered supplementary to coding ability. Some companies explain their product and try to see if the candidate understands where the value of the product exists or at least where some of the challenges are. This could be spun out into a product type interview or a system design interview depending on intent.<p>Alternatives to white-boarding or do-at-home project interviews:\n- Provide a small existing but functional code base and ask the candidate to implement additional functionality. Downside is this takes a lot more effort to prepare and are limiting the candidate in regards to language they want to use.\n- Provide multiple options for a coding project or question and let the candidate choose which one they want to solve. This would hopefully reduce some of the luck factor of getting a question you know how to solve.\n- I can&#x27;t think of any others, but I&#x27;m sure they exist<p>One of the big desirable goals of interviews are evaluating candidates in a consistent manner. All interviewers have biases and these biases vary between the interviewers. Trying to account for that is, I believe, important but also very hard.

When countries border each other and also share a coast there is a issue of how to decide who owns the water. The simplest way is to find the point where the two countries and the coast meet. Then from there draw a line along the longitude. However, that is problematic, because there are countries like Libya and Egypt where their boarder is along the latitude.<p>During those times the British were very colonial, and one of their methods of keeping power was to cause the colonised people to fight amongst themselves (as can still be seen with the Indians and Pakistanis, Israelis and Palestinians). Well, they invented a method to split the coast by first finding the angle of tangent on the point of the boarder between the countries and the sea. Take 90 degrees of the tangent, and that is the sea boarder.<p>While this looks good upon first glance, due to the coastline paradox, you can always find a different tangent line.

That criticism may be fair.<p>Static types do not help at all with software quality, beyond catching some typos.

This, we found out, now means that during a power outage, there is no way to alert the fire brigade because the sirens dont have power. We now have people sitting in the fire station again whenever our Village has a power out to use the on-vehicle radio to communicate with the dispatch.<p>TETRA itself is also a disaster.

So start small, get the first 100 users. Once you have 100 users, you know you can get 1000. And once you get 1000, you feel like you can get 10,000. And then more people start noticing.<p>I also used to run a message board to discuss the band Tool. It&#x27;s just one band, but people like discussing their music and lyrics. At the beginning, I needed to be the lead content creator and give people a reason to stick around. They wanted some discussion of lyrics, photos, show reviews, links to news articles etc. Eventually, certain members started posting more than others, like thousands of posts. I made some of them moderators, and they became leaders of the community, and it grew from there.

It seems unlikely that 50 years from now, we’ll look back and say that the existing formats for online discussion were the best we could do, even though the existing formats are all clearly providing value to users in their current form.<p>An area I’m particularly interested in is, given that anonymous forums require moderation, but “moderation doesn’t scale”, what would happen if you <i>only<\/i> allowed moderators to contribute to the discussion.

From there you can focus on slower organic growth.  Examples: YouTube and MySpace both began as dating sites.  YouTube focused on getting people to upload introduction videos of themselves.  Once they had accumulated a number of people who were willing to film themselves they pivoted over to content creation.  Similarly, MySpace was a very crude dating site that allowed people to customize their page.  Brad Greenspan was a serial investor who bought up a large number of tiny dating sites.  He cannibalized all the revenue from those sites to promote MySpace as a &quot;free&quot; dating site.

Paul Graham threw his endorsement behind the platform a few times and that also helped interest people in checking it out.<p>For my successful community sites, I&#x27;ll just mention one experience - I had built a Q&amp;A site from scratch.  It was finally done one Sunday night and I decided to go to bed.  There were eleven posts on the site, mostly from myself, but also a couple from friends I&#x27;d asked to test the site for me.  It was obvious there was no community there.  I bought a single ad - for $10 - at $0.01 CPC on a Quiz site, then went to bed.  My intention was not to launch the site, but to throw a little real traffic at it and see if any bugs cropped up that neither I nor my friends had found.  When I got to work in the morning and had finished catching up on my emails I decided to check the site and see if anyone had posted.  There were over 100 posts and people were using the site exactly as intended.  Not only that but there was about $0.50 in ad revenue already, meaning my monthly run rate was net-positive from day one.

I define this period as the period where you have to think much more about writing code than about the problem. The means that you really can&#x27;t do much software development in the true sense because just getting programmings to run and run consistently take a lot of mental effort.<p>Years 3-5 are the intermediate stage where you can solve most common problems without having to think about programming too much, but programming itself is still a source of friction when it comes to completely projects. At this stage you begin to think more about how to structure larger and larger projects, learning some clever techniques, and understanding some of the more specialized techniques in your language of choice.<p>Expertise happens when you don&#x27;t have to think about programming any more and are exclusively concerned with larger design problems.

My tech friends would often talk about code with such excitement, but I couldn&#x27;t get that feeling myself. It was just a tool to me.<p>But once I hit my 30s, I realised that actually what I enjoyed was finding a problem and solving it. Programming was part of the solution, design was another part. I&#x27;d been doing all the different parts, but just labelled myself a full-stack developer because I thought I had to fit into a bucket somehow.<p>That lead me to thinking about what actually I want to focus on, and I came to the conclusion that product (management, design, etc.) is actually what I enjoy. Programming, design, marketing, and the like, are the tools I use to make products. I don&#x27;t necessarily &quot;love&quot; any of the tools, and I&#x27;m certainly not the best at any of them, but I have a broad knowledge of all of them, and that alone had helped me in so many ways that I hadn&#x27;t realised before.<p>So perhaps you need to do something similar? You say you get interested in problems — that&#x27;s a great start! While you might not be able to come up with the best technical solution yourself, you could be the person that&#x27;s needed to research the problem, and to motivate and steer others towards the solution.<p>Also, having that broad knowledge of the surface of many topics is also a great advantage. I&#x27;m often the person my friends will come to when they&#x27;re looking for a tech solution that they haven&#x27;t found.

That takes bravery and you&#x27;ve started a really interesting thread. I have a couple of suggestions as someone who is self taught in various fields, and the world of programming and music have some bizarre parallels.<p>First, you might be wrong. You may be fine, and just need to back to fundamentals. This is <i>very<\/i> common in many complex fields. I have gone through multiple rounds of taking stuff back to beginning level. I&#x27;m doing it all over again right now in programming. I highly, highly, highly recommend reading &quot;How To Design Programs&quot;. Putting time in to truly and deeply master the very basics as well as you can is the road to mastery in anything complex, and it&#x27;s never too late to do this.<p>Second, you may not be totally wrong, you may be slightly off target on how you like to think best! There are a lot of people out there who like computing and programming, but discover that really, they are better off as someone in a related field, or that they like a different kind of coding. In my experience, the best low-level coders are often terrible architects (very high level software design), because they can&#x27;t imagine being wrong! Also, some people naturally gravitate for whatever reason to sysadmin&#x2F;dev-ops style stuff, or security testing, or embedded electronics. Or perhaps you have better than average ability to understand how people make software and would be an excellent development manager.<p>So my advice is to take a two-pronged approach:<p>A) Go back to fundamentals and learn new languages, both high and low level.<p>B) Experiment with related areas and see if one of them makes you say &quot;ah damn this is what I should have been doing&quot;.<p>And C) give yourself like a good year or two to figure this out.

There are many, many, many other &quot;translator&quot; jobs, both more and less &quot;technical&quot; than developer and more and less &quot;domain specific&quot; (whatever industry the job is in). If one is uncomfortable in one kind of translation role, there are many other kinds, many other trajectories.<p>OP mentions having wide knowledge of other &quot;tech&quot; topics- I would advise thinking about that as a skill and think of it from a &quot;translator&quot; perspective. What community does the person with those skills translate from, and who do they translate to, and what domains would they work in.<p>There&#x27;s much more, but those are my top level thoughts:<p>1. Get some perspective and a community.<p>2. Get a sense of safety&#x2F;vulnerability.<p>3. Get some understanding of the landscape.<p>The world is a BIG BIG place.

Many people are quite bad at learning because the process is counterintuitive. People mistake the feeling of mastery for learning, and it&#x27;s not at all a productive feeling (if you want to learn; it&#x27;s great at building self-confidence). My advice:<p>1. Focus. Acknowledge that you have surface level familiarity in many things, but that nobody can or should go deep in everything. Pick a language you&#x27;re using professionally, and focus on that. If you don&#x27;t currently have a job, try to pick something with broad applicability like Python or Golang. Also eliminate distractions: email popups, SMS, facebook, HN&#x2F;reddit, Slack, all must go while you focus.<p>2. Study. Now that you have a language you want to build expertise on, study it methodically. Start an Anki[1] deck for it (and run through reviews daily) -- this is your tool to &quot;try smarter&quot;. Get a set of beginner books from the library&#x2F;amazon. Run through a codecademy or similar online course series. Make new Anki cards as you go. When you&#x27;ve finished a book, start working on the easiest online problems you can find online. Sort Leetcode[2] by acceptance rate -- many make the mistake of trying them in order, or by difficulty tag, and get frustrated when they hit a stumbling block. Learn from their failures. Once you solve a problem, review how others solved it and try to understand their code: did they use arrays or objects? did they use recursion? obscure syntax you need to look up? Which code base is cleaner, and easier to read?<p>3. Pace yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint. Improvement will be slow, and it will not feel good. If you have a job, I&#x27;d limit myself to 1 hour a day on professional improvement. If you&#x27;re searching for work, I&#x27;d still limit myself to 4h daily. I try to spend about 10 minutes a day on Anki, just to retain what I&#x27;ve learned. People spend 4 years of their life on this stuff, after all.<p>4. Advanced study. As you advance beyond the material in step 2, look for conference talks at your level. Read through the official documentation. Start browsing StackOverflow or similar for your language tag[3]. Keep making Anki cards and reviewing them. Maybe pick up a CS textbook to shore up theoretical shortcomings and study 10 pages a day (textbooks tend to be denser reads than other reading material, so again, pace yourself.). Start with freshman undergrad stuff like Data Structures -- nearly universal in application and immediately useful. Or since you feel anxious about it, a book on OOP.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com<\/a>\n[3]: Little known secret: the most viewed questions aren&#x27;t the ones with the most votes, they&#x27;re the ones that novices google the most.

It is not enough to have your own discipline, the rest of the system needs to observe the same discipline at interfaces. And there are many possible, correct disciplines to choose from.<p>Rust imposes one of the possible disciplines for memory-object management that enforces one set of non-negotiable tradeoffs and costs. You the programmer are relieved from choosing a discipline or discovering what was chosen, and from discovering that two subtly different ones were used in different parts of the system.<p>Memory-object management is not the only place where systems need a consistent discipline, but others can often be referred to it; and every program needs at least the one, besides any others.<p>Arguably the reason Common Lisp never took off is that practically nothing can be assumed about any other part of a system. C++ has enough forced consistency to drive adoption, but might better have had more. C++ has a lot more tooling than Rust does to capture semantics in libraries, so the library is the natural boundary for a discipline, and it is not unusual to find more than one safely co-existing, but it is also not unusual to find them not safely encapsulated, and in conflict.<p>Ultimately there is no substitute for sound design.

PMTUD remains the proper way to handle things, or something like PLPMTUD if you&#x27;re not willing to assume IP. Some things create path MTU black holes, commonly firewalls but also APs. APs can be particularly troublesome because nowadays they commonly don&#x27;t terminate the wireless encryption, the controller at the other end of the tunnel does, which means they can&#x27;t inject an ICMP to let the client know that packet is too big. MSS saves the day (for TCP) but otherwise the AP can either drop or fragment at the encap layer transparent to the client. I&#x27;ve yet to see a system that delivers the fragmented tunnel packet so the controller can ICMP back that the packet is too big but it&#x27;d be the cleanest thing in that scenario.<p>Also if you&#x27;re going to limit tunnel size arbitrarily beforehand probably best to make sure the resulting packet ends up being able to fit into 1428. A lot of products use a 1300 &quot;inside&quot; MTU for this (and similar) reasons. 1400 + auto IPsec calc will lead to trouble in this scenario.<p>Don&#x27;t drop &quot;inside&quot; MTU below 1280 in IPv6 networks.

GPT-3 is absolutely astonishing in terms of it&#x27;s capabilities and I&#x27;d love to be able to dig into it&#x27;s inner workings and scroll through it&#x27;s code.

For better or worse obtaining a dataset that big isn&#x27;t a great deal if you really want to. Gutenberg project, wiki corpus, the reddit dumps - difficult but definitely doable.<p>2. Costs - training the model costs $5M which is a considerable amount of money by anyone&#x27;s standard(rich people will also have a second thought when they hear that number). But there is a catch - the hardware is becoming more and more accessible. Remember when a server grade GPU like P100 was ~10k a piece?

Yes, I know, I am fully aware I did the same thing years ago with Oculus.&quot;<\/i><p>He&#x27;s not wrong.  A few years ago, I spent $399 for a point-and-shoot digital camera that took decent photos under decent lighting conditions.  It supported resolutions up to 1920x1080 or so.  DJI just sold me a camera for the same price that takes better photos.  Also, it takes videos.  Also, it fucking <i>flies<\/i>.

It helps to have a recommendation, but roles are rarely filled by asking the team who they would most like to work with an approaching them. Normally companies advertise roles and try to use some kind of standardized process. So CV writing and interview technique are critical.<p>Promotions often happen because people apply for the role up when it is advertised competitively. My observation is that people succeed at this by focusing on performing against their current objectives, not being a problem, requesting training, and picking up the tasks relevant to their current role that will be on the job description for the next one up. That next role up might be in another team so your own teams favor matters less. The main thing is not to have been a problem to management and to present yourself well during the application process.<p>I think external upwards moves are more likely to be powered by skill at believable exaggeration, and internal promotions by rules compliance and consistent ambition driven box ticking.<p>Finally, some people get promoted because management need someone they trust to do that job now, at least temporarily. This happens when a new project team is created and someone is told they are in charge of it, or someone quits and their duties are reallocated to an immediate report.

Following this space for a long time, Nikola has always been by far the shadiest of all these companies.<p>They were one of the very few companies that claimed revolutionary battery technology. This is an instant red flag and a huge one. New revolutionary batteries don&#x27;t just just happen.<p>Sila Nanotechnology, is only replacing anode materials, and they have been at it since 2012 and don&#x27;t expect to be in cars until 2025. Quantum Scape, who want to make Solid State Li Anode batteries is not gone be in cars until 2025.<p>There were a number of other companies who also did this &#x27;we have revolutionary batteries&#x27;. Some actually believed they did. Dyson is a good example, they wanted to create a car, and to achieve their targets, they invested lots of money including in batteries. However since they are a honest company they eventually admired that they couldn&#x27;t hit their engineering targets and abandoned the project.<p>A Nikola competitor in the arena of bullshit spinning is Henry Fisker. His first company made lots of nonsense claims, including about batteries, but unlike Nikola they actually went threw the trouble and made some investment in future battery tech, just not credibly commercial ones. They went bankrupt. His new company is right back to the old bullshit spinning way but they have lower their ambitions and just open say they want to buy the VM MEB platform, now they are gone be the most &#x27;sustainable&#x27; among other claims.<p>As a comparison, Tesla &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; technology at battery day will likely not be a silicon anode or a lithium anode, those are simply not ready for commercial use. Revolutionary battery technology would be 10-20% energy density improvment and 30-50% longer lifetime maybe 2x faster production speed, and Tesla has been working on this for 5-10 years and have spent many 100s of millions acquiring a set of companies and having research agreement with multiple universities that all work in collaboration. In total I would guess to really bring a new cell to market at scale, you are talking 5-15 years and 5 billion $, and that is still with basically conventional cell chemistry.<p>Much of the same can be said about Fuel Cells. Toyota, Honda and also the Koreans have been banging their head against the fuel cell wall for 30 years, with heaps of government money to back them up. They know they can&#x27;t make it work, even with their massive resources. In personal vehicles they are not competitive against EVs in the slights (while also not being an improvement in CO2 compared to Gas) while in trucks they are not competitive with Disel or Natural Gas, and soon electric trucks are gone take the majority of routes over as nobody can compete with their price on these short and mid distant routes.<p>But Nikola are gone make it, and not for a geographically small place like Japan, but for the gigantic US without much government support either.<p>Another topic is that of product announcements. If you follow Nikola for many years, or you go back to 2016 and look at their announcements there is a funny effect that happens. People can say about Elon Time what they like, but mostly the products actually do come out and often are improved over the original announcement in a number of ways. Nikola shows the exact opposite pattern. It goes something like this, announce revolutionary new product but its 3-5 years out. Then progressively lower the specs over time, while pushing the time to market out further.<p>The hype for anything EV related has been insane. Quantum Scape is a fine company for example, but they have valuation that is insane for a company that is not gone make real money for many years and not gone make profits for many more after that. They essentially have a technology that requires a totally new manufacturing system, while competitors like Sila can put their materials in existing facilities claim the same level of improvements. I wouldn&#x27;t expose myself to a unique technology with so much competition<p>There are tons of EV startups and they differ widely from Lucid, Rivian being serious companies step by step putting in place a solid car company. Dynamic companies like NIO coming out of China. And there are the bottom feeders like Nikola, Fisker and others that surf on the hype.<p>This is gone be a massive market shakeout with Tesla being the leader hunted by everybody. Slow moving giants like VW, Toyota and so on finally realizing whats happening and taking methodical step after step. And a massive wave of startups from around the world, especially China trying to be next next big thing.

Quite the opposite - I’m optimistic that things are moving in the right direction. I mean, it can’t get worse:<p>- Shutdown my consulting  Business in February because I didn’t feel comfortable with being around new people constantly with a t-cell deficient immune system.\n- My boyfriend abruptly stopped his antidepressant and quietly completed suicide in his apartment alone. No indication anything was off.  It’s been tough to manage such a loss alone during a pandemic where social distancing is important.\n- I am left with his orange tabby cat; and with the unrelenting frustration in trying to reason with people who never lost their lover to suicide, with multiple “it’s not your fault” conversations. I’m conflicted in that these people are the ones who are standing with me, but I can’t hear this logic again. \n- Just a few days ago, six months later, I acknowledged what would’ve been his 33rd birthday and also our anniversary. I couldn’t find anything to actually celebrate or anyone to celebrate it with because of COVID. Still waiting for a good time to even have a proper memorial.\n- My roommate couple friends moved back home to the Midwest. As the master tenant, I’m responsible for the difference in rent, nobody is moving to SF really; but may have a roommate come October.\n- My best friend in San Francisco died of cancer late March. \n- We were supposed to have dinner the last week of February,\n- and all of us were supposed to celebrate my April birthday together at a Honey Dijon show;\n- and go to the Maceo Plex day party on Treasure Island in May. Yep, as both of them are gone and both of those events will never happen, that calendar event was a rough thing to forget to cancel.<p>On the bright side, I had time to crash course my way into sharpening my CS skills for flavor of the week programming languages, turned half my garage into a wood shop; created an IoT paradise at home or “who needs an Alexa when Jenkins will do,” been building the tabby a “catio” so he’ll get some outside time, started getting into the fun world of circuit board reworking out of a BIOS Flashing disaster, and enjoying the work of cooking all my meals.<p>I’m not too stressed about work.
