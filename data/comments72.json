My experience is probably markedly different from most teenagers in the US (I&#x27;m an immigrant who goes to a competitive school full of other immigrants) but I find that, for the most part, this article hits the nail on the head. High School is nothing like the usual media portrayal - I&#x27;ve never heard anyone even talk about a party, nobody&#x27;s doing anything stronger than weed, nobody&#x27;s fucking or even dating at all.<p>Smartphone use definitely has a negative effect. I&#x27;m in some APs, some Honors, and some regular classes and the #1 difference I&#x27;ve observed between the kids in each cohort is how often they&#x27;re on their phones. The CP kids leave their phones on their desks and are making out with the damn things whenever they can, sometimes even when the teacher is trying to lecture them. The Honors kids have them under their desks and only use them when they have nothing more pressing to do. The AP kids have them on mute in their backpacks. (I leave mine in my locker, and only use it to listen to music.)<p>Most of the anxiety is over college admissions - not necessarily to the Ivy League (everyone knows that&#x27;s just luck of the draw), but the &quot;second-tier&quot; schools (Carnegie-Mellon, Rensselaer, Duke, Cornell, etc.) where over-achieving can still net you a good chance of admission. There&#x27;s a lot of focus on &quot;building your brand&quot; and trying to &quot;stand out&quot; (make your life more &quot;interesting&quot; in the narrow ways that look good on a college application). The more technically-oriented kids are balls-deep in resume-driven development; they follow the tutorial for every trendy tech buzzword possible (mostly data-science and ML stuff) so that they can blog about it on their Squarespace-generated portfolios. I&#x27;m a member of the FIRST Robotics Team and, like everyone else there, I do absolutely nothing, because the team has 5 times more people than it actually needs. I once witnessed the entire programming subteam (about 20 people) spend 3 hours trying to flash an SD card.<p>The main thing I notice among my peers is an obsessive (borderline autistic) focus on &quot;getting in&quot; and having good credentials. Enjoying your life and doing things that you take pride in are secondary to the all-encompassing drive to impress people who know nothing about you. I wish I could say I&#x27;m above it all, but I&#x27;ve certainly internalized it to some extent - I feel a nagging sense of guilt when playing video games, or reading books that don&#x27;t imply intellectual clout, or anything else that&#x27;s internally rewarding but &quot;non-bloggable&quot;.

(I also like circuit breakers for external APIs; if Slack is down, there&#x27;s no point in sending them another request for a while and it should just fail fast.)  But Envoy does not handle dynamic HTTPS proxying particularly well (you can&#x27;t just set $http_proxy in your environment and have it Just Work; you would need to create a cluster and route for every upstream), so doesn&#x27;t work too well for the egress gateway case.  (Things like Istio claim to provide this, but they actually just configure Envoy to act as a TCP proxy and can&#x27;t extract your Opentracing identifiers or response codes.  So you can get metrics like &quot;you sent 2398473 bytes to 13.249.46.27&quot; but not &quot;100% of requests to api.slack.com timed out&quot;. \n It&#x27;s something, but not useful enough to be worth the configuration overhead for me.)<p>I have also looked at some of the traditional egress proxies, like Apache Traffic Server.  It seems like it was invented before anyone ever heard of distributed tracing or metrics, and doesn&#x27;t support those.  So it doesn&#x27;t work for me.<p>My ultimate goal is to configure every application I use to make all outgoing requests through a proxy, and then use network policies to physically prevent them from talking to any namespace that isn&#x27;t the egress proxy or something it&#x27;s authorized to talk to.  That way, there can be no unexpected (and unaudited) communication with the outside world; if some container I use starts including a coin miner or a traffic sniffer or something, I&#x27;ll know about it and can shut it down.

I uploaded a similar set of symbols here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gKJ3KO2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gKJ3KO2<\/a><p>I’ve added notes in red, some baselines in blue and some lines at x-height in yellow.<p>I want to point out a few things:<p>1. OP misses out the need for script and blackboard bold letters and various symbols. You want them to not be confused with letters. In particular U and set union, epsilon and set membership, and oplus and capital theta.<p>I think OP’s eta looks wrong. Too much like an m.<p>One trick to use is that letters can have ascenders and descenders. Numbers can too but I don’t use that. I also incorrectly write a rho as a letter with an ascender and no descender to help to distinguish it from a p. I also try to impart a big curve at the top so you won’t think there could be the top of a straight line hidden in there.<p>I draw the top of a tau just below x-height while the bar on a t is somewhat above it. This and the rest of the t being higher helps to disambiguate.<p>Never use an o (“oh”) or omicron and probably not upsilon either (I missed out capital upsilon because OP did too and I didn’t notice). An exception is big&#x2F;little O notation but I don’t really like it.<p>I don’t like OP’s q. It looks too much like a double bowled g. I prefer a tick to a loop.<p>I tend to not have issues with 2 vs z but I do with nu vs v. I kinda dislike using nu because of it. In print I have trouble with v vs u.<p>I often use variant letters for some Greek letters (in particular my epsilon is what TEX calls varepsilon because it is more like handwriting and less like a print font. Similarly for theta kappa, and phi.  I don’t use varpi which looks too much like an omega, cardigan which is only really to go on the end of a word in Greek, varrho because I don’t like it, and I don’t write capital omega the modern Greek way (a horizontal line with a circle above it).<p>Other tricky symbols are:\nAngle brackets vs lt&#x2F;gr. Usually context suffices. Angle brackets vs parens: just don’t rely on this distinction.<p>Or vs v can and union vs U can usually be solved by context and spacing (you have a bigger space between a term and an operator than between factors or arguments in a term)<p>A final note is that I tend to write mathematics more upright than my normal handwriting. This helps distinguish inline mathematics from the rest of a sentence.<p>I looked through some random old notes to see if I could still read my writing and I can. The only thing I struggled with was the script C for conjugate classes because I was missing the context and struggling to guess what ccl stood for. At first I thought it was a script G.<p>Having written this, I realise I omitted forall, exists, nabla&#x2F;del, integral sign, partial sign, therefore dots, infinity, approxequal and hbar.<p>A final note is that spoken names matter to o. “Twiddle” is a much better name than “tilde” because it is more naturally made into a verb. You can say “define the relation twiddle on the naturals such that a twiddles b if ...” and then you can easily use that verb when talking through a proof of eg transitivity."],"time":["2020-04-26 21:57:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TwoBit"],"id":[22991869],"kids":[22995015],"parent":[22990116],"text":["My favorite personal fuzzing story is from 1987 when a friend said his x86 graphics drawing program was solid, and I said OK and smashed both hands on the keyboard and it insta-crashed."],"time":["2020-04-27 02:56:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thechao"],"id":[22992162],"kids":[22994431,22994353],"parent":[22990116],"text":["&gt;  The fix for this was fairly straightforward - I just made the library keep a record of the previously visited IFDs and bail out if it found a loop.<p>If you just want to detect loops, keep a “+1” pointer that you use to increment through the data; also, keep a “+2” pointer that is advanced <i>twice<\/i> each time your “+1” pointer advances: either your “+2” pointer hits the end, or it becomes equal to your “+1” pointer — in which case you have a loop."],"time":["2020-04-27 03:50:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bhaak"],"id":[22991618],"kids":{},"parent":[22990116],"text":["If you haven&#x27;t read the whole article, you should do that.<p>There&#x27;s a funny plot twist at the end.<p>3 bug reports by discovering 1 bug.

Perhaps Stoicism never claimed to provide a deeper meaning to life, and if one goes in without that expectation one will likely be less prone to disappointment."],"time":["2020-04-27 01:00:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["NegativeLatency"],"id":[22990242],"kids":[22990431,22991411,22990281,22992549],"parent":[22990014],"text":["&gt; Willpower is like muscle power: the more exercise, the stronger they are; the more will power we have, the more self-control and courage we have.<p>IIRC: studies have not validated this"],"time":["2020-04-26 23:03:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["troughway"],"id":[22990350],"kids":[22990366,22990897,22990474,22990718,22992261,22990612,22991007,22990365],"parent":[22990014],"text":["&gt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoanhan101.github.io&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoanhan101.github.io&#x2F;about<\/a><p>I want psychologists to write a solid book on this subject.<p>So far majority of posts that I have read on this subject have been by software developers, which strikes me bizarre.

Be prepared to invest <i>at least<\/i> ten months (the longer, the better) of <i>active<\/i> study to get a decent grounding.<p>From my experience of reading multiple translations of the Big Three, for someone new to Stoicism, I&#x27;d suggest <i>not<\/i> to start with the popular recommendation of Marcus Aurelius.<p>Start with Seneca&#x27;s Letters, then Epictetus (an ex-slave, and a profound influence on Marcus Aurelius), and only <i>then<\/i> Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor.  (To quote the foremost Stoic scholar, A.A. Long: &quot;[...] That an ex-slave actually shaped a Roman Emperor&#x27;s deepest thoughts is one of the most remarkable testimonies to the power and applicability of Epictetus&#x27; words.&quot;)<p>The quality of the English translation matters a <i>lot<\/i>.  Here are my recommendations:<p>• Seneca: <i>Letters on Ethics<\/i> — translation by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long. This is the most recent translation, reads extremely well, outstanding notes, and wonderfully typeset.  It&#x27;s translated by the current foremost experts; can&#x27;t get better than this.  I&#x27;ve been reading this for four months.  (If this is a tad pricey for you, I&#x27;ve also heard good things about <i>Selected Letters<\/i>; translated by Elaine Fantham.)<p>• Epictetus: <i>Encheiridion, and Selections from Discourses<\/i>, by A.A. Long. This is a short book; the value addition here is the great introduction, and the outstanding glossary. (NB: there is no escaping full Discourses of Epictetus—refer below.)<p>• Epictetus: <i>Discourses, Fragments and Handbook<\/i> — translation by Robin Hard, intro by Christopher Gill; Oxford University Press.  Spend a good four months immersing yourself in it.  Epictetus is full of heavy irony, dark humor, histrionic wit, and sarcasm.  Absolutely my favourite.<p>• Epictetus: <i>A Stoic and Socratic Guide<\/i>, by A.A. Long.  <i>Important Note<\/i>: To get maximum value out of this, you must have already read <i>at least<\/i> one translation of Epictetus&#x27; full Discourses! This book orients the reader to Epictetus with an extremely valuable context: how not to misinterpret his unqualified faith in &quot;divine providence&quot; (which can grate on our &quot;modern ears&quot;); the influence of Plato and the &quot;Socratic Elenchus&quot; (colloquially known as &quot;Socratic Method&quot;); deep insights into Epictetus&#x27; own inimitable style; and a rich bibliography.<p>• Marcus Aurelius: <i>Meditations<\/i>. There are at least six translations.  I&#x27;d suggest to start with the gentler translation by Gregory Hays.  If you like it, then you can research other translations.  (A.S.L Farquharson spent a lifetime on his translation of the <i>Meditations<\/i>; it also has commentary.  I sometimes consult this edition.)<p>• <i>The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius<\/i>, by Pierre Hadot. This needs to be read only after you&#x27;ve read <i>at least<\/i> one translation of Marcus Aurelius This is a fantastic dissection of Aurelius&#x27; work—Hadot studied him for 25 years. Besides fresh translations of the Meditations, it also contains unparalleled summary of Epictetus, and many quotes of Seneca.<p><pre><code>             - - -\n<\/code><\/pre>\nI&#x27;ll end with one of my favourite Epictetus quotes:<p><i>&quot;For sheep, too, don&#x27;t vomit up their fodder to show the shepherds how much they&#x27;ve eaten, but digest their food inside them, and produce wool and milk on the outside.

Using a fully automatic SAT solver for the easy stuff and Coq for the things the SAT solver can&#x27;t prove maker good sense. We did that 40 years ago in the Pascal-F system. The Oppen-Nelson cooperative decision procedure system (the first SAT prover) did the easy stuff - proofs that only need addition, subtraction, multiplication by constants, and logic. Beyond that you had to write a &quot;rule&quot; and prove it with the Boyer-Moore prover, which is a constructive system that uses induction. About 95% of the verification conditions were solved without adding new rules.<p>This group got about as far as we did - arrays, but not dynamic allocation, pointers, or objects. &quot;WP cannot currently work with dynamic allocation, &quot; they write. That&#x27;s the point at which describing what &quot;valid&quot; means becomes difficult, and you get into specification languages separate from the program.<p>I notice they put in what they called &quot;ghost code&quot;, code which has meaning only at proof time.

I am convinced the investigators of the project are sincere, but they are disconnected from reality (Alexandre Taillefer is a failure as a business man, but he has friends in high places)<p>2. They spend 300k$ on this project which is made by an non-profit. This is nowhere near enough to pretend you want to compete with Amazon. This is due to incompetence of bureaucrats in the government who have no clue how to build a software project.<p>3. What they could have done is a partnership with Shopify since they already built all the functionalities (search, payment, shipping, etc.) and create a real platform that looks and feel like 2020 not 1995.... But its the Not Invented Here syndrome that stroke again.<p>4. What people want is speed of delivery and low cost of shipping. I am simplify not waiting a week for my package to arrive via a shitty service like UPS where I need to be home to receive it. I am also proposing the government subsidies the shipping cost for small retailers to make it more appealing to buy from them.<p>5. Another idea I had would be to create a competing product to Amazon prime which would combine a subscription to tou.tv, free shipping on this Amazon-like website and an audio streaming service for Quebec music, I am 100% sure it would be a hit.<p>In summary, we have to stop the &quot;magical&quot; thinking that if we create a broken website in bootstrap that feels like its 1995 all over again we are going to save local businesses and make people shop in local stores.

Additionally, the jobs that are lost there may (!) be replaced on a national level by additional hirings in Amazon warehouses or delivery companies, but again, as delivery centers tend to be centralized, this creates another loss for the communities.

Seattle leaders have also taken missteps. For example they closed all the parks on Easter weekend, an unnecessarily drastic step that probably just resulted in people grouping elsewhere in smaller, more crowded spaces. The parking lots at most parks remain closed, making it much harder for people needing a mental break to deal with all this. More broadly, Washington state also has restrictions other states don’t - for instance fishing is banned, which makes no sense given that it is a pastime that naturally requires distancing. Same with golfing. Private construction is banned but public construction is not. State parks and national forest lands are closed, despite most being desolate and full of space. Cycling and jogging on Seattle’s popular citywide trails however, are not banned, despite it being a much more likely vector for spreading via aerosol particles (note, some other areas like France have banned cycling for this reason).<p>There is an inconsistency and inequality in how these restrictions were selected.

One of the biggest factors to learning is how much interest you have. There are tricks you can do to get yourself more interested, but it does take a fair amount of work and isn&#x27;t always effective. But if you wonder why sometimes we can remember silly details or whole complicated plotlines from stories but can&#x27;t remember a simple math formula, a lot of it is actually your interest levels. Your brain prioritizes the stories because it is interesting, you can relate, and thus form strong neural connections. It is much harder to do that with a math equation that is fairly abstract and not in constant use.<p>So I would start at finding which thing interests you the most.

Patriot Act) is a nice headline but is also trivially obviated.

You might push through some open-ended nonsense with a straight party line vote but that requires a Division. Unless you believe somehow Westminster now lacks even one single decent person to say &quot;No&quot; a sunset clause seems inevitable in any such legislation.<p>But there are legitimate obstacles far more interesting which the article brings up.

If we send them home that&#x27;s not very effective especially if other members of the household aren&#x27;t tested positive) and deploying a hypothetical contact tracing app to millions of citizens.<p>But one thing test + trace has going for it, which the article hints at, is that we already know it works. The virus is not a mysterious &quot;invisible enemy&quot; it&#x27;s just a virus, if we can identify everyone (or more realistically almost everyone) who is infected quickly and quarantine them in an effective way we can literally get rid of it.<p>Guinea Worm is a surprisingly relevant example here. Guinea Worm is <i>literally<\/i> a worm that can grow inside humans, and so of course we can&#x27;t give people a vaccine against it, any more than we can vaccinate you against shark bites or being mauled by a bear. And weirdly although it is a worm, the medications known to be effective in killing worms in humans don&#x27;t work. So eradicating Guinea Worm is mostly about stopping the worm&#x27;s lifecycle, giving people safe drinking water, keeping people with worms out of the water, that sort of thing. And it <i>works<\/i>. Chances are no HN readers live anywhere with endemic Guinea Worm, even though we&#x27;ve nothing really resembling a &quot;treatment&quot; for it.<p>Maybe we will get a vaccine that works.

While an effective treatment is still possible, it will likely require a new drug to be developed and tested, which is a far more time consuming process than using a drug that is already approved for other uses (since you already understand the side effects). Meanwhile, a vaccine is still a year or two away according to most experts, if we ever find one at all (some viruses are very hard to find vaccinations for).<p>So eventually, countries will need to lift their lockdowns. People in democracies are already getting restless.

Currency is an accounting mechanism.  Time is, well, something else.  It&#x27;s an incredibly valuable commodity, a necessary (but not sufficient) ingredient for any activity and hence any kind of progress, and one which you cannot make more of and so is worth using wisely.  But comparing it to <i>currency<\/i> is a category error.<p>Which brings me to my second point: it seems intuitively obvious that if you want to use time wisely you should use it efficiently, and typing faster is more efficient than typing slower.  But this overlooks a crucial point: typing faster can only produce a linear improvement in your efficiency.  If you type twice as fast, you will be able to type twice as many characters in the same amount of time.  But there is another dynamic in play: if you type slowly, then the cost of typing will become more painfully evident to you, and that can motivate you to think about ways to type less, and that can lead to <i>exponential<\/i> improvements in typing efficiency.<p>I have been coding for forty-one years.  I never learned proper touch-typing, and so my typing has always been quite slow by coder standards.  As a result, typing boilerplate is extremely painful for me, and I try to avoid it at all costs.  That drove me to learn Lisp, and that has led me to a coding style where I only need a tiny fraction of the code that, say, a Java programmer needs to do the same job.  So yes, I type 2x slower, but I only have to type 0.1x the amount of code for a net win of 5x.  And the techniques that lead me to that win can be applied recursively.  There are domains in which I can get 100x or 1000x improvements (i.e. 1 line of Lisp code is the equivalent of 1000 lines of Java or C).  I never would have been motivated to learn those techniques if I were able to type fast."],"time":["2020-04-25 18:11:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["seventytwo"],"id":[22977983],"kids":[22978933,22977997,22979231,22979974,22979409,22978403,22978370,22978444],"parent":[22977637],"text":["Parameters of the universe are currency. Time is one of them, space (or area on earth’s surface) is another, and energy is a third. How these three things are used is what generates <i>value<\/i> to human beings. Each of the fundamental items can be traded individually, but money is used as a proxy for <i>value<\/i>. The most common trade is when a person can trade their time and their body’s energy. They produce some level of value using those two inputs, and receive money (a proxy for that value) in exchange. A person who can generate more value with the same amount of time and energy should be receiving more money than someone who generates less value, as money is only a proxy for value.<p>People can also secure space. We’re used to thinking in terms of real estate, which always prices in the value of a structure or natural resources or potential on top of the raw spatial resource. But the raw three dimensional space can be traded as well, just like time or energy, as it is finite for humans.<p>Money is just a tangible abstraction later on top of these fundamental parameters of the universe we trade.

This doesn&#x27;t work well at all when you also allow individuals to detach themselves from any responsibility over the code that they produce.<p>The culture of wasting time is so pervasive that the vast majority of developers who practice it don&#x27;t even realize that they&#x27;re doing it - Ironically, they&#x27;re often the same people who write long articles about how to be productive and who brag about how organized and full their schedule is and how they&#x27;re using all the latest productivity tools and how high their test coverage % is and how good their workflow and CI pipeline is... I call BS on all this.<p>People who spend most of their time explicitly thinking about processes are bureaucrats. Truly productive people don&#x27;t need to think about processes, they evolve naturally through sweat and tears; good processes are the byproduct (emphasis on the word &#x27;byproduct&#x27;) of a focused mindset of desperately wanting to achieve specific goals, not the mindset of ticking-off boxes from a static checklist where you don&#x27;t even understand the underlying purpose of the work.<p>You cannot be productive without a clear sense of purpose and goals. Unfortunately most software jobs today lack purpose - In this case it makes no sense to even talk about productivity. How can you know how productive (how fast you&#x27;re moving towards your goal) you are if you don&#x27;t even know what the end goal is. Finishing something is not a goal, it&#x27;s a task. A goal is about a deeper purpose.<p>Also if your goal is to help your company earn more money, this is only a worthy goal if you have a way to check your personal progress towards that goal. Usually this is not possible to do in a big company because there are too many people working towards different goals within the same company (sometimes even conflicting goals); the reality is that your work probably doesn&#x27;t matter so there is no such thing as productivity in a corporate environment because it&#x27;s not possible to measure the impact of your work in relation to achieving a real company goal... However, if your goal is to maximize your personal ranking or salary within the company, this is a goal against which it is easy to measure progress; that&#x27;s why personal goals trump company goals every time.<p>KPIs are a ridiculous, completely futile attempt to fix this problem."],"time":["2020-04-25 15:32:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["r32a_"],"id":[22977823],"kids":{},"parent":[22977637],"text":["This is why a fixed currency makes sense.<p>You work and convert your time into currency which can be traded for other goods or services.<p>When currency is manipulated, it allows the manipulator to make your currency worth more or less. effectively theft."],"time":["2020-04-25 15:10:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Rerarom"],"id":[22978120],"kids":{},"parent":[22977637],"text":["I&#x27;ve often wondered what the world would look like if languages were actually theoretically different not just practically.<p>I.e. what if you actually needed Fortran to write a program designed for scientific computation, or Prolog for GOFAI etc. Maybe some cases would fit into several languages (&quot;I showed that SimCity is a special kind of database so you can write it in SQL&quot;) but you would have proven gaps in capabilities.<p>Language disputes would be way more fun.<p>P.S.
