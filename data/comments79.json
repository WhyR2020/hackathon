When you&#x27;re talking to someone in person, you can pick up a lot of information as to whether they want to continue talking, or whether it&#x27;s your turn.  On video conferences, those things are missing.  You might detect a lull in the conversation and start talking, but at the same time, someone else does the same thing and starts talking.  You have 100ms+ of latency, so you can get into what you&#x27;re saying before realizing that someone else took their turn (or you took theirs).  The collision mitigation algorithm takes place, and it&#x27;s just as bad for your mental fatigue as it is for your WiFi&#x27;s latency (which uses the same algorithm -- listen before talk, and if you collide, wait a random amount of time and repeat).  These things just don&#x27;t happen when a few people are in the same room together.<p>The result is that we try to use the video channel to pre-allocate timeslots for speaking.  You make your eyes bigger, you raise a finger... but sometimes people aren&#x27;t looking at the video, or don&#x27;t understand what your newly-invented cue actually means.  This is all very tiring.<p>The overall quality of the call is much lower than real life, as well.  People do not own good microphones or cameras, so you can&#x27;t actually hear them or see them very well.  The noise gate intervenes and just cuts off audio from time to time.  It is maddening how bad it all is.<p>Many years ago when I worked for Bank of America, we had these multiple-100k Cisco videoconferencing setups.  They worked really well.  My friends and I were at work pretty late and there was a tornado warning, so we couldn&#x27;t go home (we all biked).  We went to these conference rooms, set up a link between the two rooms right next to each other, and had a totally normal conference.  (Things were set up so that the entire wall of the room was a video screen, and it had an array of cameras, microphones, and speakers.  Everything was tuned perfectly so it looked like the people in the other room were just sitting across the table from you.  There was no latency, everyone was their normal size, and the audio and video quality were perfect.  Obviously with two rooms across the hall from each other, there shouldn&#x27;t be any latency... but at least the system didn&#x27;t add its own.  It makes a big difference.)<p>Finally, I think another issue is that people just aren&#x27;t used to getting work done with video conferences.  I worked as a remote team at Google, so pretty much 100% of my meetings were video conferences.  1:1s with my manager and everything else.  The system suffered from the same quality&#x2F;latency issues as anything else (though we did typically have good cameras and microphone arrays in every room), but through practice, people got good at getting stuff done despite the limitations.  I never really felt fatigued the way I do on calls with random people at home.  (I guess my tips are: have an agenda in advance, and use your screen share to show progress through the agenda.  Call on people in remote locations: &quot;Anyone from the New York room have anything to add?&quot;.)"],"time":["2020-04-21 07:40:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peyton022"],"id":[22933841],"kids":{},"parent":[22930965],"text":["I broke up with my Ex fiance a few months back, in what was a whirlwind of an altercation, and was destroyed, I won&#x27;t even bother lying about it.

Its performance is noticeably worse than CMR.<p>2. The density increase SMR provides compared to CMR is not that much. It&#x27;s 25% at most.<p>3. SMR is <i>not<\/i> a separate evolutionary path that can be developed further to have increasingly more density compared to CMR. It is more like a variation of the same technology which provides slightly more density in exchange for serious disadvantages. SMR and CMR both directly depend on, and benefit from developments in platter densities. When a new, denser platter generation is introduced, CMR and SMR benefit from it same.<p>4. A <i>huge<\/i> portion of the drive must be reserved as a non-SMR cache area  to mitigate the performance penalty SMR brings. Notice that this is an extra area that does not exist on a CMR drive so it reduces density increase SMR brings.<p>5. SMR drives have much larger DRAM cache to mitigate the performance penalty (64MB on a CMR drive vs 256MB on SMR drives), increasing the cost for that part.<p>6. Logic and mechanism of writes are much more complicated on a SMR drive than a CMR one. Drive is separated into different zones, data must be stored on a cache zone, then new data should be written into permanent zones in an optimal manner in background during idle time, managing different zones, cache area, rewrites, background tasks etc. all these makes the drive firmware much more complicated. Compared to a SSD firmware it is actually worse of both worlds: You&#x27;re getting all the complexity of a SSD firmware with a worse performance than a regular hard drive.<p>7. What is even more worrying than those technical details are that vendors are sinking more and more resources and pushing very hard on technologically dead-end SMR technology.  WD even wrote a PR piece called a &quot;Zoned storage initiative&quot; for trying to paint host managed SMR technology the future of storage and developed a linux filesystem called zonefs to back it up.<p>8. Despite all those shortcomings,  they don&#x27;t even sell SMR drives cheaper than CMR drives.<p>TL;DR: SMR is a harmful technological &quot;drug&quot; HDD vendors use to buy at most few years of time in platter density but with a very serious side effects."],"time":["2020-04-22 02:29:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gorbachev"],"id":[22961219],"kids":{},"parent":[22935563],"text":["Western Digital has updated the blog post after this HN post went up and listed the technology used by their different hard drives in an update at the top of the post.<p>All the backlash seems to have worked."],"time":["2020-04-23 22:51:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["squarefoot"],"id":[22940739],"kids":{},"parent":[22935563],"text":["Are those drives really safe for RAID-1 arrangements?

MCUs have gotten even cheaper. It&#x27;s now standard to have multiple tiers of sleep modes (standby, sleep, deep sleep). Multiple clock rates are becoming more popular - which enables on-demand heavy inferencing interspersed among periods of lower processor usage. CMOS sensors increasingly have on-chip motion detection[1] that uses less energy than full sensing. RF comms are being managed more efficiently as for most embedded devices it is the largest use of energy by orders of magnitude. Last but definitely not least, machine learning at the edge is a nascent application as we realize on-edge inferencing can avoid the aforementioned energy drain of sending huge amounts of data to the cloud.<p>Of course for mission-critical applications C is still the standard for firmware in the industry, but for many startups providing novel uses of edge computing and the plethora of hobby projects C++ is a solid choice.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntu.edu.sg&#x2F;home&#x2F;eechenss&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;conf-2011-A%20CMOS%20Image%20Sensor%20with%20on-chip%20Motion%20Detection%20and%20Object%20Localization.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntu.edu.sg&#x2F;home&#x2F;eechenss&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;conf-2011-A%20CM...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-09 17:32:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["logicchains"],"id":[24421687],"kids":[24421906,24422850],"parent":[24421061],"text":["It&#x27;s a testament to the hard work of the language designers and committee members that they&#x27;re able to grow the language at such a rapid pace.

If they could get 30% of $500B+, it would be more than half of their current annual revenue."],"time":["2020-09-09 05:58:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24416923],"kids":{},"parent":[24415907],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-09 05:55:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24416529],"kids":{},"parent":[24415907],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-09 05:05:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["chrismsimpson"],"id":[24416670],"kids":[24416752],"parent":[24415907],"text":["Meanwhile in other news, pot calls kettle black"],"time":["2020-09-09 05:21:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwawaynothx"],"id":[24416904],"kids":{},"parent":[24415907],"text":["&quot;For years, Epic took advantage of everything the App Store had to offer.

The light green lines are adiabats -- air rising or falling will follow along these lines until water condenses.  The big red line is temperature, and the big green one is dewpoint temperature -- where the lines touch there&#x27;s a cloud.<p>So what we have here are large inversion layers, where temperature increases with height.  Normally, the red line goes mostly straight up the graphy, as lowering pressure should lower temperature of air. And indeed, this creates a cap, where air above and below the edge of the inversion gets trapped.<p>These huge inversions are why the smoke is largely staying above the ground.  It rises hot from the fire, but any sinking would be countered by the buoyance of the air wanting to keep it up.  Mixing at the boundary layer is slow with this strong of an inversion.<p>But the inversion is also low, which means that the temperature differences with altitude can be extreme.  I&#x27;m on the coast in Ventura, but if you went up the hills in the same city, it would be 30°F&#x2F;17°C warmer at the same time.  And in LA, the 100-120°F highs a couple days ago.  We&#x27;re having Santa Ana winds that are literally blowing over the top of calm air below, because the pressure gradient is too weak to overcome the strong inversion.

Not badly, he said, just a little when you shoved hard on them. I warned him not to use his adjustable wrench on the tightening nuts. It was likely to damage the chrome and start small rust spots. He agreed to use my metric sockets and box-ends.<p>When he brought his motorcycle over I got my wrenches out but then noticed that no amount of tightening would stop the slippage, because the ends of the collars were pinched shut.<p>&quot;You’re going to have to shim those out,&quot; I said.<p>&quot;What’s shim?&quot;<p>&quot;It’s a thin, flat strip of metal. You just slip it around the handlebar under the collar there and it will open up the collar to where you can tighten it again. You use shims like that to make adjustments in all kinds of machines.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said. He was getting interested. &quot;Good. Where do you buy them?&quot;<p>&quot;I’ve got some right here,&quot; I said gleefully, holding up a can of beer in my hand.<p>He didn’t understand for a moment. Then he said, &quot;What, the can?&quot;<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; I said, &quot;best shim stock in the world.&quot;<p>I thought this was pretty clever myself. Save him a trip to God knows where to get shim stock. Save him time. Save him money.<p>But to my surprise he didn’t see the cleverness of this at all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.<p>As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred dollar BMW, the pride of a half-century of German mechanical finesse, with a piece of old beer can!<p>Ach, du lieber!<p>Since then we have had very few conversations about motorcycle maintenance. None, now that I think of it.<p>You push it any further and suddenly you are angry, without knowing why.<p>I should say, to explain this, that beer-can aluminum is soft and sticky, as metals go. Perfect for the application. Aluminum doesn’t oxidize in wet weather...or, more precisely, it always has a thin layer of oxide that prevents any further oxidation. Also perfect.<p>In other words, any true German mechanic, with a half-century of mechanical finesse behind him, would have concluded that this particular solution to this particular technical problem was perfect.<p>For a while I thought what I should have done was sneak over to the workbench, cut a shim from the beer can, remove the printing and then come back and tell him we were in luck, it was the last one I had, specially imported from Germany. That would have done it. A special shim from the private stock of Baron Alfred Krupp, who had to sell it at a great sacrifice. Then he would have gone gaga over it.<p>That Krupp’s-private-shim fantasy gratified me for a while, but then it wore off and I saw it was just being vindictive. In its place grew that old feeling I’ve talked about before, a feeling that there’s something bigger involved than is apparent on the surface. You follow these little discrepancies long enough and they sometimes open up into huge revelations. There was just a feeling on my part that this was something a little bigger than I wanted to take on without thinking about it, and I turned instead to my usual habit of trying to extract causes and effects to see what was involved that could possibly lead to such an impasse between John’s view of that lovely shim and my own. This comes up all the time in mechanical work. A hang-up. You just sit and stare and think, and search randomly for new information, and go away and come back again, and after a while the unseen factors start to emerge.<p>What emerged in vague form at first and then in sharper outline was the explanation that I had been seeing that shim in a kind of intellectual, rational, cerebral way in which the scientific properties of the metal were all that counted. John was going at it immediately and intuitively, grooving on it. I was going at it in terms of underlying form. He was going at it in terms of immediate appearance. I was seeing what the shim meant. He was seeing what the shim was. That’s how I arrived at that distinction. And when you see what the shim is, in this case, it’s depressing. Who likes to think of a beautiful precision machine fixed with an old hunk of junk?<p>-- Robert M.

While the Swedish Corona strategy is not explicitly designed to be contrarian at the world stage (and therefor get a lot of attention), the way Swedish mono-culture works is that the people who implement policy (as well as many citizens) chauvinistically and subconsciously believe that Sweden is somehow superior to other nations and at the same time believe that Sweden (as an exceptional country) has something to teach inferior countries (i.e all other countries).<p>So where we are right now is that we have this unhealthy feedback loop where Sweden initially did it&#x27;s own thing, and as it turned out to be different that has been a signal to policy makers that Sweden is right. Because Sweden is exceptional, so if the policy is different from inferior countries (i.e all other countries), it must be right.<p>I wish, probably more than anything else, that other countries would just stop giving Swedish policy makers this attention because then maybe, hopefully, our politicians can start to do what&#x27;s right for our citizens instead of what gets attention and talking points at the world stage.<p>This is far broader than Corona: Sweden gets way too much attention overall, because Swedish politicians and government communication employees have nailed &quot;marketing&quot; more than anything else. They crave this attention and they manufacture policy to get attention, at the expense of the people who live in the country. Often under the guise of marketing Sweden as a &quot;moral super power&quot;, superior to other nations.<p>So please, if you are for example a left leaning American, please don&#x27;t use Sweden as a political piece.

Now the virus is less deadly because there are fewer people left who are vulnerable to it.<p>At the start of the pandemic Anders Tegnel, the architect of Sweden&#x27;s response to the virus, did not believe that asymptomatic carriers existed [1], so Sweden&#x27;s Public Health Agency instructed health workers in care homes to only stay at home if they had symptoms and to not wear any PPE at work [2]. So they carried the virus into the care homes and a hecatomb of old people ensued.<p>Obviously, now that the most vulnerable are gone, the virus kills many fewer patients. Swedes don&#x27;t even need to have immunity to the virus, as such. They just need to be young and healthy enough to survive it if they get it. Not so much heard immunity, as herd culling.<p>For comparison, let&#x27;s take Greece, where I&#x27;m from and which is a country with a similar population to that of Sweden (about 10 million each). Greece imposed a draconian lockdown in early March, as soon as the severity of the pandemic became obvious (we are right next to Italy, after all). The result was about ~2500 infections and ~140 dead by 1st July when the lockdown was lifted [3]. Remember, that&#x27;s in a country with a similar population as Sweden (but with a much more touchy-feely, huggy-kissy, family-dinner Mediterrannean culture than Sweden). Now we&#x27;ve opened our borders and we&#x27;re doing business (= tourism) as usual. Infections have also risen, but deaths are still very low, in the single or low double digits daily, so that about 300 people have died <i>since the start of the pandemic<\/i>. It&#x27;s all pretty manageable and our health system is not overwhelmed.<p>We had a total lockdown, lost very few people, but we&#x27;re back in action and deaths are low despite rising infections. And without letting our old and vulnerable die in their thousands. We lost 300, Sweden lost 6,000.

Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county’s respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating, yields a total of 263,708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.  Adding the number of new cases due to the Rally in South Dakota estimated by synthetic control (3.6 per 1,000 population, scaled by the South Dakota population of approximately 858,000) brings the total number of cases to 266,796 or 19 percent of 1.4 million new cases.<p>&gt; If we conservatively assume that all of these cases were non-fatal, then these cases represent a cost of over $12.2 billion, based on the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case of $46,000 estimated by Kniesner and Sullivan (2020).<p>The Kniesner and Sullivan paper cited [2] gets to the value of $46,000 by using the Department of Transportation&#x27;s &quot;value per statistical life&quot; of about $10 million per death (scaled down to ~$11k per asymptomatic case), which is not a public health cost estimate. It&#x27;s probably far higher than what hospitals and the health system spends per case.<p>Not only that, but the paper claims, without any controls, that ALL case count increases in counties that sent lots of people to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in the weeks following it were caused by the Rally itself.

In that situation, parents may be splitting their time between watching their kids and helping with homework and working from home.  This is going to be a significant loss in terms of productivity for many people.  And also a big distraction.<p>Another aspect is just exactly what their job entails and what tools they are using.  If they have a job that involves a lot of face-to-face meetings and do not have a very good video chat software setup or have significant issues with internet, that is going to be a big loss for them.  Or maybe their chat software works fine but there is no proper way to set up the video meetings because they haven&#x27;t created a Discord or Slack.  So if the software or internet is not not configured or working well, that can be another issue.<p>A side aspect of that is if there is a manager who feels he is supposed to directly monitor and supervise (i.e. giv orders on the fly) and is used to doing so in person, but now does not have a convenient way to do so.

A good starting point for that is not to discourage having kids, but not particularly support it either. If its hard, that&#x27;s ok, the people who are ok with the difficulty will do it, and those that aren&#x27;t won&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ll have fewer new people to the benefit of ourselves and future generations.<p>I didn&#x27;t think this until several years ago, when I got the opportunity to work at an NGO focused on carbon neutral energy systems research. This gave me a lot of work time to explore what the US looks like today, and how that has changed over the past 50 years. One of my key random personal takeaways from several years exploring carbon chains, land use, etc, a takeaway shared with several of my colleagues who already had children, was that we had previously underestimated the degree to which quality of life in post-2000 (completely aside from quality of life for other species, which is a separate topic) is negatively impacted by the increased density of people.<p>For example, and there&#x27;s lots of stories you can tell like this, many people like having access to alone time in nature, and it&#x27;s a lot harder in 2020 than it was in 1970, simply because more people in the country =&gt; less natural &#x2F; fallow land. &quot;The woods behind the neighborhood&quot; is less and less a thing.<p>As an aside, my wife and I were considering having kids until I got exposed to these viewpoints, and they changed my mind. I think its better that my brother has kids, because he REALLY REALLY wanted to have them. And that&#x27;s great.

Here&#x27;s how we do it. First of all, you can&#x27;t retire at 30 on an entry level engineer salary (poetic license taken). Second, there are no child care benefits.<p>Instead, parents with kids split things up. One parent (usually the one who was earning less anyway) dials down their career, perhaps by going part time. The other parent dials up, by competing for promotions. For instance, it&#x27;s almost like clockwork that someone announces the birth of their first child, and shortly after that, they&#x27;ve become a project- or middle-manager, or they&#x27;ve gone to work somewhere else. A few years later, when their family life stabilizes, they might come back to engineering. That&#x27;s what I did.<p>This is a known economic effect. More than half of workers will change jobs for higher pay shortly after their first kid is born. There was a study of unskilled single women in a poor neighborhood in Chicago. After adjusting for everything else, the ones with kids tended to work for higher pay, changed jobs more often, and worked further from home.<p>This is all pre-COVID of course, but is how things have worked for decades.<p>Is this a good thing? Well, it stratifies the career ladder quite noticeably. How do you make it so that people with kids aren&#x27;t running the entire show?

People are upset that those with children are given more schedule flexibility than those who do not have children. It seems like straight up jealousy. Instead of resenting parents, resent your manager and ask for ( or demand) what you want.<p>The argument that other workers need to make up for the slack left by parents does not really make sense; you just add tasks to your backlog, and do them when you have time. You should be in control of your own schedule, and don&#x27;t let your manager just extend your workday. If your manager does not respect your time and is overworking you, quit. As engineers, we are not punching a time clock. If you are, take issue with that, not the flexibility some other coworkers are getting (flexibility that they need).<p>If you also want more schedule flexibility, push for it. Talk to your manager. Organize with your fellow employees. Organize with other engineers. Start a union (gasp!).<p>Work-life balance is always a balance. Our jobs should take note of what we do outside of work and how that affects our ability to work. We are people, not mindless, identical worker bees. Our life outside of work is most likely more important to us than our life at work.<p>Having children is very much unlike most other activities in that you cannot quit. You can quit a side hustle, you can quit a sport. But you can&#x27;t quit being a parent. So when a parent turns to their boss and says &quot;I need more flexibility&quot;, the manager has to give that flexibility or the worker is going to have to find a new job that does give that flexibility. Usually capitalism will extract as much time from a worker as possible, forcing the worker to give up many things in the name of work. It&#x27;s impossible to give up your child though, so obviously capitalism has to yield there. But with better labor organization, capitalism will yield to other things too.<p>If we all want schedule flexibility and more time so badly, let&#x27;s unionize and get that. Not resent our working parents, who most likely have more on their plate and less free time than non-parents, even with the flexibility."],"time":["2020-09-09 20:47:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TeeMassive"],"id":[24416509],"kids":{},"parent":[24393178],"text":["I&#x27;m going to be the devil&#x27;s advocate here.

Here is my take:<p>Ad platforms work in varying degrees for different products and companies. You should not dismiss an ad platform based on poor performance alone without understanding why it performed poorly.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like with airlines: If you boycott an airline for every minor offense, pretty soon you&#x27;ll have no option but to take the train.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s disingenuous to paint an entire ad platform--that does hundreds of millions in revenue[1]--as &quot;awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic&quot; based on a campaign that ran for just 1.5 days and resulted in 11 clicks. (They say they saw similar results from larger campaigns, but they don&#x27;t show them.)<p>But Ok, let&#x27;s say we take out the generalizations. I get that it&#x27;s disconcerting for any company to find they were charged for traffic that bounced within a second. In that case you need to look for the root cause, and see if it can be resolved or worked around.<p>In this case the root cause should be painfully obvious to experienced marketers like the authors: Most of the 11 clicks seems to be from mobile traffic (as seen in their Fullstory report), where it is remarkably easy for users to accidentally click on an ad in their news feed. They do mention this possibility in both the video and the title, but they seem to underestimate the likelihood of this being the root cause, and talk too much about bots instead. I&#x27;ve seen this exact misclick behavior in Twitter and for that reason I stopped advertising there.<p>Unlike Twitter, however, LinkedIn lets you work around this. They offer a &quot;lead gen&quot; campaign type, which requires two clicks (one on the ad, and one more on the &quot;submit form&quot; button) and sharing of contact information before the advertiser is charged. I&#x27;ve still seen funky results from this--such as users saying they don&#x27;t recall submitting any form--but in much fewer cases than with simple image ads.<p>Today, when I run LinkedIn campaigns, it is almost always with lead gen ads. The results are <i>far<\/i> better than this anecdotal post suggests. Some issues still come up, and I&#x27;ve found that attempting to troubleshoot them leads to a better outcome for the business than dismissing the entire ad platform.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ad-campaigns-fail&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ad-campaigns-fail&#x2F;<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;linkedin-statistics&#x2F;#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;linkedin-statistics&#x2F;#3<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 16:28:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["josefrichter"],"id":[24408113],"kids":[24408723,24408287,24409204,24408452,24416996,24413129,24410669],"parent":[24407432],"text":["LinkedIn is the weirdest product ever.

The original idea was that the entire memory would essentially be a single address space, with segments being blocks of memory that might be in core, on disk, or on tape (called very slow storage if I remember correctly but it’s been decades). Security was at the segment level, so you could for example have (in posix parlance) an suid shared library that an ordinary program could, with appropriate authentication and permissions, call into in a controlled manner.  Multics’ permission structure was more fine grained than the binary of suid.  You can see how the backup system kind of falls out of this automatically.  I trust some multician will step up and correct any memory-corruption-based thinkos in the above.<p>Of course reality didn’t quite match the dream and Multics was cancelled before some of that research could be completed.  But if you look at the x86 segment registers they could implement something like that.  I think this was also in the intel iapx-430 but fortunately even the name of that ancient dead processor is hazy in my mind.<p>As for the alto filesystem and its descendants: the labels don’t have to be next to the blocks they describe.  After all Unix filesystems have multiple copies of their basic breadcrumbs at least.  There’s certainly plenty of room for these in modern storage systems; every modern drive, whether  spinning or ssd, does a small amount of this in block remapping and wear leveling."],"time":["2020-09-09 04:24:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tyingq"],"id":[24413419],"kids":[24414087,24414860,24419962,24420171],"parent":[24412970],"text":["Was surprised not to see the VAX&#x2F;VMS filesystem on the list.

This won&#x27;t show up in onload or first meaningful paint, etc. So the first paint is fast, but then if you try to scroll immediately afterwards you&#x27;ll probably hit some jankyness while the rest of the page loads asynchronously (but only kind of asynchronously since there&#x27;s a single main thread).<p>Some other things that could cause the regression are that more people own a budget Android phone now than before. People may not realize how slow these phones are. The single core performance of the top budget phone, the Samsung A50, is comparable to an iPhone 6 which came out in 2015."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:43:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rhizome"],"id":[24414635],"kids":[24414817,24414885,24415250,24415393,24414736,24418482,24415431,24417943,24418410,24415144,24415306],"parent":[24413705],"text":["Yes, demonstrably and provably.

A part of the article acknowledges that this all depends on the device, etc., but this is ignored in the conclusion!<p>Let&#x27;s say that, as a first approximation, the first set of quotes is correct. I think most developers who look at user experience with respect to latency or performance today (or even ten years ago) would agree that we should not only consider the average and that we should also look at the tail. If we do so, we see that device age is increasing at the median and the tail, quite drastically in the tail even if we &quot;only&quot; look at p75 device age: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;android-updates&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;android-updates&#x2F;<\/a>.<p>If we consider a user who&#x27;s still using a 2013 Galaxy S4 and ask &quot;does your phone feel 5 times faster than it did in 2013?&quot;, based on some js benchmarks improving by 5x, I think they&#x27;ll laugh in our face. I&#x27;ve used a couple of Android devices that I tried to keep up to date (to the extent that&#x27;s possible on Android) and each one became unbearably slow after taking some big Android update. Those updates probably included improvements in the Android Runtime as well as V8, and yet, the net effect was not positive. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this -- if you read any forum where people discuss taking updates for the phones, one of the most common complaints is that their previously usable phone became unusable due to performance degradations caused by the update.<p>Sure, my personal user experience on my daily-driver phone is ok on my phone because I have very fast phone and I&#x27;m often using it from fast wifi. But it&#x27;s terrible if I take a road trip across the U.S. and the experience is terrible anywhere in the U.S. with an old phone. I don&#x27;t think we should just write off the experiences of people with old phones or who live in places where they can&#x27;t get high-speed internet even if life is good for people like me when I&#x27;m at home on my 1Gb connection. When I looked at this with respect to bandwidth and latency (inspired by a road trip where I found every website from a major tech company to be unusable, excluding a few Google properties), I found that, on a slow connection like you get in many places in the U.S., websites can easily take more than 1 minute to load in a controlled benchmark: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;web-bloat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;web-bloat&#x2F;<\/a>. My experience in real life (where I probably had higher variance in both latency, packet loss, and effective bandwidth) was that many websites simply wouldn&#x27;t load.<p>One thing this post looks at is the 75%-ile onLoad time. When I travel through the U.S. on the interstate (major throughfares which will, in general, have better connectivity than analogous places off of major throughfares) most pages are so slow that they don&#x27;t even load at all, so those attempts aren&#x27;t counted in the statistics! I don&#x27;t dispute that things are getting faster for the median user or even the 75%-ile slow user if you measure that in a specific way, but there are plenty of users whose experiences are getting worse who won&#x27;t even be counted in this stat that&#x27;s in the post because their experience is too slow to even get counted in the stats."],"time":["2020-09-09 02:40:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TeeMassive"],"id":[24416620],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":["&gt; Mobile page weight increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020.

Web pages have gone from very slow to unusable very quick.<p>I believe and appreciate that the users most people target have faster devices now, especially in the core hubs of Web development like Silicon Valley. However, this trend of &quot;we can fit more data in because devices are faster&quot; is horrible for anyone already behind in available technology or even on a limited data plan.<p>My father uses my old smartphone, a Oneplus One with the latest release of LineageOS. This device runs a Qualcom 801, a chip that was considered to have flagship speeds t the time of its release. WiFi speeds are over 100mbps, but websites and applications are still getting slow somehow.<p>Even a mid-range or cheap smartphone has a better GPU than older devices, and there are many of those out there. The advice to test on budget smartphones is solid, but people often go out and buy a new cheap phone instead of using something that was popular a few years ago. People who can&#x27;t afford or don&#x27;t see the value in getting a new S20 don&#x27;t necessarily have cheap smartphones, they often have second hand phones or hand-me-downs as well. Frameworks like Flutter and browser engines using canvas are very noticeably slow on those older devices because of the advancements GPU tech has made, as CPU tech improvements in smartphones have begun to slow down over the years.<p>Is the web slower? No, not for the people you want to sell your product to. The question is, why should we accept this bloat? Web applications can be as slow as you want to make them with festures and pretty designs for all I care, but the web in general doesn&#x27;t need two megabytes of javascript to render a manual or a forum post. The metrics discussed here are wrong in the context they were originally used in, so the article does have a point. However, I don&#x27;t think we should say the web hasn&#x27;t gotten slower because computers have increased speeds to compensate with the load. Every byte you save, every script you ignore, every image you compress can have significant impact on hundreds of millions of not billions. If you can&#x27;t justify that to your team lead, use the argument that the less resources you use, the better the users&#x27; battery lives are and the more responsive a site feels. The impact is about the same."],"time":["2020-09-09 08:17:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24414728],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-09 01:11:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["bobloblaw45"],"id":[24414733],"kids":{},"parent":[24413705],"text":["Give almost any local news website a shot.
