Besides the fact the premiums are onerous, it is the health insurance carriers that evaluate if and how much insurance will cover an expenditure, usually after a copay and possibly coinsurance has been paid. To say nothing of ever-growing deductible limits. On top of that, the Trump Administration is working overtime to purge what little insurance benefits are provided via Obamacare (in it&#x27;s quest to eliminate any legacy of the Obama Administration). Unfortunately, the GOP is woefully short on replacement ideas. One does get the idea--in the true spirit of the Republican Party--the replacement will consist of costly, high-deductible health insurance that will include many exclusions from its coverage.<p>All this begs the question: quality of life in the US, especially for the middle class, is crashing compared to our friends in other industrialized nations. Why middle class especially? Because the middle class is most likely to have an employer-sponsored plan that has deductibles and exclusions. In fact, most of those carrying employer sponsored health insurance never really know how much of the  bill insurance will cover. Poor and indigent people, in many states, can still obtain health care without insurance and many states have funds just for this so the bill is paid by the tax payers in one form or another.<p>And since the healthcare complex is an aggressive lobby in Washington, this situation is not likely to change.

And to those Democrats who say millions of people who have employer-sponsored health insurance love their coverage and don&#x27;t want to give it up, I say poppycock!

But that&#x27;s not the core of OOP, that&#x27;s some weird crap people piled on top of OOP in the 90&#x27;s.<p>Object-oriented programming, fundamentally, is about associating code with the data it manipulates. Code + data = object. Two essential follow-ons:<p>* Encapsulation: Your object provides an interface composed of methods, without allowing callers to reach in and mess with the data inside except by calling those methods. This allows your implementation to evolve without breaking callers.<p>* Abstraction&#x2F;polymorphism: Objects with different implementations can implement the same interface thus making them interchangeable. This enables code which operates on such objects to be reused across wildly different use cases.<p>These fundamentals exist in basically all large systems. Example: Linux file descriptors are objects. Different kinds of file descriptors (e.g. disk files vs. sockes) implement the same interface (syscalls, e.g. read&#x2F;write), and you cannot reach directly into their implementation from userspace, which allows the kernel implementation to evolve over time. You really can&#x27;t <i>not<\/i> use OOP in these scenarios.<p>The opposite of OOP is separating code from data. In anti-OOP, you declare your data structure completely transparently, without declaring any kind of &quot;methods&quot; that apply to it. Code modules interoperate by operating on the same underlying structure. This tends to lead to sclerosis as adding new features to the data structure without breaking existing code can be quite difficult.<p>My hot take: The philosophy of REST (though less often the actual implementation) is disturbingly anti-OOP."],"time":["2020-09-03 01:50:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["decafninja"],"id":[24357629],"kids":{},"parent":[24356978],"text":["I think OOP is fine.<p>What people really hate is &quot;enterprise OOP&quot; and its related ecosystem.<p>It&#x27;s like Agile.

Just as you wouldn’t kill a fly with a sledgehammer, you wouldn’t choose a big, heavy OOP language like Java to write up a simple script to copy some files around, would you? No, Python or Perl would be better suited for such things. But using scripting language for large Enterprise-level software begins to fall apart at some point. Suddenly you’ll find yourself wishing that you could name and encapsulate data structures, and then perhaps extend the functionality of a module, and you might even find yourself mimicking concepts of classical inheritance - and eventually you’ll end up with a mess that would have been much cleaner with some kind of OOP. Take Javascript, for example. In the days before ES6, many large JS Enterprise libraries were written with strange prototype hacks that did their best to mimic classical inheritance with varying degrees of success. A framework called Dojo tried solving this with convoluted constructs like “declare”; Whole transpiled languages like TypeScript and Coffeescript were created just to make it easier for developers to write “clean” classic OOP-style code. My point is, OOP is and has been useful in all manner of problem solving, and no matter how hard we try, we always come back to it in some way. Perhaps the question of why it’s so prevalent is misguided, driven by misunderstandings, culture, trends, and a desire to shun what’s old and promote what’s new."],"time":["2020-09-03 01:13:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geophile"],"id":[24357643],"kids":{},"parent":[24356978],"text":["People like and use useful abstractions, and OO offers them: encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, inheritance.

Here we go, here I am commenting on a subject on which _everybody_ has an opinion. A lot of people say that &quot;OOP&quot; is just a tool. Or that it is overused. Or that it isn&#x27;t used properly. I will say that even though I sometimes use objects I am not a fan of almost every &quot;object-oriented&quot; codebase that I&#x27;ve had to work with. The issue is that OOP is presented as an abstraction that, if you understood it, would provide for good readable code. The way I judge good principle is whether when, inevitably, junior to mid-level programmers start working on the codebase will they be able to preserve some amount of sounds structure. I would say that OOP offers very little here, as I&#x27;ve seen even senior developers write what to them was &quot;good OOP code&quot; but in practice nobody could work with.<p>Here are some things that OOP does not give you:<p>* Is your state normalized, i.e. saved only in one place? You do not know.<p>* Is your execution predictable? Parent to child? And how do you do it when it&#x27;s reversed.<p>* What should be public and modifiable and what should be intermediate state internal to the object. And should intermediate computed values be stored next to values determining the true state of your application? (even though there are &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; modifiers it is quiet difficult to determine what is truly public and cannot be modified through some method. This makes it more difficult to understand what the state of your application truly is and what are intermediate convenience values).<p>* Are there limitations on passing state around? Or can large chunks of state be passed to multiple actors in the form of classes who change it concurrently or might store it for later use?<p>* How much state should be in a single class? In other words: how many classes can a class encapsulate and how complex could those classes be?<p>* Should something that has no state be an object or just a function (in some languages you are not given the option at true, but can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s awesome).<p>* Should you be allowed to use event buses and how to prevent spaghettification? (cause events really are akin modern goto statements).<p>* etc.<p>Basically the ability to compose the state, type and methods is so wildly open-ended that almost always what I see is just an ever expanding convoluted bloat of state spread ts chaotically that it become extremely difficult to see what the state of your application is at any moment. Everybody has their own idea of what an object _is_, what should be an object and how they should come together. And that is for every developer on the team. So you can follow the absolute best of OOP practices and still end up with a mess.<p>Let&#x27;s look at a counter-example. It is not a system that claims to be universally usable but that is the point. I&#x27;ll use the, quiet banal, example of React. Yes, it is a framework, and in a way it does have objects, but really it borrows heavily from functional programming in the sense that it says that state is king and the single most important thing in your program. That you _must_ have strong constraints as to how your state is created, organized and modified. (In contrast to a class, which is state that you can pass around as much as you want and the whole codebase could modify it at will).<p>* The application is always a predictable tree of dependencies.<p>* State is either stored separately altogether (using a state-store such as redux, mobx, etc.) or bound to a particular element in the tree hierarchy.<p>* State only flows down the tree, ideally immutably.<p>* A component (unlike a class) cannot modify state of anything outside of itself.<p>* Only &quot;has-a&quot; relationships are allowed - no polymorphism.<p>* Only event can be passed up.<p>* State is essentially a collection of easily inspectable primitives. Meaning that even though a component can _contain_ another component a class is not a valid member of component state.<p>While a system like this could be built using OOP primitives (classes). Nothing about OOP suggests this system. Yes, you can build it, but can build something absolutely unrelated. And, really, it enforces things that are the antithesis of many things that &quot;proper OOP&quot; espouses.<p>Perhaps the main thing of any system is to create a predictable and well-structured relationship between elements of state. I think that wonderful examples of the basis of such a system are Go and Rust. To be honest, I barely know the languages, but from what I see is that they make _type_ the most central element of the language. If you have your types well-defined and be separate from how the types are used you are already suggesting many things that could prevent state-sprawl. A struct defines the basic primitive around which your program is based.<p>* Struct has no private intermediately computed values. If you do not want to recompute something - memoize, do not bloat the state with random data that is inseparable from you base state.<p>* Structs provide a very predictable &quot;has-a&quot; top-down dependency between state<p>* No inheritance, so composition is enforced.<p>* Keeping types and functions that operate on those types makes it very explicit what a function does - is it a method or is it a function?"],"time":["2020-09-03 01:12:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["boltzmann_brain"],"id":[24358754],"kids":{},"parent":[24356978],"text":["I think it&#x27;s because it is excellent for building layers and layers of useless indirection and abstraction that solve no problems, and software engineers love and prefer that to looking at data, as they should, and solving actual problems at hand. ;)"],"time":["2020-09-03 00:06:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["throw1234651234"],"id":[24357319],"kids":[24357365,24357444],"parent":[24356978],"text":["Because you can do functional programming in OOP.

For container libraries in C, you really have to use them to get a feel for their usability (this sounds like a tautology but it&#x27;s not.)<p>I disagree strongly with one recommendation. This is just an example, but it holds for larger API design in general:<p>&gt; we could add a fallback to reading &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random. [...] However, in this case, the increased portability would require a change in interface. Since fopen() or fread() on &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random could fail, our function would need to return bool.<p>No, definitely not. It is dangerous to expect the application to sanely handle the case of randomness being unavailable when it is never going to occur in practice. On all POSIX platforms, &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random exists and will block until sufficient entropy is available. Something would have to go seriously wrong for this to fail. This is so rare that any error handling code for it will never be tested. The most likely outcome of forcing the caller to handle it is that the return value is ignored or improperly handled and the buffer is used uninitialized, leading to a security vulnerability.<p>My recommendation instead would be to error check your fopen() and fread() calls within get_random_bytes(), and print an error and abort() if they fail. This way if someone&#x27;s system is improperly configured and &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random doesn&#x27;t work the program will just crash.

For example, there was a completely false and made up claim on social media and in publications that should know better that the Education Secretary had said taking the results would cause students to be promoted into jobs that they weren&#x27;t competent to do: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fullfact.org&#x2F;education&#x2F;gavin-williamson-fake-quote&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fullfact.org&#x2F;education&#x2F;gavin-williamson-fake-quote&#x2F;<\/a> I can&#x27;t imagine that it would&#x27;ve gone down any better if he claimed students would get onto courses they weren&#x27;t good enough for, yet a week later after GCSEs went the other way and used predicted results that exact claim was uncritically regurgitated by the media."],"time":["2020-09-02 11:42:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["supernova87a"],"id":[24351551],"kids":[24351715,24351749],"parent":[24351011],"text":["This virus situation has (or will) produce a lost year of productivity.

But I take a lot of photos as well as long videos and heaps and heaps of screenshots from articles that I read. The internal SSD on my MacBook Air is only 128GB, so I had to resort to an external drive. With huge amounts of images and photos in a Photos library macOS keeps wanting to scan through all of them and it spends forever to do so.<p>I began creating new Photos libraries but at that point Photos libraries begin to feel rather pointless. In order to find photos I’d have to sift through multiple libraries and each of them would want to scan the whole library again.<p>Aside from that the big annoyance with importing into Photos (instead of syncing) is that it does not transfer albums and favorites, it only transfers the media files.<p>So I was manually selecting photos and organizing stuff but that takes time so I put off transferring photos and videos and screenshots from my phone for a couple of months.<p>Very recently I finally found an application for macOS that uses the iPhone backup protocol in order to transfer whole albums and favorites. But it cost $60 so I was hesitant to buy it because I was very low on money so it was a significant amount. Instead I started doing a full backup of the device. About 30% through the process my phone goes in to a reboot loop.<p>I speak with an Apple store, I speak with Apple and I speak with a data recovery specialist company. The data recovery specialist company told me that from the description I was giving them about what had happened, it was highly probable that data had been corrupted and that this would make it impossible to recover anything. They could have a look at it for a fee of $150 they said, and recovery if possible would cost between $400 and $1000. Naturally this was way above what I could afford. So I went through with factory reset on my own instead, which means accepting that the data was gone.<p>I lost a couple of months worth of photos and videos and screenshots. Which sucks. At the same time though, nothing much exciting happened in these months anyway so it’s not a disaster either. But I would have preferred to not lose the data because there were a select few memories in there from that time that would have been nice to keep.<p>I am also growing worried about my data in general, as the drives I use are starting to age. I can’t afford new drives at the moment but began looking at renting storage from Hetzner.<p>Anyways, in terms of what’s on the phone I now have iCloud photos turned back on on the 5GB plan and try to transfer regularly using the macOS third-party application that I mentioned. After losing the data on my phone I shelled out those $60 for said application. It’s still a bit more cumbersome of a procedure compared to storing more in iCloud but at the same time I think this is pretty ok. This way, as long as I keep transferring to my computer when iCloud is full I always have the photos transferred or they are in iCloud. And then after I transfer them to the compute I delete them from the phone.<p>Ironically as I am typing this I ran out of storage again earlier today, but I am going to transfer the photos and videos that are currently on my phone as soon as I get home. And if my phone should misbehave again, or I lose the phone or whatever, well at least this time it’s a few hours worth of data that I am losing and not a couple of months worth."],"time":["2020-09-22 09:07:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sneak"],"id":[24552502],"kids":[24553163,24552765],"parent":[24550197],"text":["Periodic reminder:<p>Most data in iCloud, including device backups (that includes full message history) and Photos, is <i>not<\/i> end to end encrypted and can be accessed by Apple without a warrant.<p>They provide this data upon request automatically to the US military and federal government without a warrant."],"time":["2020-09-22 11:19:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tuananh"],"id":[24552670],"kids":[24553505],"parent":[24550197],"text":["i use icloud photo just for buffering between devices.<p>my setup is like this<p>- photos from my phone&#x2F;my wife&#x27;s phone backed up to NAS whenever we&#x27;re home (geo-fencing).<p>- those photos got backup to cloud<p>- TODO: backup to my parent&#x27;s NAS maybe"],"time":["2020-09-22 11:49:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24552331],"kids":{},"parent":[24550197],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-22 10:50:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["hestefisk"],"id":[24554126],"kids":[24554354,24554382],"parent":[24552645],"text":["For those interested, I have created an FAQ on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossnode.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossnode.net&#x2F;<\/a> to get started.

He also completed his PhD at Stanford, founded two companies that were both acquired by Cisco, and has been named MIT Innovator of the year. A man of science and reason, and a person who places a premium on ideas, you would imagine.<p>&gt; Much like Iyer, John Doe also graduated from IIT.<p>&gt; The lawsuit alleges that the upper-caste Iyer recognised John Doe and instantly began ridiculing him in front of all the other higher-caste Indian employees at Cisco, saying that John Doe was a Dalit and only got into the engineering school because of affirmative action, which India implemented in 1980 under the then-Prime Minister VP Singh.<p>This behavior is absolutely not acceptable.<p>I want to provide some context to avoid the narrative being dragged into areas that are unproductive.<p>IITs are like the Ivy League Universities in India. Admissions into IIT are based on a notoriously competitive entrance exam - it’s common for people to take a multiple year break after high school just to prepare for this exam. For those who end up scoring high enough to get into the IIT, it ends up being the defining achievement of their lives.<p>There’s also an elitist attitude that plagues many IIT graduates. Wrap your head around the idea that there are dating&#x2F;match making services that are exclusive to IIT graduates. It’s pretty bad.<p>The implementation details of the Indian affirmative action programs are such that underrepresented communities are ranked separately from the rest. On these lists, the competition is less fierce.<p>There is a lot of resentment around this from multiple sides - it’s sort of similar to the recent lawsuits against Harvard for discriminating against Asians.<p>For various reasons, Brahmins have a multigenerational advantages when taking the IIT entrance exams. They are over represented in the top 500 scores for example.<p>I say all this because it’s important to understand the nuances of India’s cultural problems.

So I recommend you follow these guidelines:<p>* Build your software as if it is a house where you can add more rooms as it grows. Ensure that software architecture is modular, each module should be capable of working independently from each other. You will further atomise modules through classes. So basically composition goes like this: Software -&gt; Module -&gt; Classes -&gt; Methods.\nYou absolutely need to get modules right. Mistakes made at class level can be easily corrected but it is harder to separate module level entanglement.<p>* Variable&#x2F;function names should be self explanatory.  Don’t name them too short or too long, they shouldn’t confuse&#x2F;waste the time of other people working on the project.<p>* Code clarity is extremely important. Don’t write hard to understand code unless it is an absolute necessity. Premature optimisation is bad but you can do premature optimisation so long as it doesn’t affect code clarity. Otherwise leave optimising code to last stage.<p>* DevOp tools like docker incredibly increase the production speeds and overall software quality. So try to keep up with these but don’t go 100% on them as they might also increase the complexity. Gradually add devops tools to your project as it grows. You probably don’t need to implement every single DevOps tools.

There&#x27;s no substitute for bash, especially in robotics when you&#x27;re working with embedded Linux systems all the time. You&#x27;ll quickly pick up commands you like, and from that scripting things will really help build some experience and give you a good &quot;sandbox&quot; to play in.<p>2) Most robotics systems end up either being <i>immensely<\/i> complex, or simpler than you think. Most of the complex systems aren&#x27;t the same ones used in the rest of the world, since with the exception of self-driving cars and now the NVIDIA Jetson computers, you don&#x27;t have enough compute to run the complicated stuff. Raw C++ code will probably run fast enough. As a result, a lot of the stuff-you-use-for-web-apps-that-you-might-have-to-scale-to-millions-of-people won&#x27;t come into play. Instead, doing things like setting static IP addresses or debugging a serial port connection pop up a lot more.<p>3) Software has a nasty habit of getting complicated sooner than you&#x27;d like. As others have mentioned, testing is really, really important. Whatever your preferred language is, I&#x27;d suggest you spend a lot of time figuring out your preference for how to easily and repeatedly ask &quot;does this do what I think it does&quot;. Unit tests help a lot, as do. Without trying to shove it down your throat, this is one of the reasons why I do a lot of coding in Rust--the package manager and its unit test tooling is all built in and makes checking my assumptions much easier.<p>4) Probably avoid a bunch of posts written on either LinkedIn, and to a lesser degree, Medium. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen it in other areas, but coding in particular seems really prone to have pieces written by people whose main goal is to show that they did something, not teach other people how or explain the nitty-gritty you&#x27;ll need. On the other hand, some people&#x27;s personal blogs are <i>gold<\/i>, and I suggest you figure out a way of saving good content in a way that lets you find it again.<p>5) And finally, try to find some places where you&#x27;ll feel comfortable asking questions. Some languages or frameworks have forums, other have sub-reddits, others still have Discord&#x2F;Zulip&#x2F;etc. chats.

Writing real tests forces you to think about testing your code, solve problems in tests, make tests run quickly, etc.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;re working on a team, so you&#x27;re also looking at the work that others do and critiquing it and they&#x27;re critiquing you. You&#x27;re looking for actionable critiques, &quot;if you change X, you get Y,&quot; which should help you learn the idioms your peers use and an intuition for why one way of doing it is better.<p>2. Learn from your standard libraries.<p>Generally your standard libraries are the best code you&#x27;ll see. Popular open source libraries, especially ones that are de facto standard libraries, are a close second. Even when they aren&#x27;t how you&#x27;d like to write your code, there&#x27;s a lot of wisdom in the compromises they made.

A few ideas:<p>~ Pair programming with an experienced programmer, if possible. If not, try to work on a project (even an open source one) with someone who is an experienced software developer and who does comprehensive code reviews. Code reviews from articulate, experienced developers are an excellent way to learn.<p>~ Write lots of code. Write code in new areas unrelated to your job. Try to find some small project or projects to do. Once you&#x27;re done, reflect on what you&#x27;ve done and what you could do better next time.<p>~ Read books like Clean Code. It might also be wise to pick up a book on design patterns, particularly if you&#x27;ll be working much in object-oriented languages like Java, C#, or C++.<p>~ Always read source code when possible. Using a new tool at work? If it&#x27;s open source, go check out the code. Starting a new project? Go find similar projects on Github and browse the code. You could also find some well-known open source projects and read through their code. A good book for ideas on which open source projects to focus on is called The Architecure of Open Source Projects (there are two volumes, shown at the bottom of this page: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aosabook.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aosabook.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.html<\/a>)<p>~ Learn other programming paradigms, such as functional programming (maybe learn Haskell, or Scheme) or logic programming (learn Prolog). You may never use such languages in your work, but languages in other paradigms will provide you with both a better understanding of computation, and a bag full of useful techniques and ideas for your working language(s).<p>The next component is how to improve your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and other topics rooted in theoretical computer science.<p>~ Consider doing problems from sites like leetcode.com and hackerrank.com.<p>~ The book _Algorithms_ by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne is very good, as is their free two-part course algorithms and data structures offered on Coursera (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;algorithms-part1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;algorithms-part1<\/a>).<p>~ Work all the way through the online book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;sicp&#x2F;full-text&#x2F;book&#x2F;book.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;sicp&#x2F;full-text&#x2F;...<\/a>). It will not only touch on a number of important theoretical computer science topics, but you&#x27;ll \nalso get some good exposure to functional programming.<p>Finally, to learn commonly used technologies you see on HN, such as Docker or Kubernetes, you&#x27;ll just need to get your hands dirty:<p>~ Rent a $5 server on Digital Ocean, or set up a home server, running a Linux distro like Debian or Ubuntu (which often makes installation easier), and start experimenting with them.<p>~ Continue following HN and reading about new technologies and programming languages.<p>~ Realize that it&#x27;s critical for software developers to constantly learn new technologies. Otherwise, they very often become unemployable after a decade or two. HOWEVER, it&#x27;s also critical that devs exercise restraint and good judgment when selecting technologies for important projects. For such projects, it&#x27;s usually better to choose languages and technologies that have a proven record and that you personally have a good understanding of, over some new technology that&#x27;s getting a lot of attention on HN.<p>With respect to all three of these components, it&#x27;s a very good idea to maintain a blog and write about your experiences and projects. A blog will serve to not only consolidate your new knowledge, but also to improve your writing and help your career (a good technical blog will be a strong positive signal toward potential employers).<p>Don&#x27;t worry about not having a traditional education in computer science. Lots of excellent senior devs I&#x27;ve worked with have no formal training in computer science. As long as you&#x27;re motivated to constantly learn new languages, technologies, and techniques, and master the ones you already know, then few people will care (or even know) whether or not you have a CS degree."],"time":["2020-09-22 16:49:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m3kw9"],"id":[24557215],"kids":{},"parent":[24551229],"text":["“Better” depends on who and what you work for.

They solve specific problems that teams encounter in one part of the software industry. Engineers writing device drivers at Apple will have a different set of tools, practices and coding standards for example - if they optimize for running tests in the factory and reducing the drain on the battery, it will be a different set of complications that will create the gap between textbook code and what’s deployed. Apple’s production quality code will look extremely different from Facebook’s because the complexities are different.<p>There is a small part of the gap between textbook and real world code that is not caused by domain specific nuances. It’s pretty easy to pick up those skills:<p>1. Use a code formatter like clang-format and&#x2F;or a linter. Pick a coding style and stay consistent with it.<p>2. Write code to communicate intent. Name your variables and your methods so that the resulting code reads as close to prose as possible.  Write your code in a way that someone you’ve never spoken to can easily figure out what’s going on and modify your code.<p>3. Design your APIs first. Think long and hard about your API, how it will be used, how it can be tested against, how it can be extended in the future. Read “The design of every day things” by Don Norman and pick up on what is good design.<p>4. Related to 3, design your API (and implement) them in a way that’ll allow as much of your code to be unit tested as possible. Have an algorithm that will run when your robot hits a wall? Pull your algorithm into a separate file, with its own API in such a way that you can compile that algorithm into a second “test” program that’ll feed it some inputs and check if it produced the expected output. Use a code coverage tool (google gcov) to see how much of your code is covered by unit tests. Aim for 98% or higher. The “should I move these lines of code to a new function” is then easily answered with “will a new function (in maybe a new file) help me increase my code coverage in unit tests?”<p>5. Write your code so that tiny errors blow up into catastrophic failures as quickly and as loudly as possible. Add error messages everywhere. Add asserts and static_assets everywhere. You are going to spend a lot of time tweaking and testing your code - if any change triggers a failure anywhere else - you want it to fail with a really really loud bang so that you are more likely to notice (and debug) it.<p>6. Avoid creating skews&#x2F;variants in your code. don’t have a debug version and a release version - write code that you can test, deploy code that you have tested (exactly the same code, with no changes)<p>This will get you over that gap between text books and real world.

The fact that a significant portion of HN is engaged in modern web backend development doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only significant area of engineering.<p>&gt; So, how do I write better code?<p>Short answer: be lazy and hate work.<p>Fixing bugs is work. Instead of just fixing it, find out how you could&#x27;ve used the type system or API design to prevent yourself from making this bug in the first place. Fixing this bug is work. Preventing yourself from making the bug in the first place is saving yourself of doing the work.<p>Rewriting your old code when you get new requirements is work — learn how to build an app architecture that would make this amount of work minimal.<p>Writing code is work. Maintaining code is work. If you manage to complete your tasks using less code, you&#x27;ll have less work.<p>Manual testing is work. Writing unit tests is saving your time. Learning how to write tests so you won&#x27;t have to rewrite them when your requirements change reduces the amount of work you have to do even more. And leveraging the type system to maintain some invariants about your code saves you even more work.<p>Communicating with your colleagues and answering their questions is work. So, learn how to write code that is easy to understand. Writing comments is work too, so if you manage to write a code that is so clear that it doesn&#x27;t need comments, you&#x27;ll save yourself from even more work. Writing great documentation will save you time on work chats.<p>Of course a big difference between being lazy and being irresponsible.

Think of it as a way to package and deliver value without the fuss.<p>How to write better code:<p>- Read good code: clone repositories of proven software that you use, and read from it from time to time.<p>- Curiosity: when you use software, you may encounter functionality and wonder about it. If you have the code for that software, you can look how it was implemented and architected. Doing a git blame and finding the first commit where something was introduced is educational. You can then advance commit by commit to see how it played out.<p>- Vocabulary: sometimes you don&#x27;t know something and you can&#x27;t even look it up because you don&#x27;t know the word for it. For example, there are concepts like &#x27;message passing&#x27; or &#x27;multiple dispatch&#x27; that I have pondered on for quite some time before knowing what they were called. I was trying to formulate a search query to find what that way of coding was. The same thing happened to me when I wanted to learn how to think better and improve my cognition. I had tormented myself thinking &#x27;is there a field from which I can learn to think about my own thinking. Cognition on my cognition&#x27;. I felt stupid when I stumbled upon it and found it was simply called &#x27;metacognition&#x27;. Sometimes I was luckier. For instance, after observing how some software can add new functionality from pieces created by third parties, I knew I wanted to learn how to do that. When I was a child, I found it really cool that you could make a Winamp skin, and Winamp would transform to that skin even though the Winamp folks ignore everything about your existence. They didn&#x27;t need to integrate your skin. I found that to be really powerful. I had the docs for win32api, and found it amazing I could use it to access system functionality, etc. When I wanted to transform a Doc to PDF, I installed an extension and Microsoft Word knew where to display it and what to do with it. Same with applications. The underlying themes are APIs, extensibility. The materializations are plugins, extensions and applications. The supporting principles are good abstractions, and open&#x2F;closed principle, dynamic loading, and interfaces.<p>It helps to structure the thought into &#x27;themes&#x27;. Extensibility theme, for example. And then categories, like a plugin architecture. Keep those and link new things you learn to those themes. These compound and find their way in your new software.<p>- Write the documentation or the use guide first. A description of how your <i>yet<\/i> to exist software is used. You write &#x27;X does this, here is how you use it&#x27;. If everything were possible, what would the usage be ? How would a user interact with it. Write it, then code the simplest version that does the job.<p>- Don&#x27;t be unproductively hard on yourself. Pick any amazingly successful software and do a &#x27;git log --reverse&#x27; to see the first commits on top.

It&#x27;s the process by which the PWA specs were designed in the first place.<p>There are more than a handful of cases across the past decade where a new &quot;web standard&quot; didn&#x27;t emerge through the usual standardization process — proposal, discussion, experimental implementations, feedback, etc. Instead, these &quot;standards&quot; were developed directly in one of the browsers, shipped, and then promoted as a feature that developers should begin targeting, totally bypassing the usual process, with the tacit expectation that other browsers would be forced to follow. Apple did this with &lt;canvas&gt; and some aspects of CSS3 to help with their push away from Flash. Google did this with many the PWA APIs.<p>All along, as the PWA APIs have been released from the Chrome lab, there&#x27;s been a certain contingent of developers who heap scorn upon the Safari team for not implementing these APIs too — as though the existence in Chrome (and, in some cases, Firefox, who tend to follow-fast as a survival instinct), plus the Chrome team dropping specs off at the W3C working groups, were cause enough for these APIs to be regarded as &quot;standard&quot;. The error of these devs is confusing ubiquity and standard.<p>Most PWA features are, at current, about as standard as ActiveX was. They were designed by Google in private, to suit their own ecosystem goals. They might be good for the web, by providing an alternative to native apps — but they might also be bad for the web, by forcing browsers to serve as an app platform instead of a hypermedia user agent.<p>Sadly, we don&#x27;t get to have that very important, very nuanced discussion.

Apple have won similar battles with other &quot;standards&quot; (for instance, there&#x27;s a similar split in opinion around Flash, but until recently the &quot;Flash deserved to die&quot; contingent have been dominant, which suits Apple just fine).<p>So why did PWAs fail to take off? I would argue that it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re a significant alteration of what the web is meant to be. They&#x27;re a big step toward defining the web as a full-throated application runtime. I don&#x27;t know that the rest of the web ecosystem is on board with that redefinition. At least not yet, and not merely because Google tried to will it into being.

In my final year however, I had a full-time position doing research with CSIRO, which is a leading research organisation in Australia.

There was constant bickering and frustration around getting funding (a common sentiment in the division I worked in was that you had pander to big mining&#x2F;oil companies and propose research topics with clear financial gain for them). It was not a happy place to be, and at the end of my time there I jumped head first in to a software job instead.<p>I later found time to still do mathematics on my own, and have written about that journey and shared it previously on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;mathematics-self-learner\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;mathematics-self-learner<\/a> and have had some other little successes in my life that make me feel like I made the right choice: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;how-i-built-bbsmart\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;how-i-built-bbsmart<\/a><p>Tangentially, this I think is also why I&#x27;m more open to hearing ideas from organisations like Numenta, and seeing research done outside of academia by folks like Stephen Wolfram.

In recent decades, there has been a push to evaluate public services in private sector terms, i.e., basically, economic profitability (and in particular, short-term profitability). At least in my country, this is quite explicit, but I suppose it happens everywhere to a greater or lesser extent. There is a lot of public discourse that academia cannot be an ivory tower, it has to constantly be evaluated and provide proof that what it&#x27;s doing is useful. It&#x27;s difficult to obtain funding for basic science, you need to promise immediate practical applications to obtain grants. Papers are increasingly shunned in favor of patents, the academic that &quot;only publishes papers that other academics read&quot; is now a figure of parody or derision. There are even research grants whose main or sole evaluation criterion is &quot;amount of research income generated in the last X months&quot;.<p>So to sum up, the capitalistic mindset of looking at everything in terms of short-term profitability has harmed, and continues harming, academia.

I built it following the design for a staked work table from the Anarchist&#x27;s Design Book[2]. She&#x27;s been working at it since, and we&#x27;ve been doing our best to manage my noise and her Zoom calls separated by perhaps as much as 20 feet.<p>Sometime in late May or early June things started opening up slowly. I bought wood for those projects, and the shared shop space began operating with extremely limited hours. I&#x27;ve wrapped up those couple of projects, and honestly, the next thing on my TODO list is to spend some time doing some business planning, re-shooting some of my earlier work, and updating my website[3]. Bad timing on the pithy github comment on my part; had I known it&#x27;d hit the top of HN, I&#x27;d have made it <i>after<\/i> I updated the website!<p>If you&#x27;re in the Boston area and would like to see some of my work, the Cabinet on Stand shown on my website is on display at the Fuller Craft Museum[4] in Brockton, MA through November 8th. It feels a bit weird to mention it, but that piece is also for sale through the museum. Purchasing it supports not only me, but also the museum. They were closed for a long time this year as a result of the pandemic, and like a great many of our cultural institutions, they&#x27;re hurting. They laid off the curator for the exhibit my piece is in due to budget issues.<p>If I can offer everybody only one thing to get out of this, it&#x27;s that our cultural institutions live a fairly fragile and perilous existence, particularly the smaller ones. The Wharton Esherick Museum[5] in the Philadelphia area is also taking a beating. Please, please, please take some time to support these institutions. A lot of our shared culture doesn&#x27;t make it to the MFA. Those headline institutions show a limited subset of stuff; there&#x27;s so much of value in the smaller museums, galleries, and historical societies.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;furnituremakingclasses.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;furnituremakingclasses.com<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;claremontmakerspace.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;claremontmakerspace.org<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lostartpress.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;books&#x2F;products&#x2F;the-anarchists-design-book\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lostartpress.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;books&#x2F;products&#x2F;the-anar...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longwalkwoodworking.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longwalkwoodworking.com<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fullercraft.org&#x2F;event&#x2F;2020-biennial-members-exhibition&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fullercraft.org&#x2F;event&#x2F;2020-biennial-members-exhibiti...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whartonesherickmuseum.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whartonesherickmuseum.org<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 14:40:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nicbou"],"id":[24542433],"kids":[24544086,24544429,24542522,24543830,24543782,24547760,24543163,24548986,24544036,24545371,24543946,24547783,24547241,24544731,24546606,24546385],"parent":[24541964],"text":["Add me to the woodworking ex-developers.

It&#x27;s a line by the Joe MacMillan character (portrayed by Lee Pace) from <i>Halt and Catch Fire<\/i>:<p>&quot;The computer isn&#x27;t thing.  The computer&#x27;s the thing that gets us to the thing.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s how programming felt when I got into it back in the 80&#x27;s and was still there when I started doing it professionally in the 90&#x27;s.  It felt like we were using computers as tools for creativity and exploration.  For making the world a better place.  Increasingly, as the valuations skyrocketed, that feeling has diminished to the point where I don&#x27;t see it anywhere anymore.  It&#x27;s not about &quot;getting us to the thing&quot;, it&#x27;s not about making the world better.  It is about making a buck.<p>Now, look; I don&#x27;t have a problem with people earning a living or even with Apple having a $2T valuation.  My problem is the influence that has had on the industry.  One might suggest that such a thing is unavoidable and they are probably right, but can&#x27;t we at least try to be better?  Can&#x27;t we at least try to keep in focus the goal of making lives better and less about showing yet another ad?  People are genuinely suffering right now all over the world.  I challenge anyone to suggest that health and economic hardships are less important than Facebook.<p>On a more practical, day-to-day matter: my job as a programmer is, well... my GOD the amount of tooling!  When I got started web programming I had a text editor, and FTP client, a server, and a browser.  I made a change, uploaded the files, and refreshed my browser.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  Having a debugger built into the browser is great.  Having a proper version control system is fantastic.  I think, however, we&#x27;re missing the forrest for the trees where tooling is concerned.<p>Here&#x27;s a case in point that a good friend pointed out to me recently:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thecreation&#x2F;jquery-wizard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thecreation&#x2F;jquery-wizard<\/a>    It&#x27;s a simple jQuery plugin (please let&#x27;s not get sidetracked with &quot;jQuery is so old|bad|blah blah blah&quot;!) for building wizards.  Just look at all the files needed for the various tooling in relation to actual source code. Babel, Bower, ESLint, NPM, Travis, Gulp, Karma. You have to ask yourself, how much time does the developer get to spend on making his&#x2F;her product better versus maintaining tooling support?!<p>And _that_ is what programming is like right now.

This is intentional, of course and it&#x27;s the same reason Snowden is also unwilling to return to a US trial - the jury is known to have strong pro-government views, strong ties to the national security apparatus.<p>EDIT: The bigger concern is that there are only four spots for the public to view the case and all of the online access was cut, so almost no public observers are allowed in. This is concerning given the broad implications of the trial and the fact that there is obviously enormous political pressure being brought to bear."],"time":["2020-09-21 20:15:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["asplake"],"id":[24542751],"kids":[24542816,24543467,24544835,24546754,24545996,24543929,24546290],"parent":[24542352],"text":["Tweeted on a closely related subject earlier today.
