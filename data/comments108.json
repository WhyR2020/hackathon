Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in part determined by the buyer assessing the <i>maximum<\/i> amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.<p>&gt; Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage with new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharply downward, sometimes even to a negative figure. In truth, “equity” is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt is currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often to another leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.<p>Left unsaid is what happens if things do <i>not<\/i> go well. Saddled with as much debt as possible, the business by design has been put in a position such that it cannot survive even a modest decline in revenue without raising significant additional capital.<p>Therefore, if government assistance is not forthcoming, the economic shock of COVID-19 looks likely to put a majority of leveraged buyouts in bankruptcy.<p>[a] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;letters&#x2F;2014ltr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;letters&#x2F;2014ltr.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-03 22:13:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Havoc"],"id":[22771893],"kids":[22773402,22774202],"parent":[22768506],"text":["&gt;But do they really deserve any part in a bailout?<p>Do any of these companies?<p>The whole concept of bailouts create bad incentives - to me that&#x27;s more the crux of the issue.

The others are job ads for YC startups, and orange usernames for YC alumni—but only when displayed to <i>other<\/i> YC alumni, which always generates &quot;why is my username not orange&quot; emails. But I digress.<p>Launch HN posts are like job ads in that they get an initial front-page placement, usually somewhere between #8 and #10. (I think job ads start a little higher). Then they fall down the page. Unlike job ads, though, launch posts can be upvoted and commented on. Once they&#x27;ve gotten their initial placement they function like regular stories. Occasionally the community finds one particularly interesting and it gets upvoted higher. This recent one spent quite a while at #1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22616857\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22616857<\/a> (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hnrankings.info&#x2F;22616857&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hnrankings.info&#x2F;22616857&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>We started doing the Launch HNs three years ago. I was worried that the community would hate them because we were taking additional front page space for YC. (Our intention was to make it so that a launch post and a job ad wouldn&#x27;t appear at the same time, but I never ended up writing that code, so sometimes they do.) But that hasn&#x27;t ever come up. I think it&#x27;s because launch threads are intrinsically more interesting than job ads (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22767319\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22767319<\/a> downthread for more on that).<p>All this time, the initial front-page placement of launch posts, unlike job ads, has been done manually. That is, founders have had to email us and we&#x27;ve manually jigged the post onto the front page. The problem with that is that you have to be awake to do it. I don&#x27;t <i>want<\/i> to be awake to do it, especially because startup founders tend to be businessy, bustling types who are all bright-and-early, while my schedule drifts ever deeper into the darkness as the few moorings I had remaining to the rest of society dissolve in this time of social distancing and self-isolation, which were basically my bread and butter to begin with (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yUlBWNDW72E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yUlBWNDW72E<\/a>).<p>Until now, I&#x27;ve told founders to post at Pacific 10am and email us, because that&#x27;s roughly when I get going in the morning. Tomorrow, though, there are two. One is a fintech startup in Latin America who want to post at 9am. And the other is Peter Roberts, who&#x27;s going to do another immigration AMA (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;submitted?id=proberts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;submitted?id=proberts<\/a>). Peter is on the east coast, and wants to get going at 8am Pacific, which is late for him and (ungodly) early for me.<p>So tonight I got frustrated enough to write some code to deal with it. Frustration reaching a tipping point and boiling over is my gateway into the code these days. My goal is for startups to be able to post their launches, and occasionally for pre-scheduled submissions like Peter&#x27;s (which are rare), to end up on the front page independently of whenever I went to sleep the night before.<p>This code turned out to be a lot more complicated than I anticipated. The patch ended up adding a hundred lines of Arc. A hundred lines of Arc! Do you have any idea how many lines of Arc that is? I just looked through the history and the last commit that added that many lines of code was over two years ago when we got Arc to compile to JS. Obviously this change needs to be thoroughly tested, so after testing it on my laptop I deployed it to production and decided to do a couple of sanity checks live. One was to post a test Launch HN using my old account gruseom, which is the founder account for Skysheet, the spreadsheet startup that Scott and I had 10 years ago (and which I still think about every day, but I should avoid digressing again). The code I wrote has some logic in it for cofounder accounts. One thing it&#x27;s supposed to do is email all the cofounders when a Launch HN post has made it to HN&#x27;s front page, so they will be ready to engage with commenters. Anyhow, this test post was the OP. The good news: it got placed on the front page in the way that I intended. The bad news: none of the emails were received. God fucking shit fucking goddamnit I knew those emails wouldn&#x27;t work...I mean, <i>dang<\/i>.<p>(Edit: actually that&#x27;s not what happened. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22772667\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22772667<\/a>)<p>My intention was for this thread to remain obscure, then get placed briefly on the front page by the new code, at which point I&#x27;d get the emails and immediately delete it. I didn&#x27;t think it was very likely to get noticed in the middle of the night here, especially when posted by what ought by now to be an obscure account, but oh well.<p>I think that covers everything. Hopefully you all will see  those two auto-placed posts on the front page tomorrow morning because I do not intend to be awake 5 hours from now.

The use of ECB mode is not recommended because patterns present in the plaintext are preserved during encryption.<p>-The AES-128 keys, which we verified are sufficient to decrypt Zoom packets intercepted in Internet traffic, appear to be generated by Zoom servers, and in some cases, are delivered to participants in a Zoom meeting through servers in China, even when all meeting participants, and the Zoom subscriber’s company, are outside of China.<p>-Zoom, a Silicon Valley-based company, appears to own three companies in China through which at least 700 employees are paid to develop Zoom’s software. This arrangement is ostensibly an effort at labor arbitrage: Zoom can avoid paying US wages while selling to US customers, thus increasing their profit margin.

They can be in the form of a canvas renderer such as Skia, which is what Google uses for Chrome and Flutter, and also used by some other GUI projects like Revery for ReasonML.

We’ve shared details on the safety precautions we’ve taken to date on the Day One Blog, and today, I want to give an update.<p>&gt; Disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are already standard across our network, and the procurement teams have worked tirelessly to create new sources of supply to keep these critical items flowing. The millions of masks we ordered weeks ago are now arriving, and we’re distributing them to our teams as quickly as possible. Masks will be available as soon as today in some locations and in all locations by early next week. Any N-95 masks we receive we are either donating to healthcare workers on the front lines or making them available through Amazon Business to healthcare and government organizations at cost.<p>&gt; We’re conducting daily audits of the new health and safety measures we’ve put into place. We’ve shared some of the photos of these measures here. We also assigned some of our top machine learning technologists to capture opportunities to improve social distancing in our buildings using our internal camera systems. With over 1,000 sites around the world, and so many measures and precautions rapidly rolled out over the past several weeks, there may be instances where we don’t get it perfect, but I can assure you that’s just what they’ll be—exceptions.<p>&gt; Finally, I can’t stress enough how much I appreciate our teams for serving their communities. If someone would rather not come to work, we are supporting them in their time off. If someone is diagnosed or comes to us who is presumptively diagnosed (but unable to get a test), we are giving them extra paid time off. In addition, we are also contacting people who have been in close contact with a diagnosed individual and giving them time off as well, for 14 days, to stay home with pay.<p>There&#x27;s even more that Amazon has done in response to COVID-19 at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;amazons-actions-to-help-employees-communities-and-customers-affected-by-covid-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;amazons-actions-to...<\/a>.

Yes that will still be significantly different than our previous lives, but for many people it will be much closer to how things were before.  The key is we need to continue to ramp up testing and we need a system in place for authorities to randomly test healthy people so that they can monitor the extent of the outbreak before it turns into hundreds or thousands of deaths a day again.  So the average person will be able to go to work, socialize and more or less return to life as normal but they may have to submit to a nasal swab once in a while on the way into the grocery store or something like that.

(Layout engines were optional then.)<p>The newer UI frameworks are round-about and confusing. They make it easy to get 80% of what you want, but that last 20% is bear, requiring long trial-and-error periods, unless you are heavily versed in them. Abstraction is only nice when it does what you want, not when it becomes &quot;abstract art&quot;.<p>The price for &quot;responsive&quot; (client-side auto-placement) has been huge. In applications that are primarily for office desktops, their advantage is lost. Mouse and PC&#x27;s is still where most real work is done. Instead we are using things like Bootstrap, designed for social networks, not real work. Glamour won over logic.<p>It&#x27;s great job security for UI experts, but expensive for organizations because they need stack specialists whereby before a one-man-band (or 2) could make useful apps for less than half the cost and time without having to spend years with UI-Yoda to master some screwy layout engine.<p>Something is wrong."],"time":["2020-04-02 19:38:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jancsika"],"id":[22760000],"kids":[22760340],"parent":[22758218],"text":["&gt; This approach isn&#x27;t recommended because we can only attach one handler for each event.<p>Except when you <i>do<\/i> want that behavior.

If you follow it to it&#x27;s terminal conclusion, it shows that neurologists had a standard course of therapy for lyme. The alt-lyme community insisted that it was too short, and you needed long term treatment (with a duration based on their own experiences&#x2F;treatment regimens). So conventional medicine studied the longer courses of treatment, and found there was no difference when studied in an objective way (randomized double blind comparison). Well, as soon as that happened, the goal posts got moved back, and they alt-lyme community said &quot;well of course the study was negative! the treatment course wasn&#x27;t long enough! It needs to be 12 weeks, not 8 weeks&quot; (or whatever), even though they had consistently been saying 8 prior to the study. And <i>still<\/i> conventional medicine is open minded about any evidence that can be provided. That&#x27;s how science works! But you are going to need to pay for the evidence, lyme people, because we feel like we did our due diligence with the first study, and don&#x27;t need a repeat of the public health resources that were wasted searching for the autism-vaccine link over and over again.<p>Even the other treatment outlined in this blog post (disulfuram) has an open study that is still looking for volunteers. That tells you a little bit about the level of need (modest, but not zero) and the disinterest of the patient community in advancing science (you can draw your own conclusions here).<p>Related to this Stanford post specifically, I&#x27;m disappointed.<p>&gt; We&#x27;d been bitten by unseen ticks harboring the parasites that cause Lyme disease and babesiosis, a malaria-like disease<p>It&#x27;s far (far!) less like malaria than it is to syphilis. It&#x27;s a bit like saying &quot;this is a border collie, which is similar to a Maine Coone&quot;. Ok, well... kind of. To the extent that they are both mammals. But why are we not comparing the border collie to a great dane or a poodle? Because those are just as familiar, and way more similar.<p>What syphilis and lyme have in common is that they are both spirichete bacteria, and a huge portion of the disease burden if it&#x27;s not diagnosed quickly (and it&#x27;s often not...) is due to autoimmune injury. You can completely kill all the bacteria in the chronically infected person, and their life will not get any better, because the autoimmunity is present, and unrelenting. Which is the second big criticism of this blog post: killing all the bacteria is not the challenge, and this discovery, while awesome, is not awesome for the reasons described.<p>PragmaticPulp really nailed it here with what is now the top comment on this thread.<p>&gt; for reasons that are unclear, the antibiotics don&#x27;t work for up to 20% of people with the tick-borne illness. One possibility is that drug-tolerant bacteria cause the lingering symptoms.<p>these reasons are only unclear to the alt-lyme community.<p>&gt; Many researchers believe that doxycyline&#x27;s inability to clear the persisters may account for the ongoing symptoms of some Lyme sufferers.<p>Yes, the same researchers that are working on climate change for Exxon. It doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t disprove climate change, but it means they are outside the conventional understanding of this area of science.<p>Overall, though, the science story here is legitimately cool! The scientists are using the application of a high-throughput system to test multiple compounds with known safety profiles against a pathogenic organism.

They are letting you know that the quality of the software your company puts out is going to start suffering soon if technical mitigations aren&#x27;t taken.

(Roughly equivalent to a Pentium - a bit slower clock but slightly more powerful instructions.)<p>How could this be? Photoshop 4 used 68k instructions, and the fastest 68k based Mac was the Quadra with the 68040 CPU. The first PowerMac was released in 1994, but it had to emulate the 68k to run Photoshop, which had a serious performance hit. Once Photoshop was released for the PowerPC, this anomaly ended.<p>(And Photoshop on Windows must have been faster than both Amiga and Mac pretty much immediately, but if I recall correctly it wasn&#x27;t as capable on Windows right then. Or maybe people used to working on Macs for magazines etc just weren&#x27;t prepared to switch platforms on a whim.)<p>So, Amiga was the original Hackintosh. :-)<p>But the copyright situation was even thornier then - to start the emulator you&#x27;d have to copy ROM images from a real Mac, and the only legal way to do that was to buy a Mac.<p>(Not that anybody did that, they just copied the ROM onto a floppy.) I think the preferred emulator was Shapeshiter. It worked remarkably well because most Macintosh programs did not use any direct hardware access but used the Apple provided official APIs.<p>Another anomaly was that Amiga was dead as a commercial gaming target by then, and so did not receive a port of Doom - but you could run the Macintosh version of Doom:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=spHpv3NKQhI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=spHpv3NKQhI<\/a><p>Earlier, there was even an older Mac emulator for the Amiga which tried to go the legal route by having a little hardware board you could put Mac ROMs into.

It is expressing an opinion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<p>Furthermore, this article and others from Vice, Vox, Huffington Post, and others are proving why Amazon does not want to explain for the &quot;umpteenth time&quot; what they are doing in response to the virus. There is only so much that can be done within the confines of a physical operation like an Amazon warehouse, and it is crucial that online stores keep operating at this time, so that shoppers stay home.<p>And yet, all these articles make it seem like Amazon has done nothing. In actuality, apart from providing industry leading wages for warehouse workers, Amazon has increased baseline pay, overtime pay, and enacted numerous reasonable changes to alter the operations of their warehouse. Vice buries one of the most interesting bits, which is how Amazon has been trying to get PPE but has had difficulties:<p>&gt; Zapolsky’s notes imply the company’s attempts to purchase N95 masks from China fell through. “China has deemed N95 masks as ‘strategic,’” Zapolsky wrote. “They’re keeping them for optionality. They also want to use them for ‘diplomacy.’ The masks in China that we thought we had probably got redirected by profiteers.”<p>Even the &quot;protests&quot; outside Amazon&#x27;s warehouses in response to this news story are overblown. For instance <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;amazon-fires-chris-smalls-walkout-staten-island-new-york-warehouse&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;amazon-fires-chris-smalls-walko...<\/a> notes that although activists claimed there were 50 employees protesting, the actual count was 15, and only 9 of those were Amazon employees. Yet mainstream left-leaning media keeps amplifying this story.<p>In actuality, it appears Amazon has been continuously attempting to improve working conditions, and were finally able to get masks based on orders they placed weeks ago - well before the recent social media &#x2F; left-leaning journalists&#x27; attacks on Amazon began. See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;02&#x2F;amazon-begins-running-temperature-checks-and-will-provide-surgical-masks-at-warehouses&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;02&#x2F;amazon-begins-running-temp...<\/a> for more on that:<p>&gt; Amazon has already described some precautions it’s been taking, including mandatory paid 14-day quarantines for employees who test positive, as well as increased cleaning and sanitation efforts of facilities and infrastructure. The new measures to be introduced next week include taking temperatures of employees at the entrances to warehouses, with any individuals with a fever of more than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit to be sent home, where they’ll have to have three consecutive days without fever to return to work. Employees will also be provided with surgical masks starting next week, the company says, once it receives shipments of orders of “millions” placed a few weeks ago.<p>Lastly, everyone seems to ignore that this employee violated a direct work order to not come on site, because he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Regardless of what people speculate about Amazon&#x27;s reasons for firing this person, no one seems to be disputing that this employee violated a requirement to not come to the work site. That is clearly grounds for termination, irrespective of other considerations.<p>So can we please stop sharing these low quality articles over and over on Hacker News?"],"time":["2020-04-02 22:35:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["booboolayla"],"id":[22764105],"kids":{},"parent":[22763057],"text":["Yes, Marxist agitators usually get a taste of their own medicine."],"time":["2020-04-02 23:33:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["Mizza"],"id":[22763271],"kids":[22763283,22763293,22763309,22763894,22764027],"parent":[22763057],"text":["A really disgusting but predictable thing to fall out of this whole fiasco is to watch Obama-era staffers aggressively side with management against labour:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JayCarney&#x2F;status&#x2F;1245474780746330119\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JayCarney&#x2F;status&#x2F;1245474780746330119<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-02 22:21:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["stefan_"],"id":[22764882],"kids":[22764985],"parent":[22763057],"text":["Zapolsky seems like the kind of person who, and you don&#x27;t have to go too far back in history, would be drafted, deployed and then promptly unceremoniously shot in the back by those around him when they discovered his adventurous streak in putting them at risk.<p>Now that we are in a state of emergency, maybe we can instead arrest those psychopaths that sit at home in pyjamas, log into their Zoom meeting and draft up plans to disparage and terminate the people exposed and speaking up against unsafe practices.

The benefit amounts will sound small if you&#x27;re living in an expensive city like SF or Seattle, but $600&#x2F;week from the federal government and a similar amount from state unemployment insurance means that unemployment benefits can pay up to an equivalent of $50-60K&#x2F;year right now.

During normal times, this is a common tactic for seasonal businesses. I have friends in seasonal tourism industries who received training on applying for unemployment benefits during their annual off-season layoffs each year. They even have an explicit system for tracking seniority in the re-hires.<p>Of course, the longer this quarantine lasts, the more likely their businesses are to disappear before they can re-open.

Time and time again, all the bailouts of the past seem to benefit them, but during a time when we need insurance companies to pay out for business interruption instead of claiming &quot;act of God, we exclude pandemics...etc.,&quot; we fail to bring them into the conversation."],"time":["2020-04-02 15:27:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hopfog"],"id":[22758487],"kids":{},"parent":[22758227],"text":["This chart is just getting crazier and crazier: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EUmW1PgXYAEdggm?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EUmW1PgXYAEdggm?format=png&amp;name=...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-02 15:08:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aazaa"],"id":[22759292],"kids":[22762587],"parent":[22758227],"text":["There&#x27;s a sense that once &quot;lockdown&quot; ends, thing go back to normal.
