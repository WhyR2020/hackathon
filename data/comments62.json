No &quot;this&quot;, easy reuse of logic via react-like &quot;useXYZ&quot; hooks and a general fast development. But two things really bugged me:<p>* You need to be really careful when passing around values and how you handle them. Destructure a Proxy object? You instantly lose reactivity. Not using a reference to proxy object in computed? Changes won&#x27;t trigger the computed function. There is a lot of magic involved and while it may seem that it takes a lot of &quot;thinking&quot; from you, once it doesn&#x27;t work you will have to rethink and maybe even ditch some of the underlying language&#x27;s features.<p>* &quot;ref&quot; vs &quot;reactive&quot;, where &quot;ref&quot; is used for primitives which need a proxy object wrapper and &quot;reactive&quot; is used for objects&#x2F;arrays. Now, my primary problem is that you again have to use specific operations based on whether your using ref or reactive. A &quot;ref&quot; array can be easily set to an empty array via `arr.value = []`. If you try this with a &quot;reactive&quot; array, you will lose reactivity; you would have to use `arr.length = 0`.<p>TypeScript detects a lot of those pitfalls and, IMO, it is essential when using the composition API.

The reality is, most farmers in Xinjiang are independent entities. They are the little guys. They grow cotton or any other produces on their land, and sell the produces to distributors. Many of these farmers are minority ethnicity, Uighur included, but there are others as well. These people lived in villages and in the country side for generations.  Farming and the &quot;primary&quot; sector of the economy is how they make a living for generations. They are the low to middle income bracket of the society. They depend on agriculture to raise families, provide food on the table, raise children, and take care of the elderly in the family. A blanket ban of all cotton produced in this region will devastate the life of these people. Think about it from the perspective of these people. They grew cotton on their farm, and one day they are told &quot;The U.S. stops buying your product because they want to protect you from forced labor&quot;, and because of that, you will be out of work. The farmer sits there and think &quot;Wait, I am farming because I need money to feed my families&quot;. This ban sounds like its standing with the Uighur people, but in reality, it hurts them the most. Rights to live, rights to livelihood, rights to income and bringing food to the table is also human rights.<p>Target companies or organizations that actually committed forced labor and present concrete evidence. Maybe require a document of the name of the farmer, require disclosure and certifications of the practices of the producers. There are many ways this could be done to both protect legitimate producers, farmers, and rule out the bad actors. Or at least act like you are trying. A blanket ban blew the covers off of the PR statement this is about protecting human rights and stand with the people. Instead, the actual intent is to suppress the Chinese economy, and prevent the people living there from getting richer and achieve a better quality of life. Its sad that there are people in the world who don&#x27;t really care about other people&#x27;s quality of life. They can enjoy themselves a good paying job, nice cloths, good cars etc. While for other people, farming, doing hard, manual and labor intensive work on the farm is all they can ever dream of.

If you follow the other time references given in the book -- such as days of the week mentioned on the radio etc -- this time frame given cannot possibly be true.

He wrote the novel in English first, and translated that English version into Japanese. His reason being &quot;if it is English, my vocabulary is not that great, so I&#x27;m forced to write in short sentences, which creates this natural rhythm. Kind of like an 8 beat.&quot; [1]<p>Being bilingual, I often find myself pondering whether I should write something for myself in English or in Japanese for tasks such as note taking or journal&#x2F;blog entries for myself. More and more, I&#x27;m finding that my writing in English is clearer, and more to the point. Not only that, but my thinking is structured in a more productive way, so I can write at a faster pace.<p>This was not meant to be a comparison of languages. We have enough of those discussions with programming, why would we talk about Natural Languages and risk angering a whole nation, instead of just Java programmers. Maybe my Japanese is no longer at the level of my English. But when somebody like Murakami also says that he wrote his first novel in English because it was easier for him, I feel there might be something there besides my English being better than my Japanese. Something worth exploring at least.<p>There are many great things about Japanese writing, the kanji characters bring about conciseness to the writing. I can glance at a page and quickly get a sense of the contents from the face of the characters much easier than English text. The characters feel closer to pictures. I also love the style of the &quot;Bunkobon&quot;, which is a smaller sized book, which can fit inside a pocket. I used to carry those everywhere with me and pull it out when I had a moment.<p>The novels and stories are great. People like Haruki and Souseki and Ranpo are my heroes.<p>I guess my Kokugo teacher would have liked for me to mention the beautiful poetry that arises from Haiku and the seasons, but those things are no longer practical use to me.<p>On the other hand, there are also many mental blocks and barriers that I face when writing Japanese. Finding the right Kanji characters is one thing. That&#x27;s probably attributed to my poor memory of kanji characters. Another thing is sentence endings: Desu&#x2F;masu and dearu&#x2F;da. The Desu&#x2F;masu is a more respectful tone. Dearu&#x2F;da is authoritative and sometimes regarded as casual. So now in addition to wondering whether I should write in the first person or third person, I have to worry whether my reader will be offended by my writing.<p>Anyway, would love to hear from other multilingual people on their views of language preference and differences.<p>[1] This was from an interview he did with a magazine called &quot;Kaie&quot;, The New Yorker also mentions this <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;page-turner&#x2F;lost-in-translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;page-turner&#x2F;lost-in-translat...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 01:31:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["willyg123"],"id":[24418055],"kids":[24420879,24422061,24429797,24418986],"parent":[24417015],"text":["Out of college I worked on the finance side of a self storage investment company (thank god I left after 4 years), so I know the ins and outs of the business.<p>The number one deciding factor for customers is location.

This is admittedly more rigorous work than previous efforts to train language models to perform automated theorem proving and it&#x27;s admirable that the authors have actually reached out to the community around Metamath (the classical automated theorem prover used in the paper) to understand the extent to which their work is useful to that community.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t understand the motivation of the work. Why is it necessary to teach a language model to perform automated theorm proving, when there are already approaches that can perform automated theorem proving, that outperform language models in theorem proving and that do not have the high costs associated with training language models? Indeed, Metamath is based on an extremly simple principle of variable substitution, which is just what it sounds like and comparing the complexity of a modern, GPT-based language model to such a simple approach is not flattering for the language model approach. Besides if I understand correctly, Metamath, was used as the &quot;ground truth&quot; for evaluation and testing of the trained language model and the language model didn&#x27;t get anywhere near 100% performance, meaning it&#x27;s far behind the ability of Metamath in automated theorem proving. So we have a very simple approach that works very well on one side and an extremely complex approach that doesn&#x27;t work very well on the other. The comparison is, again, not flattering for the language model approach.<p>I can see that GPT-ƒ (the language model in the paper) has contributed some shorter proofs to some theorems in Metamath&#x27;s database, which seems to be very much appreciated by the Metamath community, but on the other hand, it seems that GPT-ƒ was not able to prove <i>new<\/i> theorems (and a shorter version of a theorem proved by GPT-ƒ was found by hand, by one of the Metamath users, a little after the GPT-ƒ results were announced on the Metamath google group).<p>It seems to me it would be a long and arduous road for language models to achieve parity with classical automated theorem provers - if indeed such parity can be achieved at all. And all this hard work- for what, when there already exist perfectly serviceable automated theorem provers with none of the drawbacks of language models)? Why reinvent a wheel, only to come up with a new wheel that can only roll one way and only on Tuesdays?<p>Finally, despite the more rigorous approach in this paper, the trend of only comparing neural net approaches to other neural net approaches continues. An automated theorem prover approach of any stripe should be compared to the state of the art in automated theorm proving, not just to other efforts using a similar approach!

That matched revenues better to costs, allowing software companies  to keep more employees on staff to actually improve the  product.<p>When Apple came out with the iOS App Store, they broke the upgrade model. Existing users get every update for free. Releasing a large update as a separate product means it can’t access the existing user data because of sandboxing, and it can’t be priced at a discount for existing users.<p>There are workarounds to all these problems using in-app purchase and data export&#x2F;import schemes but they are costly in developer time and offer a poorer user experience than traditional upgrades did.<p>I’m convinced if Apple had an upgrade purchasing system as easy to implement as subscriptions, developers would abandon most of their subscriptions and replace them with upgrades."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:35:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["OldHand2018"],"id":[24427634],"kids":[24428899],"parent":[24403827],"text":["Microsoft offers Office as both a 1-time purchase and on a subscription basis.

In the vast majority of OOP languages, instantiated classes are mutable-by-default and can be mutated by multiple concurrent operators (threads, coroutines, etc). This makes them actually quite similar to the underlying computing model - even though they&#x27;re a high-level abstraction, they force you to deal with the knowledge that the memory at any address can be modified at any time with no warning. [1]<p>Classes in most languages also offer implementation inheritance, which boils down to an approach to &quot;rebundling&quot; the constituent functions in ways that are arguably simple enough, but generally in practice it has been found to be hard for programmers to reason about. Dynamic dispatch is very powerful, and the way that most inheritance mechanisms expose this seems to be a model that programmers understand in theory but fail to consistently remember in practice.<p>In my opinion, the fundamental difficulty with classes is that in most languages, you get all of these tools bundled (complected) into the same toolbox without any say in the matter. If you didn&#x27;t want inheritance, too bad. If you didn&#x27;t want concurrent mutability, you&#x27;re now being asked to design a complex state machine to prevent it, rather than it being excluded off the bat by most functional approaches. Functional approaches force you to opt in to most of the footguns that are included &quot;out of the box&quot; in OOP.<p>Classes will remain the best approach in many OOP languages for RAII-shaped problems, where some part of an application needs to encapsulate and manage a limited, shared, and potentially mutable resource (such as a file handle, a database connection, or an in-memory cache), because classes are an abstraction that maps cleanly to shared mutable state with locking mechanisms.<p>[1] You can of course also shoot yourself in the foot with closures that themselves contain mutable state (e.g. some kind of mutable container), and I think this is a rarely-considered danger for functional paradigms in languages that default to mutable data structures."],"time":["2020-09-09 19:34:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["knubie"],"id":[24425370],"kids":{},"parent":[24422547],"text":["OOP is an abstraction over functions, but it can be explained much more simply without closures.

Paranormal Panic is our first stab at a remotely playable escape room.<p>Players have 30 minutes to catch a ghost, and must work together as two squads.

They also have control over different equipment, and have different information on their control panels.<p>It&#x27;s built using Vue, Websockets, Jitsi, Raspberry Pi HQ cameras, and Python.<p>We got lucky that escape rooms are a reasonably safe entertainment option (gatherings of eight or less, no strangers, sanitized, etc.) during these times, so we&#x27;re fortunate to have reopened and are seeing good attendance.

That things go to crap if society is run by private interest, greed or straight up clowns seems self-evident.<p>But every time someone brings up old ideas, in this case Plato&#x27;s philospher caste, there&#x27;s an immediate question. If it is so great, and if it worked in the 19th century, why did it die out? Good things don&#x27;t vanish randomly.

I&#x27;m shocked that standards for writing have dropped so low.<p>Consider this paragraph:<p>&gt; Democracy’s fetishisation of freedom inevitably gives way to anarchy. Fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, humans to animals, and ‘the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable’. Anarchy produces class struggle, as the poor attack the rich and the rich retaliate; class struggle produces war and disorder. When all this becomes intolerable the masses will turn to a dictator who can restore order.<p>It&#x27;s meaningless! Democracy apparently makes &quot;humans pander to animals.&quot; Why does this happen? Just because! The author spits out this weird gob of nonsense and continues as if he&#x27;s made a real argument that democracy always leads to anarchy (which, confusingly, leads to class conflict, and not the other way around).<p>He does mention uneducated voters making bad decisions earlier, but that&#x27;s a whole other can of worms that he never even digs into (i.e. can we fix this with education reforms, or by introducing new journalistic standards into media?). He just throws it out there as if it&#x27;s all the proof he needs that only &quot;wise elites&quot; can save us from ourselves.<p>How about this part:<p>&gt; Thus the paradox at the heart of tyranny: even though tyrants have absolute power over other people, they have no power over themselves. Slaves to their own passions – ‘ill-governed’ in their own souls as Plato puts it – they use their positions to inflict those passions on the entire population. A tyranny is a psycho-drama in which everyone is caught up in the tyrant’s raging ego.<p>This is flatly untrue. Let&#x27;s look at some of the greatest tyrants of the 21st century. Xi Jinping, Vladmir Putin, the Saudis... we could go on. Are any of these people particularly prone to temper tantrums? &quot;Slaves of their own passions&quot;? No! They&#x27;re ruthless, disciplined, and experts at consolidating and leveraging power. This weird psychoanalysis of authoritarianism has no basis in fact -- it&#x27;s just storytelling.<p>Finally, scraping away the abysmal analysis, we get the actual argument:<p>&gt; The metaphor of the ship is a way of driving home Plato’s wider point about the importance of ‘guardians’. Plato argues that a successful republic is run by a class of people whose job it is to think about the long-term success of the polis.<p>The trouble with this is that putting a discreet class of people in charge of society leads to those people acting in their own interests. The whole motivating reason behind democracy is for the public to have a veto on their leadership so that leaders can&#x27;t act in their own interest. The author&#x27;s solution is &quot;let&#x27;s educate our leaders not to act in their own interest,&quot; but that&#x27;s practically a childish suggestion. What part of history has ever suggested that you can educate humans out of their innate instinct to act in self-interest?The author provides basically no real examples. Who gets to decide how these rulers are educated? The rulers? Wow I&#x27;m sure we can trust them not to act in their self-interest in that regard. After all, they &quot;educated&quot; themselves not to.<p>They did include a couple vague gestures at evidence:<p>&gt; Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol from 1870 until his death in 1893, devoted his life to two great projects: producing a definitive edition of Plato and turning his college into a production line for Platonic guardians.<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; There was a certain amount of priggishness in the cult of Plato. But it nevertheless produced an elite that was remarkably public spirited by today’s standards: too dignified to put its fingers in the cookie jar and too well-educated to be blown hither and thither by the latest intellectual fads. The old elite didn’t hog publicity for the sake of publicity – most of them were happy to work in the background without any public credit – and they wouldn’t dream of piling up vast private fortunes. This was a world of modest but tasteful cottages in the country, not swanky apartments in Belgravia or Manhattan. Dignified public service was its own reward.<p>But again, that says nothing. Who exactly are we referring to here? Which individuals led so well? By which metrics? How do they compare against other leaders? No actual evidence, just a bunch of emotionally-loaded language. The period in question (19th century England) was absolutely abysmal for workers&#x27; rights, by the way.

In fact, I&#x27;d recommend beginning along those lines, followed by developing several different new languages, probably domain-specific ones.   Your first attempts probably won&#x27;t be worth keeping.   (I haven&#x27;t kept the object oriented Prolog I wrote about 25 years ago, but I do regularly use a small Prolog I recently wrote in Lisp.)<p>The languages at the roots of all programming languages are Fortran, Lisp, Cobol, Algol60, APL, Snobol, Forth, Prolog, OPS5, SASL, Smalltalk, Prograph.   (If I&#x27;ve missed any out, or any of the above have important predecessors, please let me know.)   A new language is unlikely to be radically different from any of those languages or their descendants - of those I listed, the most recent is from the mid 1980s.  Within the descendants, which is your favourite?   Can you make big improvements to it?   If so, make them.   Otherwise, can you improve another language so that it becomes your favourite?<p>One heuristic I&#x27;ve found useful: the right design choices at the start might be unknown, but when I need make them, they&#x27;re obvious to me, and often a particular choice leads to other equally obvious choices.   If the choice isn&#x27;t obvious, I&#x27;ve probably done something wrong.<p>My own preference is for pure rather than hybrid languages with simple regular syntaxes (i.e. one idea expressed well), and very strong static typing.<p>My favourite language is Common Lisp or rather a subset of it.   I have trouble thinking of ways to make it significantly better.   But I also like the idea of dataflow (a few decades ago I knew some of those working on experimental dataflow hardware), and graphical programming seems to be the right approach to dataflow.   Prograph was the closest existing language to what I wanted.   It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t pure dataflow, it&#x27;s dynamically typed, it&#x27;s object oriented (so, unless it&#x27;s Smalltalk it&#x27;s hybrid), and entering programs in it involves too many mouse gestures and keystrokes.   So I&#x27;m implementing a new language which corrects those deficiencies.   It&#x27;s been particularly difficult because I have to write an IDE as well as the language, and there aren&#x27;t any textbooks I can rely on for help.<p>I&#x27;ll have succeeded if I use the new language more often than I do Lisp, and if along the way I get a few more papers (two so far) and some academic interest, so much the better.   I don&#x27;t expect a wide user base.   If that was important to me, it would have C syntax and I&#x27;d try to get corporate backing.

These terms can be used to wrap selected combinators (eg church numerals). The normal beta reduction rules are extended to handle these decorations in a useful way.<p>The decorations allow predicates to be formed that are total over the term space (eg isChurchNumeral?), which means that function call identifiers can be dynamically \ndispatched based on their arguments (using a certain amount of term assembly from the surface syntax).

Using Scheme to build an interpreter. This can easily be done in several days.

The world doesn&#x27;t need yet another syntax on top of basic C-style or Lisp-style semantic constructs.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been wondering if I should reconsider, though, and have had a bunch of ideas that blur the lines of what should be considered in-scope for a programming language.  Things like:<p>1. Universal constructs for serial &amp; parallel execution, but with user-defined semantics for <i>where<\/i> the code should execute.  So for example, at low-scale you&#x27;d execute in a loop on the CPU.  At mid-scale it&#x27;d run on the GPU.  At high-scale you could transparently distribute across thousands of GPU boxes.<p>2. Profiling and execution statistics built into the language.  Write your code, run it on representative data, and instantly get statistics on how many times each function is called, what the average size of data structures is, how much memory is used, etc.  Profilers do this, but often not at a granularity that&#x27;s particularly useful (ever tried to find out how many Strings are created within a particular dynamic call-tree?), and most new languages overlook implementing a profiler, leaving it to third-party vendors.  This is a shame, because a standardized programmatic API to a profiler could be a very effective compiler tool, leading to...<p>3. A way of defining transformations between data representations, benchmarking the <i>cost<\/i> of those transformations, and then having the compiler automatically decide whether it&#x27;s worth bulk-converting data based on typical profiler results.  The motivating example for this is the AoS-SoA transformation, but they also feature in common system design questions like &quot;Do you unpack all of the fields of this wire protocol, or lazily construct an object only when necessary?&quot; or &quot;Should you zip your data before sending it in an RPC?&quot; or &quot;Do you do this work at indexing or serving time?&quot;<p>4. The ability to dump intermediate data from any function call site to disk, and then restart program execution from there without re-running the whole program.  Handy when iterating on a complex algorithm.<p>5. Drill-down data visualizations for large collections.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried to find the logic bug in a 500,000 element array using a standard IDE debugger, you&#x27;ll know about this pain point.<p>6. Built-in support for machine-learning.  In particular, many ML applications need extensive preprocessing, and you need to preprocess the data in exactly the same way for training and serving.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be neat if you could write your traditional algorithms, dump out your signals at the particular call-site of the classifier, and then have the development environment automatically send it to Mechanical Turk or Craigslist for labeling?  Then have the system return the labeled data in a format easily suited for your ML framework of choice, do your data analysis &amp; training, and import the finished model back into the call site of the language.<p>7. GPU-native, with language constructs that lead to efficient GPU code.  This is becoming increasingly important not just for execution speed, but for developer velocity, because devs in data-intensive areas can waste a significant amount of time waiting for their program to run."],"time":["2020-05-03 04:35:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23058661],"kids":{},"parent":[23053773],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-03 14:48:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["pbiggar"],"id":[23054963],"kids":[23055298],"parent":[23053773],"text":["This advice is quite good for certain types of programming language, if you look at the world the same was as he does. We&#x27;re implementing Dark from a completely different worldview, and from that vantage point, a lot of these aren&#x27;t exactly wrong, but different.<p>&gt; Syntax matters<p>The approach we took with Dark is that there isn&#x27;t a syntax, per se, in that there isn&#x27;t a parser. There&#x27;s certainly a textual view of Dark and so it&#x27;s important that the code looks good (it currently looks only OK, in my opinion). But as a result, we have other options for minimizing keystrokes (autocomplete built-in), parsing (again, no parse), and minimizing keywords (you&#x27;re allowed have a variant with the same name as a keyword, which isn&#x27;t allowed in languages with parsers (well, lexers, but same idea).<p>&gt; context free grammars<p>No parser, no need to have a grammar. His point about IDEs is great - we only support our own IDE (a controversial decision to be sure!)<p>&gt; Redundancy<p>This is an esoteric parsing problem, that only applies if you have a parser. No parser means no syntax errors. We are left with editor errors (how does the editor have good UX) and run-time errors.<p>&gt; Implementation<p>He&#x27;s right about how hard error messages are, so I feel good about our &quot;not parsing&quot; approach.<p>&gt; Compiler speed<p>Our compilation is instant. The way it&#x27;s instant is:<p>- very small compilation units: you&#x27;re editing a single function at a time, and so nothing else needs to be parsed.<p>- no parser: The editor directly updates the AST, so you don&#x27;t have to read the whole file (there isn&#x27;t a &quot;file&quot; concept). Even in JS, that means an update takes a few milliseconds at the most.<p>- extremely incremental compilation: making a change in the editor only changes the exact AST construct that&#x27;s changing.<p>&gt; Lowering<p>This is really about compilation. One thing you can do, which is what we do, is have an interpreter. Now, interpreters are slow, but we simply have a different goal with the language, which is to run HTTP requests quickly. We do run into problems with the limit of the interpreter, but we plan to add a compiler later to deal with this.<p>Really what I&#x27;m suggesting here is that compiled languages look at having interpreters in addition to compilers.<p>&gt; i&#x2F;o performance<p>&gt; memory allocation<p>I think he&#x27;s approaching this with an implicit goal of &quot;it must be as fast as possible&quot;, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a goal for all languages.<p>&gt; You’ve done it, you’ve got a great prototype of the new language. Now what? Next comes the hardest part. This is where most new languages fail. You’ll be doing what every nascent rock band does — play shopping malls, high school dances, dive bars, etc., slowly building up an audience. For languages, this means preparing presentations, articles, tutorials, and books on the language. Then, going to programmer meetings, conferences, companies, anywhere they’ll have you, and show it off. You’ll get used to public speaking, and even find you enjoy it (I enjoy it a lot).<p>Well this is certainly correct!"],"time":["2020-05-02 23:13:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jakear"],"id":[23055357],"kids":[23055451,23057912,23055876],"parent":[23053773],"text":["Off topic:<p>Annoying that this is totally unreadable even at 300% zoom on an iPhone 11 Pro.<p>I feel like a set of people refuse to learn proper HTML&#x2F;CSS as some sort of statement, not realizing their laziness renders their work unavailable to the visually disabled.<p>HN behaves similarly poorly."],"time":["2020-05-03 00:21:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrisdone"],"id":[23053225],"kids":[23054638,23053490,23057279],"parent":[23052300],"text":["There&#x27;s a StrangeLoop talk about teaching programming by Felienne Hermans (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ<\/a>) that claims that all fields have an &quot;exploration vs instruction&quot; debate on how to teach their field, but this debate is apparently absent from the field of programming for the most part, wherein the &quot;mess around and figure it out&quot; exploration style of LOGO and Papert (&quot;every time you teach something, you deprive a [student] of the pleasure and benefit of discovery&quot;) is the predominant unquestioned wisdom.

Wally made up the\nname &quot;Logo.&quot;<p>&gt;The team Wally put together at BBN included Seymour Papert and Dan\nBobrow.  The three of them are credited as the designers of the first\nversion of the language; Dan wrote the first implementation.  In a BBN\nreport dated August, 1967, credit for additional work is given to\nRichard Grant, Cynthia Solomon, and Frank Frazier.<p>&gt;Seymour later started a Logo group at MIT, where Logo development\ncontinued.  The MIT versions of Logo were substantially different from\nthe BBN ones, both in the notations used and in the things the language\ncould do.  Most notably, turtle graphics was added at MIT.<p>&gt;Among the many people who contributed to the development of Logo at MIT,\nat the risk of leaving someone out, are Hal Abelson, Paul Goldenberg,\nDan Watt, Gary Drescher, Steve Hain, Leigh Klotz, Andy diSessa,\nBrian Silverman... oh, lots of people.<p>&gt;I think that most of the early documents are out of print now, but whatever\ndocumentation there is of the early efforts will be in the form of technical\nreports from BBN and from MIT.  You may have to visit Cambridge to find them!<p>&gt;From Leight Klotz:<p>&gt;In the mid 1970&#x27;s, when the AI Lab Lisp Machine project was just\ngetting underway, Marvin Minsky and Danny Hillis (later to found\nTerrapin, and still later, Thinking Machines) put together a project\nto build a Logo machine.  It had two components: a PDP-11 processor\n(the 3500) and a separate vector-graphics display (the 2500).  Guy Montpetit, a Canadian\nentrepeneur, funded development eventually, and a company called\nGeneral Turtle was formed.  General Turtle built and sold the 2500&#x2F;3500\nsystem.  Henry Minsky, then about 12, worked on the design of the\n2500, using the Stanford Draw program, one of the early electronics\nCAD systems.  (The 2500 had this really great barrell shifter stolen\nfrom the Lisp machine design, but it was later found not to work, so\nit was never used.) [...]<p>&gt;[...] Like Brian, I&#x27;ve left out many people who worked on Logo over the\nyears: Brian Fox and Flavio Rose worked for me at Terrapin on a\ncontract basis briefly, as did vagabond programmer Devon McCullough\n(who used to dial in with a 300 baud modem he&#x27;d written in entirely\nsoftware using the parallel game port, with an 80-column mixed-case\ndisplay done with 3x5 pixel characters; when the modem detected the\ncall waiting click on the line, it would make the Apple II speaker\nmake the telephone ringing sound -- a feature which I just saw a US\npatent filed on, not by Devon.), and the frustrated Sinclar QX programmer,\nwho I suspect doesn&#x27;t want his name used.  Of course, there were tons\nmore people at the AI Lab in the pre-commercial days...<p>&gt;From Lars Brinkhoff<p>&gt;Hello,<p>&gt;I&#x27;m mostly researching PDP-10 software, especially MIT&#x27;s Incompatible Timesharing System.<p>&gt;I have recently stumbled across some of the LOGO group work.  I have a\ncopy of the Dazzle Dart game that ran on their PDP-11&#x2F;45.  It uses the\nTom Knight vector display controller, so it&#x27;s not easy to run it.<p>&gt;Maybe it would be possible to get the original MIT PDP-11 LOGO running.<p>&gt;[...] It&#x27;s running now.<p>&gt;[...] Now also BBN PDP-10 Logo, MIT CLOGO, MIT Lisp Logo, and hopefully soon MIT Apple II Logo (direct ancestor of Terrapin Apple II Logo)."],"time":["2020-05-02 21:28:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DonHopkins"],"id":[23058440],"kids":[23064346,23058794],"parent":[23052300],"text":["Terrapin Logo for the Apple ][ and C64 came with a 6502 assembler written in Logo by Leigh Klotz, that they used to write Logo primitives (for controlling the turtle, etc).<p>It would be ambitious to make a self hosting 6502 Logo meta assembler, by porting the entire 6502 assembly language Logo source code to the 6502 Logo Assembler!<p>Leigh, wasn&#x27;t the assembler that you used for the original Apple ][ version of Logo written in MacLisp running on a PDP-10?<p>The Apple II Source Code for the LOGO Language Found (adafruit.com)\n379 points by mmastrac on Oct 4, 2018 | hide | past | web | favorite | 89 comments<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18142287\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18142287<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.adafruit.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-apple-ii-source-code-for-the-logo-language-found&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.adafruit.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-apple-ii-source-cod...<\/a><p>Lars: The link in the article to the code from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PDP-10&#x2F;its\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PDP-10&#x2F;its<\/a> is broken.

I am very much aware of the holding power of an interactive computer and of how taking the computer as a model can influence the way we think about ourselves. In fact the work on LOGO to which I have devoted much of the past years consists precisely of developing such forces in positive directions.&quot;<p>&gt;Seymour Papert<p>&gt;&quot;Logo is the name for a philosophy of education and for a continually evolving family of computer languages that aid its realization.&quot;<p>&gt;Harold Abelson<p>&gt;&quot;Historically, this idea that Logo is mainly turtle graphics is a mistake. Logo’s name comes from the Greek word for word, because Logo was first designed as a language in which to manipulate language: words and sentences.&quot;<p>&gt;Brian Harvey<p>&gt;Logo was initially created by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, Daniel G.Bobrow, Cynthia Solomon and Richard Grant in 1967 as part of a National Science Foundation sponsored research project conducted at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1969 Dr. Seymour Papert started the Logo Group at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Throughout the 1970s the majority of Logo development was conducted at MIT in the Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Division for Study and Research in Education, using large research computer systems, such as ITS powered PDP-10.<p>&gt;Our goal is to make that early Logo systems available to a wider audience of enthusiasts for exploration, experimenting and, of course, hacking.<p>[...]<p>&gt;MIT APLOGO<p>&gt;In accordance with Leigh L Klotz Jr., Hal Abelson directed the Logo for the Apple II project at MIT.<p>&gt;MIT APLOGO was developed by Stephen Hain, Patrick G.

My idea for a way to improve these simulations would be to include what could be the most important public policy issue of them all: In many US states, the governor has forbidden (or greatly restricted) pharmacies from dispensing hydroxychloroquine. How many people could be kept out of the ICU (when the medicine is used in conjunction with azithromycin or zinc) if governors allowed pharmacies to dispense this medicine? I&#x27;ve yet to see a study where hydroxychloroquine, when used in conjunction with z-pak or zinc, was found to be ineffective against COVID-19. Of course, that&#x27;s not proof of anything, but, with 25% unemployed in some of the biggest US cities, rigorous scientific studies may wind up taking more time than we can afford to wait.

For the vast majority of oil reservoirs, shutting in is good for production.  The reason is fairly intuitive - you drill into the oil-bearing part of the reservoir which is in the middle (beneath the gas but above the water).  When you suck on the oil, you pull water and gas through with it (&quot;coning&quot;) but when you stop, it all settles down again.  When you restart production you get more oil (valuable) and less gas (far less value, possibly worthless) and less water (worthless).<p>Lifting costs vary a great deal but for my high-cost-of-living part of the world, we still don&#x27;t spend more than about $20 a barrel to produce the oil.  Most of the world would be far less.<p>I think for the vast majority of the oil industry, we still make a small profit on low oil prices.  The economics of oil production is really that you spend a shitload up front (CAPEX) and then your continuing costs (OPEX) are an order of magnitude smaller.<p>And as our CEO said recently, when prices are low everybody expects to rise back to what we&#x27;re used to again soon, because we&#x27;re naturally optimistic.  But that&#x27;s not a law written in stone, it might be true that oil prices drop again in future, so we&#x27;re better off selling it today.<p>Also what they mentioned about waxy pipelines doesn&#x27;t affect most facilities.  Usually we would do a shock biocide dose for preservation, which is not a particularly high cost.  And if you&#x27;ve got a waxy crude, you&#x27;re probably going to get your wax issue within 12-24 hours anyway as soon as you cool to ambient, so a long shut-in and a short shut-in would be dealt with similarly."],"time":["2020-05-02 12:27:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DyslexicAtheist"],"id":[23050430],"kids":[23051225],"parent":[23041286],"text":["I used to work offshore in commercial diving &#x2F; ROVs.

Basically the current crisis is a double crisis of first Russia deciding to stop voluntarily limiting their oil production to keep the prices artificially high so the US producers don&#x27;t go bankrupt. And then the demand collapsed due to the lockdown. So over supply and demand collapse happened nearly at the same time.<p>What this means for producers in the US, that are increasingly relying on more expensive sources of oil is that Russia can collapse the prices to below their break even point any time they want. Same for the Saudi&#x27;s. That used to be the nuclear option when Opec controlled the prices. This is also where the word oligarchy comes from. Once oligarchies stop fixing prices they are suddenly competing for cost per barrel. And the simple truth is that when it comes to fracking, the cost is too high.<p>What that means in turn is that oil related investments suddenly got a lot more risky than they already were. All the easy sources have long been invested in and the remaining sources are increasingly difficult to exploit. Institutional investors have already been divesting away from oil for a few years. Price fluctuations like we&#x27;ve seen in the past decade ranging from negative to above 100$ per barrel means it&#x27;s a highly risky investment as you simply can&#x27;t know if you get back your money.<p>So, shutting down right now may get a permanent nature for a lot of companies as they&#x27;ll have a hard time getting investors to back bringing their plants online. The longer this lasts, the worse it gets. I expect a lot of recent investments to be written off completely. Also things like the Keystone pipeline are probably dead in the water as it is debatable whether the thing will ever be profitable.<p>IMHO that&#x27;s actually good news and will force people to look at alternative technologies and accelerate the agenda on e.g. switching to electrical vehicles, battery technology, alternative energy etc."],"time":["2020-05-02 12:25:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BurningFrog"],"id":[23052645],"kids":[23052687,23053445,23054558,23052887],"parent":[23041286],"text":["Oil income is supporting many horrible regimes.<p>I have some hope a prolonged oil glut might make some of them fall.<p>A world where Russia or Iran or Venezuela was run by decent government would be a great improvement!<p>I wish the same for Saudi, but I think that regime is safe."],"time":["2020-05-02 18:15:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anticensor"],"id":[23050559],"kids":[23051537],"parent":[23041286],"text":["It is hard to close, but is there no way to ramp down either?"],"time":["2020-05-02 11:34:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cachestash"],"id":[23052764],"kids":[23053057,23052915],"parent":[23041286],"text":["Walked past a petrol (gas) station earlier in the UK.

When A hits capacity, create a second read-write hash table B (a constant factor 1.0 &lt; n &lt; 1.5), and stop writing to A. Create a read-only hash table R, dump A into it. During this time, all reads look at [B, A, R] in sequence.  Once R is created, swap the list to [B, R].  When B fills, create another RW hash C (again resized) and dump R and B into a new read-only table S and swap the list to [C, S].<p>During resizes you only ever have 3 places to look.

(edit: just saw other comments mentioning this).<p>2) Many restaurateurs don&#x27;t have the skill or knowledge to run a restaurant, and yet they do so because it&#x27;s often one of the few options left (if you can&#x27;t land a high-paying job, and don&#x27;t like a low-pay one).<p>3) What she describes in the article is very US-centric. Most of Europe, or Japan (where I am currently sheltering before returning to the US soon), have a very different restaurant landscape. Most are small mom-and-pop shop, they have very low ops costs, and can do not too bad in a time like this one. I spoke with a few owners recently (in Italy and Japan) and they all confirmed it. They mostly don&#x27;t have personnel, or if they do, their relationship is flexible enough that they can quickly react to 2-3 months of 50-70% less business than usual.<p>4) For the long term, nobody knows what&#x27;s going to happen.

Think of a suburban neighborhood in Madrid or Rome, where a small restaurant is just as common as a tabacchi &#x2F; corner convenience store.<p>I believe (have not seen a careful study yet) that the rent-seeking &#x2F; zoning policies of our cities in the US increase greatly the cost of running restaurants.  And incentivize &#x2F; prohibit anything but large commercial &#x2F; chain places from surviving as a rule.   It makes it very hard for small experiments or small-time mom-and-pop shops to survive and stay in a community for decades at the low profits those places are willing to accept.  There may also be something about the small square footage of typical shops in such cities being unfavorable towards chain restaurants which seem to require a certain size (like hotel properties).<p>The landscape of our policies for cities, neighborhoods, plus the way they interact with our corporations, directly translates into the kinds of restaurants that we get as a result."],"time":["2020-05-02 07:44:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["every"],"id":[23049424],"kids":[23049653,23049565,23050136],"parent":[23044987],"text":["I worked bar and restaurant for 25 years.

Think of all of the inefficients around grocery stores--you have to travel there, wait in a bunch of different lines, pick out everything you need yourself, travel home, put a bunch of what you bought into a big, cold box, and then when you&#x27;re finally ready to have a meal, you have to know how to cook everything yourself, and deal with the pain of cleaning up the mess you made doing so.<p>Food delivery seems like it should be more efficient--you don&#x27;t have to waste time by going to buy ingredients and cooking food, but it&#x27;s horribly expensive. That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a lot of middle men in there--the delivery guy, the cook, the restaurant manager, the restaurant owner, the coders buying the app you ordered on, the marketeers who you learned about the app in the first place. All those people need to take a cut of cost of putting food into your belly.<p>Meal kits were supposed to be a middle point, but they&#x27;ve all pretty much failed, unable to bring the cost down much further than restaurant delivery. And people really just don&#x27;t want to cook and clean up.<p>Fast, good, cheap. I think you can get all three if you focus on finding efficiencies.<p>1) Only do drive through or walk by pick up. People can pick up food on the way home from work.<p>2) Order ahead on an app. Maybe days in advance. That way, food is ready at a specified time and can be handed off as soon as the custom drives&#x2F;walks up.

In fact the first few Google search results e.g. [1] confirms what I suspected: margins were low single digits even 10+ years back.<p>Therefore, this makes it less likely that there is a paradise lost of high restaurant margins we can return to, and more likely that some fundamental parameters that make the economic equilibrium of restaurant margins really low.<p>A guess for these parameters include:<p>- High competition: there are dozens if not hundreds of different restaurants I could walk to in 10 minutes (living in a US city).<p>- Low barriers to entry: a good minority of the population can learn how to operate an okay restaurant.<p>- A lot of owners get &quot;passion utility&quot; out of running a restaurant -- this means they are willing to be paid less in cash.<p>- Lastly but maybe most importantly, incredibly price sensitive customers.

Many restaurants here in Germany have switched to offer take-away food, so while drastically down, their business is not going away completely. And of course, the market isn&#x27;t going away. As soon as restaurants can operate mostly normal again, the demand will be back, if not even much higher at least initially, because everyone is missing eating out at the moment.<p>So the question is more, can the restaurants survive the time in between? And this is not a question of margin, it is a question of fixed costs. The employee costs are quite reduced, as they are fired or on temporary leave. Here in Germany, the salaries are covered to large parts by the government and public insurance in times where there is not enough work for a business as a whole. This leaves the rent for the restaurant as the big cost factor and the rent is also the biggest cost factor which makes restaurants struggle in normal times. Which also kills all attempts an raising the margin as described in the article. And this isn&#x27;t limited to restaurants only, the true reason small shops are disappearing isn&#x27;t only online purchase, it is the real estate costs which keep rising until the shops and restaurants are operating at minimal margin. This is where in this crisis and going forward, the survival of restaurants and businesses is decided.<p>For the restaurants themselves, a lot can and should be improved to raise their margins. First of all, many restaurants are badly run. It is easy to cook and serve a burger, it is an entirely different challenge to run the business so that you make a profit. This is why some restaurants are in a constant struggle while others are hugely profitable. And of course, as with any lasting business, you have to put money aside in good times to survive bad times.<p>The post doesn&#x27;t talk about beverages. At least here in Europe, the places often are just making even at the food while earning a lot with beverages. Especially as in the evenings, people don&#x27;t leave the restaurant so quickly after the food has been eaten, but stay for some more drinks and conversation. This is why I always order a drink even when being out for lunch. When they serve me a glass of water for 2-3€, that is basically their profit.<p>But all of that goes to nothing, if all the profit is absorbed by the real estate costs. Short term, the landlords will have to waive quite a large part of their rent, or they are going to find out that a bankrupt restaurant pays no rent at all.

I&#x27;ve used Trac, MediaWiki, MoinMoin, Confluence, GitHub Wiki (+ Gollum), and finally Notion. Notion is easy-to-use for non-developers, but still mostly supports Markdown. It makes rich content easy, including tables, in-line images, code snippets. It supports GDoc-style real-time editing, fine- &amp; coarse-grained permissioning, in-line comments, mentions, and versioning. It&#x27;s a great wiki.<p>It&#x27;s really, really easy to over-use a wiki for everything. It&#x27;s also really easy for wikis to get under-utilized, out-of-date, etc.<p>But if you&#x27;re a fully distributed team with 20+ people, you need somewhere to store your team policies&#x2F;practices, your culture, your vision&#x2F;roadmap, etc. Notion is a great fit for this.<p>If you try to use Notion as the &quot;hub for all of your work&quot;, you&#x27;ll certainly be disappointed, just as you would have been using any other &quot;wiki&quot; product for this. For example, though we use Notion as our team wiki, we still use:<p>- GitHub Issues for bug reports, because it&#x27;s built perfectly for this, and links with code and pull requests seamlessly<p>- GitHub project boards for code-oriented project management, because it can kanban-ize GH issues to visualize capacity, issue stages, and project&#x2F;milestone progress<p>- Trello for non-code project management, because if you&#x27;re not a programmer, Trello is much simpler than GH Issues&#x2F;Projects, and nails the experience of a kanban project board<p>- StackOverflow for Teams for FAQ-oriented team &amp; product knowledge base<p>- GDocs for long docs, forms, slides, spreadsheets, and so on -- and especially when these need to be shared &quot;officially&quot; with external parties<p>- Slack for real-time chat and notifications, often linking to the above tools<p>I think part of the dissatisfaction expressed in this article is that Notion is being hyped (especially with the VC valuations) as &quot;the future of all work&quot;, similar to Slack in a prior startup generation.<p>Slack is better IRC for busy teams who prefer a SaaS. Notion is better MediaWiki for busy teams who prefer a SaaS. Neither is an all-in-one work hub. Neither is &quot;the future of work&quot;.

Sometimes I use a bash script to combine them all into one big file to easily search through them.<p>I use &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; symbol to mark the important ideas&#x2F;insights so I could easily search for them later.<p>I use hashtags to organize ideas and notes by topics. Like #pst for blog post ideas, #gamedev for everything I&#x27;ve learned about game development, #book for books I want to read, #health 2020-05-02 for daily notes about my health, #todo 2020-05-02 for todos, etc.<p>Notes aren&#x27;t organized in any other way, it&#x27;s just stream of consciousness.

Shifting sand of non-backwards compatibility. Notice how of the above list everyone except Linux and Android have solid back compat stories. Video games are in development for 2-3 years, and stay on the market for 5+ years with no planned recompiles. So a 7 year period of support after inital build machine setup is expected, anything less is going to get your platform side lined.<p>3. Small market. Mac users make up a share of sales similar to Linux. &quot;What are you talking about! Linux is 1% while Mac is a whole 4%!&quot;, nope! Those numbers are the same insignificance per a video game business plan. Platforms with such low sales, like Stadia, might be support provided the platform owner pays porting costs.<p>4. Culture.
