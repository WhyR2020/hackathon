We shy away from hard work because inherent in hard work is risk. Hard work is hard because you might fail. You can’t fail at long work, you merely show up. You fail at hard work when you don’t make an emotional connection, or when you don’t solve the problem or when you hesitate.<p>I disagree with this, at least what the author classifies as risk. I&#x27;m more than happy to take on challenging work, work I am emotionally connected to and want to see succeed--then fail.

It could be health risk work (say a police officer), failed research resulting in lack of a job, or a poor new art collection that ruins the future career of an artist.<p>Our society needs to learn to be more accepting to to a few more degrees of failure than the hypercompetiveness currently allows. Less and less failure is being acceptable and it&#x27;s completely unrealistic to hold all humans to these standards. Yes, we should reward high risk success but should we punish every form of failure as we often do?

He passed away due to  mesothelioma, but her father who grew up there has not been affected, which is quite amazing given the circumstances. I have seen footage from Wittenoom of children playing in mounds of asbestos.<p>Today there are two general types of legacy asbestos products, friable and non-friable. Generally non-friable products such as asbestos-cement sheeting are considered safe to leave in place and are only dangerous when cut, broken or otherwise damaged. Friable products such as pipe lagging are very dangerous as they easily break down into fibers that can be inhaled.<p>It can be found in many old homes in odd places. I was removing some old putty around a window and a friend of mine who was an asbestos hygienist suggested that it could contain asbestos and took a sample for testing (all clear thankfully).<p>In another instance I worked on a demolition of a 1960&#x27;s era multistory apartment complex. During construction of the concrete core walls the builder had used asbestos in the formwork, leaving some embedded in the wall at regular intervals. This meant that all of demolition waste was considered contaminated and was going to a special dump at a huge cost.<p>Finally, there was an infamous case in Canberra, Australia where a company called Mr Fluffy [1] installed loose friable asbestos as insulation in homes. A cleanup program in the 90&#x27;s did not adequately fix the problem and so in 2014 the government finally purchased affected properties and demolished the houses.<p>Asbestos is bad stuff, but exposure causing mesothelioma seems to be a bit like Russian roulette. You might get it, you might not. But if you do, you will die.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mr_Fluffy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mr_Fluffy<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 01:45:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aresant"],"id":[24298513],"kids":[24298602,24298605,24298659,24299149,24299929],"parent":[24298104],"text":["Build on this even in 1942, just prior to the discovery of the link to Mesothelioma, we were busily figuring out every use case we could for asbestos - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tC8L8ooBSgQ&amp;t=1m8s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tC8L8ooBSgQ&amp;t=1m8s<\/a><p>Despite the recognition of Mesothelioma in the early 1900s it took almost 40 years to associate the disease with Asbestos.<p>My understanding is that this was due to the 10 - 40 year average post exposure timeline for Mesothelioma to show up.<p>If Asbestos was discovered today would our contemporary understanding of materials science &amp; safety prevent us from spinning up factories and use cases like this?<p>(1) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;asbestosis&#x2F;symptoms-causes&#x2F;syc-20354637\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;asbestosis&#x2F;sy...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-27 22:51:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liability"],"id":[24298420],"kids":[24298487,24299922,24299448],"parent":[24298104],"text":["I&#x27;ve heard this Charlemagne legend before but I&#x27;d love to see somebody put it to the test.

I’ve been on Hacker News 13 years but this is my first Show HN. You might know me from YC08 and as Heroku cofounder and author of 12factor.net.<p>Today my team and I are launching Muse, a thinking tool.<p>Engineers sometimes talk about “typing problems” and “thinking problems”;  Muse is for the latter. For example: designing a distributed system, doing a deep read of an algorithms paper, or creating a product roadmap.<p>My colleagues and I spent a few years doing research at a lab called Ink &amp; Switch. You can read HN discussions of our publications on software performance [1], the creative process [2], and local-first software [3].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18506170\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18506170<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20255457\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20255457<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21581444\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21581444<\/a><p>One research question for us was whether touchscreens could ever be as powerful as desktop tools like vim or emacs. That resulted a prototype we named Muse. We saw commercial potential and spun it out of the lab last year.<p>A founding insight for Muse is that deep thinking happens away from the computer. e.g. in a sketchbook, on a whiteboard, or just in your head. There are some up-and-coming tools for thought like Notion and Roam but they’re tied to the desktop&#x2F;laptop form factor and primarily focused on text. We saw an opportunity for a thinking tool that blends together visual media, text, and offers spatial navigation on a tablet.<p>Since this is a technical crowd, you might be interested in some of the challenges building this thing, like maintaining 120fps at all times. There is no concept of opening a file or a loading screen—you just navigate to a document and it’s already there. Ink rendering is another ongoing engineering challenge, from point simplification to curve fitting to stroke masking for the eraser. Happy to talk about any of this in the comments.<p>We’re charging $100&#x2F;year, comparable to other prosumer tools like Dropbox, Evernote, Roam, etc. There’s a generous free tier and you can export your data as a flat files (PNG, PDF, TXT).<p>We’re building in public on Twitter: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MuseAppHQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MuseAppHQ<\/a> and Mark and I talk shop on our podcast: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;museapp.com&#x2F;podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;museapp.com&#x2F;podcast<\/a><p>HN is known for sharp critique, so bring it on.

What used to be a full install of Debian with your app checked out in &#x2F;var&#x2F;www is now a Docker container containing only the packages you need.  The even more careful people don&#x27;t even use Debian, they use a stripped down distribution like Alpine.  The even more careful people don&#x27;t have a distribution, they just have their application and the one or two support files it needs (ca-certs usually).  It is intriguing to apply this approach to OS features itself, because less dependence on the OS means that more of the kernel can be safely shared.  And, of course, there is less surprise at something that is enabled by default that you don&#x27;t need.  (I feel like 99% of security is disabling stupid things that are on by default.  With Linux, you never know if you got them all.)<p>Being able to share the kernel safely means potentially better utilization. (The progression is dedicated machines -&gt; hypervisor-based VMs -&gt; multiple customers sharing the Linux kernel.  gVisor exists for that last step, but I don&#x27;t see anyone willing to sell me the ability to run my random container next to their mission-critical security-sensitive app, whereas people are perfectly happy to share CPUs with me if there is a hypervisor in the middle.  But we&#x27;re certainly moving in that direction.)<p>It is also intriguing to imagine a world that moves the other direction; just have a giant computer with thousands of power-efficient CPUs in it and no virtualization.  When a request comes in to your app, your CPU is just powered on, your app boots in a millisecond, handles the request, and shuts down.  I am not sure even the big cloud providers have solved the time-of-day utilization problems; being able to turn most of the computers off at night has some potential to save money.  (I would turn my workstation off at night if it booted in 1 millisecond in the morning, for example.  I can also imagine some power savings for mobile devices if they could go hard off for 59 seconds out of every minute.)"],"time":["2019-12-29 19:21:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["StavrosK"],"id":[21905950],"kids":[21907436,21906410],"parent":[21905856],"text":["This looks great, but I&#x27;m wary of projects that sound <i>this<\/i> great but don&#x27;t include a &quot;downsides&quot; section.

I&#x27;m cognitively no genius by any metric but certainly &#x27;well capable&#x27; relatively to most people (strong points being speed of thought, clarity&#x2F;precision to a fault, powerful synthesis). I however have a bad factual memory in general, I need to &#x27;do&#x27; or &#x27;understand&#x27; things to really memorize (e.g. I suck at poems, lyrics, can&#x27;t even remember mine, but I love systems, physics, logic).<p>Without explanations or hazardous &#x27;hypotheses&#x27; (hum) as to why, here are my observations and personal &#x27;tricks&#x27;. Spoiler: no magic, just directed effort, solving for X.<p>- There is an inverse relationship between speed and depth of information input. The faster you take it in, <i>even if you feel like you understand all of it<\/i> (and may, factually), the shallower your actual <i>intake<\/i> will be in the long run. Generally. Emotions act as a catalyzer for memory, but cloud thinking temporarily.<p>- The more massive a piece of content (book, article..), the <i>slower<\/i> I want to go if I aim at a constant result (comprehension, food for thought, memory, etc). I may speed up when cruising if the content lends itself to that (repetitive, very structured, etc). Essentially, whenever recent memory won&#x27;t cut it to think and remember, because there&#x27;s too much content, or it&#x27;s too complex, I need my long-term memory sparked into activation.<p>- I read fast in general, but it has nothing to do with &#x27;techniques&#x27; related to the act of reading itself: it&#x27;s entirely a mental &#x27;mode&#x27; or &#x27;state&#x27;, that I only ever get otherwise in sports, this moment when you just <i>trigger<\/i> the beast and <i>commit<\/i> entirely to victory. When you just won&#x27;t fail, when it&#x27;s &#x27;all-in&#x27;. That level of focus, of concentration, is best exercised with training, of any kind. So indeed you need to <i>think<\/i>, not just read, and actually want to even <i>write<\/i> and <i>use<\/i> the substance if you are to maximize its results on you.<p>- It&#x27;s very important for me to begin slow, whatever the average pace later on. I need to get acquainted with the author, their go-to vocabulary and grammar subsets, the point they&#x27;re making. Sometimes it never clicks and the whole piece is tedious for me. Sometimes it&#x27;s so clear I feel like I could have written it myself, at least the structure of it. It&#x27;s a thing, hard to explain. I guess why all we have our own favorites and dreaded authors.<p>I like people who speak relatively fast because I don&#x27;t get easily distracted or bored when they talk to me, so speeding up audiobooks is a personal treat; but there&#x27;s a limit if I want to retain anything more than fuzzy snapshots of partial points. I may understand 100% on the spot (I actually do nothing else but listen and focus), but it&#x27;s evading memory, evaporating in the long run. Ultimately it means that book won&#x27;t change me beyond a few impressions, it just won&#x27;t make its mark, it never had a chance to imbue my consciousness — only my superficial cognition. However sharp, it can&#x27;t substitute for the real thing.<p>An exercise I do if I really want to use or remember (be &#x27;changed&#x27;) by some piece of content — article, book, chapter, quote, podcast, piece of code... — is to do the &quot;good student duty&quot; of writing a short essay: summarize what you read, raise a few interesting points about it, elaborate a bit beyond (make that new material become food for your thought, <i>use<\/i> it like it&#x27;s a new word you just learned, or a new math technique).<p>It only takes ~30 minutes or so, easily 10 minutes if the material is easy, an hour if it blew your mind, I don&#x27;t know... well worth it, because it has a lasting power for years. But do it well, because that exercise you &#x27;submit&#x27; to no one but yourself will become part of the memory of that content, you will <i>see<\/i> your own words sometimes before&#x2F;above the actual author&#x27;s.<p>Hopefully this helps someone trying it my way. The hard way. The no-genius no-magic no-trick way. The way that lets one play in the present with stuff learned 10, 20 years before.<p>TL;DR: the faster you read, the shallower it gets beyond some sweet spot, probably biological but trainable; speed is good when it forces you to focus, but not beyond that — it must not become a distraction from actual understanding. If that is your goal. Using at least in thought what you read is my preferred way to really internalize something, make it <i>mine<\/i>, thus remember it for <i>long enough<\/i> usually. At least I probably won&#x27;t be able to forget that it exists, and then I can search it for finer points."],"time":["2019-12-29 02:08:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["droithomme"],"id":[21904060],"kids":[21912610],"parent":[21891316],"text":["I read extremely slowly compared to most, but seem to come up with more insights as well as debunkings.<p>A relative of mine is a natural born speed reader.

For the record there&#x27;s nothing wrong a non-tech company not wanting to pay top dollar for engineers, some random ecommerce store probably doesn&#x27;t need world class engineers, just like a semiconductor manufacturer doesn&#x27;t need the best graphic designers.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with the UK so I don&#x27;t know firsthand why UK engineer salaries are so much lower than in the U.S., but if I were to guess I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s largely because their culture just doesn&#x27;t value engineering talent like in SV.<p>2.

Apple&#x27;s market cap is $9m&#x2F;employee, revenue is $2m&#x2F;employee, gross profit margin is 38%, and they have $245b in cash. Even unicorns that bleed money (eg. Uber) are flush with cheap capital from VCs, with Uber having raised $20b to date.<p>Looking at it from this metric, it would seem that engineers are <i>underpaid<\/i> relative to the value they create.

Consider this:<p>1. Wages are dictated by supply and demand.<p>2. Software has no formal entry requirements, anyone who can demonstrate competence can get hired as a software engineer.<p>3. The same set of traits make someone good at software development and other branches of STEM.<p>4. An increasing, if not already majority, of young STEM graduates are also more than familiar with software development. Many do it as part of their non-tech day-to-day jobs. They may not be able to start working as a software dev on Monday, but given a relatively short amount of time (a couple of months) to prepare, they can switch to software just fine.<p>5. Pay for software jobs is multiple times higher than other SEM jobs.<p>I do not see this situation as steady. Here is my speculation: If the wage gap persists, more and more STEM graduates would seek careers in software. This will increase the supply of labour in software and decrease it in the rest of STEM, until the wage gaps closes or at least shrinks significantly. At this point, the new wages for all STEM would be lower than current tech salaries but higher than current SEM salaries. Since the number of tech graduates is much lower than the number of all other graduates, the equilibrium point would be closer to current SEM salaries than current tech salaries.*<p>* Note: I don&#x27;t know the statistics, but I presume that universities take roughly the same number of students in each STEM major. So a university may have approximately 100 graduates per year in each of software, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, ..., biology, physics, ... If for every 100 software graduates, there are 900 SEM graduates, and if only 10% of each SEM major&#x27;s graduates decide to seek work in software, supply of labour in each SEM category would decrease by 10%, but for software it will increase by 90%. The effect on software salaries would thus be more steep.

I suspect most developers need to spend time at least reading and honing their skills across their career.  To be fair many doctors read medical journals and may attend seminars.<p>The difference between a doctor, lawyer vs a programmer is that a programmer emerges from a computer science program in a &quot;larval stage&quot;.  Most fresh graduates have very little experience in knowing how to structure code at the level of a senior software engineer.   There are years ahead to, maybe, get to the point of mastery.<p>The professional fields, in particular Doctors, require that the residency graduate is more or less fully &quot;baked&quot; and can perform their role without error.  That the residency is grueling is just an artifact of the way the profession organizes itself.  Personally I think it is dangerous to require doctors to run long shifts.  It is almost more of a test of physical fortitude.<p>There is the full gamut of intelligence and diligence in the medical community, just as in the software engineering community.

As it&#x27;s been 2 and a half years since I wrote this post, I thought I&#x27;d give a little update as to the tools I use since my preferences have changed slightly. (I know this comment would be more useful as an addendum to the original post, but since I&#x27;m currently on holiday it&#x27;s just quicker to type everything out here for now.)<p>I switched to using Eclipse as my Java IDE about a year ago. The reason for this is that Eclipse is much nicer to use with a keyboard and a screen reader. The state of Java GUI accessibility is a little convoluted and I won&#x27;t go into that here (look up Java Access Bridge if you&#x27;re interested), but basically Eclipse works better and faster because its UI toolkit uses the platform&#x27;s native accessibility API&#x27;s directly. I guess the reason why I picked up IntelliJ in the first place was that literally every Java developer I knew at the time was using it, so naturally I thought it couldn&#x27;t be a bad choice. Also, I had used Eclipse briefly in 2013, and let&#x27;s just say it was nowhere as nice as it is today.<p>I have also ditched Notepad++ for daily development work. I do use it for notetaking and other similar things, but for non-Java based coding Visual Studio Code is all I use these days. I had experimented with VS Code when I wrote this post, but back then it still had some accessibility-related bugs that had to be ironed out. However, they were fixed a long time ago and I&#x27;ve been very happy with my experience so far. VS Code&#x27;s team has been incredibly committed to ensuring their work is accessible, and these days I just expect things to work right out of the box. And this is something I usually never, ever do.<p>Other than that things have stayed pretty much the same. I&#x27;m still on Windows 10 and  am using NVDA as my screen reader, neither of which is likely to change anytime soon.

Publishers don&#x27;t like the ebook market, and my guess is that it&#x27;s because of how little control they have over it.<p>In the world of ebooks, indies actually have the upper hand. For one, we don&#x27;t have the overhead of big publishers, so we can sell ebooks at more reasonable prices (while pocketing more than authors with traditional contracts). We have the ability to move more quickly and thus take advantage of new features (like Amazon&#x27;s ad platform) earlier. We can sell worldwide with a click, instead of negotiating messy contracts.<p>With print on demand, we can also have our books in print. But publishers definitely have the upper hand there and, I presume, always will.<p>Also, as an indie I have the option to make my books available DRM-free.<p>Personally, I _like_ ebooks, especially for fiction. They weigh nothing. They have search. My highlights can get aggregated together. I can switch devices and even switch between ebook and audiobook.

Most books are mass-printed, shipped to warehouses, then shipped to local sellers (or e.g. Amazon, that ships a single book to a buyer) - and the (huge) non-sellable rests are either deeply discounted or completely dumped. If you see a pile of the latest &quot;bestseller&quot; at the local store, its almost guaranteed that only a fraction is sold, the rest will be disposed.<p>Moreover, most print books, magazines and newspapers aren&#x27;t even fully read by the buyers, let alone multiple times. Its a huge industry producing, promoting and selling mostly single-use items.<p>And the used market for most books is virtually non-existent: I had to move a couple of times and the paper weight was one of the biggest hurdles. I dumped lots of books because I couldn&#x27;t find a buyer on the used market (handling would far exceed the value of the books, some companies buy used books only based on weight and condition) and even libraries and social services like the Caritas declined to take used books.<p>So, I&#x27;m really wondering why we as a society aren&#x27;t more demanding on the sustainable side of the publishing business, especially the environmental effects.

According to the publishers in that recent case in the CJEU, you get a perpetual licence (not ownership) to access their copyright content, which never deteriorates in the same way that physical books do. As a result, the publishers claimed successfully, you aren’t free to sell on your licence, and can only do so if they, the copyright owners, agree. In other words, you pay much the same price for something which immediately on purchase becomes worthless.<p>Well... what&#x27;s the difference there?  That doesn&#x27;t seem like it, since it&#x27;s no less true of movies or music.<p>Actually, my guess is that most people never read most of the books they buy.  Maybe they intend to, but it ends up mostly being some kind of affirmation of the kind of person they are.

Nothing other than your eyeballs and hands are needed to interface with a book. No batteries, headphones, passwords, or wires. Plus reading a book is quite a different experience as your mind is actively painting images and creating sounds. Video and audio can present some wonderful sensations but ultimately arent as personal as the creations of your minds eye (and ear). So books as they are work very well and do exactly what they were meant to do. Plus reading on a screen sucks and who wants to buy another electronic gizmo with a good screen like e ink which will become obsolete, fail, or have your book deleted after some DRM copyright spat? Please no.<p>Video and Audio NEED electronics. They are already hamstrung with a technological need so consuming via digital means is much more practical. And as far as physical media goes nowadays, it&#x27;s less convenient than streaming. Though Music still enjoys a strong association with the medium being an art so it goes hand in hand with physical collecting which is why you still see tapes and vinyl. Like a book, you want to be able to hold it and also enjoy the art work.

Basically centralized services can roll out changes quickly and decentralized ones are more or less set in stone.<p>However, I feel that maybe he isn&#x27;t considering the downsides of being able to change quickly. Sure WhatsApp was able to add end-to-end encryption with a single update, but they can just as easily remove encryption with another update. Additionally, while I will admit that it sucks that email is not encrypted, knowing how many people and businesses rely on email every day, it should be incredibly difficult to make changes to it. I don&#x27;t want a single person or company to be able too suddenly decide to change how email works.<p>One area where I am sympathetic towards Moxie and Signal is requiring phone numbers (mentioned at the end in the Q&amp;A).

In the process, he ignores attempts to work on what I&#x27;d consider the primary problem (something someone thankfully poked him about during the Q&amp;A, though I&#x27;d say not hard enough)--transport obfuscation--and thereby goes so far as to claim that decentralized systems are fundamentally less private (using an example involving peer-to-peer video&#x2F;audio calls on Signal that they decided to instead route through their centralized servers) based on that assumption of non-private transports (as clearly we should all trust Moxie Marlinspike and the handful of people who work at Signal with our metadata over anyone else we might want to be able to choose to trust).<p>As part of this, he spends a lot of time trying to argue that people don&#x27;t actually have any useful control in a decentralized system anyway, which is, of course, extremely convenient given how he doesn&#x27;t really acknowledge that the entire point of his thesis is that he and his centralized organization not only should but in fact <i>must<\/i> maintain <i>all the control<\/i> so that he can follow the moving ecosystem :&#x2F;. Meanwhile, he cites federated systems of the past as clear and unmitigated failures, including specifically IP, a layer upon which he somehow manages to build Signal on top of despite being supposedly fundamentally and horribly flawed due to being a decentralized protocol frozen in time and nearly impossible to change (which isn&#x27;t even true! IPv6 was insane for actively going out of its way to break transition paths, but as many people have pointed out it didn&#x27;t have to be that way; and even within IPv4 we have seen a lot of manipulation and progress in the form of protocol extensions. many of his other examples are also clearly flawed if you know anything at all about the protocols involved).<p>&quot;Finally&quot;--a word I use here both in terms of it being the most repetitively frustrating things about this talk (and so I list it last) but also as it came up again at the very end (thereby closing the video) due to a question from the audience poking him hard on this point (to great applause)--he continues his apologetic rhetoric for the idea that phone numbers are somehow <i>better<\/i> as an identifier than any other possible alternative--something that is so wrong on the face of it that we can point at <i>ludicrously<\/i> popular chat systems, such as Kik, that were largely popular <i>because<\/i> they did not use phone numbers at all, in addition to the vast majority of popular social networks that merely use phone numbers for account password recovery (and while many of them now require phone numbers to sign up, that is entirely unrelated to the service and how you use it, and was usually not the case when the service first came into existence: it was way more common to require an e-mail address than a phone number)--to the point of seriously claiming multiple times that ceding control of identity to the telecom infrastructure (something we know is horribly insecure even if you trusted all of the players, which I don&#x27;t think anyone does) is one of the things that makes chat fundamentally better than e-mail (?!?).<p>Really, the best line from the video came from someone in the audience asking a question, leading with: &quot;thanks for the thought provoking talk... you said so many things I disagree with, it is tough to pick a question&quot; :&#x2F;. For me, that feeling goes well past just this talk and his positions on chat systems: his love for Intel SGX--a technology that has been broken multiple times and whose key feature, Remote Attestation, is just &quot;DRM&quot; by another name--puts him on what I would argue is &quot;the wrong side&quot; of the war over general purpose computing, wanting to rely on user-hostile hardware to protect decentralized cryptocurrencies (such as his MobileCoin) from attack by anyone... other than Intel, obviously, as they can be trusted?... or any governments that can lean on Intel, as maybe we like those governments?... or of course, anyone with a zero-day hardware side channel attack, as we can pretend all of those have been found? :&#x2F;... essentially, in the end, most of his positions just seem like a way to shill for centralized government control over everything, with metadata being protected only by the security of the memory of his servers (something which was pointed out by yet another question from the audience, and for which he didn&#x27;t really have a good answer) wherein the best case scenario is that laws like the DMCA end up being what protect us from attackers as opposed to actual math :&#x2F;."],"time":["2019-12-29 07:41:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["inputmice"],"id":[21906348],"kids":{},"parent":[21904041],"text":["The irony of a talk that speaks out against decentralized systems being only available on decentralized backups of the centralized original…"],"time":["2019-12-29 16:28:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hncensorsnonpc"],"id":[21905493],"kids":[21905658],"parent":[21904041],"text":["The link gives me an error"],"time":["2019-12-29 13:10:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geuis"],"id":[21905533],"kids":[21905661,21907346,21906802],"parent":[21904041],"text":["Link is dead now. 404"],"time":["2019-12-29 13:22:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21904272],"kids":{},"parent":[21904041],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-29 06:54:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["Glosster"],"id":[21904972],"kids":[21904997,21904985],"parent":[21904041],"text":["Why is he saying that email is not encrypted?

My goal is having a clear log of what I did, when I did it, and any useful references all integrated into my general note-taking system, so perhaps some of these observations could be useful:<p>1. It is a highly personal process. I&#x27;ve tried copying high-level systems (like GTD and its derivatives), specific note-taking &#x2F; TODO paradigms, productivity&#x2F;habit tracking apps, and other journaling approaches, and I&#x27;ve always found that if the system is not built around your own habits and preferences, you will eventually lose motivation. Figuring out your own style seems to be important. Another general principle I’ve found is keeping the tools simple. Mostly text-based, always available offline, built to last, etc. Develop the habits, then adopt fancier tools.<p>2. For quick context-capturing and bookmarking, I rely on email and Pocket. I prefer email because it is reliable, it&#x27;ll be here in 20 years, and it is fast to flag a message as &quot;needs attention&quot; or e-mail yourself an important thought or reminder. Pocket seems to just work across all my devices, so I haven&#x27;t had any reason to branch out. Whenever I have time during the day, I organize this “unorganized” view by either taking care of the item (if it’s a quick article in Pocket or errand in email), skipping it (it’s fine to de-prioritize things until later), or by triaging it into Evernote:<p>3. I use Evernote for a <i>lot<\/i> of things (including all my technical notes, paper highlights, personal journaling, my &quot;principles&quot; document, philosophy on nutrition, habit aspirations, workout plans, and so on), but of interest for this question is probably a topic-specific log and backlog system. Near the top of my Evernote shortcuts are four log links (Daily Log, Technical Log, Health Log, Workout Log).<p>4. Daily Log is where I can make a plan for each day, or put nothing here, or just have a place to ramble (writing down thoughts helps internalize them, after all). This is something of an unstructured personal journal.<p>5. Technical Log is for all technical work that I undertake (coding train-of-thought, reading papers, reading blog-posts, etc.). In reality, under each date, this log contains a bunch of Evernote links to more detailed notes on specific technical topics, but the big benefit here is being able to look back over the course of a week or month about what kind of insights or interesting concepts I’ve come across. It’s particularly useful to read the day after and get most of the context back quickly. I usually always have this log file opened.<p>6. Health and workout logs track both metrics and how I generally felt that day (health-wise and workout-wise, respectively). It’s ok to have empty days. The important part is filling in on days when things are particularly bad, or particularly good, so you can reflect.<p>7. After this, I have a bunch of backlog shortcuts — so when I triage items from Pocket or my email, they go into the appropriate backlog list. Examples for me: Backlog of {ML reading, CS reading, Bio reading, Travel destinations, Video&#x2F;TV&#x2F;Movies, Restaurants, Games, Running routes, Books, etc.}. Backlogs are great -- they are lightweight, they can grow indefinitely, and you&#x27;ll naturally prune them of things that you don&#x27;t care about after some time. Really, lists are a great way of writing things down! When I&#x27;m at a coffee shop, I&#x27;ll pick and item from one of my reading backlogs, if I&#x27;m not already working on something. When I have time to plan a weekend, I can scroll through my recreational backlogs and combine some items to fill out my schedule.<p>8. I like having a high level view of what I did and what I have coming up on long time scales, and for this I use a big spreadsheet, one sheet per year, one row per week, where all past and future social events, travels, and “macro” events. It’s useful to be able to look back at months or years of events and figure out who you spent time with, how often you traveled, or went out, etc. I prefer the spreadsheet to a calendar app because I don’t feel the pressure of adding specific times and I can keep it uncluttered.<p>Having a centralized place (along with a calendar or some kind of macro-overview) seems to work well for me, because I can easily cross-reference just about any day of the year to figure out what I did that day, my state of mind that day, and so on."],"time":["2019-12-29 20:42:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidjnelson"],"id":[21908333],"kids":{},"parent":[21906650],"text":["Evernote isn’t perfect, but it works well enough."],"time":["2019-12-29 21:45:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jvagner"],"id":[21913614],"kids":{},"parent":[21906650],"text":["A personal slack."],"time":["2019-12-30 15:45:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Sargos"],"id":[21910701],"kids":[21910856,21911008,21911005,21910990,21911273],"parent":[21906553],"text":["Apple and Google have complete control over the mobile market which is the dominant way humanity interacts with the internet in today&#x27;s world, especially in developing countries. Having a policy which forbids arbitrary things like listing other apps for users to interact with is very dangerous as it effectively bans whole industries from competing on a level playing field.<p>This is a big problem for cryptocurrency especially as mobile web browsers cannot interact with blockchains and so users are forced to use custom apps that implement the web3 interfaces. This effectively bans wallets from providing a good experience to allow users to interact with dapps and since you can&#x27;t fall back to using a web browser on mobile it might end up being a total ban on the use of dapps on mobile platforms unless each dapp makes their own app (which just opens a whole new can of worms).<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what the solution is here but something really needs to be done before it becomes a ceiling for dapp adoption.

I’m skeptical of the price being where it should be because I think it’s too high resulting in the profits being worse then what could be achieved. Interestingly all the high THC strains are usually all sold out online in my province’s store but I think most people that would enjoy the benefits from the high would prefer a low to medium THC or even CBD strain.  Edibles are in my opinion dangerous and I’m curious to see how that will likely make no difference in sales.
