This would drive evolution of the pathogen to mis-adapted freaks.  For example, the mumps isolate was from the daughter of the Merck scientist (Maurice Hilleman), and he grew it in cow cells, then lizard cells, then insect cells (or somesuch, I don’t know exactly).  By the end of the process, the thing could still infect humans, but just BARELY.<p>Nowadays, with molecular biology, we can rationally design the ‘attenuations’, and do knock-outs or modifications.<p>Which brings me to low-virulence wildtype isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (S2):  The root problem here, as with HIV, is it’s a super-fast-evolving RNA virus.  Sure, a particular isolate might be low-virulence NOW, but give it a few weeks on a cruise ship and – viola! – nasty bugger ahoy!<p>When SARS-CoV-1 broke out, years back, it had a high lethality and freaked out the public health experts at the time (in fact, we were writing proposals to get into the research, but then it got contained).  At that time, efforts were initiated to make a vaccine, based on the observation that all that was needed with the Bcell production of ‘neutralizing antibodies’.  This is the long standard, matching most existing vaccines.  So it was a low-weight lift, for vaccine developers (relatively easy-peasy).  The project got pretty far along, but then stopped when SARS-CoV-1 disappeared as a threat.<p>When MERS, then SARS-CoV-2 came along, they resurrected the previous, promising design, based on a slow-evolving vector.  But in the case of S2, they discovered that the targeting receptor usage of S2 was significantly different, so the design required a significant re-tune.  Even so, the Chinese (I think) did it, injected the first people several weeks back, and I don’t think it works well (too early for formal reports).<p>S2 is nasty, as HIV is.  It is using evolution against us.  And because its hypermutable (like the influenza viruses), it’s going to be nearly impossible to make one vaccine that works cycle after cycle.  It will continue to evolve, but the subsequent cycles will probably have lower lethality than this first pass (which was completely novel to the human immune system, so we had no ‘herd immunity’ protection).  Going forward, it will be hard for highly-virulent forms to transmit if they kill their hosts too quickly, which will select for less-virulent forms.<p>The trick is to stay alive during this pass.  The only mechanism we have to do this is to not get infected.  The only way to do that is to not expose ourselves to infected people, or the things they’ve touched.<p>We’re back to how things were in the 1800s.  Better than no science, but about the same as post-epidemiology&#x2F;cell-theory-of-disease (1890s)<p>But as I said, this vaccine should be RELATIVELY easy to develop.  It doesn’t have to be perfect, it just has to blunt viremia (so that the global pneumonia it causes in your upper&#x2F;lower respiratory system doesn’t cause aveoloar collapse.  In other words, even working a little bit will probably massively lower the death count.<p>But even an easy-peasy vaccine will take 18 months.

With COVID-19 a mild case does not mean you are infected with an attenuated strain – for most people with a mild case if they happen to infect a person with preexisting conditions or who is old, that person will be at a high risk of dying. A mild case does not equal a harmless strain.<p>Even if the weak-strain hypothesis holds water (which remains to be seen), the proposal is predicated on something that&#x27;s physically impossible to do.

Then you&#x27;ve got to figure out how to administer doses safely.<p>So the solution must work within those parameters. And the only practical option is a vaccine.<p>&gt; The major risk is the virus we think is safe is not 100% safe. While we can use community spread of the identified strain to estimate how safe it will be (i.e. if it has infected 1000 people and none have got seriously ill then we should have a pretty good idea that it is safe), but our knowledge will be incomplete.

Nowhere close to one. The Fed learned from what happened to Europe last time, and has already announced swap lines.<p>Two, there isn&#x27;t one generic &quot;dollar&quot; funding situation. In 2008, it was really about Europe. Now, we have lots of countries each with their own situation (which the Fed is watching closely).<p>Japan has probably been where most of the growth in the market has come from. They are deep into CLOs but have a fairly neutral funding position (they borrow&#x2F;lend in USD), and Japan has a huge stock of dollars...so a crisis seems unlikely. Canada is another big one but, again, this is US branches of Canadian banks...not an imbalanced position. The big mystery is China, which seems to be getting dollars from nowhere, but like Japan they have a huge stock of dollar reserves.<p>The situation with EM is also not that simple. A lot have a huge stocks of dollars. The reason why some are getting into trouble is: bad monetary policy, borrowers with bad credit, and (lesser extent) dollar strength. The last is going to continue but Turkey, as an example, has been in this position for years (I noticed their issues 6 or 7 years ago). What is happening now changes nothing.<p>Definitely, we have seen surprising moves in GBP and CAD which suggested that people were looking for dollars quickly but JPY rallied...so...who knows? I don&#x27;t think it is something to be unduly worried about. The US has supplied tons of dollars, China and Russia will keep kicking up a shit fit about this but the US isn&#x27;t taking advantage of the situation, the Fed is providing the market with liquidity.

I just hate a lot of the design principles of web browsers in general. So, rather, the better way to design a web browser would be using principles such as:<p>- The user is assumed to understand the computer and to know what they are doing, and if not, to read the documentation in order to understand it.<p>- Stuff coming from the server is assumed to be possibly hostile and not necessarily a code that the user wants to execute, or having the styles that the user wants to be displayed; this is independent of whether or not the connection is secure, which should not control access to any features (except those which are part of the protocol, such as certificates). The user must be able to have complete control over it.<p>- You have enough ropes to hang yourself, and also a few more just in case. That is the better way to design anything.<p>- Disable CSS transitions, and otherwise the user can customize how the CSS is interpreted (in addition to defining their own, of any priority level, low or high or anything in between).<p>- Use keyboard controls for many things, and do not override the browser&#x27;s commands of keyboard or mouse or otherwise except if the user specifically activates the command to do that (&quot;application mode&quot;).<p>- Support use of ARIA even for ordinary screen view and not only for speech.<p>- Allow stuff to be controlled directly by the user rather than APIs used by scripts in web pages.<p>- Add a command for the user to save and recall form data using local files.<p>- Allow individual scripts and other files to be overridden with the user&#x27;s own version.<p>- etc.<p>Those who set up the services should also be encouraged to use other protocols, such as IRC, NNTP, SMTP, Telnet, etc. Such thing can be more suitable than web browser, less complicated and less stupid than a web browser, and can even be usable (to some degree) without specialized software (although having software to use specifically with these protocols certainly improves it, it isn&#x27;t entirely necessary; I think IRC was actually designed for that purpose anyways).<p>And I really would like them to stop using such huge fonts (they should respect the user&#x27;s font setting)."],"time":["2020-04-12 05:09:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thekyle"],"id":[22835053],"kids":[22837085],"parent":[22831506],"text":["I&#x27;ve been using the new Flatpak in beta for a month or so.

Technique, as illustrated in this article, serves that intention.<p>Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic&#x27;s book &quot;Storytelling with Data&quot; is a good book on technical communication. TLDR: it&#x27;s a process, and it&#x27;s not about you, it&#x27;s about them."],"time":["2020-04-11 01:36:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GekkePrutser"],"id":[22828928],"kids":[22830831,22833867],"parent":[22827833],"text":["If you&#x27;re interesting in building your own you can get a 12&quot; one from waveshare: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waveshare.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;displays&#x2F;e-paper&#x2F;12.48inch-e-paper-module.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waveshare.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;displays&#x2F;e-paper&#x2F;12.48inch...<\/a><p>This is the black&#x2F;white one, they do a black&#x2F;white&#x2F;red one too.

When you figure something out about the code, whether through reason and research, or tinkering and logging&#x2F;monitoring, you should embed that knowledge into the code, and use releases to production as a way test if you were right or not.<p>For example, in PHP I often find myself wondering if perhaps a class I am looking at might have subclasses that inherit from it. Since this is PHP and we have a certain amount of technical debt in the code, I cannot 100% rely on a tool to give me the answer. Instead I have to manually search through the code for subclasses and the like. If after such a search I am reasonably sure nothing is extending that class, I will change it to a &quot;final&quot; class in the code itself. Then I will rerun our tests and lints. If I am wrong, eventually an error or exception will be thrown, and this will be noticed. But if that doesn&#x27;t happen, the next programmer who comes along and wonders if anything extends that class (probably me) will immediately find the answer in the code, the class is final. This drastically reduces possibilities for what is possible to happen, which makes it much easier to examine the code and refactor or make necessary changes.<p>Another example is often you come across some legacy code that seems like it no longer can run (dead code). But you are not sure, so you leave the code in there for now. In harmony with this article, you might log or in some way monitor if that path in the code ever gets executed. If after trying out different scenarios to get it to run down that path, and after leaving the monitoring in place on production for a healthy amount of time, you come to the conclusion the code really is dead code, don&#x27;t just add this to your mental model or some documentation, embed it in the code as an absolute fact by deleting the code. If this manifests as a bug, it will eventually be noticed and you can fix it then.<p>By taking this approach you are slowly narrowing down what is possible and simplifying the code in a way that makes it an absolute fact, not just a theory or a model or a document. As you slowly remove this technical debt, you will naturally adopt rules like, all new classes must start out final, and only be changed to not be final when you need to actually extend them. Eventually you will be in a position to adopt new tools, frameworks, and languages that narrow down the possibilities even more, and further embedding the mental model of what is possible directly into the code."],"time":["2020-04-11 05:20:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jerzyt"],"id":[22835691],"kids":{},"parent":[22833601],"text":["Great read.

It&#x27;s the source of a hundred little ingenious anecdotes that demonstrate the imagination behind Bernays&#x27; campaigns, but one of the most alarming is that of Beech-nut bacon. Here I quote from one of Bernays&#x27; own books, &#x27;Biography of an Idea&#x27;:<p>&quot;The sales of Beechnut bacon were falling off because people had slimmed down their breakfast to a piece of toast, orange juice and a cup of coffee.[...] Beechnut favoured breakfast habits of a century before, when people started their day with bacon and eggs, doughnuts, pie and coffee. If the trend of breakfasts could be reversed, beechnut, the dominant breakfast bacon, would regain its sales. \nPhysicians confirmed to me [i.e. Bernays] that heavy breakfasts were scientifically desirable. The body needs food replenishment twelve hours after an evening meal. I enlisted a well-known New York phyisican, Dr A L Goldwater, to write to phyisicians thoughout the country for their opinion on heavy verses light breakfasts. Physicians from all over the country gave overwhelming support to the hearty breakfast. \nSix months after widespread  publicity on the survey, Bartlett Arkell, president of Beechnut, announced that Beechnut sales of bacon had increased “enormousely in the past half year. Nothing else did it , except the recommendation of American doctors.”&#x2F;<p>Bernays recounts this anecdote in such a way as to minimise the appearance that he himself deliberately sought or bought trusted medical opinions to confirm his campaigns: they simply &#x27;confirmed&#x27; things to him. But while the Lucky Strike and soap-carving contests he organised often get the most attention - they&#x27;re beautiful works of creative showmanship and inventive campaigning - quick portraits of his work tend to obscure just how data-driven he actually was. Rare was the PR stunt he pulled without extremely thorough research behind him.<p>It&#x27;s also traditional to comment that either Ivy Lee or Walter Lippmann were in fact the &#x27;real&#x27; fathers of public relations. One of Edward Bernays&#x27; most interesting commentators was Jacques Ellul, whose work expands and develops the role of propaganda in mass or atomised society. He&#x27;s not well-known in the Anglophone sphere because he published in French, but his book &#x27;Propaganda&#x27; has been translated into English and, despite first being published in 1962, actually remains shockingly relevant. In his estimation, &#x27;public opinion&#x27; was infinitely malleable, and any political or commercial system that answered to public opinion, without recognising just how vulnerable that was to anyone with an agenda and a good means of delivering misinformation, was doomed. Both he and Bernays make excellent reading in the context of modern political advertising and &#x27;populism&#x27; i.e. when public opinion is led or actively wanders into dangerous territory."],"time":["2020-04-11 19:09:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neuro_image3"],"id":[22839353],"kids":{},"parent":[22834901],"text":["I encourage anyone interested in this topic to listen to this podcast: Radical institutional reforms that make capitalism &amp; democracy work better, and how to get them<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;80000hours.org&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;glen-weyl-radically-..\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;80000hours.org&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;glen-weyl-radically-...<\/a>."],"time":["2020-04-11 04:58:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["eggy"],"id":[22833229],"kids":{},"parent":[22831931],"text":["I love J, APL and the array languages in general.

You can share some data at the API level but beyond that you will be in for a ton of trouble.  Its true this requires more discipline at the design level and more discipline in implementation and operations.<p>The moral of the story is that if you cant level up to managing microservices with the horses you currently have, personally, I would leave it alone.  If your 3-5 years behind the curve already as an enterprise shop, you may want to consider \nputting your whole system into maintenance mode, and paying a competent organization to manage it, buy a startup or buy some COTS and call it a day.<p>As for the single server guys know this, yes you can make a ton of money scaling that out on a limited basis and selling your startup or IPO-ing.

Hopper: the Mother of COBOL<p>By Vicki Porter Adams<p>When Captain Grace M. Hopper put her pack of Lucky Strikes (they\nstill make them) on the table as she prepared for an interview,\nthe assembled journalists felt that this would be a different\ntype of question-and-answer session. It was.<p>Captain Hopper, 74, inventor, mathematician, teacher and computer\nexpert, is on active duty with the United States Navy. She is\ncalled &quot;The Mother of COBOL.&quot;<p>After talking to Hopper, you understand why she contributed so\nmuch to the computer industry. She is never satisfied with the way\nthings are; she is eternally curious — an American pioneer.<p>In 1943, armed with a PhD from Yale, teaching experience and work\nat the Applied Physics Lab at Harvard, she joined the Navy. She\nwas appointed to the pilot group assigned to analyze the\nElectronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC), the\nmachine that was modified to become the first North American Air\nDefense computer.<p>- &quot;&quot; &quot;By not adopting—or following—standards, the Federal\ngovernment spends $450 million a year converting computer\nprograms.&quot;<p>Hopper was then assigned to work on the Univac Mark I, to help\n&quot;tame the monster&quot; as she puts it. Recognizing that progress was\nslow because operating instructions had to be repeated for each\nrun, Hopper used her abundant common sense to devise a solution to\nthe problem. She prestored the steps most prone to human error in\nthe computer. This was the birth of compilers.<p>Hopper, after working with computers for 40 years, thinks, &quot;The\ncomputer industry today is about where the Model-T was when it was\ndeveloped. When I was a child, Henry Ford came along and invented\na car everyone could have—as long as they wanted it black.\nThat&#x27;s where we are today. The very beginning of mass use of the\ncomputer. We haven&#x27;t even begun to exploit its potential.&quot;<p>Captain Hopper is one of the first members of the U.S.\ndata-processing community to recognize the value of using\ncomputers in the areas of predicting weather patterns, managing\nenergy resources, increasing agricultural output and generally\ncontributing solutions to the many long-range problems Americans\nmust solve.<p>Largest Industry<p>&quot;Computers will be, if they aren&#x27;t already, the largest industry\nin the country,&quot; declares Captain Hopper. The data-processing\nindustry will replace automobiles and construction as the mainstay\nof the American economy.&quot;<p>- &quot;&quot; &quot;The computer industry today is about where the Model-T was\nwhen it was developed.&quot;<p>When asked how expanding Japanese semiconductor production and\nJapanese activities in programming may affect American industry,\nshe replied, &quot;The American people have imagination and creativity.\nNobody else possesses these traits as we do. I think it has\nsomething to do with the fact that we all came here from somewhere\nelse. Many of our families were down and out. The American people\nhave always had to think a little harder and do a little better to\nprove themselves. That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t really have to worry about\nanyone else. Whatever we want to do, we can do.<p>&quot;But let&#x27;s not mismanage it,&quot; she continued. &quot;Right now we&#x27;re in\nthe business of collecting information. No one has really analyzed\nthe total flow of information. What is most important? Is it Joe&#x27;s\ntwo hours of overtime, or is it a nuclear power plant that might\nblow up if we don&#x27;t change a valve setting? We have not correctly\naddressed that.<p>&quot;We haven&#x27;t researched the value of information or the cost of\nincorrect information—or even which information gets priority.\nIt is my experience that the senior squeaking wheel gets the top\npriority.&quot;<p>She offered an anecdote about the origin of the term &quot;debug.&quot; &quot;In\n1945, while working in a World War I vintage non-air-conditioned\nbuilding on a hot, humid summer day, the computer stopped. We\nsearched for the problem and found a failing relay—one of the\nbig signal relays. Inside, we found a moth that had been beaten to\ndeath. We pulled it out with tweezers and taped it to the log\nbook. From then on, when the officer came in to ask if we were\naccomplishing anything, we told him we were &#x27;debugging the\ncomputer.&quot;<p>Captain Hopper thinks standards have been neglected. &quot;By not\nadopting — or following — standards, the Federal government\nspends $450 million a year converting computer programs. A real\nwaste of money,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;Of course, data-processing\npeople won&#x27;t obey formulas or follow standards anyway,&quot; she added.<p>Computer Future<p>Captain Hopper&#x27;s strongest conviction about the future growth of\nthe computer industry is her faith in the curiosity and\nimagination of the young and their acceptance of computers.<p>She admits that she may not consider age a factor in anything.\nWhen she was 40 and women were allowed to enlist in the regular\nNavy, they told her she was &quot;too old.&quot; She says, &quot;When someone\ntells you you&#x27;re too old at 40, you get over the trauma. You never\nhave to worry about age again.&quot; (Incidentally, the Navy called her\nback after she retired from Univac when she was over 60.)<p>She contends, &quot;Kids know what&#x27;s happening. They&#x27;re up on the\ntechnology. Lots of bright youngsters aren&#x27;t hampered by &#x27;we&#x27;ve\nalways done it this way; &#x27;it won&#x27;t work&#x27; or &#x27;I&#x27;ve never heard of\nit.&quot;<p>She thinks the media contribute to the fears of people outside the\nindustry. &quot;What do we see in the newspapers?&quot; she asks. &quot;Computers\nwill eliminate jobs. Computers will take over the world.<p>&quot;Computers can&#x27;t take over,&quot; she asserts. &quot;We can always pull the\nplug!&quot;<p>Finally, addressing the matter of the shortage of programmers and\nother computer people, Captain Hopper said, &quot;Yes, there is a\ntremendous shortage, particularly in the area of system design.\nThe schools and colleges aren&#x27;t meeting the needs of the industry.\nThe kids need hands-on time, and the teachers have to know how to\noperate and efficiently use computers.

Try to get them to do the best they can and observe them all the time.<p>This way you can get good feeling for how they are as a person, how they react to guidance and teamwork, and false negatives where a simple miscommunication leads to wrong solutions and a bad result, despite the candidate actually beeing good, are reduced.<p>If they constantly and heavily rely on your guidance that is a bad sign. If they actively fight against your guidance, this is bad as well. But in the end you are ”casting” them for a certain position within an existing &quot;cast&quot;, and sometimes a person who initially needs more guidance will do great after a while if they are in an environment where they can receive it, while people who actively avoid guidance could work just fine in a position where they don&#x27;t get too much anyways etc.<p>The opposite of this approach would be to ask an actor which pieces of [insert obscure european postramatic theatre director here] they know and if they know none assuming they can&#x27;t act.

Many companies just send you online timed hackerrank or leetcode questions as a preliminary filter.<p>Second, the entire interview process rewards people who study for the interviews rather than those who like to build projects.

Take-home assignments offer more insight into actual development skill, while whiteboard questions filter out a large portion of people (many who would be just as good, if not better, at actual implementations.)

It is difficult to voluntarily stick to the timelines given when you know you could do this or do that to improve the solution and that other candidates will not hesitate to do it.

However, the test will be managed by a central authority, with predictable content, with a clear study path, and once you take the entrance exam, you won&#x27;t have to take it over and over during job interviews for the rest of your life.

It&#x27;s probably one of the most fair, unbiased, and insightful articles written on tech interviews and may be the best one I&#x27;ve read.<p>Over the past 15 years, I have interviewed with many different companies. I once read that when you&#x27;re a good fit for the company, the interview will feel suspiciously easy. This has been the case for all the times I&#x27;ve gotten offers.<p>Reading this article, a lot of the good points remind me of a particular interview I had though. It was at relatively large tier-2 tech firm a few years ago (not the FAANG tier); one where I didn&#x27;t get an offer, but the interview process and experience was memorably good. I remember specifically telling the recruiter even after the rejection that I really enjoyed the interview there.<p>One of the rounds was with the principal engineer at the company, who was the most senior engineer at the company at the time if I recall correctly. It was the system architecture interview. I was asked to prepare by thinking of a system I had designed and architected in my past experience, and present it as if the principal engineer was my coworker and we would hold tech discussions. It&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve ever gotten to the &quot;Present code they wrote&quot; idea that Andrew mentions here.<p>For the coding round of this interview, I was asked to bring my own laptop (another point that Andrew mentioned here; this was also the only company of all the interviews I&#x27;ve had in 15 years that asked me to do this.). I was then given a problem at the beginning of that interview, and given 45 minutes or so to write code on my own (the interviewer actually walked out of the room and left me alone while I did). It was a reasonable problem to code for the allotted time, and had reasonable complexity but not overly difficult. When time&#x27;s up, the interview came back and we discussed my code.<p>Both of those rounds were something that was so well done that I think it was the most fair way a company could have assessed me correctly. I did well on the coding round, but my experience in system architecture was not a good match for the type of work they did, and in retrospect I could tell. Since I was interviewing at the Staff Engineer level, I think they correctly evaluated me and turned me down for the role. (Although I would point out that after that day of interview, they ended up being undecided, and asked me to come back one more time to have one more interview round, with one of the first engineers of the company there. I did poorly in that round for a variety of reasons, and that was ultimately what got me the rejection.)"],"time":["2020-04-10 07:45:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22830719],"kids":{},"parent":[22828808],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-10 09:14:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["youeseh"],"id":[22830332],"kids":{},"parent":[22828808],"text":["Whiteboard interviews all the way.

This does not make sense to me. The whole point of freelancing is that either of us can terminate the contract on short notice if for whatever reason we don&#x27;t like each other. Usually, if it comes up, I just recommend the company that if they have another qualified candidate (i.e. better qualified than me), they should do their best to hire them. It&#x27;s a good way to cut the bullshit and get it in people&#x27;s heads that they need to work hard to get me if they want me to commit to their project. If based on my profile they are not super eager to talk to me, I&#x27;m wasting my time because either they need somebody with a different profile or they are B&#x27;s trying to hire C&#x27;s. In both cases, that&#x27;s a good reason for me to not engage any further.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the interviewer role as well and I tend to not rely on coding exercises, whiteboard BS, etc. I usually just wing it knowing full well that interviews are in any case a bit of a crap shoot in terms of objective results. My goals when interviewing are very simple: 1) verify that what is in the person&#x27;s CV holds up and try to get them to talk about what they did, how they did it, etc. 2) inject a few technical questions to see if they can come up with some good answers or whether they start bullshitting. 3) Figure out what they don&#x27;t know and how they would deal with having to learn something new. 4) Figure out how well their experience aligns with my team&#x27;s needs. I&#x27;m OK with a less than perfect match if a person has the potential to learn new stuff. Especially with junior roles, that&#x27;s the most important thing because they probably don&#x27;t know much yet.<p>But really, I tend to go with my first impressions here and have learned the hard way that ignoring those leads to bad hires. Yes, there&#x27;s a risk I&#x27;m wrong about not hiring somebody. But if it feels wrong, it&#x27;s not going to happen. Usually, I know within a few minutes what it&#x27;s going to be; the rest of the interview is then either about making sure the candidate is sold on the job or giving me enough material to defend the choice not to hire to my managers, HR, etc. Coding exercises don&#x27;t really factor into this. If I have any doubts whatsoever about a person&#x27;s ability to actually produce code, I&#x27;m not going to hire them.<p>Unfortunately hiring is hard. There are a lot of mediocre candidates out there with a lot of mediocre recruiters representing them. I vastly prefer warm introductions through trusted friends and colleagues. So, as an interviewer, I deal with screening a lot of obviously not great candidates. The flip side is that when somebody good comes along, you need to be able to act fast because they&#x27;ll have other options.

Testing and rehearsing ahead of time mitigates these problems.<p>This is essentially a throwaway line at the end of a section and it should be its own section.<p>Get your presenters together ahead of time. Like a week ahead of time, and then again an hour before the conference. Test their mic levels. Have them show you the outline for their slide deck (so everyone has shared their desktop at least a couple of times). If you are recording the conference, record the rehearsal. Get people used to the idea that all the faffing about they do getting their system set up after their name is called is going to be the beginning of their video. So no faffing.<p>And something I picked up at a pretty large national company: You might actually want to have the MC and the coordinator be two different people. It&#x27;s so much less distracting on a conference call with hundreds of people if it&#x27;s one person&#x27;s whole job to moderate the microphones, and maybe play a video at the right moment.<p>But now the moderator and the MC have to rehearse so that they can pick up on each other&#x27;s cues, and they may need an out of band communication mechanism for that (or in this scenario, be someone they already live with).<p>Also, get your giant microphone out of the frame, even if you have to mount it in a weird way to do it.<p>And I&#x27;m not really sure what to suggest here, but it&#x27;s worth thinking about how your slide deck looks with your face showing in a floating rectangle in the bottom corner.

Revised planning basis Statens Serum Institut informs on the basis of antibody studies in 1,000 blood donors in the Capital Region, lost in the period 1-3. In April, 2.7% had been detected with antibodies, which, with a sensitivity of 70%, corresponds to 3.5% of those examined had already been infected with COVID-19. Statens Serum Institut states that if this figure is transmitted to the entire population of the Capital Region, it is equivalent to approx. 65,000 people may have been infected as early as 26 March. At this time, 917 confirmed cases of infection were found in the region. This means that there can be up to 70 times more infected in the community than confirmed cases.<p>In the work of the State Serum Institute in modeling the development of the epidemic in Denmark, on the basis of studies in, among other things, Iceland and Germany, it has been decided to work with the real number of infected in Denmark being 30-80 times higher than the number that remains. ver proven.<p>It is therefore estimated that the dark number is significantly higher than in the first planning scenario, and it is estimated from the State Serum Institute that for every detected infection case up to March 28, there may be 30-70, which are actually infected. This ratio will be affected by the number of people who will be infected in the future.<p>Thus, there is probably much more widespread contagion in society than previously thought. This does not have a direct impact on the planning basis for the health care system, as the increased spread of infection is in a part of the population who do not need hospital treatment and probably only to a very limited extent have sought medical attention. It should also be noted that it also means that the mortality rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (infection fatality rate, IFR) is lower than the mortality rate of registered case fatality rate (CFR) and possibly lower than that of WHO have evaluated. The WHO has estimated that the IFR is between 0.3-1.0 with wide variation across age groups. With more precise knowledge of the dark figures, the IFR for the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark can be clarified and the expected mortality will be accurately estimated.<p>The State Serum Institute states that over the coming weeks they will be able to continuously monitor the development of immunity in the population through cooperation with the blood banks, focused sample studies and testing for the population&#x27;s immune status in general.<p>The above also means that the previous assessment of the mortality in connection with COVID-19 in Denmark is no longer true. When a more accurate assessment of the actual prevalence of infection is obtained on the basis of the epidemiologic surveillance and a precise IFR for the Danish epidemic is estimated, a new and true mortality prognosis can be estimated.<p>The need for ordinary beds and intensive beds is evident from the modeling, which will be continuously qualified.<p>TLDR: blood donor antibody testing indicates true infection rates are 30x-80x higher than confirmed cases in Denmark and that 1.5 weeks ago ~3.5% of Copenhagen’s population may have already been infected by Covid-19."],"time":["2020-04-10 18:36:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lidlin"],"id":[22833143],"kids":[22833179],"parent":[22832960],"text":["The title of the article is deceiving as virus itself was never isolated from wastewater.

People are finally, grudgingly accepting that they must go parallel unless we want to see software performance stagnate permanently.  For most people here, the issue has been obvious since before they learned to program.  But, still they are putting off learning how to deal with it.  The first, obvious answer to that is threading.  But, in my experience, SIMD is a bigger bang for the buck for two reasons: 1) No synchronization problems.  2) Better cache utilization.  It&#x27;s not just that SIMD forces you to work in large, contiguous blocks.  Fun fact: When you aren&#x27;t using SIMD you are only using a fraction of your L1 cache bandwidth!<p>A big challenge is that SIMD intrinsic-function APIs are weird.  They have inscrutable function names and sometimes difficult semantics.  What helped me greatly was going through the effort of writing #define wrappers for myself that just gave each function in SSE1-3 names that made sense to me.

Thank you all for your comments.<p>While I understand is tempting to easily conclude that this is apples-to-oranges or that &quot;obviously a relational database is better at data relationships&quot;, I recommend to dive deeper into the topic.<p>First of all, almost all data models you may think of are in some or another way relational (call it &quot;related data&quot;, if you prefer). So any database, RDBMS or NoSQL or whatever, will need to deal with data that is related to other bits of data. So this is, from this perspective, very apples-to-apples IMHO.<p>Second, and regardless of the above statement, the exercise here is to model a data model that is, necessarily, two (or three) pieces of related data. And actually we considered the two models that MongoDB themselves consider for data modelling: embedded and reference. This is explained in the post and references to official MongoDB documentation are provided.<p>Third: benchmark is open and public. The repository also contains all the query examples used in the post. If anyone considers that there&#x27;s a better way to represent this data model (problem statement), that would still answer all the &quot;business&quot; questions (queries) considered in the post, please send a Merge Request to the repository. We will be very happy to analyze it.<p>All in all, this is an exercise of data modeling, for a given dataset. MongoDB requires data modeling, is not &quot;schema-less&quot;, and this is pervasive through their official documentation. The reference model, and their $lookup operator, are not a corner case nor a hidden downplayed option. It is a first-class operation, well advertised. But its complexity, performance and rewriting needs to adapt to changes are what are not, apparently, advertised, after our observations."],"time":["2020-04-10 19:44:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liquidify"],"id":[22834987],"kids":{},"parent":[22834036],"text":["Ok everyone, calm down.

Interviews with doctors all report that ventilators are supposed to be used for up to a week, not 3 weeks.<p>Although the occasional patient makes it off a ventilator, from a public healthcare policy standpoint, ventilators just don&#x27;t work well enough, so there&#x27;s no reason to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; now (April 10, 2020) aside from accumulating PPE (masks, gowns, gloves for hospital staff.) (A cure will likely take 18 months to invent and approve, so that&#x27;s not something to put on a roadmap.)<p>The plan should be this:<p>1. have our healthcare policy experts (CDC, etc.) study today&#x27;s reported data on patient mortality and PPE supplies for a couple days<p>2. inform seriously ill, high-risk corona hospital patients about the risks of ventilators (ie. you&#x27;re probably going to die on one anyway, and horribly)<p>3. have dedicated quarantine and palliative buildings for moderately ill confirmed corona patients with O2 available (like the Javits Center in NY, as an example for discussion, or an anchored cruise ship moored off each major city). Recovered people can work there safely it appears.<p>4. have dedicated hospitals for corona ICU patients if they choose to try a ventilator (China has dedicated hospitals)<p>5. lift the US lockdown and treat corona like any other seasonal  flu, mainly because it is, and also to avoid destruction of our economy and related uncertainty<p>6. the exception is passenger airline flights, which should be grounded until further notice. develop a plan to make airliners safer to fly (hepa filters, etc.) Cities shouldn&#x27;t be under lockdown, but airlines are almost certainly a major disease vector and need to be treated as such.<p>(FYI: Wuhan has an international airport only 2 hours flying time to Shanghai Pudong International, which is a major hub. So that&#x27;s likely how it spread world-wide.)<p>The impediments for the US to implement this plan are:<p>1. as a society, the US has lost the ability to formulate and execute policy at the highest level, whether healthcare, hurricane response or infrastructure. At this time, we need experts (like the CDC) to lead.<p>2. Trump should not be involved in any way, since he doesn&#x27;t care about facts.<p>(The reasons California Governor Newsom broke contact this week with the federal government are essentially the above.)<p>I&#x27;ll add my collection of supporting links later today. They are all consistent with each other, so the facts I outlined above are not in dispute.<p>Although the information from China was publicized late, it appears overall to be accurate and helpful. They used their previous experience with corona and bird flu infections to move fairly assertively on Covid-19 - a far better response than the US or Europe.<p>Please leave a comment if you want an area of my outline above to be fleshed out more.<p>If somebody could look into how Sweden and Germany have fared with less social distancing, that would be helpful.
