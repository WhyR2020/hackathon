We at least deserve a statement. I&#x27;m going to suggest a potential explanation, but I&#x27;m still disappointed by the lack of vote and&#x2F;or statement.<p>Based on how Patty Murray (D) has said she would have voted YES but wasn&#x27;t able to get to DC in time, it&#x27;s clear it was never going to pass to begin with. This happens often – someone like Mitch McConnell might whip the votes, realize they&#x27;re ahead, and allow a few Republicans that are at-risk to vote YES to provide cover for them in the future. Remember, even if you count the two Independents as Democrats, there&#x27;s still 6 more Republicans. We&#x27;ve seen this with Susan Collins a lot; if Republicans don&#x27;t need her vote she&#x27;ll vote against them. But when they need it, she votes with the party like clockwork.<p>So, now we get to be mad at Sanders and Murray (the Democrats who weren&#x27;t in DC), and nobody blames the 37 Republicans who actually killed it. Remember that McConnell decides what is voted on, and he always knows the votes. Maybe the one exception ever was McCain saving Obamacare.<p>I feel certain Sanders would have voted YES. He&#x27;s historically been mostly pro-Snowden, anti-surveillance, and pro-whistleblowers (it&#x27;s nuanced; for example he thinks Snowden should be prosecuted but also thinks what he did was right and that he should get a plea deal).<p>(Not the point, but it&#x27;s insane Senators have to be physically present, especially given the situation. At least one Senator missed the vote due to quarantine. Why are we making a 78 year old man physically fly to DC to vote, and do so in a chamber full of at least one person who has had COVID-19 recently?)<p>Like I said, I&#x27;m still disappointed we haven&#x27;t even gotten a statement from Sanders yet.

So I have typically worked on small scrappy IT teams at companies that are working on something else -- whether maintaining a Roku channel or putting together the heating ducts and plumbing assemblies for a building or making sure your marketing companies are not making illegal promises to customers that you can&#x27;t fulfill. Inside those teams there is some sort of pain that we are meant to alleviate -- say, executives are spending too much time telling accounting in slipshod fashion their estimates for how much money they anticipate will be coming in from various prospective contracts, and roughly when it will come. The idea is born: an app which accounting can grab information from, automatic emails to the executives, and a user interface that fits the executives like a glove so that this is a better-than-painless experience for the people who actually use it.<p>Given this context, I agree that you want to repeatedly iterate on the frontend of the product over and over until the actual users start to change the nature of their complaints. Their complaints started with: &quot;I need to put in a Flotsam which is also a Jetsam, how do I do that?&quot; &#x2F; &quot;What do you mean, I thought flotsam and jetsam were different things?&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Well for established Wakes they are, but not when we are looking at a new Surf. Then sometimes they are different but sometimes something is both, until that Surf becomes a Wake.&quot; So it is a failure of your domain model to match theirs.<p>And you are right, being able to have that domain model in a couple of JSON structures really helps with your ability to refactor everything around, especially if you have a type system which can just tell you &quot;look that function is still designed around the last iteration and it&#x27;s gonna break now with this new structure.&quot;<p>Those problems are really hard to fix when that data structure has already been broken apart into tables to be stored in a relational database and then ossified into various Data Access Objects and API calls which perform the updates.<p>By contrast with this approach you have a time where the product has succeeded in matching the user&#x27;s domain model, which comes when they say something like &quot;hey I changed this in this other system but I am not seeing the change in your app&quot; or maybe just &quot;hey I ran into a bug where it looks like the software is no longer saving my changes.&quot; Something that reveals that they think this software is in beta rather than pre-alpha development. You have a conversation like, &quot;It was never saving your changes, that&#x27;s a forthcoming feature.&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Uh, how was this ever supposed to work if it didn&#x27;t save my changes?&quot; &#x2F; &quot;No, like, that has been part of the design from day one, but that turns out to be a really costly part of the development effort so we wanted to get you to sign off that this is exactly the app you want before we start to build that layer of persistence.&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Oh. Well where can I sign up? I really want this app!&quot;<p>Also really good for the idea of &quot;build one to throw away&quot;, once you have fixed up your domain model then it can be nice to start from a clean slate.<p>Let me also say where you are limited: sometimes you do have a reasonably good guess at the domain model. For example you might be doing anthropological work as a developer, sitting in on meetings and getting a sense for how people talk about a system, before building the app. Or, you are interfacing with an external API and its domain model is presented to you directly in its documentation. Or, you are designing a game engine and the decisions are up to you -- the &quot;users&quot; are people who will have to play the game later.<p>Here it is helpful to build back-to-front. In fact there is a really nice REST principle which you may wish to emulate if you can, called HATEOAS. If you can do it, it makes things so much simpler. The basic idea about HATEOAS is the exact inversion of what you are saying: a polymorphic frontend, rather than a frontend which knows what API calls to make and in what sequence. So the idea is to have an intentionally crappy frontend -- it is crappy because it is generic, the backend tells it &quot;here are the many different sorts of objects tracked by the system, and here are the things you can do with them,&quot; and it configures up a crappy UI based on this skeleton which the backend gives it. UIs created procedurally by robots reading data structure descriptions will never be as pretty and fits-your-hands-exactly as ones you create yourself. And the key technology which enables this front-end polymorphism is precisely linking: a web browser is able to show all web sites and is agnostic about how exactly everything connects because the web server tells it how everything connects. So if you have a survey app, when you get a survey from the backend the backend also tells you something about &quot;to submit a new response to this survey, POST it to this URL, and validate the contents against this schema first.&quot; The crappy UI probably shows you the 10 questions for the survey up above, and then down by the &quot;submit new response&quot; form it contains 10 answer fields and you have to scroll between the top and the bottom for each question. Very inconvenient, because it is generic.<p>But on the flip-side, you usually get a good-enough-for-developers-for-now UI on the frontend, and now you can modify the domain model and services purely on the backend.<p>My white whale is probably to combine both of these together someday. :)"],"time":["2020-05-14 21:46:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Beefin"],"id":[23187722],"kids":{},"parent":[23179850],"text":["all software is build for users, and users interact with the front end. it makes sense to define the requirements with the front end and iterate until its ideal before starting any backend."],"time":["2020-05-15 03:09:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Kagerjay"],"id":[23188494],"kids":{},"parent":[23179850],"text":["I don&#x27;t think front-to-back or back-to-front are correct.

Which is to say, it was way more common back in the days to dev on a dev server than on their own laptop. (Maybe that&#x27;s a point against Windows at the time; about how difficult it was to have a reasonable local dev environment on Windows.)<p>So when I joined a startup later, and found out how everyone on the team had Macbooks (with no option of going Windows), and everyone ran the entire server app on their laptops (and this was the nodejs world, no longer LAMP), I was almost in disbelief -- are we not to worry about any difference between developing, testing and running this server code on a Mac laptop, vs when deploying it and have it actually run on a Linux server later? After a short while it seemed like it was not really a concern; it seems perhaps either macOS linux is close enough to servers, or node is compatible&#x2F;high-level enough between mac and linux.<p>Reading this article is kind of a wake-up call -- no, it&#x27;s really not exactly the same."],"time":["2020-05-14 07:04:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bdcravens"],"id":[23175281],"kids":[23176618],"parent":[23166098],"text":["Worried that your laptop is too fast?<p>Run your code in Docker for Mac, that&#x27;ll fix the problem."],"time":["2020-05-14 06:26:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Rapzid"],"id":[23175336],"kids":[23177659,23175514,23175464,23177552],"parent":[23166098],"text":["m.2 (NVMe) is so fast and cheap it&#x27;s absurd.

Some of the things I learned during the past two years:<p>* Learning a new walking technique is super hard, it takes at least months, if not even years.<p>* Wearing barefoot shoes and walking forefoot strike seemed to significantly decrease my lower back pain (although I’m not a 100% certain if there is a correlation, I just know that my back pain decreased a few months after switching to barefoot shoes)<p>* Got rid of my neck pain completely (I’m extremely certain that there is a correlation here, because my posture changed, more on that in a later point)<p>* I realized that my leg muscles (especially hamstrings and calves) are extremely tight and possibly also shortened. In the beginning I had trouble to get my heel to the ground without feeling tension in the calves.<p>* Just because I adapted my style of walking, my posture increased significantly. I walk and stand way more upright than before (I compared recent pictures to older pictures)<p>* Significantly decreases the number of migraine attacks. I’m also quite sure this is because of the forefoot strike (although not 100% certain) since heel strike puts a lot of pressure in the neck and head. You can easily Test or experience this Stress on the neck and head yourself if you stick your fingers in your ears and walk barefoot with heel strike over firm ground. You should “hear” it. For me it works best when I put in noise cancelling over ear headphones and walk heel strike (no music, just the noise canceling effect).<p>Of course all of this is highly subjective and many&#x2F;all things I described may not correlate at all.

You don&#x27;t need to add anything, just stay out of its way and let it do what it was built for.<p>Here&#x27;s what I would encourage anyone interested to try:<p>Start by balancing the spine sitting on the edge of a chair. Roll shoulders backward, relax the stomach, tilt the hip forward and pull the chin in until you feel your upper body is balancing on the root of the spine in your hip. Do a body scan and release any sign of muscle tension, the idea is to use bone structure and tendons to carry the weight. It should feel effortless, like the upper body is floating mid air.<p>Then repeat the same procedure standing up.<p>Now comes the slightly tricky part, unlearning the funny walk you&#x27;ve most likely been practicing your entire life. I recommend starting barefoot.<p>Keeping the same pose, and making sure not to tense any muscles, including the muscles in the feet; lean slightly forward. If you manage to do it without tensing, your body will start walking by itself and the feet will land exactly where&#x2F;how they&#x27;re supposed to. Leaning further increases the speed.<p>Adding muscles will increase the speed further. Just make sure the energy is directed backwards, pushing the body forward; and not straight down into the ground which is what people usually do when running, especially with bouncy shoes."],"time":["2020-05-14 13:49:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thdrdt"],"id":[23177499],"kids":[23193641],"parent":[23153123],"text":["For all citywalkers: check how the sidewalk slopes to move rainwater to the street.<p>I was always walking on the right side of the city roads.

More than 200 explanations have been proposed, but there is no consensus about which explanations are plausible and which should be rejected. This situation is as risible as if, in physics, phlogiston theory and thermodynamics coexisted on equal terms.<p>(From the linked page <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;454034a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;454034a<\/a>).<p>Multiple problems here. My understanding (as a pretty-well-read-for-an-amateur in the subject) is that this claim is overstated. Most historians today seem to agree that<p>- Rome had long since stopped being the capital city of the Empire. It wasn&#x27;t even the most important city in Italy in the Late Empire.\n- Romans at the time wouldn&#x27;t have known about a &quot;fall.&quot; It had been a long time since Italians ruled the empire. The empire simply passed from rule by Romanized-non-Italians to foreign conquerors.\n- The Roman empire didn&#x27;t fall, it moved; it persisted in the East until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Emperor in Constantinople would have called himself &#x27;Roman&#x27; for those 1000 years, and the term &#x27;Byzantine&#x27; is a later invention.\n- There were lots of contributing factors to the fall of the Western Empire that worked together. Some of these were external (migrations of the German tribes, invasions), some of these were internal (cultural divergence between East and West). There is some debate about the relative importance of these different factors.<p>The question can&#x27;t be answered not just because the answer itself is complicated, it&#x27;s because the meaning to the question is ambiguous in a way that the questions answered by thermodynamics are not. For related, more specific questions, we actually do have consensus on the answer.<p>It&#x27;s also cherry-picking one example. There are lots of cases of historians coming to a better understanding of an event over time, and concluding earlier explanations of the event are incorrect.<p>While I can see why it would be good to have a &quot;science of history,&quot; we&#x27;ve proven largely unable to do this in much simpler areas.

When I came in, I got feedback from the users to clarify the content that belongs in the subreddit.  They indicated that they wanted about equally to post about robotic art as well as real robots.  Right now about 70% of posts are about real robots and 30% are about robot art or something called that.<p>But my point is, the posts that get upvotes are generally not the quality posts.  The things that determine upvotes are number one, how easy is it to consume?  So if it&#x27;s a GIF rather than a video, it is likely to receive at least 10 times as many upvotes.<p>Maybe tied for number one, does it have some kind of base emotional effect?  Most of the time means, is it sexual or vaguely sexual?   Sometimes that means, does it look kind of like a cute baby robot?<p>Another one is, is it reductionistic? In other words, headlines or overall posts that tend to over-simplify something tend to be more popular.<p>Another one: randomness affects vote count significantly.  Also, vote manipulation seems to be a factor.  When we had some seemingly &#x27;professional&#x27;  redditors come in that really, really wanted to be mods and I let them for a couple of days, it seemed like they must have been willing to do anything to get their posts upvoted.  And also to mod any and all subs that would let them.  Which is why I kicked them out.<p>But the point of this is that in-depth videos of real robots will get few upvotes just because they are longer, and the ones that do better may just have good thumbnails but aren&#x27;t actually good videos.<p>Which is to say that I have been watching the judgement of our community closely for months, and the posts that receive upvotes are absolutely not the best posts in general.  I mean, sometimes good ones get upvotes.  But sometimes they are ignored and utter trash gets upvoted.<p>It&#x27;s really changed my perspective on democracy.

If we follow Lisp&#x27;s encoding, there are two forms of list: the empty list &#x27;Nil&#x27;, which doesn&#x27;t &quot;contain&quot; anything; and the pair &#x27;Cons(x, y)&#x27; which contains a value &#x27;x&#x27; (the &quot;head&quot; or &quot;car&quot; of the list) and another list &#x27;y&#x27; (the &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;cdr&quot;, which might be &#x27;Nil&#x27;).<p>&#x27;Delay&#x27; is the other way around: it is either &#x27;Now(x)&#x27;, which contains the value &#x27;x&#x27;, or it is &#x27;Later(y)&#x27; which contains another delay &#x27;y&#x27; (which might be a &#x27;Now&#x27;). We can imagine &#x27;Delay&lt;T&gt;&#x27; a bit like a list containing a single &#x27;T&#x27; value at the end, preceded by an arbitrary amount of NULL elements. I&#x27;ve gone into a bit more depth on such constructions (AKA &quot;initial algebras&quot;) in a blog post <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chriswarbo.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014-12-04-Nat_like_types.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chriswarbo.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014-12-04-Nat_like_types.html<\/a><p>This gets interesting if our language allows <i>co-termination<\/i> (like Agda, Coq, Haskell, etc.). This is where we&#x27;re allowed to recurse &#x27;inside&#x27; our return value. For example, the following function doesn&#x27;t terminate, since it will always call itself recursively; yet it does co-terminate, since the recursion is happening &quot;inside&quot; the &#x27;Cons&#x27;. We don&#x27;t know what the full result will be, but at every stage we definitely know what the next part will be (a &#x27;Cons&#x27; list). We can reach any finite &quot;depth&quot; of the result within a finite amount of time. This is also known as being &quot;productive&quot;:<p><pre><code>    function countUpFrom(x) {\n      return new Cons(x, countUpFrom(x+1));\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe following function doesn&#x27;t co-terminate (whether it always terminates is currently unknown), since (in the non-1 case) we don&#x27;t &#x27;narrow down&#x27; the return value before recursing. As far as we know, this could keep &quot;passing the buck&quot; forever, and we&#x27;d never get any closer to knowing what any part of the result looks like:<p><pre><code>    function collatz(x) {\n      return (x == 1)? 1\n                     : collatz(even(x)? x &#x2F; 2\n                                      : 3 * x + 1);\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nImplementing co-termination requires that the &quot;contents&quot; of a datastructure are calculated on-demand rather than straight away (AKA &#x27;lazily&#x27;). We can actually do this in any language with first-class functions by creating (and subsequently forcing) &quot;thunks&quot;, although it gets quite verbose, e.g.<p><pre><code>    function countUpFrom(x) {\n      return new Cons(x, function() { return countUpFrom(x+1); });\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nI wrote a blog post which uses this to generate Fibonacci numbers in PHP: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chriswarbo.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014-07-23-fib.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chriswarbo.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014-07-23-fib.html<\/a><p>We can use co-termination to implement a Turing machine, or any other generally-recursive system, by simply making a list of each &quot;step&quot;:<p><pre><code>    function turingMachineList(tm) {\n      return Cons(tm,\n                  halted(tm)? Nil\n                            : turingMachineList(step(tm)));\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis will produce a list of each machine state, which might stop (if the machine reaches a halted state) or go on forever. Likewise we can implement a list of Collatz values:<p><pre><code>    function collatzList(x) {\n      return Cons(x,\n                  (x == 1)? Nil\n                          : collatzList(even(x)? x &#x2F; 2\n                                               : x * 3 + 1));\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf we only care about the &quot;result&quot; then we can use &#x27;Delay&#x27; instead of &#x27;List&#x27;:<p><pre><code>    function turingMachineDelay(tm) {\n      return halted(tm)? Now(tm)\n                       : Later(turingMachineDelay(step(tm)));\n    }\n\n    function collatDelay(x) {\n      return (x == 1)? Now(1)\n                     : Later(collatzList(even(x)? x &#x2F; 2\n                                                : x * 3 + 1));\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThese will return a value like &#x27;Later(Later(Later(...)))&#x27; which will either keep nesting forever, or (if the calculation has an answer) will eventually contain &#x27;Now(answer)&#x27;.<p>&#x27;Delay&#x27; is nice since we can write programs in pretty much the same way as normal. The only changes are mechanical and obvious:<p>- If a recursive call isn&#x27;t &quot;inside&quot; the return value, we wrap it in &#x27;Later(...)&#x27; so it is; and wrap any corresponding base-cases in &#x27;Now(...)&#x27;.<p>- If we need to perform some calculation on the result of a &#x27;Delay&#x27; (i.e. the value in its &#x27;Now&#x27;), we can&#x27;t do so directly, since there might not be a result (it could be &#x27;Later(Later(...))&#x27; forever); and even if there is, we don&#x27;t know how many &#x27;Later&#x27; wrappers to dig through. Instead, we use these values <i>indirectly<\/i>, by <i>mapping<\/i> our calculation over the &#x27;Delay&#x27; value. This isn&#x27;t hard: it&#x27;s exactly the same as mapping over the elements of a list, or over an optional value, etc. Here&#x27;s what &#x27;map&#x27; looks like for &#x27;Delay&#x27;:<p><pre><code>    function mapDelay(f, x) {\n      return case x {\n          Now(y):   Now(f(y));\n        Later(y): Later(mapDelay(f, y));\n      };\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWe can run such programs in two ways:<p>- We can remove (up to) some finite number of &#x27;Later&#x27; wrappers, which is equivalent to running with a timeout. We can always do this inside the total (terminating&#x2F;co-terminating) language. We might still end up with a &#x27;Later(...)&#x27;, unless we can prove that the computation will always finish before our timeout (i.e. if we have a termination proof).<p>- We can use an external program (in a Turing-complete language) as a clock to &#x27;tick&#x27; through each step; essentially playing the role of OS or VM (similar to using a trampoline for recursion, in languages which don&#x27;t eliminate tail-calls). In this sense, &#x27;Delay&#x27; is like a language-enforced version of cooperative multitasking, since we must always eventually yield, at which point the OS can pick another delayed value to tick. The ticks are also a convenient place for the user to interrupt&#x2F;cancel a program.<p>Of course, knowing that the next tick will be occur within a finite time doesn&#x27;t guarantee that it will be happen before the heat-death of the universe!<p>Note that we can also use co-termination to build datatypes which have <i>no<\/i> base-case, and hence every value must be infinite. This would be pretty useless for &#x27;Delay&#x27; (since there is only one infinite value, namely &#x27;Later(Later(...))&#x27; forever). The always-infinite equivalent of lists are called &quot;streams&quot;, and are defined as having a &#x27;Cons&#x27; form but no &#x27;Nil&#x27; form.<p>From the OS&#x2F;VM perspective above, this lets us write programs which are guaranteed to run forever (e.g. servers which never crash), although they may run out of memory, and responses might take a while (bounded by the busy beaver number for the server&#x27;s code size + the request size). The classic example is to represent input as an infinite stream, e.g. &#x27;Stream&lt;HTTPRequest&gt;&#x27;, have a function for constructing a response &#x27;respond : HTTPRequest -&gt; HTTPResponse&#x27;, and construct a server via &#x27;streamMap(respond, input) : Stream&lt;HTTPResponse&gt;&#x27;. If we want a stateful server we can include the new state with our reponse and have the server plumb it through:<p><pre><code>    respond : (State, HTTPRequest) -&gt; (State, HTTPResponse)\n\n    server : (State, Stream&lt;HTTPRequest&gt;) -&gt; Stream&lt;HTTPResponse&gt;\n\n    function server(currentState, stream) {\n      return case stream {\n        StreamCons(request, rest): case respond(currentState, request) {\n          (nextState, response): StreamCons(response,\n                                            server(nextState, rest));\n        };\n      };\n    }<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-05-15 15:23:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["drothlis"],"id":[23178652],"kids":[23182469],"parent":[23157783],"text":["The OP is 100% right that ninja&#x27;s biggest architectural insight is the &quot;assembler&quot; metaphor.

I think I am personally more latency-sensitive than the average programmer, but I also believe that programmers feel latency and it affects their mood even if they don&#x27;t notice it. (Google has recently done some research in this area that kinda confirmed my belief, here&#x27;s hoping they&#x27;ll publish it publicly!)<p>This is something to emphasize.<p>I often feel that my productivity is strongly linked to the latency of actions I do. I like to play around a lot if the latency is low. Once it becomes higher, I generally don&#x27;t do that, and in principle I often additionally think about how to work around stuff, maybe write another complexity layer on top, maybe even do less testing, etc (many of these things just unconsciously). So it does not only adds the latency time, but really makes the whole development cycle slower, and less optimal. Also I tend to get distracted more easily. When I know that the next action (compiling, startup time, whatever) takes 30-60 seconds, I will definitely not just wait, but do something in the meanwhile. But also you cannot really do something productive in that time. So I end up checking mails or HN or so.<p>Also, since I started with my PhD, doing research on machine learning, I discovered a whole new scale of this problem, which I had not experienced before. Now the latency time has usually increased from a couple of seconds to a day, or a week. This drastically changes of how you work. To stay productive, you have to parallelize your work. When you are trying out things, you will try out many variations in parallel. Also you will look at the intermediate results, and maybe already draw conclusions from that.<p>If there is a chance to refactor your current pipeline to reduce that iteration loop time, or the wait-time (which might be the startup time of some tool, or whatever), I think it&#x27;s very worth to do it."],"time":["2020-05-14 14:24:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["biggestdecision"],"id":[23175337],"kids":{},"parent":[23157783],"text":["Funny to hear the author of Ninja say that he&#x27;s never used CMake...<p>And they shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised at the number of Ninja users that were on Windows, Ninja is so much faster than the alternatives if you are using CMake on windows."],"time":["2020-05-14 06:34:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gjvc"],"id":[23162764],"kids":[23174556,23163012],"parent":[23157783],"text":["I have found the combination of CMake, Ninja, and ccache to be excellent."],"time":["2020-05-13 04:25:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["carapace"],"id":[23182932],"kids":{},"parent":[23157783],"text":["&gt; Related work<p>&gt; I mentioned that I stumbled through Ninja&#x27;s design.

I am able to maintain complex state and jump back into the flow. Maybe this is just a young brain thing and will go way, but in any case, this advice seems to be more tuned to those sorts of distractions. What happens in an office is entirely different. Your working memory is finite and social interactions are complex. Moreover, most people become personally offended (whether they will admit it or not) if you do not appear to be paying full attention. This was a particularly bad case but I once had a boss who would become visibly angry if you even stopped to write some notes when he showed up to interrupt you. Many of these interruptions are totally irrelevant too. Your boss does not need to stop by 4 times a day to get a detailed progress report. Your chatty coworker does not need to talk about his weekend at the lake. It&#x27;s perfectly natural to feel some annoyance in a situation like this and it seems kind of absurd and subservient to me to ask devs to bend over backwards to accommodate the personality flaws of their bosses and coworkers. Sure, you shouldn&#x27;t let this annoyance derail you, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you also shouldn&#x27;t tell your chatty coworker to shut up occasionally. Okay, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be so rude about it, but you need to set healthy boundaries and be allowed to block off time for the work you need to do. If you aren&#x27;t, you are probably working for a shitty boss or organization. No amount of distraction management is going to help you there.<p>Beyond that, I think that there is a limit to the complexity of problems that can be tackled without periods of extreme focus. Some problem domains are full of deep and irreducible complexity. It&#x27;s probably true that we often mistake accidental complexity for irreducible complexity or fail to break down problems, but, and this may come off as arrogant, I find that it is generally people that have never had to deal with a problem domain with such irreducible complexities who think that we can solve all of our problems by breaking up work into smaller chunks. Sometimes you also have to deal with business requirements that effectively turn accidental complexity into irreducible complexity. Like, yes, technically things like regulatory compliance are accidental complexity but we also can&#x27;t just simplify them away without facing serious repercussions. It&#x27;s also much much easier to maintain context and state in problem domains you have worked in extensively for years, and you tend to be able to write more concise yet still complete descriptions of things within that problem domain. I suspect that has something to do with why the author only adopted this working approach later in life, in addition to the health problems he mentions. For instance, I find that I can pick up physics and math problems with minimal friction because I spent the better part of a decade studying those subjects intensely, but ask me to debug a SQL script (an area where I have minimal domain knowledge) and I will need probably 30 minutes before I can even think a useful thought about it. Most devs do not have the luxury of only working on problems they are domain experts on.

In a for profit company that&#x27;s measures such as increasing customer spend, increasing conversion rates, reducing churn, reducing operational costs. All of those measures can be directly tied to revenue, costs, and profit. It&#x27;s the language the business speaks, why would you want to speak a different language to the rest of the business? More than that, why would you want to start measuring performance in a different way to the rest of the business?"],"time":["2020-05-15 00:04:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["grensley"],"id":[23185414],"kids":[23192365],"parent":[23175866],"text":["That scoreboard sounds particularly toxic."],"time":["2020-05-14 23:03:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["koz_"],"id":[23188849],"kids":[23220113,23189011],"parent":[23175866],"text":["Reminds me of when my team at bigcorp noticed that you got given a badge on your personal page for being quick to respond to code reviews.
