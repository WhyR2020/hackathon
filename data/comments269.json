(In the business environment, I&#x27;ve focused more on them being &quot;critical questions&quot;.) It has been really great for me, and I&#x27;ve tried to make it as painless as possible for others. It started simply enough.<p>For real business reasons, there are things that I either needed to know, or I needed to be confident that the other person either had the answer to or were were putting some serious thought to. I wasn&#x27;t asking sensitive questions just to embarrass them. I expected them to give me an honest answer (and I helped make that easier if an honest answer wasn&#x27;t forthcoming on its own). I learned that I could trust my team not to take any of my questions out of context, and they learned that I would never try to take their answers out of context either.<p>Here are the big takeaways as best as I&#x27;ve been able to pin them down: it is all about trust, personal motivation, and intention. These complications are multiplied by the number of participants (even in situations where one person is asking a question and one person is answering the question, but multiple people may be listening). The process is quick and painless when the trust between the participants is high, the personal motivation (at the cost of others) is low, the level of trust between everyone is high, and there are just the two people. (Can it get better than that? Surprisingly, yes. Consider when one of the participants is a benevolent all-seeing and all-powerful diety.)<p>I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t read the full article. I&#x27;d be curious what dimensions of trust they recorded and how well it coordinated with their results.<p>If you&#x27;ve developed all those factors between all the participants, you can ask just about anything with the minimum of time wasted.  As one or more of these factors break down, the more complicated the conversation becomes. Or the more process you need to introduce to smooth over the wrinkles. &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t mean to embarrass you, but on the Johnson account it is more important to get an accurate documentation than to show any kind of regular process. See? Here is where we&#x27;ve been capturing this for everyone, and this is what&#x27;s done with the information.&quot; (So then you see how something like transparency comes into play.)<p>I think it makes sense when you look at it in those terms. You also need to be asking questions work asking, and sometimes you&#x27;re going to be asking questions that you don&#x27;t want or need the answer to yourself. You might be asking to build up trust within a group of people, or you might be asking because you know that several people really would benefit from knowing something that they&#x27;re too conditioned to do on their own. (This is where I started. And the key is that even if a question is confrontational, you must never ask in a confrontational tone. The tone of your voice and the content of your words have to reflect that you&#x27;re asking because you need to know. Nothing personal, just business.)<p>Even still, I hardly consider myself the master. I&#x27;ve never written anything down on this, but this is the 10,000ft view of what I picked up up over the years. If you&#x27;ve spotted something along these lines in a book or an article somewhere, let me know.

The focus at the recent conference was multi platform and concurrency.<p>They are making concurrency a first class citizen. With items like Go channels, Observable etc. This is baked into the language. There are a number of new frameworks utilizing these patterns. Resulting in less code, and more performance. At the cost of sometimes more difficult debugging.<p>The bigger item to me is multi platform. I&#x27;m working on a micro orm. That reflects your schema automatically generating types for NodeJs, Native, and JVM(Graal&#x2F;JDK). It can then be run on any of those platforms. An example is libpq for postgres allows streaming and observing rows on update. This is not in the DB libraries that I&#x27;ve seen yet.

It strives to be compatible both ways (calling Java from Kotlin and vice versa), which I think has helped with its adoption. It also means that it cannot have very wild features that can&#x27;t be mapped nicely to the world of Java, which I think has its downsides.<p>My main gripe with Kotlin is some of its design choices for syntax. I really really really don&#x27;t like its syntax for lambdas, specifically. A code block in curly braces could be both a lambda with an implicit argument, or a list of statements. You have to inspect the context to see which one it is, or rely on intelliJ to make the former type slightly bolder. That is so bad for comprehension, and I think the only reason it was done like that was to allow for some cute hacks where control flow constructs such as map, fold etc. could be implemented using lambdas and still look like regular imperative code.<p>Another thing is that you can create lambdas with an implicit binder that you can refer to as &quot;it&quot; inside the body. It may save you one or two keystrokes, but it also encourages the programmer to be lazy about naming things. Combined with the fact that curly braces are overloaded, whenever I see &quot;it&quot; in code, my eyes scan frantically for the first opening curly brace, and I then have to determine whether it is a lambda with an explicit binder (then it isn&#x27;t my binder, and I have to continue searching), a statement block (then it also isn&#x27;t my binder), or a lambda with an implicit binder.

Even with clippers, with a guard, you can still do some damage to someone&#x27;s skin (and, you know, giving them a horrendous looking haircut). I&#x27;d imagine many people would be extremely wary of such a contraption.<p>&gt;So we&#x27;re building a robot that comes in kiosk form and lives in airports, malls, and offices. You book an appointment, come in, get your cut, and go about your day; all without talking to anyone.<p>How are you handling sanitation? Actually cleaning all the hair up? Water for easier cutting (dry hair, curly hair, etc changing the moisture levels can change the ease of cutting)? Washing hair that has product in it? Adding product? Upselling and making a good chunk of your profit by selling overpriced product?<p>What about the fact that this is all regulated at a state level in the United States and most (if not all) require a cosmetology license to cut hair with varying levels of education and hours required before.<p>What about other public health laws&#x2F;requirements? Dropping a salon in a mall, in a contained area, is one thing but dropping a kiosk in the middle of an airport or mall is another.<p>What sort of system do you plan for when someone is unsatisfied with the outcome? How do you plan to handle &quot;no I don&#x27;t like that, can you change it a little&quot;? What about the fact that human heads are not uniform or even symmetrical? What about natural parts?<p>How does the buyer communicate they want their sidebrowns at this level, their bangs at this level, keep&#x2F;lose the widow&#x27;s peak, etc?<p>What about people that don&#x27;t want a bowl cut or a buzz cut?<p>What about someone that has lice? Open wounds? Isn&#x27;t remotely clean? Will it confuse excessively dry skin with lice and refuse service?<p>What happens when a pair of clippers snag on someone&#x27;s hair, do they just sit there waiting for a passerby to cut their hair so they can be freed? Do they wait for mall security to tell them it&#x27;s time to leave because the mall is closing? Do they have to wait for the kiosk babysitter to come back from their smoke break?<p>What if there is a power outage? Mechanical failure? Does the person leave with only a percentage of their hair cut, is there a second system that can resume, is there a battery backup, will the components most prone to failure be able to be replaced in that session by the equipment to continue?<p>How do you clean the chair that gets sat in? The floor around it? Hair will fall, regardless of a vacuum.<p>How will you minimize noise? Filter the exhaust? How often will the filter(s) need serviced? What happens if there is a vacuum&#x2F;suction failure and hair is being left behind?<p>How well will the system identify black hair on someone with dark skin? Blonde hair on someone with very light skin? Pink hair? Blue hair? Curly hair? What if someone is balding considerably, how will it identify where to cut&#x2F;not to cut? What if someone has a beard, how will it know where to terminate? What if they have bushy eyebrows? Will it confuse a several hundred dollar wool&#x2F;cashmere sweater with the person&#x27;s hair?

We want to take responsibility, to pick up other people&#x27;s trash, to fly less when we see the compassion and empathy in it, when we can feel the meaning and purpose those who went to jail for other people&#x27;s freedom did in the US civil rights struggle half a century ago or fighting Hitler a generation before.<p>My podcast <i>Leadership and the Environment<\/i> <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;podcast<\/a>, and my experience acting, have taught me a lot."],"time":["2019-12-16 13:54:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Delfino"],"id":[21804066],"kids":[21804248],"parent":[21802452],"text":["I read about 25 books this year, here are the top 10 I look forward to reading in 2020, many of them informed by my favorites of 2019:<p>Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari - I read Sapiens this year and really enjoyed it. I just started this today one so I may finish that before the end of the year.<p>Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman - I like books that make me think and from what I&#x27;ve heard, this will definitely do the trick. I read Factfulness this year and this was a suggested follow-up.<p>The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker - I&#x27;ve gotten really into natural languages since I&#x27;ve lived outside my country of origin for the last 2 and a half years and I&#x27;ve heard good things about this book being an entry point into linguistics.<p>Sword of Destiny by Andrzej Sapkowski - With the new Witcher show coming out on Netflix I finally went back and beat The Witcher 3 then read the first book, The Last Wish. It was enjoyable enough that I want to keep going with the series.<p>Educated by Tara Westover - Was convinced by Bill Gate&#x27;s blog this is worthwhile. I&#x27;m a teacher so it wasn&#x27;t hard to convince me.<p>Robot Builder&#x27;s Bonanza by Gordon McComb - I&#x27;ve been asked to teach a robotics course next year and this one seems to be The Book everyone recommends to dive into robotics.<p>Divided by Partition: United by Resilience by Mallika Ahluwalia - I recently visited the Partition Museum in Amritsar, Punjab, India and purchased this book there to learn about more stories about people impacted by this event.<p>The Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Shocken - I just read Code by Petzold and it was one of my favorite books. Even though I studied Computer Science in University and most of the concepts weren&#x27;t new to me, it was such a fun experience mentally &quot;building&quot; a computer from relays&#x2F;transistors to logic gates and up to assemblers, compilers, and interpreters. I want to keep going with this and jump into the Nand2Tetris online course.<p>The Annotated Turing by Charles Petzold - Again, I loved Petzold&#x27;s Code so I looked up other books he wrote and this one looks great. I&#x27;ve never actually read Turing&#x27;s work so I&#x27;m excited to have some background and explanation to help me not just read the words but grasp their significance.<p>ZACH-LIKE by Zachtronics - I played through several Zachtronics games this year (TIS-100, Shenzhen I&#x2F;O and Opus Magnum) so I can&#x27;t wait to dive into some of the thinking behind creating these and similar games."],"time":["2019-12-16 17:09:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jriot"],"id":[21803978],"kids":[21804047],"parent":[21802452],"text":["I&#x27;ve curated my 2020 list over the last few months, eventually splitting it in two; 2021 has been started, but below is my 2020 list.<p>Brave New World<p>Catcher in the Rye (3rd read)<p>Tom Sawyer<p>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<p>War and Peace<p>Catch-22<p>Stranger in a Strange Lan<p>The Hobbit (3rd read)<p>The Illiad<p>The Odessey<p>Walden<p>Leisure, The Basis of Culture<p>The Seven Storey Mountain<p>Confessions<p>The City of God<p>Ways of Life St Augustine<p>Catechism of the Catholic Church<p>These Truths<p>Battle Cry of Freedom<p>The Complete Guide to Fly Fishing<p>The Lure and Lore of Trout Fishing<p>The Duck Huntingest Gentlemen"],"time":["2019-12-16 16:57:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LoveMortuus"],"id":[21804413],"kids":{},"parent":[21802452],"text":["Book: How to Win Friends and Influence People\nReason: To learn how to be a human.<p>Or something like this, because apparently there&#x27;s a thing called emotional intelligence, the Doctor says that I have a severe lack of it..."],"time":["2019-12-16 17:46:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aerovistae"],"id":[21803813],"kids":[21803902],"parent":[21802452],"text":["I just started Ulysses for the second time, see if I get further this time."],"time":["2019-12-16 16:42:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arethuza"],"id":[21802944],"kids":{},"parent":[21802452],"text":["Tim Shipman will be writing his 3rd book about Brexit - the other two being great pieces of journalism so I&#x27;m really looking forward to the next, and presumably final, instalment."],"time":["2019-12-16 14:50:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["woldemariam"],"id":[21841114],"kids":{},"parent":[21802452],"text":["-The Triumph of Injustice<p>-Politics of Institutional Reform: Katrina, Education, and the Second Face of Power<p>-The Economists&#x27; Hour<p>-Insurance of Dummies<p>-Architect of Prosperity: Sir John Cowperthwaite and the Making of Hong Kong"],"time":["2019-12-20 02:48:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["divkakwani"],"id":[21802924],"kids":{},"parent":[21802452],"text":["Some of the books I plan to read are:<p>* The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham<p>* Complications by Atul Gawande<p>* The Structures of Everyday Life: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century by Fernand Braudel"],"time":["2019-12-16 14:46:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["x2f10"],"id":[21808275],"kids":{},"parent":[21802452],"text":["I have made it a goal to read all of Cal Newport&#x27;s books.

I then started catching him with different girls several times but every time he would say that he love me and that he needed some time to think about our relationship. But cannot stop thinking about him so i decided to go online and i saw so many good talk about this spell caster called Dr Raypower and i contact him and explain my problems to him. He cast a love spell for me which i use and after 24 hours, my boyfriend came back to me and started contacting me regularly and we moved in together after a few months and he was more open to me than before and he started spending more time with me than his friends.

After 1&#x2F;5 year relationship with my boyfriend, he changed suddenly and stopped contacting me regularly, he would come up with excuses of not seeing me all the time. He stopped answering my calls and my sms and he stopped seeing me regularly. I then started catching him with different girls several times but every time he would say that he love me and that he needed some time to think about our relationship. But cannot stop thinking about him so i decided to go online and i saw so many good talk about this spell caster called Dr Raypower and i contact him and explain my problems to him. He cast a love spell for me which i use and after 24 hours, my boyfriend came back to me and started contacting me regularly and we moved in together after a few months and he was more open to me than before and he started spending more time with me than his friends.

I had an idea about 3 years ago for what appears to basically be Nebula (which I just found today based on another comment in this thread). My idea was basically:<p>* Creators are curated and are seeded from existing Youtube channels. Curation happens on the creator level where illegal content means removal of the channel.<p>* No advertising so latitude for monetization of brand-unfriendly content.<p>* User pay a monthly subscription fee.<p>* Money is divided amongst creators based on watch time.<p>Some ideas I had that I don&#x27;t see represented:<p>* Users have the opportunity to pay more per month and can elect to spend this money in a discretionary way, like a &quot;tip&quot;. This isn&#x27;t shared based on watch time but by direct action from the user towards creators they want to show appreciation above and beyond.<p>* Creators can elect some of their content as &quot;free&quot; content, e.g. introductory videos, videos older than 3 months, etc. in order to attract and grow an audience. This free content does not contribute to their &quot;watch-time&quot; that comprises their share of subscription revenue but it can attract discretionary tips.<p>A couple of points:<p>* Anyone who scoffs at the idea of the discretionary monthly &quot;tip&quot; idea has not watched the flood of donations to Twitch streamers. However, some kind of feedback would be required in a similar way to TTS shoutouts - I&#x27;m not sure on this. We tend to focus on the majority who say &quot;I would never pay $Y for anything!&quot; while ignoring the whales that would happily pay $Y <i><\/i>* 100 given the right incentives. If you&#x27;ve worked in free-to-play games then you know the revenue potential of whales. If you remove the ceiling of what people can pay, some people will pay above your wildest expectations just because they can.<p>* I worked in video distribution and I was closely involved in managing costs. Most people cannot believe the costs involved in delivering video. Linus mentioned terabytes of data but that is the tip of the iceberg for popular content. Costs can ramp up to $100k&#x2F;month for even modest audience sizes when storage and delivery are considered. That doesn&#x27;t include server costs to run the multiple back-end and front-end services needed, nor the salaries of engineers and devops to keep it up. I was unable to find a way to make the $$ work without serious up-front investment. This isn&#x27;t a space you can bootstrap on free tiers of cloud services.<p>Ultimately the real &quot;whales&quot; are businesses. I don&#x27;t believe any subscriber funded effort can ever attract the kind of spend that massive advertising budgets can leverage. That means that platforms funded by advertising will always have a war-chest to snipe the best content creators. Think how Mix payed for Ninja and Shroud. Even if a content creator gets popular on one of these subscriber-supported platforms there will always be an advertising platform ready with cash-in-hand to steal them away.<p>Despite some pessimism, I am actually very bullish on this idea and I truly hope the idea succeeds!"],"time":["2019-12-16 18:48:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["matthew27"],"id":[21812579],"kids":{},"parent":[21804206],"text":["Hey Linus"],"time":["2019-12-17 12:33:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m1el"],"id":[21804316],"kids":[21804396,21804616,21805951,21805078,21805257,21805692,21805380,21806377,21804405,21804993,21807047,21804919,21805155,21804408],"parent":[21804206],"text":["To anyone who makes sites like these, please consider removing the following CSS rule:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;RWqwd0P.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;RWqwd0P.png<\/a><p>Thank you,<p>-- someone who thinks selecting text is not something you should screw with."],"time":["2019-12-16 17:38:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arkanciscan"],"id":[21804626],"kids":[21805429,21804866],"parent":[21804206],"text":["."],"time":["2019-12-16 18:06:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["baybal2"],"id":[21804377],"kids":{},"parent":[21804206],"text":["Clicked on it in disbelief.

Imagine if in your history, all the tags associated with an article were saved too. Tags aren&#x27;t provided by the website? Websites should be encouraged to provide better tags for personalisation (tags over tracking beacons!), or the browser&#x2F;browser plugin uses some kind of text processing (machine learning?) technique to generate tags automatically from content, and can train on the millions of already tagged articles in websites around the place.<p>The trivial solution is then: increment the count for each of the tags when a user visits a page with those tags. In top news, show the stuff at the top with the highest tag count. When doing a search term for something ambiguous that contains some of the tags, show the highest visisted tag results first. e.g. if you search for &quot;election results&quot; and the user has a higher frequency of &quot;us politics&quot; tag visits compared to &quot;uk politics&quot; tag visits, how US election results higher up. (You could weight this based on current events too, e.g. which one is more recent and so on). Over time, the plugin itself could have a model which could train its filtering, and maybe receive global anonymous updates that improve the algorithm.
