Initially many mathematicians found them confusing, Hamilton&#x27;s book is unusually difficult to read and there were no others. The work of Grassmann was somewhat neglected at the time, and eventually the Gibbs&#x2F;Heaviside notion of vectors (essentially what we use today) emerged as a competitor to the quaternions. It seems it was a particularly bitter mathematical divide, up there with Newton vs Leibniz. Here is a quote by Tait, one of the &quot;quaternionists&quot;:<p>&quot;Even Prof. Willard Gibbs must be ranked as one of the retarders of quaternion progress, in virtue of his pamphlet on Vector Analysis, a sort of hermaphrodite monster, compounded of the notations of Hamilton and of Grassman&quot;<p>See &quot;History of Vector Analysis&quot; by Crowe or &quot;Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal&quot; by Altmann.

In the case of 3D rotations calling them Rotors or Quaternions seems mostly like a different way of thinking about the same thing.<p>I think this would be more kindly put as &quot;reimagining&quot; quaternions and not &quot;removing&quot; them. The additional geometric intuition from GA does seem useful, and even as someone who has used quaternions extensively (though in a very different context), I would also choose to work with Geometric Algebra as a framework for geometry over Quaternions.<p>The visualizations are quite good here, it is a good way to understand bi-vectors, you can wiggle them about a bit in 3D instead of just staring at parallelograms on a page. The only criticism I have is that they say quaternions and the cross product come &quot;out of nowhere&quot;, but then the way they present the geometric product is equally &quot;out of nowhere&quot;."],"time":["2020-01-31 17:03:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["VikingCoder"],"id":[22202670],"kids":[22206376],"parent":[22200260],"text":["While we&#x27;re at it, can we please move the homogeneous coordinate to be the first value in memory?

Check out the publications by Dietmar Hildenbrand and his team for several examples:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;Dietmar_Hildenbrand\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;Dietmar_Hildenbrand<\/a><p>* Quaternions start to exhibit several limitations when dealing with complex objects, even in 3D. It provides just the necessary structure to store quadrature information to avoid the &quot;gimball lock&quot; issue, for example. However the fact that it collapses the scalar with the pseudoscalar presents several problems again in calculations with dual quaternions and higher dimensions (projections, for once), and it&#x27;s not much different from the hurdle of having to discriminate axial and polar vectors in Vector Calculus. The main issue is that its handedness doesn&#x27;t scale well and has problems capturing the geometric nature and physics of the world in several dimensions (ie symplectic geometry).<p>* IMHO the real usefulness of GA is that, as it name implies, it&#x27;s an algebra. That is what Clifford, Ball, Lie and Klein realized while extending the work of Grassmann on exterior algebras, screw theory, vector spaces and differential forms. Matrices, quaternions and some forms have awkward behaviors when they are treated symbolically as algebraic objects, being &quot;leaky&quot; on information or having singularities just because they are not the best representation. GA fixes that allowing you to formulate problems symbolically, and then you can almost blindly solve the equations with high confidence that the result will be sound. You can then convert the objects back to your favorite representation.

(And if you’ve been watching closely, this is a very well funded campaign, that has been very active for the past 3 years.)<p>But let’s try to think this through.<p>If they (China) were researching it, then it is possible that this could’ve accidentally escaped the lab. Although that is some serious professional incompetence. And if they are intelligent and skilled enough to work with dangerous diseases, then I’m sure they have proper containment and stringent decontamination processes in place.<p>However, if this was a bioweapon, then a few arguments fall apart.<p>(1) If they engineered it, then they should’ve had the genome already. Instead, they had to capture the strain, and sequence its genome, and it took them three weeks to complete the sequencing. And then, they shared it with the world, the CDC, the WHO, in order to help foreign countries contain it.<p>For comparison, the CDC took over 2 months to sequence the Ebola virus. The Chinese sequenced this virus in 3 weeks. Granted, technology and techniques improved in the intervening years.<p>So that begs the question: If this was a bioweapon, then why would they quickly share its genome with the world?  Why not just keep it for themselves, while they work out some cure, and let the rest of the world flounder and die off?<p>Their strength comes from their economic engine, and their exports to the world. They can’t make things for foreign markets, if those other countries are dying from some bioweapon that was unleashed on the world.<p>(2) If this was a bioweapon, and then they ‘accidentally’ released it on themselves, which makes no sense, then what is the goal?  Because the economic fallout from this thing will cause billions in economic damages.  As well as potentially causing social instability, for a country that prizes stability over all else. And the political fallout will be even higher.<p>(3) The Chinese are not suicidal. They were attacked with biological and chemical warfare by the Japanese in the 1930s. They were threatened with nuclear annihilation by MacArthur (to drop 50 atomic bombs) during the Korean War in the 1950s, and were also likely subjected to biological warfare too. The rest of the Western world prefers to ignore this, but they can never forget, because their people actually died from biological warfare.<p>So given all that, they have first hand experience of what biological warfare will do. So if they are researching bioweapons, then I’m pretty certain that they will have stringent procedures in place to contain it.<p>(4) And then there is the most logical argument, that this is a very poor bioweapon.<p>The goal of a bioweapon is to maximize immediate casualties, while minimizing uncontrollable transmissions to others.

The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity &#x2F;similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.

I needed to use a regex, but the Busybox version of find doesn&#x27;t support the iregex option, so all expressions are case-sensitive. With some googling, I was able to find out that the default regex type is Emacs, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find either a good reference for exactly what Emacs regex does and doesn&#x27;t support, nor any information about how to set the &quot;i&quot; flag. In the end I had to manually convert every character into a class (like [aA] for &quot;a&quot;) which was tedious, but quicker than trying to find a better solution or resorting to grep.<p>A related, annoyingly common pattern is that the documentation for `find` states that `--regex` specifies a regex, but it does not state <i>which<\/i> flavour of regex. The documentation for certain versions of `find`, which support alternative engines, note that the default is Emacs. From this I was able to infer (perhaps wrongly) that the Busybox `find` uses Emacs-flavoured regex, but ultimate I still had to resort to some trial-and-error.

Areas not zoned RH-1 (Essentially residential areas that allow the construction of multifamily apartments  and other larger condominium projects) are seeing an explosion of growth and change; mostly in lower income minority neighborhoods where developers can affordably purchase property.<p>It’s incredibly unbalanced; and senate bill 50 would have balance the scales to favor more housing options in some of these areas with stringent zoning for only residential single-family homes.<p>Even though Senator Wiener is from San Francisco, the city council itself came out against this bill. San Francisco is the densest large city in California, with a larger ratio of the population living in  apartments then most other cities in the state. Sen. Weiner is pretty safe from backlash as a majority of San Franciscans understand that other cities around the state need to do their part in building housing just like San Francisco has over the last century.<p>For other politicians around the state, senate Bill 50 is Kryptonite. Like everywhere else in America, Politicians are elected by residents. The largest constituencies of voters tend to be those in single-family homes because mostly California lives in single-family homes. Very expensive single-family homes.<p>People do not want to change the neighborhood to drastically in a way that would alter the equity they have accumulated in their home.<p>The best way to not be reelected is to support this bill. Why support multi family apartment  construction for people who do not live in their district? Very much the “I got mine“ attitude.<p>There is no panacea here. It’s going to take a ballot referendum, which is not likely to pass for the same reasons. Or change to the fair housing act. In the 50s and 60s, California zoning was indeed complicated with racial bias and exclusion. Above all else, it is the epitome of Systemic racism for the time period; and the biggest flaw in the fair housing act. As it turns out, the system is still working as originally intended. Fixing the fair housing act to cover residential zoning might be more achievable then anything California can do on it’s own."],"time":["2020-01-31 01:34:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jarjoura"],"id":[22198358],"kids":{},"parent":[22195426],"text":["This is a great read for anyone who wants to learn more about how we got here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Neighborhood-Defenders-Participatory-Politics-Americas&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1108477275\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Neighborhood-Defenders-Participatory-...<\/a><p>Katherine Levine Einstein was on The Weeds podcast a few weeks ago and gave a really good summary of her findings.

This also happened with Java back in the day when IBM developed their own incremental java compiler for use inside of Eclipse (technically this predates their IDE; I was using an early version in 1998). It gives that IDE an edge over things like Intellij in terms of compile latency, which is orders of magnitudes slower in intellij (measured in seconds instead of ms.). Intellij does a lot of work to hide the issues through elaborate caching, lots of things happening asynchronously, etc. They even attempted to integrate the eclipse compiler. But it&#x27;s very noticable if you are used to fast feedback on your code correctness.<p>Another important aspect that they are trying to address in the Rust Analyzer that the Eclipse Java compiler also addresses is handling partially correct code. If you are editing, the end state is of course correctly compiling code. But in between edits when it doesn&#x27;t compile is exactly when you need your IDE to be helpful. Eclipse used to be really good at this and update in real time on basically every key-press. The red squiggly lines disappearing basically means &quot;now your code is compiling fine&quot;. Intellij works a lot slower and worse, ends up actively lying quite often with both false positives and negatives being very common (the dreaded reset caches feature is a top level menu item for this reason).<p>So, it&#x27;s an important problem. Rust is optimized for run time safety and performance.

Then if someone went on a rampage, they couldn&#x27;t just pollute one topic and go to another to vent (or create new topics to vent).

From what I could observe, once the our basic food&#x2F;shelter needs are satisfied, we humans have an inherent need for long-term goals. Like slowly progressing one&#x27;s career, or growing one&#x27;s small business. Self-actualization, something to put your passion into.<p>For instance, I myself am running a bootstrapped software business, draw immense positive energy from seeing satisfied customers and feeling that I&#x27;m the person that made it possible.<p>As far as I can see, due to commoditization of most labor (better organization, moving of production offshore), it is becoming harder and harder for people to self-actualize professionally. It&#x27;s hard to draw personal satisfaction from driving Ubers all day or being a cog in a corporate machine. You perfectly know that one day you can be replaced by a fresh graduate with a minimal training who would do just as fine. You can no longer have a self-identity as &quot;the best baker in town&quot;, because most people buy bread from a supermarket. There are certainly artists, video bloggers, etc, but it&#x27;s a tiny percentage of the population and it pays a fraction of what the soul-crushing corporate jobs do.<p>So, since people cannot self-actualize professionally, they seek it elsewhere. Since the West has a culture of openness and acceptance to all kinds of minorities and subcultures, many people&#x27;s self-identity becomes their belonging to a certain social group and their feeling of self-growth comes from having others acknowledge their point of view. Except, this is a zero-sum game: instead of creating value for those who need it, people begin competing for other&#x27;s attention and alignment.<p>For instance, if I am selling ice cream and the guy across the road is selling chocolate cakes, we&#x27;re at peace with each other because whoever wants ice cream will come to me and whoever wants chocolate cakes will come across the road. But if I go on a crusade trying to convince everyone that ice cream is the only <i>correct<\/i> desert, while my neighbor does the same for chocolate cakes, we quickly become political enemies intolerant of each other.<p>To sum it up, if you want to fix it for yourself, put your passion into something that creates value rather than aims at redistributing it, and you will feel much better. This would be extremely hard in the current economy though, and yes, it feels sucky because the previous generations sort of had it for granted.

The claim was that &quot;trolls&quot; were causing too many problems. This was around the same time the definition of troll changed to mean anyone who disagreed with the OP or the content of a news article.<p>Once that happened, more and more opinion pieces started to be passed around as &quot;news&quot; articles.

This was a further attempt to control the discussion&#x2F;debate by defining what tools could and could not be used when discussing&#x2F;debating.

They reward being visible and playing to people who already agree with you, which means many good ideas get steamrolled by enthusiastic trolls.<p>So I was thinking that maybe instead of relying on the &quot;wisdom&quot; of the mob, I mean crowd, to determine what&#x27;s noteworthy and important and productive - which inevitably leads to a constant churn of middle school student council-like dynamics - I thought maybe you could flip it.<p>Don&#x27;t ask people who are like you if you&#x27;re making a good point.

Other people can watch. Somehow we have an idea of the &quot;way&quot; people lean politically, identity-wise, etc., or at least how they compare to others. Isn&#x27;t this something that NN-driven text analysis would be good at? And at the end, you can rate someone&#x27;s ideas and performance, and how much your opinion counts is weighted by how you compare to them, and then the system&#x27;s understanding of who you are is adjusted accordingly.

And, quite honestly, I doubt there&#x27;s ever going to be a proper way to solve it.<p>But here are some of my observations:<p>- Everyone&#x27;s online.  Everyone.  That includes people a) who had a less than stellar upbringing (whatever that means to which one of us); b) with mental illness (some of them untreated and&#x2F;or self-diagnosed); c) from other cultural background (which don&#x27;t necessarily align with western point-of-views); d) who are underaged; e) who are (very) bored (and some find entertainment in provoking chaos); f) who lack proper education; g) who simply do not care about educating themselves and others; and h) who are naturally antagonistic for whatever reason.<p>- Bots.  There are also a good number of botnets out there (the &quot;like&quot; economy comes to mind) or subverted systems (smartphones, routers, PCs, etc) which act without the owner&#x27;s knowledge;<p>I&#x27;m convinced there&#x27;s also botnets out there that purposefully amplify certain controversies online (websites&#x27; comment sections come to mind).  Now, understand, this doesn&#x27;t apply to <i>every<\/i> controversy.  But I&#x27;ve seen some weird stuff on YouTube, for example.\nAnd, quite frankly, it&#x27;s not that hard to extrapolate that since there are &quot;like&quot; bots there are equally &quot;hate&quot; bots as well.  The end game is, in most cases, visibility.  In others, it&#x27;s probably social engineering for whatever reason.  Mostly political.<p>Unfortunately, media outlets have fallen into this scheme as well.  I mean, it&#x27;s not like the concept of clickbait is new.  Attractive headlines are as old as newspapers&#x2F;journalism.<p>- Highly progressive opinions will always clash with the status quo;<p>- There&#x27;s a fundamental and unavoidable loss (or lack) of signal whenever people communicate in short sentences, or when they do not have enough time to fully understand what&#x27;s being said, or when they communicate with people who they don&#x27;t know;<p>If I have a friend who&#x27;s a prankster&#x2F;jester I might be used to their shenanigans and tolerate them--a stranger might not find them funny.  Maybe the stranger will find it funny after they know my friend, but that would depend on a lot of other variables as well.<p>- There&#x27;s also the problem of the person who transmits information not expressing themselves properly (for whatever reason) which will unavoidably lead to miscommunication;<p>- Social networks are fundamentally designed for engagement--now that everyone is online there will be a clash of ideas.  Tribes will organically form (just like offline).  And - with few exceptions - what was meant as a benign message ends up in a declaration of war from the other tribe.<p>So, in sum, I just scratched the surface of the problem.  It&#x27;s very hard to make sense of all the noise and coming up with a proper solution to this problem.<p>Is it an education problem?  Is democracy the root cause?  Would a totalitarian (regardless it being Right-Wing or Left-Wing) system work?  Is it something fundamentally ingrained into our human condition that makes it impossible to solve this problem?  (Look at bees, for instance, they&#x27;re ruthless and yet highly efficient at what they do.)  Is it a fundamental purpose (or lack thereof) that each and everyone of us has defined - through whatever heuristic and for whatever reason - that&#x27;s to blame for all this chaos?

Helping the users such that they would not behave in such a manner  would, of course, be a complex matter mostly outside the realm of technology-based tools, but I do not believe that is any reason to abandon the cause.<p>One thing we could do, which would not solve the problem but perhaps illuminate a better way forward, would be to work on communications technology.  Not simply technology for data transfer, but for actual information and understanding transfer.  Technologies and systems which facilitate the good behavior without facilitating the bad nearly as well.  By that I mean things such as systems which enable presenting large volumes of nuanced information in ways accessible to more people, and systems which enable both constructing, sharing, and refining complex arguments.<p>As an increasingly large portion of humanity conducts themselves online, we must keep in mind that there is much of human behavior which is not admirable.  The solutions to that behavior are not technological except in the most dystopian and (philosophically to me at least) disgusting scenarios.  There has never been, nor ever will be, a happy, prosperous police state.  Autonomy and free expression are not luxuries, they are necessary for human health.  We must also always be vigilant that the systems we implement are flexible and permit society to change both within and through them.  Take a thought experiment I came up with for example.  Imagine that tomorrow morning 90% of the population of planet earth awoke to a realization that agitation over nudity was ludicrous.  Would it be possible for our existing systems to accommodate this change, or would it actively thwart every single attempt by any individuals to live their life according to this newly adopted principle?  Would it result in a global relaxation of pointless anxieties, or would it result in increased anxiety as people felt themselves isolated in their realization, &#x27;judged&#x27; by their technology which would filter them, block them, and reject them at every stage?<p>At no point in history has any society, so far as we know, hit upon &quot;The Correct Ideas&quot; which represent unvarnished truth, eternal and unchanging.  And we should be careful to consider that our current social ideas are not unwittingly treated as such, ossifying human culture.<p>In Eric Schmidt&#x27;s book &quot;The New Digital Age&quot; he speaks about wishing to play a very active role in exactly this kind of cultural ossification, expressing an extremely elitist view that due to the fact Google is rich, they are Better and should therefore take steps to actively guide and mold society in the ways which Eric Schmidt believes are best.  Those just so happen to be the social values of the late 1990s when Google was introduced and which facilitated their wealth-building.  That is, to my mind, a dangerous game.  Past history would suggest that attempts at &quot;social engineering&quot; which do not rely completely upon broad social consensus and upon society reaching its own conclusions and doing its own enforcement of its own ideals tends to backfire in spectacularly catastrophic and inevitably violent ways."],"time":["2020-02-01 04:02:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anigbrowl"],"id":[22205234],"kids":{},"parent":[22178292],"text":["While driving the marginal cost of communication to zero would seem to bring people together, what it really does is bring <i>similar<\/i> people together but also exposes significant differences between people.<p>The essential reason for the toxicity is the contestation of online spaces, which are virtual territory over which proxy wars can be fought as a low-cost substitute for physical violence (although there is a direct nexus to physical violence, and the threat thereof, by both individual and state actors, is a factor in the aforementioned contestation.<p>There are 3 basic approaches to encroaching toxicity:<p><pre><code>  a. ignore it aka &#x27;don&#x27;t feed the trolls.\n  b. implement technical solutions to manage it.\n  c.

The News tends to be negative stuff and it used to be available for an hour or two on the TV. Now, you can access The News 24&#x2F;7 via TV, internet, radio, etc.<p>Some folks find that really depressing because they get so much more negativity in their headspace than they used to. A primary approach to not being depressed about The News is to stop letting it take up so much of your time and attention. Actively seek to tune it out and focus on other things.<p>Similarly, the internet is bigger than it used to be, so some of this is perceptual and&#x2F;or a numbers game. It&#x27;s easy to find fightiness and feel like &quot;It&#x27;s everywhere.&quot; It&#x27;s relatively easy to take good things for granted and underappreciate them.<p>Some things I find helpful:<p>1. Actively seek constructive engagement. For me, this involves declining to indulge the knee-jerk reaction to rebut anything and everything that directly disagrees with some comment I made (ie replies to me that tell me &quot;You are wrong!&quot; or similar). This is a bad habit of mine that just makes things worse and no amount of trying to justify to myself why I tend to do this makes it not a bad habit.<p>2. If I do choose to reply to people who disagree with me or who are being negative, think about what my goal is and what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish. Is there particular information I would like to put out as a result of their comment? Can I do it without just going down that path of &quot;No, you!&quot;?<p>3. Grow a thicker skin. I don&#x27;t absolutely have to have every single person who replies to me on the internet like me, be nice to me, be my friend, blah blah blah. It&#x27;s okay for other people to disagree with me and to talk about what they think. I can decline to take it so freaking personally that the entire world doesn&#x27;t always agree with me.<p>4. Keep in mind that people are much more likely to reply to you online if they disagree. There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say if you agree and HN in particular actively discourages low value replies. So you aren&#x27;t going to see a lot of vacuous &quot;Me toos&quot; here. That doesn&#x27;t mean people here hate me.<p>5.

Multiple replies disagreeing with me say more about that fact than about me, this opinion, etc.&quot;<p>6. Work on my communication skills. This is an ongoing effort. Some phrases or framings tend to get knee-jerk negative engagement. Learning to say it better helps reduce the nonsense.<p>At the same time, I try to make my peace with the fact that no amount of effort on my end will ever completely put a stop to other people choosing to do whatever the heck they choose to do. &quot;You can&#x27;t please all of the people all the time&quot; and that sort of thing.<p>(This comment is not intended to be comprehensive.

This decade-young group has no experience in what the internet actually and take no personal responsibility for their own online safety. For instance, they assume or act like a) Twitter will be around forever and b)Twitter can just block the bad guys and create a peaceful, harmonious online community. They cede all personal responsibility to a corporate hiearchy, like they were customers in a fast-food joint demanding to speak to a manager or some shit.

I think most platforms wouldn&#x27;t implement these ideas because they would decrease engagement and ad revenue on their sites.<p>Here are some of my crazy ideas (in paragraphs because I had trouble formatting bullets):<p>Allow negative reactions from normal users to make content less visible to others. The advantage of a downvote system is that it takes the burden of content moderation off of moderators and puts it more on the people who consume the content most. The disadvantage of a downvote system is that often, when people are downvoted, they don&#x27;t learn anything because they often don&#x27;t know why they were downvoted and they have to guess. Maybe when you downvote someone, you should have to pick a reason and then a breakdown of the downvote reasons should be available transparently for everyone to see.<p>Content recommendation improvements. YouTube&#x27;s algorithm is infamous for converting people from moderates to Neo-Nazis. Part of this is that the algorithm that shows you what video you should watch next just shows you what videos keep people watching YouTube. It makes no effort to separate news and facts from opinion and infotainment, so the lines get extremely blurry. If there were separate communities on YouTube for news on different topics, or for opinion and infotainment on various topics, it could shield people who really just want the news from being exposed to three-hour-long alt-right rants, if that is not what they were looking for in the first place.<p>We need more awareness of emotional manipulation on social media and news content. As an example, if a headline has the word &quot;disturbing&quot; in it, I would call that emotional manipulation because the headline is trying to do your thinking for you, reach conclusions for you, and tell you what to think and feel before you had a chance to read the article and digest it. Too often, we vaguely point to &quot;education&quot; as a way to protect people from sharing toxic content or disinformation online. The fact is that educated people are human too, just as emotional as anyone else, and are not going to be in a fact-checking mindset when they see a social media post with a headline or image that makes them feel sad, angry, or disgusted. We need a platform design that lets ordinary people flag, downvote, or otherwise participate in the fight against emotionally manipulative content.<p>We need to improve the moderation process so that people trust moderators more, can understand their decisions more, and can contest their decisions if necessary. I think that when a moderator removes a post, it shouldn&#x27;t disappear. It should be replaced with a list of the rules that were violated for everyone to see. And moderators should be able to hide a post temporarily to give the author a chance to edit it and resubmit it. Also, the first time someone posts in a forum, when they write a comment, they should see sitewide rules and community rules right before they submit, giving them a chance to go back and revise their post. (This mainly applies to a place like Reddit, but I think a platform like Facebook would also be better off with community rules.) These changes would make it so that people understand moderation more, can see a more transparent process, will stop being surprised by moderation, and will overall have a more positive experience with moderators.<p>On Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, I believe some of the problem is that the platform encourages you to follow people. When you follow personalities instead of topics, it introduces a lot of potential toxicity and content moderation problems. There&#x27;s no bechmark for civility, nothing you&#x27;re encouraged to talk about, just opportunities and rewards for creating drama. If these platforms made it harder to make everything oriented around personal brands, and easier to engage in communities that at least have a stated purpose, that would probably help to discourage toxicity, because in a community with a stated purpose, it&#x27;s easier for a community member to say, &quot;That type of content doesn&#x27;t belong here, this community is supposed to be about x.&quot; Where x is a fairly uncontroversial topic."],"time":["2020-02-07 17:06:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sebow"],"id":[22203198],"kids":{},"parent":[22178292],"text":["If you think the web used to be &quot;sanitized&quot; before 2010-2012, you&#x27;re very mistaken.

Because he clearly thinks Telegram is the only one to document its encryption.<p>Overall, I love Telegram, I use it daily. I don&#x27;t mind the lack of demonstrable privacy, because I really don&#x27;t need it for what I do on Telegram. It&#x27;s convenient and I love the cross-platform TRUE clients, none of that webapp packaging stuff (Seriously the QT client is amazing).

The usability concerns and terrible Electron desktop apps didn&#x27;t help but Moxie&#x27;s attitude and the fact that he&#x27;s just not rich enough to be free of gov&#x2F;corp influence were my motivating factors. He fought us for dropping dependency on Google Play Services, refuses to allow 3rd party distribution, and is anti-federation.<p>I&#x27;ve been having a back and forth with Telegram over email since the events of last night. It&#x27;s... interesting. (last response was a couple minutes ago)<p>So last night, I was speaking with this friend and he remarked that he used a burner to register his Telegram number, he was expected it to be banned at any time. I was in the middle of typing back to him &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t worry, so long as the account is active&quot; and my account was instantly banned before I could hit send. I was trying to provide him this re-assurance because I use Telegram with a Google Voice number instead of a carrier number that could be ported out easier.<p>Trying to sign back in the clients tell you the number is banned. There is a help button. It gives you a pre-drafted email filled out with app version, OS version, and phone number asking for help to unban.... and it&#x27;s addressed to login@stel.com. I found this peculiar as recover@telegram.org is the email used in most documentation and is what other people suggested to email.<p>Within a few minutes of this email being sent my account was re-enabled with nothing deleted except my chat mutes. They apologized and I inquired about wtf had just happened. They told me that it was likely due to my usage of Google Voice and not to worry as my number is now on a whitelist. Furthermore they said in their response: &quot;Or why did you have\nsuch unusual authorization parameters?&quot;.<p>I use the secondary app password, I listed off all the clients I&#x27;ve used... the only really bizarre one being an ancient QT port of the desktop client to Blackberry 10 (I was curious to see if anything still worked on that platform). They told me it was likely due to that.<p>I questioned them about use of pattern matching in private messages, not once did I hear a denial of this. I could see it being done to prevent bot or terrorist activity, but my guess is talking about &#x27;burners&#x27; and having a Google Voice number was enough to have me slip below their trust level even though my account is years old.<p>EDIT: Turns out the friend I was speaking to had people logging into his account this morning.

The Go team seems to have taken an opposite approach and removed your control (I often joke about Go just being short for &quot;Go Fuck Yourself&quot; because of its attitude against developer control and the teams&#x27;s &quot;if we don&#x27;t need it you don&#x27;t need it&quot; attitude).<p>It is resources like this that really make Java shine in its pro high performance developer attitude. (Current Go issue, getting select and channels to operate anywhere remotely efficiently and trying to find a way to keep high CPU goroutines on different OS threads - so far not much luck)."],"time":["2020-01-31 16:19:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajkjk"],"id":[22200070],"kids":[22200193,22200195,22200683,22202831,22202152],"parent":[22190815],"text":["This is good stuff.
