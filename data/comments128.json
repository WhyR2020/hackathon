At the moment, I’m considering pivoting this slightly into an email archiving service, but haven’t yet decided.<p>I ended up learning quite a bit about how email works and how to setup an email server from scratch. The email backend is written in Rust and hooks into a Postfix server as a filter. Since I am not storing any mail, I’d like to eventually migrate to either an LMTP server or a custom SMTP server.<p>I also used this as a chance to learn Ansible. I’ve been pretty impressed with how much easier server provisioning becomes, especially when compared to a more manual approach.<p>Currently, the mail backend is fully working for Dropbox. Right now, I am setting up a landing page to gauge interest. After that, most of the work will be on the web app side.<p>The project is open source, for now: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aksiksi&#x2F;vaulty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aksiksi&#x2F;vaulty<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-21 21:01:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["federicoponzi"],"id":[22657301],"kids":[22701228],"parent":[22648431],"text":["I&#x27;m writing a supervisor &#x2F; init system in Rust, called Horust (from Horus &quot;the one from the above&quot; + Rust).

It&#x27;s been released for 7 years now - Keen Software has been keeping it intact and adding features (VRage). I think of it as Minecraft but with a near-true physics engine.<p>There is terrain deformation according to the force exerted by the object crashing into it. Ships colliding will either destroy or crush blocks according to that force. A &quot;grid&quot; is considered a powered assimilation of blocks, which could function as static &quot;station&quot; or moving vehicle. Thrust is measured in Newtons, block locations are measured in Cartesian coordinates. Everything has precise mass (kilogram) and this effects collision damage. Someone made a mod where there are aerodynamics (atmospheric force on fast traveling bodies, though this is computationally expensive). There is already a large workshop of mods that other players have made.<p>I say &quot;near-true&quot; physics because gravity of planets only stretches out a few kilometers above the planet. After that there is &quot;zero&quot; gravity and you can turn engines off and stay in that spot forever. Ship speeds are capped at 100 m&#x2F;s. These limitations are required for now because computers cannot keep up with that many calculations especially if grids are interacting and causing terrain deformation or casting functions often.<p>There are sim speed drops during large scale events, and that is a challenge that draws me in. Keen uses rendering tricks for view distance draw and object visibility according to user settings (reflecting the power of their PC), eventually I&#x27;d like to standardize things so that players could interact planet-side without trees disappearing and nullifying camouflage attempts.<p>The vanilla game requires you to find and extract ore (iron, magnesium, nickel, platinum, cobalt, silver, gold, uranium, more could be added if you wish). These elements can produce things that somewhat reflect their utility IRL, then they are refined using energy (solar, wind, battery, nuclear, hydrogen). Then produced into components that you weld into the block for its completion.<p>When you join an official server right now, you are confined to a max speed, as this is a safety measure to prevent the game from crashing. A server sets up conditions for players to build in their secret remote spot away from everyone else, though sometimes they will group into factions. There is seldom any interaction and NPC ships are randomly spawned in near the player, flying in a straight line - they have no deeper function and they are meant to be your salvage.<p>My big picture is that there should be no speed limit, but players locations give off visual signatures if they want to go fast all the time. Space implies distance, and distance implies travel, which implies a set amount of time. Controlling this time would be key to bringing players together much more often, and we will remove risk of their creations being destroyed (automated respawn, at some sort of liquidity cost, which players will be ultimately competing for by chasing objectives that the game already allows - mining and transporting mass).<p>I want there to be a real functioning economy, where dumping a load of ore on the market has real repercussions, like EVE Online. If you see the price of iron go down fast, you&#x27;ll know this has happened. So a player gets a huge cash payout, even though they are selling far below market rates because they wants to &quot;get rid&quot; of bulk iron (which costs them energy and time, of either him or his bots). Because of this event, you as a market participant can buy that up and the reduced price, and have a cheaper source of iron that takes you less time (transport). AI agents will also respond to these events in varying degrees of effectiveness, in order to create competition that economically active players must consider. We want the higher level players to have production assets and ownership in the economy, whereas newcomers can choose to pirate, pillage, or mercenary contracts which rewards them with liquidity if they succeed, which results in them being able to buy equipment quickly and return to combat, but other players may be funding this behavior by selling the ships and weapons produced with ore and energy.<p>I said big picture because all of these things would come in time only after some sort of standardized transport system was put into place, which the game needs now (it currently uses a simple jump drive which makes you suddenly appear in a new spot) - if we allow extremely fast travel speeds there cannot be collisions otherwise the SIM speed will drop.<p>Since there are so many physics elements, this game feels like a canvas and I&#x27;d eventually want to implement concepts to suggest new technologies that actually may be up and coming in real life. Think of it as a sort of education platform in that regard, but when you don&#x27;t want to learn, you can just go and realistically blow up space ships and compete on a leaderboard."],"time":["2020-03-21 20:31:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["weitzj"],"id":[22653630],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":["I flutter mobile application with iBeacons to teach social distancing."],"time":["2020-03-22 09:49:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bluedino"],"id":[22650061],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":["Setting up ceph on my homelab system.

About four projects in flight that I can talk about at the moment:<p>1) Neural approximation of surface light scattering (learned BSDF approximations, in other words). Historically, real time BSDFs used in games have been statistical models that make quite a few simplifying assumptions. GGX and other modern BRDFs do an admirable job and get about 90% of the way there, but creating new surface models is very time consuming. You need a mostly-unique model for retroreflective cloth, another for faraway swaying grass, another for plastics, another for skin, and so on. It&#x27;s doable (and much has been done), but the process is far from easy.<p>So, an attempt at a workaround: trace trillions of statistically modeled paths and use the resulting distributions to train a small network that can be baked into an efficient ALU-only shader representation.

Different heuristics (muscular control delay, effort minimization, etc.), some variants of off policy learning, different exploration approaches, some low level architecture tweaks, and so on.<p>3) Gradually resurrecting and modernizing a bitrotted renderer from a few years ago (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mIax_ProQ8c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mIax_ProQ8c<\/a>) and expanding its functionality. Beyond just fixing the massive problems it has accumulated, I&#x27;d like to flesh out a full surface space rendering pipeline. All shading would be computed on the surfaces of objects (and, where appropriate, in volumes) rather than in screenspace, so temporal reprojection is made far easier and there&#x27;s no geometric blurring. Final rasterization is extremely cheap (~1 texture sample read) and can be decoupled from shading, so with 144hz+ geometric rendering in combination with late latched camera input, you can get application contribution to display latency below 10ms pretty easily.<p>The surface space caches and decoupling also give you a path towards tons of other interesting approaches- surface space shadow maps, low resolution directional occlusion and global illumination caches, conetraceable prefiltered surface representations, and all sorts of cool stuff.<p>4) Continuing to improve the physics engine (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bepu&#x2F;bepuphysics2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bepu&#x2F;bepuphysics2<\/a>). It exited beta last year, but there is always more to do. Next target is the tree structure used by meshes and the broad phase. While it is more than an order of magnitude faster than v1&#x27;s, it should be possible to extract more parallelism, eliminate the need for a separate cache optimizer step, and cut down the aggressiveness of the static tree refinement. Simulations with hundreds of thousands of sleeping or static objects could see some significant gains, among other things.<p>Was also considering training a network to compress in-memory solver data since, on manycore AVX2 capable systems, the solver is always memory bandwidth bound, but down that path may lie madness... maybe not everything needs to have DL thrown at it.

I started working on idea just to prove myself that I can do it. First version were pretty basic, but with complex logic for court reservations.<p>They liked the idea, so we were live, and they threw paper bookings away. 100+ users in a few weeks. It was little bit of pressure to get things right, but after fixing bugs, I was pretty satisfied with first alpha version, which was basically MVP and POC (proof of concept).<p>Then another club joined and there was around 150 users very fast.<p>I expand app so players can have their own ratings when they store their results. It was pretty fun to watch how everything suddenly changes. Players started to have conversions about their rankings, and they started to play more tennis. They have all history now for their matches, so no more &#x27;I beat you that time, how can you not remember that :)&quot;<p>I wrote some cool stuff too, like module for leagues and tournaments, which we organised under our Sliceer brand. We have pretty successful league and tournament with over 150 players.<p>We expand reservations to more clubs outside my hometown, and we are trying to reach even more.<p>I have some income from app too, but it&#x27;s very basic, mostly from Premium users who can see little bit more advanced features like &#x27;one sign in&#x27;, i.e. non Premium users have to login every two hours, etc.<p>Now, I&#x27;m improving registration page which has to be very simple and fun.

Distilled takes the view that some parts of testing are a lot easier than people think, so it explicitly <i>doesn&#x27;t<\/i> do those things. It doesn&#x27;t give you a test harness out of the box, it doesn&#x27;t give you a `beforeEach`, stuff like that. It gives you a very solid, very predictable base that you can very quickly morph in different directions. I&#x27;ve been using Distilled for ~2 years at this point, and it&#x27;s been a mild revolution in how I approach testing.<p>So the philosophy with Raise is very similar. With Raise, there are no built-in transpilers or templating engines, there is no CLI. I expect you to do whatever text transformation you need yourself, either manually or through a 3rd-party library. What Raise does do is make it very easy to recursively pipe directories through transform functions, and very easy to build complicated transforms.<p>So if you want to compile a bunch of markdown files:<p><pre><code>  await Raise({\n    input: &#x27;.&#x2F;source&#x27;,\n    output: &#x27;.&#x2F;public&#x27;,\n    transform: {\n      &#x27;**&#x2F;*.md&#x27;: async (info) =&gt; ({\n        [`${info.filename}.html`]: marked(await info.contents())\n      })\n    }\n  });\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd you can also do fun things like recursively return transforms, which makes Raise really easy to extend and adapt to different projects. So for example, if your sitemap was being managed by a CSV file or something:<p><pre><code>  await Raise({\n    input: &#x27;.&#x2F;source&#x27;,\n    output: &#x27;.&#x2F;public&#x27;,\n    transform: {\n\n      &#x2F;* structure: &quot;page_name&quot;, &quot;page_location&quot; *&#x2F;\n      &#x27;pages.csv&#x27;: async (info) =&gt; {\n         let pages = parse(await info.contents(&#x27;utf8&#x27;));\n         return pages.reduce((result, page) =&gt; {\n           result[page[1]] = async (info) =&gt; ({\n              [page[0]]: marked(await info.contents())\n           })\n         }, {});\n       }\n    }\n  });\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThere are a few other cool tricks you can pull with it, but they&#x27;re hard to explain in small code samples. But you&#x27;re not getting any transforms for free, and I&#x27;m not trying to intuit anything about the structure of your site. There&#x27;s no magical behavior. But what you get in return for that is an API that is extremely consistent, extremely predictable, very easy to learn, and very easy to adapt to novel situations.<p>Still a work in progress, but I should be done with the last few chores for the alpha within the next few days, at which point I&#x27;m going to start testing it out by converting some of my own sites to use this as the builder.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distilledjs.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distilledjs.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-22 02:56:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["oscargrouch"],"id":[22651605],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":["A &quot;application browser&quot; based on p2p technologies like bittorrent.<p>Its based on a (heavily modified) Chrome codebase, and the application sdk its in Swift and later also one for C++.<p>Apart from the application process use to remote render the UI, i have a &quot;instance&quot; process that run for the &quot;apps&quot; that works for handling the RPC messages (which is in gRPC).<p>The instance process, will expose the RPC interfaces as in a background service, where the RPC is designed by the app developer accordingly to its needs.

Across almost every amateur project that does hardware data collection, people are repeating the same steps: Set up a custom protocol for streaming from an MCU over serial, write a program to receive&#x2F;store that data, use an external tool to load, process and chart the data, etc.<p>On some level, that experience is really valuable, and I&#x27;m building the platform not to force you into a certain method: Using one piece of the system does not require buying into every feature. For example, you could just use the server for data collection, and read data points directly from the server into your own UI. conversely, you could use the server&#x2F;UI to point at a ROS instance and just use the UI as a UI layer for dashboards.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m really excited because I think that building a ready-to-use server and a powerful UI into a single package represents a real step forwards. There&#x27;s a real need for this type of system that I&#x27;ve seen time and time again in the field from makers, researchers, and anyone else building hardware systems."],"time":["2020-03-22 00:12:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22650606],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-21 23:05:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["iskander"],"id":[22650900],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":["Peptide vaccine for SARSCoV2"],"time":["2020-03-21 23:45:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["songzme"],"id":[22650970],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":["TLDR - I&#x27;m teaching my local community to code. My vision is to show tech companies that you don&#x27;t need to spend money to find good engineers. You can invest in your local community instead and you will find really talented engineers.<p>My 10 year journey:<p>Ever since college, I had been teaching. Teaching and helping others keeps me humble, develops my patience, and makes me a better developer. I am constantly forced to follow best practices so I don&#x27;t teach the wrong things.<p>2010 - I started coding as a junior in college. I was objectively the worst coder having started so late so I convinced my best friend at the time to learn how to code while he was pursuing an econ degree. This way, I know somebody worse than me at coding. It helped boost my confidence.<p>2012 - After graduation, I got a job! Shortly after, my best friend got a job too despite having only an econ degree and no coding background. This inspired my ex-girlfriend at the time (who had a stats degree) to learn how to code. She got a job shortly after.<p>2014 - I started thinking... could anyone get a coding job without a degree? I reached out to a high school friend who was working as an uber driver. His college degree didn&#x27;t work out for him, so I invited him to stay in my home while he learned to code. I eventually hired him onto my team and we worked together for awhile.<p>2016 - I wanted a definitive answer to the question &quot;could anyone get a coding job without a degree?&quot;. My hypothesis was a yes and to verify that and I needed more students. I made a public post offering a free coding bootcamp with no interviews. First 12 students got to join for free.<p>2018 - Teaching those students turned out to be really difficult because they all came from all different backgrounds. I had to change my curriculum many times to not only train them to become good software engineers, but also prepare them for interviews. Eventually, all the original students (2 of whom I hired myself) got a job as a software engineer. I invited new students and started drafting up a formal curriculum.<p>2019 - Wrapped up a first draft of our formal curriculum. Started a free coding group at our local library: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;San-Jose-C0D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;San-Jose-C0D3<\/a><p>I show up before work every day (M-F at 8am) to help students who are learning how to code.<p>2020 - Throughout my journey, I worked as a software engineer. Our curriculum has proven to be pretty effective and I&#x27;m currently in the process of hiring some students who started coding at our library into my engineering team. My goal this year is to launch our curriculum to the world for free as open source.<p>Due to the current pandemic, we have paused all in person meetup groups and we interact online.

However they don&#x27;t say anything about how lactate is related to fatigue.<p>A lot of the answers talk about the high mitochondria concentration in the heart. This allows it to use more oxygen and produce more ATP. That&#x27;s fine, but again, what is the connection between mitochondria and fatigue?<p>One example to show these answers are inadequate: You can walk or jog at an easy effort for a long time and eventually your muscles will get tired and sore, without ever going anaerobic or lactic -- i.e. without your leg muscles ever needing more energy than your mitochondria can provide or ever producing more lactic acid than your bloodstream can clear away immediately.<p>So mitochondria and lactic acid can&#x27;t be the full story.<p>I don&#x27;t know the true answer and I&#x27;m not a biologist, but I suspect the heart has evolved to never be the weakest link. Maybe exercise always strengthens the heart at a higher rate than the other muscles. Or maybe part of the answer is that we don&#x27;t have nerves to feel soreness&#x2F;tiredness in the heart?

The speed that we were able to cobble together a team that can work smoothly, 100% remotely from all different organizations has been amazing. The crisis action team for the state of CA has reached out to see if they can collaborate with us, and we’re doing our best to understand how to work with state and local governments going forward.<p>Thanks to the fantastic volunteers, we have we were able to refactor early, away from the junk front end I built, to something that we can actually scale on the front and back end. We’re currently struggling with how to scale our collection and updating of test locations as they spring up, and we hope to build an application to allow providers to submit their locations on their own. Right now that whole process is manual, based on manually scraping&#x2F;validating locations that are publicly stating they are doing testing. If infrastructure existed to identify places that are testing, we would be using it, but it doesn’t as far as we know, so we’re building the communication infrastructure for these test sites as it starts forming.<p>We’re US only right now but if we can get to a scalable way to collect test location data we can be worldwide.<p>This is a 100% volunteer effort explicitly for public good. We will not monetize the site, sell access to any resources we have, or in any way monetarily or personally benefit from this project, we have no plans to continue as a group any longer than we need to. No single organization is sponsoring this, and we have credits from GCP and AWS to run our infrastructure so Jorge and I don&#x27;t go broke!<p>Please help us: Post in this thread any feedback, suggestions for scaling how we source and verify testing location data (manual currently), or anything you think useful!

One of the things I&#x27;ve been meaning to do is figure out how to get it to talk to a serial port for terminal access.<p>A while ago on YouTube, I watched a series where someone was restoring their IMSAI 8080 (the machine from WarGames) and learned it and the original Altair were a lot more capable than their front panels made them seem due to the S-100 expansion slots inside that sit on the bus. The first card the video showed was a terminal connection so he could send&#x2F;receive commands using a VT-100 terminal (an emulator on a normal PC in this case). The cool thing I learned is that the way this worked is that the terminal board on the IMSAI would simply send the same screen info over and over again across the serial port, and it was up to the terminal to display this data on screen (making terminals like little dedicated computers themselves). I don&#x27;t know how I thought this worked, but it was cool to see him debugging it.<p>Seems a lot easier than trying to get a direct-connected display up and running and having to figure out all the signals and colors, etc. That said, I haven&#x27;t actually done this yet, so the devil may be in the details.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eater.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eater.net<\/a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;d_mWREmze5o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;d_mWREmze5o<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-21 20:26:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dmitripopov"],"id":[22645704],"kids":[22645835,22645913,22645750,22645715,22647473,22645774,22646088,22648145,22651638,22645752,22653514,22647104],"parent":[22645431],"text":["A friend of mine, an 8-bit enthusiast, calls usage of ATMEGA chips &quot;cheating&quot; :) &quot;True&quot; 8bitter relies solely on component base of the 80s."],"time":["2020-03-21 11:51:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["black_puppydog"],"id":[22645546],"kids":{},"parent":[22645431],"text":["Very cool project!

If we&#x27;re going to shut down non-mandatory industries, people from those industries would get broke immediately - it&#x27;s so deeply coupled so effective measures could not be taken.<p>In a perfect world, less than 10% of people working, or everyone working one day per week could feed everyone effectively. As automation goes on, the percent could keep shrinking. As a comparison, at the end of the day of a capitalist world, most of the &quot;meaningful&quot; jobs would done by very few persons because of the automation, and the rest of the world can only earn money at their mercy by doing &quot;barely meaningful&quot; jobs. Other than that, those who can&#x27;t even get &quot;barely meaningful&quot; jobs have to working hard on futuristic versions of TikTok trying to become superstars - it&#x27;s their only way of claiming their part of the economy.<p>Furthermore, the well-connected people get tested first as Trump suggested (or naturally happens in the US) is also a capitalist way of doing things. If we take Asian countries as an example, the testing kit is soon promoted as strategic resource mostly instructed by the government, which should eventually come from health care institutions, they have ideas to allocate those test kits in order to make maximum use of it, instead of blindly testing people back and forth.<p>If Karl Marx is not for you, it&#x27;s always worth taking a look at Singapore where they did most things correctly most of the time. It&#x27;s perfectly balanced in economics, politics and many, many other aspects (Though usually bashed by Western media as an authoritarian country). People can afford to buy houses, education is excellent and at a reasonable price, eating outside is cheap and easy, health care is affordable, and people are relatively free. Everything is carefully planned and designed by the government.<p>As a comparison, at a first glance, Hong Kong seems to be similar to Singapore to those people who haven&#x27;t been there, but Hong Kong is a more western-style democratic society compared to its neighbors (at before 97 if you protest). But the rent is out of control, things are messier, there&#x27;s no specific plan for things.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not evangelizing communism but those problems Karl pointed out have been overlooked largely nowadays."],"time":["2020-03-21 05:34:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Fjolsvith"],"id":[22646833],"kids":[22649213],"parent":[22643187],"text":["In 6 days, Chloroquine combined with Z-Paks will have nipped this pandemic in the bud."],"time":["2020-03-21 15:48:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["danieltillett"],"id":[22643695],"kids":[22643708],"parent":[22643187],"text":["It is time to declare war.

However, the ability of the coordination server (login.tailscale.com) to add arbitrary nodes to my private network without my consent scares me.<p>Maybe you can use Wireguard&#x27;s PSK to add an additional pre-shared-key to all nodes that is not managed by the coordinator (and never transferred to it)? This would make the setup slightly more difficult (you need to login to tailscale.com AND you need to provide your PSK), but it would at least ensure that the system can never talk to foreign nodes added by the coordinator itself (because the foreign nodes do not know the PSK).<p>If you already use the PSK for something else, another passphrase&#x2F;key-file that is never transmitted and is XOR&#x27;ed over the PSK will do the trick. The firewall configuration that is pushed to all clients should be probably signed by a local key too, since it is rather critical.<p>Another possible attack of the coordinator would be if he pushes a configuration with correct VPN IPs and correct public keys, but changes the mapping between them.

I spent much of my time thinking about computers because I saw them once and was fascinated by them. One of the thoughts I had was about multi-socket computers. How did the two CPUs communicate and run in the same system.<p>I eventually came up with the concept of race conditions, but I had no word for this concept, but I could see it in my mind&#x27;s eye. I eventually thought of different ways to work around race conditions by making certain assumptions.<p>Nearly 2 decades later I was in my first job when a CPU bound problem showed up and I quickly slapped together some multithreaded code that worked the first time and was not only the first time I ever wrote multithreaded code, but was also my first real world programming project. I hand rolled a lockless queue. It was messy, it had some redundancies, but what I wrote was based on the concepts that I thought about when I was 8 years old.<p>It was at this point that I decided to look into my concerns about &quot;data access ordering multithreading&quot; and learned about the term &quot;race conditions&quot;.<p>Of course learning this term opened up my mind, furthering my understanding of the concept both in communications and in more concrete concepts than the abstract blurs in my mind.<p>I actually deal with unknown unknowns all of the time. When I envision a problem in my head, I tend to focus on guarantees. I enumerate assumptions that my designs require, and if I can&#x27;t prove to myself that I can guarantee that assumption, then it is now a known unknown.<p>I have a track record at my work of finding corner cases. I do this entirely by my &quot;guarantee&quot; approach. If I can&#x27;t guarantee something, can I think of a proof of concept that could cause the assumption to be violated. This also works well for multi-threading. I don&#x27;t need to worry about thinking about a problem in a serial fashion, I only have to think about &quot;in order for this to work, what assumptions do I have to make and can I prove those assumptions.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s quite often that I learn about new concepts by describing an assumption that I can&#x27;t guarantee, and I will find an existing answer or solution.<p>I&#x27;ve reflected on my obsession with correctness. I&#x27;ve found my issue is my ADD. If I can&#x27;t prove something can&#x27;t happen, my mind will wander uncontrollably thinking of what might go wrong. In order to cull these distracting rabbit trail thoughts, I have to prove to myself that no issue can occur.<p>This approach works well enough that I&#x27;ve had large complex mulithreaded projects where the process deadlocked several times. When the problem got priority and my team lead asked me if I had any ideas, I told him &quot;I read thought my code, it must be .Net framework&quot;. He thought I was joking at first. Three times in a row, non-reproducible deadlocks that rarely occurred, I diagnosed as &quot;not my code&quot;, and 3 times I was correct.<p>Not only does this process seem to work well for me, but I&#x27;ve also used it with other&#x27;s who were stuck pair programming a bug that they couldn&#x27;t figure out. I can generally just start asking questions and eventually the programmers figure it out on their own.<p>I think if more people focused on guarantees, there would be fewer issues.<p>Where was I? Oh yeah. If you can&#x27;t guarantee something and you can&#x27;t figure out why, then there must exist an unknown. You don&#x27;t need to know what this is in order to know it exists.

You can see at the top middle of your crumbshot that there&#x27;s a big gap, where it kind of fell down a bit. This is because at the point of cooking the dough didn&#x27;t have quite enough strength.<p>There&#x27;s a number of ways you can increase the strength, but I&#x27;ve found that folding is pretty useless IME with the flour that I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve had some success with just 2-3 folds when I switched to a higher gluten flour (or just added some vital wheat gluten to my flour mix)... but I&#x27;ve found that a better strengthening technique before I do the folds has radically improved the strength of the gluten strands.<p>My favourite way is the Rubaud method (check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zgz0oAhgwyg?t=72\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zgz0oAhgwyg?t=72<\/a>) directly after the pincer and fold step, for about 5 minutes, followed by a few minutes break, then another 5 minutes. After that, you can leave off the later folds completely, or still do them to try and eek out the last bit of ovenspring.<p>Additionally, you can see that the loaf spread out a bit on baking. This is usually an issue of the shaping, which I had troubles with for soooo long after starting with FWSY. I found that this started to really improve when I added dough strength, but when I was starting out I was trying to duplicate what Forkish was doing and kept on failing. I think that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ww78_SfGyQE?t=181\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ww78_SfGyQE?t=181<\/a> is a much easier tutorial to follow — but of course, if the dough doesn&#x27;t have the strength then it&#x27;ll continue to be difficult.<p>Anyway, happy baking.

A good place to start is:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.web.cern.ch&#x2F;security&#x2F;recommendations&#x2F;en&#x2F;codetools&#x2F;c.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.web.cern.ch&#x2F;security&#x2F;recommendations&#x2F;en&#x2F;cod...<\/a><p>The program checks to ensure it is running setuid.  In that context the following are particularly dangerous:<p>- The path to the cache file is determined by looking at the HOME environment variable.  Anyone that is calling that can set HOME to whatever they want, causing the cache file to be created in or deleted from any directory.  It&#x27;s better to use getpwuid(getuid()) to find the home directory of the running user.<p>- The use of stat() (instead of lstat()) and fopen() (instead of open() with O_CREAT|O_EXCL) opens the door to symlink attacks.  This can allow creation of arbitrary files.<p>- popen() is used without clearing the environment. I think that most systems clear particularly dangerous environment variables from setuid programs (e.g. LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) but there could be others (documented or not) that influence the behavior of the program called by popen() in a way that can be exploited by an attacker.  Generally, a privileged program will drop privileges and sanitize the environment before calling subprocesses.  popen() is not a rich enough interface to make that easy.<p>There are other smaller issues (e.g. memory leaks, unclear handling of buffer sizes, failure to check returns from functions that could fail, etc.).  Additionally, if home directories are on NFS, it is quite unlikely that this program will be able to create the file with root ownership (&quot;root squash&quot;). I don&#x27;t immediately see how these could be exploited.<p>Another comment mentions a bunch of prior art.  Those are probably better things to be looking at than trying to invent something new in this space. \n That being said, there are a number of interesting concepts that the author needed to explore to get to this point.

I haven&#x27;t touched an inhaler in years.<p>Since we are dealing with a respiratory virus, I figure anything that helps the lungs is probably a good thing.<p>For some fun reading you might want to read about the relationship of iodine and: cancer, lungs, mitochondria, apoptosis, breast cancer, asthma, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and any number of thyroid problems.<p>If you think Iodine is only good for the thyroid gland, I suggest reading about the sodium-iodine-symporter and which tissues have it.<p>Anyway, I had already thought about this when it seemed Japan&#x27;s death rate from covid-19 was lower."],"time":["2020-03-21 22:20:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DoreenMichele"],"id":[22649097],"kids":[22649548],"parent":[22647898],"text":["The Japanese smoke more, but see less lung cancer.
