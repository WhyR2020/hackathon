For the longest time the branding drive for cars has been about new technology, signaling success and personal branding. But I see a few shifts in society that make these less important:<p>1. New Technology is fun, but it&#x27;s reached a peak of usefulness to the consumer in cars. For the vast majority of people, a car is a utility, and their basic usefulness isn&#x27;t improving anymore.

For many it&#x27;s just been assumed that you need a car and that it&#x27;ll be expensive, so you&#x27;ll get it financed, which hides the real cost of the car inside weekly expenses. I see that changing, not least because the middle class has less money than they used to.<p>Just like inflated housing costs, the only reason we&#x27;ve been stomaching the cost of new cars is thanks to easy finance.

I would love to see them in a general purpose computer so that developers can really take advantage of the power.  Whatever is in my iPad Pro would make a great development workstation if I could connect two monitors to it and ... run Linux.  It is power-efficient, very lightweight, and has built-in 4G.  In those categories, it beats the pants off of any Intel-based laptop I&#x27;ve ever had.  But I still have to SSH to a real computer to work, which is an artifact of Apple&#x27;s OS policies, not what sort of workload the chips they put in there are capable of.<p>The unfortunate reality with all of these stripped-down computers, though, is that nobody is writing software for them.  While the CPUs are powerful enough to run pretty much anything, nobody is porting their AAA games or CAD software or video editors.  Maybe Apple&#x27;s ability to dynamically recompile Mac Store apps to ARM will help, but I still think MacOS is seriously lacking compared to Windows.  So the best Apple can hope for is a &quot;budget Mac&quot; which power users won&#x27;t buy (and power users write all the software), and they&#x27;ll just be an expensive Chromebook.  (ChromeOS doesn&#x27;t have a lot of native software either, but at least you can run a normal Linux environment in a container and write software on the device.  And, I don&#x27;t think any person goes out to buy a Chromebook... they just get them for &quot;free&quot; from their school or company.  It is an interesting segment of the market that can be profitable, but I really want to see these chips in something I can sink my teeth into.  Set up a development environment, write software, and run the same software in production on those chips too.)<p>My takeaway is that it&#x27;s a shame that this amazing CPU-design division exists inside a company that is all about dumbed-down user experiences.  They could probably kill Intel overnight if you could just buy the chips on their own, but instead they insist on putting these chips in devices that are hamstrung by arbitrary policy.  Obviously they are playing a long game, but as someone who just wants the best possible equipment... I can&#x27;t afford to wait.

Some quick and sloppy searching shows that Intel’s prices on the CPUs in the current Airs are somewhere in the $150-300 range, if I make the best-case assumption that the cheapest Air’s CPU costs Apple $300 and that the cost of a desktop-level Apple CPU is <i>zero<\/i>, that’s still a BOM of ~350 for the rest of something built with the same specs as the cheapest Air.

So let me plug my daily driver of the past several years:<p>Void is an excellent, excellent distro. It&#x27;s quite similar to Arch in many ways, but its binary software repositories are much larger, and include some quite tricky customers (like FreeCAD). Its package management system is very advanced. Unlike Arch, shared libraries are tracked, so partial updates are supported. The &quot;templates&quot; (a BSD-ports-like system, like Arch&#x27;s PKGBUILDs) are all kept in a single github repository, which means you can basically fork the entire distro, make as many changes to as many packages as you need to get a complex feature working, and - if you like - submit the entire lot back as a pull request. Distro-on-git - a powerful concept. Package building is stateless - a clean system is created in a chroot and build dependencies are automatically installed there. It&#x27;s not nix, but it&#x27;s highly practical.<p>One gets the sense that the whole system was designed with a slightly wistful eye on the BSDs. systemd is eschewed in favor of the lightweight runit. ZFS support is first class. The repositories, in addition to all the standard Linux stuff, contain lots of little BSD hints - yes, you can install pulseaudio, but you can also install sndiod. You can install sudo, but also doas. Heck, you can even run the entire system off musl, instead of glibc. The system feels like a small voice of rebellion against the tide of bloat in Linux-land. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way, you know...&quot;, it seems to want to say.<p>And yet, if you want all that bloaty Linuxy stuff, it&#x27;s there and it works brilliantly. I run Plasma 5 on my laptop and it&#x27;s computing nirvana. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s rock-solid - rolling distros never are - but the simplicity and elegance of the system clearly yields stability dividends.

They could memorize all the tools and intricacies of the language but were completely unable to figure out the steps between knowing what their program was supposed to do and implementing the code to do it. It&#x27;s something about problem solving, I think. I suspect the real unifying trait among programmers is the ability to solve puzzles more than anything else.<p>I don&#x27;t think our CS101 class was particularly tough although I do think our school did them a favor by not babying them through the basics so they could go on to fail their data structures class. I&#x27;ll stress that these kids were very smart and most went on to have very successful careers in other majors. It&#x27;s not about intelligence or ability to work hard.

Some (VC backed, and also mid-size) companies said they cancelled the position after talking with me and realizing they needed a completely different role, or the hiring manager didn&#x27;t really have as much autonomy over the role they thought and the company focused their efforts on another team. In others (Big Tech) they didn&#x27;t even know I wasn&#x27;t already in the company, and therefore I was at an inherent disadvantage and pulled harder from internal pool. (Other big tech does matchmaking after an offer).<p>All I have are anecdotes. I had friend and founder referrals to their current startups, every &quot;in&quot; you could imagine, and still rejections. The silver lining?

If someone who calls you asks you for ANY sensitive personal info, just tell them that your policy is to not give any personal info to those who called you, but you’re happy to call the official number.

So if the person who had hung up, picked up the phone again, they&#x27;d still be connected to the same person, and wouldn&#x27;t hear a dial tone. This was useful: if you wanted to move to a different phone connected to the same line, say, for more privacy, you just tell the other person what you&#x27;re doing, hang up, and then pick up in the other room. But some scammers found a way to use this.<p>Basically, the scammer would instruct a suspicious mark to hang up, look up their bank&#x27;s phone number, and call back, just as Krebs is instructing. As soon as the mark hung up, the scammer would begin playing a dial tone instead of hanging up. When the mark picked up the phone, they would hear the dial tone, so they would begin dialing at which point the scammer would end the dial tone, wait for the dialing to stop, and then play a few ring tones and then pretend to pick up the phone. This was in the 90s so the technology was there to automate it, but it&#x27;s simple enough it could have been done completely manually by stopping and starting recordings. From the user&#x27;s perspective, it seemed they had hung up and made a call to the bank, so it seemed impossible that they were connected to someone else.<p>Cell phones, which don&#x27;t stay connected when only one party hangs up, are totally immune to this hack.

Below details are from wiki -<p>Another simple trick used by the fraudsters is to ask the called parties to hang up and dial their bank, but after the victim hangs up, the fraudster does not, keeping the line open and remaining connected when the victim picks up the phone to dial.[4] When in doubt, calling a company&#x27;s telephone number listed on billing statements or other official sources is recommended, as opposed to calling numbers received from messages or callers of dubious authenticity. However, sometimes hanging up and redialing is insufficient: if the caller has not hung up, the victim might still be connected, and the fraudster spoofs a dial tone down the phone line to entice the victim to dial. Then the fraudster&#x27;s accomplice answers and impersonates whomever the victim is trying to call.[5] This is known as a &#x27;no hang-up&#x27; scam.[6] Hence consumers are advised to use a different phone when dialing a company&#x27;s number to confirm.<p>When in doubt: hang up, look up, and call back &quot;from a different number&quot;."],"time":["2020-04-24 06:46:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yhager"],"id":[22965273],"kids":{},"parent":[22958477],"text":["I had a legit call a few months ago from the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency).

Without some new testing technology, I just don&#x27;t see how we can stop the spread of this disease. A month ago, the US did about 100,000 tests per day. Yesterday, the US did about 200,000 tests. Growth in testing started off as exponential but now it looks linear.[1] Even if testing capability doubled every month, it would take 8 months before we could test every American once a week. (200,000 * 2^8 == 51,200,000, which is 15% of the population.)<p>It only took a couple of months for 20% of New Yorkers to get infected.[2] If we assume that half the population will get this disease over the next two years, and we assume an infection fatality rate of 0.3%, that&#x27;s around 500,000 deaths. (328,000,000 * 0.5 * 0.003 == 492,000). Those are optimistic projections. The IFR is likely higher and the R0 is somewhere between 3 and 9[3], so that means at somewhere between 60% and 90% of the population needs to be infected before we get herd immunity.[4]<p>Unless there are radical improvements in testing and&#x2F;or treatment, I think we&#x27;ll end up with at least 500,000 deaths in the US.

When 21% of NYC has had a disease that has been spreading for only a few weeks in spite of extreme public safety measures (social distancing, shutdowns), you have to wonder if you can avoid getting it, for how long, and at what cost.  If you don&#x27;t get it now, how do you keep from getting it later?  Eradication is typically a decades-long project.  Vaccination is anywhere from a months-long project if you don&#x27;t care about establishing vaccine safety to a multi-year effort -- enough to eradicate if you&#x27;re serious about it and have a vaccine that can cope with mutation rate (probably not).<p>&gt;  Catching this virus is a bit like playing a round of Russian roulette. You’ll probably be fine, but you could end up dead.<p>But that&#x27;s not really the case.  Risk factors for covid-19 are fairly well understood at this point: old age, past history of pneumonia, obesity, and diabetes.  That&#x27;s not not-a-big-deal, but it&#x27;s in the realm of the manageable: isolate those at risk.  But stopping the progression of this virus through the population is clearly not an option at this point -- we long ago passed the point where that was feasible.  We can only slow down the progression, and definitely not long enough to obtain a tested vaccine because that&#x27;s well over a year away and might be closer to two years if anything goes wrong with the current candidates.  In terms of morbidity rates, this thing is not that bad as it has <i>not<\/i> overwhelmed the U.S. healthcare system (a few hospitals, yes, but the vast majority are far from capacity), and some treatments are available.<p>So it&#x27;s not clear that we need to slow covid-19&#x27;s progression further, or that we could if we really wanted to.  Transmission rates are just extremely high.<p>&gt; With this test, we can screen for the virus at the entrances to buildings and other areas, much like we currently use metal detectors to screen for weapons. [...] Longer term, it can be used to safely reopen more crowded areas such as festivals, sporting events, and even Disneyland.<p>With... a test that... takes 10 minutes to run?  Color me skeptical.  By the time amusement parks get the go-ahead to reopen, covid-19 will have worked its way through well over 50% of the population.  The way things are going, that&#x27;s not too long from now, maybe two more months and NYC will be at 50% -- by the end of the year maybe most of the U.S. will be past 50%.<p>Covid-19 is just too infectious.

Sprints are timeboxed so consultants can charge by the spring, and stories lack implementation details because companies hiring consultants don&#x27;t want or need to know how their sausage is made.  The further away your product is from that area, the less effective agile is; some companies really need to design their sausage well, up front, because they are going to be eating it for years.<p>A process that&#x27;s built up over years has become the way it is typically for good reason.

The commercialization, envy and corruption that followed is what the problem is. &quot;Agile&quot; has become a synonym for &quot;cargo-cult brainless implementation of sprints and stand-ups to copy something called scrum but effectively doing things in a very much waterfall and old fashion that isn&#x27;t even remotely close to the original intent&quot;.<p>The problem is of semantics order. What does need to &quot;die&quot; is the  &quot;agile&quot; industry, with cargo-cultish coaches whose only value is to repeat Scrum says X, XP says Y, Agile says Z, my other customers do <U+2126>, without trying to convey the reason behind those implements ; &quot;agile&quot; methodos like &quot;safe&quot; which have very little agility backed in and whose &quot;Enterprise Architects&quot; proponents usually don&#x27;t get any of the intent.<p>But take a look at the manifesto[1] and tell me that you want it to die, I feel like the arguments will be very complex. Re: the that we should become &quot;engineers&quot; (semantics and cargo-cult again), there&#x27;s a very good reason why agile applies well to software, but not to mechanical engineers. The economic equations between those two practices are completely different[2][3], the &quot;engineering&quot; phase of mechanical engineering is cheap compared to the production costs and so iterations have effectively an extremely high overhead cost, whereas the &quot;engineering&quot; phase of software engineering represents most of the cost, and so iteration and adaptability have a very low overhead.<p>But saying &quot;agile needs to die&quot; because of how the &quot;agile industry&quot; corrupted it is similar to saying &quot;email needs to die&quot; because what you see most is spam.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agilemanifesto.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agilemanifesto.org&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developerdotstar.com&#x2F;printable&#x2F;mag&#x2F;articles&#x2F;reeves_design.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developerdotstar.com&#x2F;printable&#x2F;mag&#x2F;articles&#x2F;reev...<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RhdlBHHimeM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RhdlBHHimeM<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-24 20:01:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["parasubvert"],"id":[22975112],"kids":{},"parent":[22969533],"text":["I’ve been doing XP for 22 years, and was on Ward’s wiki as the C2 project was being executed, watching the ideas grow in real time.  I worked for Pivotal for the last 5 years.  Here are my thoughts.<p>Agile alone is insufficient to successful products, which the original proponents would tell you.  It’s a body of practices.  There are more practices than just those.  People seem to want “12 steps to an easy rich life” and want to scream when someone offers only 6 of them.<p>Most of the Agile practices the industry has adopted and evolved without calling them agile.  So in that sense, it’s a “success”.<p>But agile coaches often are so focused on the original 20 year old practices and they miss the bigger picture of business and products and supporting technology, and the evolution that’s taken place in each during that time.<p>Any software method that is delivering software for users to consume has to be complemented by outcome-focused approaches like user-centered design, product development, customer development, and  budgetary funding &#x2F; management practices that don’t weaponize the use of openness, sharing, and metrics for political purposes that hurts people’s self worth.  If you’re missing those, agile isn’t going to help you much.<p>Ultimately just letting engineers be engineers is partly how we got into this mess in the first place.  People don’t know how to organize themselves without some kind of constraints:  design constraints, time, physics, customer constraints, quality, etc.   Talented teams turned loose that ultimately deliver little of value is a cliche at this point.  Agile tries to use time as a constraint to limit active work in progress to force the delivery of customer visible &#x2F; valuable results that can be tweaked.  It’s not the only way to constrain the problem space, but “cost of delay” does have a fairly universal explanatory value in showing what really matters to a business, as lean product development and manufacturing has shown.  But that might not be the outcome you’re looking for.<p>whatever process or practices you do, Agile or not, it has to be organized end-to-end to be tied to some kind of tangible mission or outcome or else it’s just a form of self-deception.  For example, if we think products need to be usable and solve actual problems, and that design can evolve, then Product owners need to speak for the Customers and have the power to make decisions. Engineers need to be empowered to make the technical decisions.  These seem obvious but they’re rare:  committees and political strings attached are the norm.   If you get both an empowered balanced team of product, design, and engineering you’ve got potential for an engine of collaboration and learning, which is the whole point.  Don’t build projects, build human&#x2F;techno systems that grow and improve and evolve.<p>Agile is also not universally applicable and much of the resentment stems from a  religious conversion therapy or Developer Rehab approach to marketing (even though some really could use a stint in rehab).  Agile is applicable to some kinds of software (user-Centered software in particular), which happens to be a big chunk of industry.  It isn’t applicable to everything, such as deeply technical components, pure or applied scientific R&amp;D, or certain kinds of exploratory work.  Nor is it applicable to jobs with set and unchangeable   requirements.<p>People are best to understand there are a spectrum of practices and processes suited to different environments and stages of organizational evolution.  Or they could reject such complexity and nuance and just adopt SAFe, I guess."],"time":["2020-04-25 04:43:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["caseymarquis"],"id":[22974311],"kids":{},"parent":[22969533],"text":["The article mentions Agile as an attempt to bring lean manufacturing methodology to software development. I make software which is used as part of lean manufacturing initiatives (among other initiatives), and see a lot of different manufacturing environments. I want to point out that lean manufacturing is often the wrong tool for producing significantly more of something complex or ramping up production speed of a complex product. In its defense, you could say that lean should be this tool, but is usually so misinterpreted or done so incorrectly that it fails to be this tool. (funny that agile reportedly has the same problem)<p>Generally speaking, lean is a tool for reducing various kinds of &#x27;waste&#x27; and &#x27;doing more with less&#x27;. That&#x27;s the part people seem to focus on anyway. The problem is that people become myopic. Lean becomes the justification for premature optimization and focusing on details that don&#x27;t matter.<p>Sometimes, waste is good. Or, stated differently, not all waste is equal. If you have 5 machines that each produce $1000 of value per hour run, and you&#x27;re attempting to go lean by rearranging them so you can lay off a $20&#x2F;hour employee, then you are focusing entirely on the wrong thing.<p>Lean is often pushed with the idea that employees shouldn&#x27;t be standing around doing nothing, or that you shouldn&#x27;t produce excess material which will sit in a pile. The problem with this is it often fails to account for needed excess capacity, and when something goes wrong, everything falls apart.<p>The correct move (depending on margins) is usually to hire more inexpensive humans to stand around and make sure the expensive machines never stop generating value because you overburdened one of the humans. When you want to make things faster, you don&#x27;t stop producing when the next machine in the process can&#x27;t keep up (producing a pile of unused parts). You buy another machine that performs the next process or figure out what it needs to run faster.<p>Lean is the methodology most people use when they can&#x27;t make big changes that will have a major impact on production. It&#x27;s a tool for making the existing (possibly broken) system function better.  It&#x27;s culturally good to focus on reducing waste, but often it&#x27;s the waste you&#x27;re not measuring or thinking about that&#x27;s killing you.<p>Lean isn&#x27;t bad any more than optimization is bad, it&#x27;s just not the tool you typically want to be starting with. I work directly with customers, have no deadlines that aren&#x27;t self imposed, and couldn&#x27;t tell a story point from a scrum master, so I can&#x27;t say if the failures of lean manufacturing implementation extend to agile, but I&#x27;d be curious to hear if they do.<p>A tool I find more useful than lean: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Theory_of_constraints\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Theory_of_constraints<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-25 02:05:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andarleen"],"id":[22971925],"kids":[22972339],"parent":[22969533],"text":["“and it’s pushing women engineers into non-technical roles” - wtf"],"time":["2020-04-24 21:24:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fukbezos"],"id":[22973871],"kids":{},"parent":[22969533],"text":["Agile adds so much administrative overhead"],"time":["2020-04-25 01:03:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[22970472],"kids":{},"parent":[22969533],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-24 19:12:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["tabelle"],"id":[22969675],"kids":[22969966,22970247,22970133,22970170],"parent":[22969533],"text":["why are people still talking about agile?"],"time":["2020-04-24 18:14:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jaytaylor"],"id":[22972786],"kids":[22974007,22973165,22972863,22973248,22974432,22974082,22975467,22973938,22973631,22982690,22974684,22977658,22973940,22975591],"parent":[22972661],"text":["Kudos to the OP, I&#x27;m glad this got posted on hacker news because Snap is so ridiculously broken.<p>Since 16.04, Snaps have been a huge pain for me with running LXC in production environments.<p>By default, Snap applies updates and restarts Systemd services anytime it likes, and there&#x27;s no way to turn this behavior off!

That said, R still leaves a lot to be desired. Changing the default for stringsAsFactors is great, and I think it reflects a small shift in R from being an exclusively stats-based language to something more general purpose. The nature of stringsAsFactors is that in most statistical models you need your categorical variables to be ordinal.<p>That said, R still is a stats language by design. In Python or JS for example, you can concatenate strings with ‘a’ + ‘b’ but the + operator in R is explicitly only for numeric types. R also has a horrible architecture for memory management, leading to code that uses profound amounts of RAM. I face this issue constantly as I work with very large datasets.<p>I have a love&#x2F;hate relationship with R and despise using it in production. I’m also not a fan of the divergence that Tidyverse has caused. Particularly the expectation of Non-standard evaluation and the tendency for new R learners to become dependent on these packages. Especially as it relates to reproducibility and deploying code, these unnecessary dependencies suck. Tidyverse is maturing and breaking changes are still too common for comfort. There is no reason in my opinion to load stringr when a grep() will suffice. Or, to subset with select when [[ works perfectly fine. Or to filter when subsetting on a logical with which()... the list goes on. Tidyverse is essentially reinventing the wheel in many places. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t translate well to base-R in my experience with new programmers, leading to this divergence.<p>That said, piping with %&gt;% and modifying directly with %&lt;&gt;%(via magrittr) is a pleasure that other languages I’ve worked with don’t manage as well.<p>And at the end of the day, I’m not going to rewrite implementations of all the latest statistical methods already written in R, and this is its strong suit. I’m increasingly using sophisticated spatial and spatiotemporal methods, and these methods are solely implemented in R.<p>I understand that R gets a lot of flack from software developers and I understand why.

Put a couple teaspoons of sugar to let the yeast work better, and make sure the water is between 20°C and 45°C.<p>But the most interesting idea for home baking is the &quot;double fermentation&quot;: let the dough rest for about one hour in a slightly warm environment (20°C - 40°C - usually that means starting the oven for one minute, then turning it off and putting the covered dough in). Then prepare the base for the pizza on your baking tin, but DO NOT PUT anything on it; instead, leave it for 30-45 min more resting in the oven.

I really like extreme dark roast (your typical American diner coffee doesn&#x27;t even count as coffee in my book).  In Italy you can go into pretty much any coffee shop and come away with a top-quality espresso.  (Don&#x27;t even get me started on Starbucks.)  It&#x27;s a taste I inherited from my parents, who have European roots.<p>Now, my parents are seriously old-school.  They still live in the house I grew up in, a house they bought new in 1975 and pretty much never updated.  It still has the original flower-pattern wall paper.  Walking into their house today feels like stepping into a time machine that transports you to an episode of the Brady Bunch.  And in their kitchen is a 40-year-old Mr. Coffee which my father loves to futz with.  On a good day he can coax it into producing an acceptable cup of joe, but that&#x27;s about it.  So for their 50th anniversary I decided I was going to buy them a proper espresso machine.<p>Now, I know next to nothing about espresso except that I love to drink it, so I started doing some homework and very soon got lost in a morass of coffee geekdom.  The range of options available in the espresso machine market is truly mind-boggling, as are the prices.  I didn&#x27;t mind dropping some serious coin (this was their 50th anniversary after all) but I wanted to make sure I was actually getting something for my money.  So I decided to do some experiments.<p>At the time I worked in a co-working office that had a high-end espresso machine (retail price $5000) and several Italians so I asked one of them to show me how to make a proper espresso.  I wanted to use the espresso that came out of the office machine as a baseline and compare it to what I could make on a less expensive machine to see if the machine actually made a difference.  &quot;The first thing you have to do,&quot; he told me, &quot;is to get the right beans.  You have to go to this little specialty shop that&#x27;s a half-hour drive away and get this particular brand of beans...&quot; which, of course, cost $50 a pound or something absurd like that.  But I love my parents, so I dutifully complied.<p>Proper beanage having been procured, we spent several hours brewing espresso with just about every possible variation on the theme you could imagine.  Different grinds (we had a high-end burr grinder in the office too), different packings, different machine settings.  Not once did we manage to produce a cup that any of us considered even remotely drinkable.  It was all acidic and awful, probably because the machine had never been cleaned since it was installed god-only-knows how many years before.<p>I ended up getting them a Keurig.  I got one for myself too.  It makes a decent cup of coffee, but nothing compared to what you find in Italy.  It is still a mystery to me how the Italians manage to produce such consistently good coffee, but only in Italy.  When they come to the U.S. they seem to lose the touch.  Maybe there&#x27;s something in the water."],"time":["2020-04-24 17:04:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["airstrike"],"id":[22960324],"kids":[22966858,22966901,22967567],"parent":[22959023],"text":["I&#x27;m quarantined with two Italians (father-in-law and his mother) from Northern Italy and had been planning on making pizza from scratch to surprise them but always thought I would make a huge mess in the kitchen... from the video, it looks totally manageable!

This IP, 209.235.0.153, hosted the FBI website at some point in time.

You don’t need a sophisticated custom level editor, you can just use something off the shelf like Tiled.

I can’t count all the times I’ve said, “I know how to implement that, but not in Unity.” My mental model of how objects are drawn to the screen consists entirely of buffers and shader program invocations. There are also plenty of games that just don’t benefit from some of the core features of engines, like physics, and need to roll their own anyway.<p>Some games have fairly custom needs and aren’t a good match for existing engines (like <i>No Man’s Sky<\/i> or <i>Minecraft<\/i>) and some games (especially 2D games) have very simple needs and an engine doesn’t provide as much of an edge over something like a framework (e.g. MonoGame) or platform abstraction library (e.g. SDL).<p>Or in short, “custom engine” does not automatically mean “half-baked alternative to Unity”.

Put another way, it seems to be written as if advising royalty or the wealthy is the implied goal, ignoring the broader experiences of mankind, which seems to me in turn ironically a moral failure.<p>Maybe related to this, it seems to presume a certain set of things that I see as actually being fundamental societal and philosophical questions, such as free will and personal agency and all that encompasses. Failure to attain well-being in a broad sense is a failure of the individual to practice free will, under The Ethics, and not of society to foster or intervene in a way so as to facilitate individual improvements in well-being. The sort of paradigm being asserted in The Ethics provides no way out to address the question of &quot;how do I improve the lot of my fellow persons?&quot; or to develop virtues in others. If someone rejects the notion of free will, either in itself or as a meta-phenomenon (that is, as something that can be manipulated itself), The Ethics seems misguided at best and pernicious at worst.<p>Virtue ethics also seem naive to me often, in that there&#x27;s often little self-awareness of its limitations.

To simplify things greatly, there is basically only one alternative to it: Nietzsche. As Alasdair MacIntyre explains (the erstwhile Marxist, now Catholic, who helped revive virtue ethics with his book <i>After Virtue<\/i>), &quot;the underlying structure of [Nietzsche&#x27;s] argument is as follows: if there is nothing to morality but expressions of will, my morality can only be what my will creates. There can be no place for such fictions as natural rights, utility, the greatest happiness of the greatest number. I myself must now bring into existence &#x27;new tables of what is good&#x27;&quot; (AV 114).<p>Nietzsche is commonly misread as a nihilist, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Nietzsche recognizes clearly that is precisely the <i>installation<\/i> of fictional moralities that is the source of nihilism, not the denial of those fictions. (This is also something that Heidegger sees clearly, e.g, in &quot;The Letter on Humanism.&quot;)<p>At the end of the day, then, the question is this: Do you believe in some kind of &quot;objective&quot; morality that governs human life, gives meaning to our existence, and so forth? If so, then Aristotle&#x27;s <i>Ethics<\/i> is by far the most cogent articulation of that view. However, if you believe that morality is just conventional, historically contingent, and a product of our &quot;wills,&quot; then Nietzsche helps us see that clearest. To admit the latter view is not to succumb to nihilism; it is rather to free us to truly pursue the activities of greatness.<p>Ultimately, MacIntyre (inter alia) thinks that we have to choose.

(I.e. you studied it for the historical value mainly, but it had zero connection otherwise to contemporary analytic philosophy.)<p>The two main strands of philosophical thought over the past few centuries have been deontology (best exemplified by Kant) which is that you follow specific moral rules (&quot;don&#x27;t kill&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t lie&quot;, &quot;keep a promise&quot;) no matter what, and utilitarianism (Bentham&#x2F;Mill) which is &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot; (divert the trolley to kill one person instead of five).<p>They both obviously have truth to them but are also deeply incompatible with each other. Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;virtue ethics&quot; says instead that what is most important is one&#x27;s <i>character<\/i>, and that a virtuous character comes from a <i>balance<\/i> of temperaments. For example, you shouldn&#x27;t get angry all the time, but you also shouldn&#x27;t be cowardly all the time. Good character means knowing the right times to take bold angry action, but also knowing the right times to stay back out of fear -- and that honing good judgment is the key to knowing when. Sometimes it means breaking a promise, sometimes it means sacrificing a greater good for another principle, and there isn&#x27;t always an obviously right answer.<p>Thus the idea of &quot;good judgment that can&#x27;t be reduced to strict rules&quot; is now seen as an equally viable alternative to deontology and utilitarianism. Perhaps because it seems particularly relevant in an age of relativism.<p>Also perhaps particularly telling, in the TV show <i>The Good Place<\/i> which recently ended, and where every episode is about a different philosophical dilemma, when the creater Mike Schur was asked about which philosophical system was closest to his own beliefs, he replied that it would have to be Aristotle&#x27;s virtue ethics.<p>I personally found reading <i>Nicomachean Ethics<\/i> a fascinating experience, because it was written pre-Christianity, so the complete and utter lack of notions of &quot;good and evil&quot; is revelatory. We&#x27;re so used to thinking in such terms in much of the world, it&#x27;s refreshing to see a totally different worldview.<p>In case anyone is curious for a modern treatment of Aristotelian thought, Martha Nussbaum&#x27;s book <i>Upheaveals of Thought<\/i> played a big part in &quot;rehabilitating&quot; Aristotle in contemporary philosophy.

Those were windows focused, but if they&#x27;ll do it there, why wouldn&#x27;t they do it on linux?<p>2. Often manufacturers who ship linux will add really stupid EULA&#x2F;TOSs to the system. A few years ago I bought a Dell linux system only to be greeted by one that had all kinds of things like arbitration clauses I did not agree to, so <i>I highly suggest not using pre-shipped linux versions!<\/i><p>3. <i>Be prepared to distro-hop to find the right one<\/i>, regardless of &quot;linux compat&quot; tags. Each batch of production even on the same laptop line will have small variations, and after many years of testing linux on many laptops, my general advice is you really have to distro-hop to find the right linux for the laptop you have. I know this isn&#x27;t ideal, but it is the state of things. For example, I have a newer Ryzen laptop 2-in-1. Every single major distro including arch with newer kernels had major, showstopping issues... On a hunch I tried Devuan... and I have now been running a non-systemd system for half a year with no major issues at all. (and it helps me stay on top of sysvinit land since I still  manage some non-systemd boxen) On other systems I&#x27;ve had to distrohop and the one that works ends up being something else. For example in 2015 I had a MBP on which Ubuntu seemed to just work better than fedora or debian or arch. In 2017 the MBP I had Manjaro ended up being what worked over the others. (the Manjaro hardware detector is the best in linux land imho)<p>4. <i>Consider different desktop environments and window managers<\/i>. One of my pet peeves is someone trying out Ubuntu with KDE&#x2F;Gnome with something and when it doesn&#x27;t work throwing up their hands. I think far too often what people blame linux for is really the fault of the DE&#x2F;WMs. Consider going outside the norm, try XFCE, i3, or my favorite, Awesome. (there are many more)<p>5. Finally, while I understand we all want things to just work on the practical side, remember that computing is inherently an ideological choice, at least in my opinion it is. (I am excluding work computing because sometimes you don&#x27;t get a choice on that &#x2F;<i>stares at work Macbook menacingly<\/i>) I believe in the four freedoms as posited by RMS and try to match my actions to that, for example almost everything I use is gpl+, with only a few exceptions which I am always looking for alternatives to.

I&#x27;m going to posit that a video game is the three following things, but you&#x27;re welcome to disagree:<p>1) a player performs some sort of input into a game<p>2) the game responds with some sort of audiovisual phenomena in regards to that input<p>3) 1 and 2 are repeated, creating a relationship between the player and the game<p>I know a lot of people define video games as a series of choices or &quot;states&quot;, but I think it&#x27;s too strict as I don&#x27;t think the appeal of video games is necessarily reduced to &quot;a series of interesting decisions&quot; as Will Wright puts it. I do think decision-making is a big part of a lot of games, but it doesn&#x27;t explain the entertainment of situations like Revolver Ocelot torturing Snake in Metal Gear Solid, or groups of teenagers playing an easy Starcraft map against a computer player together. Animal Crossing is the same way too; the relationship the player has with the product is fulfilling, and that&#x27;s what drives its appeal."],"time":["2020-04-24 05:28:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kosievdmerwe"],"id":[22964576],"kids":[22964798,22967150,22964891,22965813],"parent":[22963232],"text":["OK I skimmed through the article and I can&#x27;t say I much care for it.<p>To me Animal Crossing is a game that you play over many months to sometimes relax doing something mindless or over the longer term to have an island and house that you slowly build up in your own way.<p>With that in mind there are a lot of great things in animal crossing. A lot of the furniture has interesting interactions and the museum is just a beautiful thing to walk through.<p>But I also feel that some aspects of the game needs tweaking as they detract from the gameplay. There&#x27;s no reason I should have to craft fishbait one by one, mindlessly spamming A for minutes at a time. Nor does shopping have to be as tedious as it is. There is no reason I should have to buy flowers in batches of 5 taking 5+ seconds per batch. I want to plant a massive flower patch not navigate overly deep menus. The lest said about the online play the better.<p>I think the author is trying to find meaning where there really isn&#x27;t any. At its core Animal Crossing is shallow, but in some sense that lack of depth is the appeal. What it has is a shocking breadth though giving each player lots of options to express themselves or simply to while away a few peaceful hours.<p>It&#x27;s not for everyone and it doesn&#x27;t have to be."],"time":["2020-04-24 06:17:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lawrenceyan"],"id":[22963647],"kids":[22963801,22964471],"parent":[22963232],"text":["It&#x27;s kind of funny that they titled the article this way considering the fact that Animal Crossing is currently banned in China because people have been using it as a platform to stage the Hong Kong protests online [1].
