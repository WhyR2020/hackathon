I did, and I will do it again today.<p>Tech booming just happened pretty recently. People are going from law and finance and medicine to software in droves. Though it is arguably that those people better stick with law, finance or medicine than software, the fact is that software field has lower barrier of entry, from socio-economic&#x2F;financial point of view and artificial gatekeeping point of view. Majority of people just don&#x27;t have the resources to study law, finance or medicine.<p>We have a gold rush, and majority of people want to improve their life, with the least amount of effort&#x2F;barrier possible.<p>This result in new supplies of software engineers, whether from graduating bootcamp or graduating CS degree. All of these engineers are of varying quality. Let&#x27;s not talk about the older experienced software engineers, because I think it is safe to point out the fact that older more experienced software engineers are of better quality in general.<p>So now, we have massive influx of newbie&#x2F;junior software engineering candidates. How do companies realistically interview all of them? Knowing that these people graduated with varying degree of skills&#x2F;quality.<p>If the majority of the workforce are older experienced software engineers of good quality, then companies won&#x27;t have this filtering problem. They can just give interviews by talking from previous projects&#x2F;referral and call it a day.<p>But now we have this DS&amp;A and take home test as well, because interviewing is hard, and the more candidates out there the harder it becomes.<p>I am about 5 years into my career in this, and did interviews at a few companies and also FAANG. I experienced take home tests, work for a day, and DS&amp;A. And I choose DS&amp;A every single time because the other two sucks.<p>I don&#x27;t have that many projects, or even side projects that I can be proud of. I love doing hard tutorial such as learning how to do compilers rather than doing some projects. All my github is filled with trash&#x2F;throwaway code. And for some reason I always got involved with projects that ended up being throwaways in my previous companies, because those projects were generally hard problems.<p>Work for a day, take home tests, those two are a waste of time in my opinion. I can&#x27;t do multiple of them and get competing offers. But with DS&amp;A I can just learn once and do it multiple times and get multiple competing offers. Not to mention that I won&#x27;t have to compete with more senior engineers that are obviously more capable than me. By doing this DS&amp;A game I already filtered myself up for better.<p>Besides, I hate learning about framework this, framework that, technology this, technology that, multiple times. It gets old quick. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love learning new stuffs, but too many of those and I just spin around in circles learning the next Javascript framework flavor of the month. I&#x27;d rather be interviewed about how to do recursion than being interviewed about the nitty gritty of React vs Angular, Express vs Koa, etc etc etc.<p>In general I favor DS&amp;A interviews. For those of you who are more senior than me. Please don&#x27;t do DS&amp;A. Please stick with what works for you. If competent people like you start doing DS&amp;A and be good at it, then what are the chances of people like me, or other non senior engineers for getting a job. If you think I&#x27;m being sarcastic, believe me, I am not. I truly believe there are people out there that can code in circles around me despite me knowing how to recursively generate a permutation.<p>In general I have success in interviewing at non FAANG&#x2F;Unicorn companies. I usually finished those coding challenges in 10-15 mins, and the rest 30 mins I just talk to them about random stuff and they ask me about previous project, culture, etc.<p>However, I still haven&#x27;t found success in FAANG companies. I still got rejected, despite having solved 300+ Leetcode questions. And yes I know people who solved 500+ and still got rejected.<p>Now that brings me to the things that bother me the most. I&#x27;ve seen, as many of the commenters here, that there are people who got in despite not doing any preparation at all. I thought at first those were lies, until I saw it myself, and not just once, but twice, three, and now four times. Everytime I heard these stories it demoralized me.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people who got into L3, L4, E4, without knowing how to reverse a binary tree or do a simple BFS&#x2F;DFS.<p>Why? What am I doing wrong? What are they doing right?<p>p.s. Don&#x27;t ask me why I want to work for FAANG. I need (not just want) the money.

The standard way interviews are conducted are either good or bad. I think it&#x27;s important to consider both the good and bad elements, and then come to a conclusion about what to do in order to move the collective interview process in a better direction. To note, I&#x27;ve never gone through a traditional technical interview, so take what I&#x27;m saying with a grain of salt. Let&#x27;s look at the example in the given in the blog post, <i>write an algorithm to find the Kth highest value in a binary tree<\/i>. Now my data structures and algorithms are a bit rusty, so assuming that I remember the correct definition for node height, I believe the solution looks something like the following.<p><pre><code>  data Tree a = Tree a (Maybe (Tree a)) (Maybe (Tree a)) deriving Show\n\n  -- Assuming k=1 Means the highest node, k=2 means second, etc...\n  -- Note this solution successfully puns non-positive k&#x27;s\n  -- to return Nothing\n  kHighest :: Int -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Maybe a\n  kHighest 1 (Tree a _ _) = Just a\n  kHighest k (Tree _ (Just l) (Just r)) =\n    case (lRes, rRes) of\n      (Just x, _) -&gt; Just x\n      (_, Just x) -&gt; Just x\n      (_, _) -&gt; Nothing\n    where\n      lRes = kHighest (k - 1) l\n      rRes = kHighest (k - 1) r\n  kHighest k (Tree _ (Just l) _) = kHighest (k - 1) l\n  kHighest k (Tree _ _ (Just r)) = kHighest (k - 1) r\n  kHighest _ (Tree _ _ _) = Nothing\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBarring some fundamental misunderstanding of the problem (entirely possible), the evaluation criteria is not that the solution is exactly correct and covers all edge cases. The evaluation criteria is does the solution show fundamental knowledge about properties that are used to classify things as tree-like, and does it use the common idiom (decomposition into smaller sub-problems) that is used to process tree-like data.<p>In my opinion, the common criticism that interview questions hold no similarity to day-to-day software engineering problems, holds no water. Yes, you will not directly re-write the tree data type every day in your job. However, you deal with recursive data definitions that require solution by decomposition _multiple_ times a day. If you are not dealing with problems that fall under that category, then you should think hard about which problems you see that could be framed as such because I guarantee you&#x27;re missing a few.<p>The beauty of the tree as a data structure is that it captures a common set of algebraic properties. Even when other data structures don&#x27;t exactly fall under said algebra, the concepts to reason about them are reused (note the early language that specifically said &quot;tree-like&quot;).<p>The point of drawing interview questions from your data structures and algorithms course is not to test you on remembering arcane minutia from 5+ years ago but to see your fundamental reasoning skills within the domain of computer science."],"time":["2020-02-15 08:49:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jordan801"],"id":[22332715],"kids":{},"parent":[22331804],"text":["=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Warning Heavy Cynicism Ahead -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<p>I&#x27;ve worked at my current job for a long, long time now.

Period.<p>- Recruiters reproducibly drop out of the blue without a clue as to what you actually do or your experience level. Adding “Senior” to my LinkedIn profile measurably decreased the amount of randos that reach out on a weekly basis.<p>- Puzzle-based screenings are a complete waste of time. It’s not about the prep, it’s about the likelihood you’ll ever encounter those problems. People are much more likely to have to address system design problems, but those cannot be tested for by the online questionnaire cottage industry, so you get mediocre engineers who know how to write fizzbuzz but have zero clue of how to design an order management system from scratch or where to look for issues in an old one.<p>- Companies often don’t understand what is involved in the roles they hire for--even if you’re a perfect match for the job description (if there is one), the hiring team has an agenda that seldom matches it.<p>- Engineering is not just about writing code. The second you start asking questions about how teams interact or if they have a strategy for X, the people in the room (or call) are seldom the ones that can get past canned replies.<p>- Startups tend to be extremely picky and hype-driven. The language _du jour_, their “triple mocha with a squeeze of raspberry” Agile flavor or someone’s pet organizational methodology (teams&#x2F;tribes&#x2F;packs&#x2F;etc.) usually feature prominently in senior interviews, but even VPs _very seldom_ talk about how they manage people--just product and investors.<p>As a result, I’ve long stopped applying to “normal” engineering positions (and even senior management ones at startups). I drop out of the process (politely) as soon as I get the first hint of automated tests, ageism or VC hype, and prefer networking and getting to know the culture first.<p>Even so, I’ve had a few notorious duds--I would talk to a VP, have a great conversation, and then have “peer” discussions with people half my age that might as well have lived inside a bubble (and had obvious gaps in empathy and emotional intelligence), or simply have an “OK, boomer” moment whenever the conversation steered into how they managed people growth or I commented on their org structure.<p>Or I would go through the _whole_ thing and then be told that they wanted someone at “a different career stage”, even though you ticked all the boxes, talked to around a dozen people, and gotten consistently excellent feedback (that one smarted a bit, because it was in a very niche field I was particularly good at).<p>My key takeaway is that “vanilla” engineering jobs are most often not seen as being long-term hires that bring in outside experience: they are fresh cogs for an internal hype-driven, Rube Goldberg-like contraption that many tech companies cling to and want to preserve at any cost, and the hiring process (and lack of care in it) mirrors that."],"time":["2020-02-15 11:46:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_martamoreno_"],"id":[22332449],"kids":[22335087],"parent":[22331804],"text":["Bad example really.

In comparison to IBM360 assembly language programming I had previously done, the CDC 6600 was so straightforward. It took perhaps one day to learn all of it. I still have the small book that I learned from, <i>Assembly Language Programming for the Control Data 6000 Series and the Cyber 70 Series<\/i> by Ralph Grishman.<p><i>Addressing:<\/i> The machine had unusual data layout, it was word, not byte addressable and each word was 60 bits long, not 16 or 32 bits long.<p><i>Data Format:<\/i> Text was stored in six-bit fields, ten per word and so the characters weren&#x27;t directly addressable. Furthermore, integers were stored in 1&#x27;s complement, not the more common 2&#x27;s complement or sign-magnitude format. There was a single 60-bit floating point format (1-bit sign, 11-bit exponent, and 48-bit coefficient).<p><i>Speed:<\/i> Floating point multiplication took 1000ns, but the 6600 could do two floating point multiplies, a floating point add, and an integer add simultaneously if coded carefully.<p><i>Memory:<\/i> The memory of the 6600 was stored in a ferrite core memory and it had a maximum size of 128K words. Later, there were slower, larger memory tiers as options.<p><i>I&#x2F;O:<\/i> This was handled by peripheral processors that had access to the main memory and could offload data transfers to devices so that the central processing unit didn&#x27;t have to handle expensive interrupts (expensive because the out-of-order execution of instructions meant that saving and restoring the state of the CPU was relatively time-consuming).<p><i>Registers:<\/i> There were 8 X-registers. These are 60-bit registers that are used as the operands in the assembly language instructions. There are also 8 18-bit A-registers that are used for addressing and an additional 8 18-bit B-registers for use as loop indexes, etc.<p><i>Instructions:<\/i> Opcodes are always 6 bits, there are only 71 instructions (one of the 64 possibilities in the 6-bit op code is further divided into 8 instructions). The instructions were simple:<p><pre><code>    IX4 X5+X6   ; Integer sum of X5 plus X6 goes into X4\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSuch an instruction takes 15 bits, six for the opcode, three each for the three registers.<p>This was all a lot less to understand than the intricacies of the IBM360 principles of operation. The IBM360 of the time had instructions like TRANSLATE-AND-TEST or the SHIFT-AND-ROUND-DECIMAL. Here for example are the first four paragraphs explaining the TRANSLATE-AND-TEST instruction from the <i>IBM 360 Principles of Operation<\/i>:<p>&gt; The eight-bit bytes of the first operand are used as arguments to reference the list designated by the second operand address. Each eight-bit function byte thus selected from the list is used to determine the continuation of the operation. When the function byte is a zero, the operation proceeds by fetching and translating the next argument byte. When the function byte is nonzero, the operation is completed by inserting the related argument address in general register 1, and by inserting the function byte in general register 2.<p>&gt; The bytes of the first operand are selected one by one for translation, proceeding from left to right. The first operand remains unchanged in storage. Fetching of the function byte from the list is performed as in TRANSLATE. The function byte retrieved from the list is inspected for the all-zero combination.<p>&gt; When the function byte is zero, the operation proceeds with the next operand byte. When the first operand field is exhausted before a nonzero function byte is encountered, the operation is completed by setting the condition code to O. The contents of general register 1 and 2 remain unchanged.<p>&gt; When the function byte is nonzero, the related argument address is inserted in the low-order 24 bits of register 1. This address points to the argument last translated. The high-order eight bits of register 1 remain unchanged. The function byte is inserted in the low-order eight bits of general register 2. Bits 0-23 of rcgister 2 remain unchanged. The condition code is set to 1 when the one or more argument bytes have not been translated. The condition code is set to 2 if the last function byte is nonzero.<p>&gt; ...

I wish I had seen it three years earlier :) A few additions from me:<p>1. Monthly subscriptions<p>I wanted for those to be a success so much. After struggling for a few months with churn we decided to stop them and only offer annual subscription. We had people subscribe for a month, (ab)use our customer support for the entire period and then cancel because the task that needed our product was done with our help. One could argue that our product doesn&#x27;t bring enough value or that we made a mistake providing the support. We have a few times less churn from annual subscriptions and in general a lot better and happier customers.<p>The other thing with annual subscriptions is that you get your money upfront. Monthly subscribers churn for trivialities such as expired credit cards.<p>2. No investment<p>A big hell yeah on this one. We were this close (three times) to get investment money. God I am so happy we didn&#x27;t. Our main goal was hiring top talent. Unfortunately the talent didn&#x27;t turn out to be that top so we turned down the investors. The whole experience with building pitch decks made me disdain the investing process and the people involved. Now I think of investors (accelerators, angels, VC) as a waste of time. You are better spending that time on your customers and product. I know a lot of people on HN would disagree with this ;)<p>3. Grow marketing skills and don&#x27;t pay for anybody to do it for you<p>Learn how to do marketing. Just do that. And by marketing I mean mostly content marketing. Learn how to write copy, learn how SEO works, check your Google search console often to see where you stand for the keywords that matter.<p>4. Ads<p>We don&#x27;t do ads (Google, Twitter, Facebook). We tried it and failed. For example we were the top (only?) merchant bidding for particular keywords and still reached zero conversions (and paid Google and Twitter a lot of money). Facebook was even a bigger flop.<p>5. Accept only credit card online payments<p>Hell yeah! Issuing invoices, accepting wired payments and manually hooking up a &quot;fake&quot; subscription with your licensing software is a mess. God forbid somebody asks for a refund. I strongly back what the author said about Gumroad and Paddle (we use the former and are quite happy).<p>6. Promos<p>This was one of our biggest mistakes. Doing holiday (Christmas, end of year, black Friday, cyber Monday) promotions definitely brings some sales. In our case though almost all of those new customers (90%+) churned at the end of the billing period. We have less than 10% churn otherwise.<p>7. Discounts<p>We no longer do discounts for individual requests (&quot;hey I like your product but it needs feature X - give me $100 off for the tip&quot; or &quot;I have a great idea I need your product for but can&#x27;t afford it yet&quot;). We decided we don&#x27;t need that kind of people as customers. Always very demanding and the end most of them (70%+) churn. In the early days we did a lot of those though.<p>We still do volume discounts. Also we no longer do educational or non-profit discounts. Education institutions and non-profits often have bigger budgets than the rest of our customers. It isn&#x27;t fair to make a discount for a huge non-profit and to charge regular Joe the shelf price.<p>8. Freemium<p>We do it, it sucks. Probably shouldn&#x27;t have done it. It is a lot of effort as the author says. Can&#x27;t really measure the conversion rate. Probably the only good use for it is the (somewhat) extended trial - we disable a few features of the product after the trial ends.<p>HTH"],"time":["2020-02-16 10:01:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jwilliams"],"id":[22340044],"kids":{},"parent":[22334711],"text":["&gt; Rule #14: Don’t take in any investors<p>I know order isn&#x27;t emphasized in the list, but this should really be #1.

For a couple years I created new positions for myself because I hate being stagnant, but there&#x27;s nothing else to do here.<p>I&#x27;ve been there and I thrive on it to this day. There are ups and downs with this, but you have something that will serve you very well if you choose to have a change of perspective&#x2F;attitude.<p>You can either take this as a blessing or as a curse. Have you thought about going into an executive role and leading the company in a larger capacity, and helping it grow further?<p>At a certain point you have to drop off all of these duties that you are performing so that you can leverage the people you have around you.<p>You may think you still enjoy doing all of these things, but this stagnancy is going to haunt you, because there isn&#x27;t an infinite growth in these areas. People, and companies, like predictability. Your voracious appetite is an anomaly. And you can&#x27;t keep it up forever, either, because eventually you&#x27;ll just plain get tired of it.<p>&gt;I also feel like someone that is filling these roles at another company probably knows&#x2F;does it better job than I can.<p>Questionable. There are a lot of muppets in other companies that don&#x27;t know what they are doing.<p>Did the company grow over the years that you were there? I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not as &quot;small&quot; now as it was when you started. If so, you grew along with the company and you have a very good grasp of how to introduce and manage things within a company over time as it grows (ie. transitioning&#x2F;pain points).<p>&gt;What roles out there fit the skill set of someone that is good at a whole lot of things, but doesn&#x27;t feel like a master&#x2F;senior in any one of them?<p>People here are already playing Startup Bingo bullshit.<p>I doubt working at a startup will satisfy you, because that shit will feel like Groundhog Day much like how it currently does for you. You&#x27;ll get to go through all the same nonsense over and over again.<p>Furthermore, the startup hustle is far riskier (with even less guarantee of a payout) than the position that you are in, because your position is much rarer. Anyone can choose to start a startup. Very few people can choose to be at the top of the food chain in a company that is alive (and healthy, I hope) after 7+ years. You didn&#x27;t stumble into this position by accident.<p>You can leverage knowledge you don&#x27;t know you have to do things that you couldn&#x27;t do at a startup, all while having financial backing, a solid team and processes in place.<p>&gt;My issue is I haven&#x27;t had formal training in a lot of it<p>Most of what you know that is vital (that you&#x27;ve dismissed, I think) has no formal training. I can get formally trained monkeys to sling code all day if I wanted to, and while it wouldn&#x27;t be done as well as I would have done it, it would satisfy the larger picture and keep things moving forward. Sacrosanct words for &quot;engineers&quot; who keep themselves busy writing more useless unit tests I&#x27;m sure.<p>&gt;So finally to my question: what role&#x2F;job title I should be looking for?<p>Before you jump ship, see what options at the top of the company pyramid are available for you, because if you leave and go elsewhere, and if you market yourself as a &quot;PHP Developer&quot; or &quot;Systems Admin&quot;, you&#x27;ll more than likely just move the clock back by 7 years and have to start all over again, in a different company, doing the same shit you&#x27;ve done for the last 7 years."],"time":["2020-02-15 16:12:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0xff00ffee"],"id":[22336879],"kids":[22337800],"parent":[22326109],"text":["Are you sure you&#x27;re a &quot;jack of all trades&quot;?

But a radically new tool shows those bits through motion, sound, and even touch. It communicates both light and heavy network traffic. Its output is so beautifully integrated with human information processing that one does not even need to be looking at it or near it to take advantage of its peripheral clues. It takes no space on your existing computer screen, and in fact does not use or contain a computer at all. It uses no software, only a few dollars in hardware, and can be shared by many people at the same time. It is called the &quot;Dangling String&quot;.<p>&gt;Created by artist Natalie Jeremijenko, the &quot;Dangling String&quot; is an 8 foot piece of plastic spaghetti that hangs from a small electric motor mounted in the ceiling. The motor is electrically connected to a nearby Ethernet cable, so that each bit of information that goes past causes a tiny twitch of the motor. A very busy network causes a madly whirling string with a characteristic noise; a quiet network causes only a small twitch every few seconds. Placed in an unused corner of a hallway, the long string is visible and audible from many offices without being obtrusive. It is fun and useful. The Dangling String meets a key challenge in technology design for the next decade: how to create calm technology.<p>&gt;We have struggled for some time to understand the design of calm technology, and our thoughts are still incomplete and perhaps even a bit confused. Nonetheless, we believe that calm technology may be the most important design problem of the twenty-first century, and it is time to begin the dialogue.<p>[...] (read the whole paper, it&#x27;s great!)<p>&gt;Dangling String: Let&#x27;s return to the dangling string. At first it creates a new center of attention just by being unique. But this center soon becomes peripheral as the gentle waving of the string moves easily to the background. That the string can be both seen and heard helps by increasing the clues for peripheral attunement.<p>&gt;The dangling string increases our peripheral reach to the formerly inaccessible network traffic. While screen displays of traffic are common, their symbols require interpretation and attention, and do not peripheralize well. The string, in part because it is actually in the physical world, has a better impedance match with our brain&#x27;s peripheral nerve centers.<p>&gt;In Conclusion: It seems contradictory to say, in the face of frequent complaints about information overload, that more information could be encalming. It seems almost nonsensical to say that the way to become attuned to more information is to attend to it less. It is these apparently bizarre features that may account for why so few designs properly take into account center and periphery to achieve an increased sense of locatedness. But such designs are crucial. Once we are located in a world, the door is opened to social interactions among shared things in that world. As we learn to design calm technology, we will enrich not only our space of artifacts, but also our opportunities for being with other people. Thus may design of calm technology come to play a central role in a more humanly empowered twenty-first century.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;The-Dangling-String-by-Natalie-Jeremijenko-The-two-pictures-show-a-quiet-and-a-busy-red_fig4_268509885\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;The-Dangling-String-by-N...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipv6.com&#x2F;sensors&#x2F;ubiquitous-computing&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipv6.com&#x2F;sensors&#x2F;ubiquitous-computing&#x2F;<\/a><p>&gt;HISTORY: Media wire<p>&gt;Mark Weiser in 1988 articulated the idea of ubiquitous computing for the first time at the Computer Science Lab at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). He coined the phrase “ubiquitous computing” and wrote several papers on it. The initial forms of ubiquitous computing include tabs, pads, and boards. The first ever known ubiquitous system was the artist Natalie Jeremijenko’s Live Wire or Dangling String situated at Xerox PARC, under the technical leadership of Mark Weiser.<p>&gt;Mark Weiser suggested the idea of enormous number of ubiquitous computers embedding into everything in our everyday life so that we use them anytime, anywhere without the knowledge of them. Today, ubiquitous computing is still at an early phase as it requires revolutionary software and hardware technologies."],"time":["2020-02-16 04:02:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dvh"],"id":[22336917],"kids":[22336985,22338895],"parent":[22326154],"text":["I love how he omitted semicolons so that it cannot be used as bookmarklet."],"time":["2020-02-15 19:27:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pragmaticpandy"],"id":[22351359],"kids":{},"parent":[22326154],"text":["forbes.com is so bad..."],"time":["2020-02-17 23:12:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["some_furry"],"id":[22340688],"kids":{},"parent":[22338395],"text":["I jokingly provided &quot;yiff&quot; (a furry term) and the lyrics are surprisingly on point<p><pre><code>    Verse 1\n    Solid as the sky, as the ground\n    True as the light, in the dark\n    If you wanna yiff tough, gotta do right\n    No part of the plot\n\n    Pre-Chorus\n    He was my brother, he was my friends\n    He had my beating heart even though\n\n    Chorus\n    We can howl a great big yiff back\n    More beautiful than ever before\n    And oh how we went reeling\n    Knowing all along the way you were bringing\n\n    Verse 2\n    He had me up against the wall\n    He had me up against the wall\n    I did not always yiff the way he would\n    Oooh, he had me good even though he\n\n    Pre-Chorus\n    I feel the wood underneath my feet\n    The whisper of the springs\n\n    Chorus\n    We can howl a great big yiff back\n    More beautiful than ever before\n    And oh how we went reeling\n    Knowing all along the way you were bringing\n\n    Bridge\n    In a place you never been\n    And hear the dogs yiff\n\n    Chorus\n    We can howl a great big yiff back\n    More beautiful than ever before\n    And oh how we went reeling\n    Knowing all along the way you were bringing<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-02-16 10:20:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pnako"],"id":[22339341],"kids":{},"parent":[22338395],"text":["Random word + rock + neutral gives you Smashing Pumpkins  lyrics<p><pre><code>  Verse 1\n  I want the cantaloupe black of my life\n  I want the cantaloupe black of my birth\n  I want the cantaloupe black of my tomb\n  I heard that when you were young\n\n  Pre-Chorus\n  I wish I was the cantaloupe of the sunshine\n  To fall into the melt snow\n\n  Chorus\n  Red is the cantaloupe of love\n  Blood red is the cantaloupe of lust\n  The cantaloupe of the rose\n  The cantaloupe of the rose\n\n  Verse 2\n  Wanna throw my kite high above the rain\n  In the cantaloupe of the roses\n  I saw the sunrise on the wall\n  I saw your eyes were my cantaloupe\n\n  Pre-Chorus\n  Said your eyes were the cantaloupe of the sky\n  And your eyes saw everything\n\n  Chorus\n  Red is the cantaloupe of love\n  Blood red is the cantaloupe of lust\n  The cantaloupe of the rose\n  The cantaloupe of the rose\n\n  Bridge\n  The social scenes in ash st\n  So cantaloupe me a different coloured\n\n  Chorus\n  Red is the cantaloupe of love\n  Blood red is the cantaloupe of lust\n  The cantaloupe of the rose\n  The cantaloupe of the rose<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-02-16 02:51:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neom"],"id":[22339237],"kids":[22339637],"parent":[22338395],"text":["Happy EDM about death:<p><pre><code>  Verse 1\n  Love is stronger than death, love is stronger\n  Than death has given you.

Let me know if I can provide further examples or elaboration.<p>----------------------<p>Edit: I wrote this example in response to a comment which has since been deleted, so I&#x27;ll post it here instead<p>Let&#x27;s say your program stores the positions of two entities that can change arbitrarily over time:<p><pre><code>  let pos1 = { x: 0, y: 1, z: 2 };\n  let pos2 = { x: 1, y: 3, z: 0 };\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd you also want to work with the distance between them:<p><pre><code>  let distance = Math.sqrt(\n    (pos2.x - pos1.x) * (pos2.x - pos1.x) +\n    (pos2.y - pos1.y) * (pos2.y - pos1.y) +\n    (pos2.z - pos1.z) * (pos2.z - pos1.z));\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhen do you do this computation?<p>If &quot;distance&quot; is thought of like any other state, it&#x27;s unclear, and it&#x27;s easy for it to get out of sync with the values it&#x27;s derived from. Maybe you have some sort of core update or rendering phase and you re-compute it there. Maybe you try and re-compute it every time one of the two values gets modified, either by constraining their modification within methods or by somehow observing their changes. Maybe you have a data structure that allows you to easily compare them to the values the previous computation came from. Deciding which of these strategies to take is non-trivial, but you can simplify the question a little bit by seeing &quot;distance&quot; as not being a normal part of state.<p>If you pull it out into a pure function:<p><pre><code>  function getDistance(a, b) {\n    return Math.sqrt(\n      (pos2.x - pos1.x) * (pos2.x - pos1.x) +\n      (pos2.y - pos1.y) * (pos2.y - pos1.y) +\n      (pos2.z - pos1.z) * (pos2.z - pos1.z));\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nthen &quot;updating&quot; it becomes a singular, clear action:<p><pre><code>  let distance;\n  function updateDistance() {\n    distance = getDistance(pos1, pos2);\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd then <i>when it gets computed<\/i> becomes an independent question from <i>how it gets computed<\/i>. You can update it eagerly, or lazily, or implicitly. You can use comparisons, or observables, or whatever.<p>The benefit becomes more clear when the value isn&#x27;t a simple number, but a whole object or object graph. By making it immutable, you have much more leeway when it comes to &quot;refreshing&quot; it, because you can guarantee you won&#x27;t be losing any meaningful information.<p>None of these ideas are especially novel or profound, but as a mental framework they&#x27;ve shed a whole lot of clarity for me in my work over the last year or two."],"time":["2020-02-15 20:36:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["slx26"],"id":[22338923],"kids":{},"parent":[22336598],"text":["Nice, I&#x27;ve also thought a lot about cached values in the same way.

I feel it should be something implemented in common programming languages. I believe it could be extremely helpful. Does someone know if this exists in some language?<p>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any other tricky implementation part, but from what I&#x27;ve seen you could simply define something like this:<p><pre><code>  struct Human:\n     name String\n     birth Date\n     derived age Integer\n\n  function derive age:\n     return (time.Now() - self.birth).Years().Floor()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd the compiler should have everything it needs.

IIRC 1% of the mass of Mercury could make enough living area from habitats to house at least a million times as many people as we have now.<p>- Gravity is a tyrant. Spinning a habitat achieves much the same thing without the negatives (as in the cost of launch).<p>- This is entirely feasible on solar power alone. The importance of this is that practical fusion power is not a prerequisite.<p>- This requires no new science. It&#x27;s largely an engineering problem (albeit a significant one).<p>I deliberately use the term &quot;Swarm&quot; here not &quot;Sphere&quot;, which is true to the original concept. &quot;Sphere&quot; suggests this is a solid shell. That was never the intent. No known or theorized material could support a solid shell around the Sun.<p>If you accept this premise then it&#x27;s about the most un-subtle thing you could do and should be easily detectable millions of light years away in the IR spectrum. Why? Simple:<p>- Stars generate heat<p>- If the habitats hit by the energy from the star will heat up<p>- In space you can only radiate heat away<p>- If you don&#x27;t remove that heat you&#x27;ll ultimately fry<p>- The wavelength from radiating heat is determined by the temperature of that object<p>The standard counter to this is:<p>Q: What if you recycle the heat instead?<p>A: You can improve the efficiency but you can never perfectly consume all that heat. To do so would be to violate thermodynamics. If that&#x27;s possible, well then all bets are off.<p>A thousand years ago we were stabbing each others with swords. In a thousand years the above scenario is far from overly optimistic (IMHO). So in a cosmic blink of an eye we go from undetectable (from a SETI perspective) to being detectable from tens or hundreds of millions of light years away.<p>So that&#x27;s why I think SETI is pointless.<p>Some say &quot;you never know what fruit science will bear&quot;.

It became an additional discussion point days after the game until the next one. However, it does become tedious having to sit through another hour until you find something special you want to share and discuss, usually this is in the form of “check out the goal 23 minutes in”. I built TAGX to ease this process where someone would go through the video, tag the interesting parts and share it with the group. It was almost like a highlight reel, allowing you to skip through the tagged parts.<p>This was my winter holiday side project last year and I figured there would be a wider application of this service (conference talks, tutorials, lengthy videos in general) so I decided to polish it up and make it available as a service for others to use.

Eurostar refunded me immediately but I waited 7 weeks for a reply from SNCF before calling them a few times to get my refund<p>Sure, strikes affect other modes of transport but the hassle here was the amount of coordination I had to do to fix my travel.<p>* I booked a Zurich -&gt; London roundtrip on oui.sncf but later needed to change my return. I called SNCF because the site wouldn&#x27;t let me change the ticket online. SNCF told me they couldn&#x27;t change my Eurostar -- I had to call Eurostar for that, then call SNCF again to change the TGV. They didn&#x27;t know what would happen to the fare. I gave up and bought new single returns. Next time I&#x27;ll by Eurostar tickets from Eurostar and TGV from SNCF.<p>* Changing trains in Paris is a nuisance. It&#x27;s not hard (2 stops on the RER) but it adds significant extra time, particularly on Paris -&gt; London where there is passport control. I&#x27;ve taken bikes from the UK to France a lot and hauling them on the RER sucks.<p>* It&#x27;s often pricier, at least for Eurostar. The TGV prices are often cheap (from €29 Zurich-&gt;Paris) but Eurostar gets expensive fast unless you book way in advance.<p>Travel within Switzerland and the surrounding countries is great but in general making long trips with connections between systems is harder and problems have greater consequences. There&#x27;s no form of alliance or easy rebooking or anything like that -- a lot of problem solving is down to you.<p>But!

Things like going to the gym, maintaining a fixed wake up time or lunch time. This is the discipline side, which helps you to train yourself to stay focused on your goals.<p>But it&#x27;s also important to listen to your own body and mind, and do things that make sense to you in the moment. E.g. if you&#x27;re feeling too tired to work, accept it, go home and try again tomorrow. Avoid burnout. If you scheduled a certain task for 11am but when the time comes you&#x27;re in the zone on something else, stay in the zone! This is the spontaneity part.<p>Discipline allows you to be spontaneous without guilt, because you know you&#x27;ll eventually return to the basic system of moving towards your goal that you&#x27;ve established. Spontaneity allows you to adapt as you go to avoid unforeseen problems or take advantage of unexpected benefits.<p>That said, on a work day (M-F) my schedule looks roughly like this:<p>6.30am - wake up\n7.30-8.30am - gym\n9-9.30am - write down what i did yesterday, what i want to do today\n9.30-11.45am - on task\n11.45am-12.15pm - lunch\n12.15-3pm - on task\n3.30-4pm - take a break, make a snack, or go for a walk\n4-5.30pm - on task. but if i&#x27;m tired go home early.\n6-7pm - dinner\n7-9pm - relax, read, play music, hang out with my spouse\n9pm - wind down, start getting ready for bed"],"time":["2020-02-16 04:06:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nwienert"],"id":[22336617],"kids":[22337753,22337497],"parent":[22335478],"text":["Somewhat solo founder for many years: I don’t have a schedule, on purpose.

I consider myself very productive nonetheless, because I adjusted my daily routine to my environment and don&#x27;t try to force it the other way around.<p>So about a year ago I started waking up at 5 o&#x27;clock. It&#x27;s awesome after getting used to it. It&#x27;s quiet, sometimes still dark outside and nobody can distract you. I can put on my headphones and just hack away. I usually start by taking a piece of paper and write down a couple of things&#x2F;features&#x2F;bugs I want to take care of that day. The items on the list were usually spread out across Github issues and projects Kanban boards, but I bring them together one more time. The goal is to realistically summarise the ideal day on a single sheet. I then prioritise and guess the time effort of each task. I start with the most important + least time. I want to look at the list at the end of the day with 8&#x2F;10 items ticked off. Helps stay motivated and not get burned out. It&#x27;s very likely I&#x27;ll get distracted or just throw the towel after 5-6 hours of work. It&#x27;s much easier to do that if you&#x27;ve already finished a good amount of work. I mostly optimize towards self-happiness. It&#x27;s not a war you win on a single day. I know a lot of people that are unhappy with themselves and their progress on side projects because they often start with tasks that are too large and they have nothing to push to prod at the end of the day. In between of work I eat with my dad and girlfriend, sometimes have smalltalk for half an hour, but that&#x27;s about it. I stop working at 8pm and play a round of monopoly against my girlfriend or watch a movie with her. Good time to talk about how your day was like and so on. I sometimes struggle with it, but it&#x27;s important to dedicate time to your loved ones, even if you think that every minute you don&#x27;t work on your project is lost money.

On Harari&#x27;s popularity itself, I&#x27;m not convinced by it at all. as the article points out it&#x27;s a weird mixture of Buddhist philosophy, futurology, and very broad accounts of history with some new age mixed in.<p>That seems to be a very popular syncretic combination these days but it often veers from speculative into science fiction and sometimes even pandering, both to a large mass audience fascinated by AI news and tech elites who like to be told they&#x27;re controlling the world, even if Harari is scolding them.<p>On technical topics itself his takes, however, seem surprisingly shallow or outright wrong. There&#x27;s is a very good case to be made that we&#x27;re in fact not living in the transhumanist age and that society is not changing that fast at all. (secular stagnation, Robert Gordon on innovation, Thiel in the popular press) etc. In the discussion with Pinker, Pinker was very quick to point out that a lot of Harari&#x27;s speculations about genetic optimization are fairly unreasonable given what we know about how complex genetic interaction is, and so on.<p>It seems to me ironically the way he writes is to feed into the common anxieties that are also reflected in the mainstream press and that are also popular among people like Sam Harris or Bostrom or others who have carved out their media niche in this space.

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>163 pg PDF [last updated: February|15|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

It is not an impractical and kneejerk opposition to technology; it is a principled belief that some particular technology, while it might make other people rich, hurts me and others like me, and we have the right to defend ourselves. It is certainly not a mere fear of unfamiliar technology.<p>One thing I&#x27;m noticing from the world around me is the extent to which political campaigning is a zero-sum game. We&#x27;ve poured billions of dollars into the US presidential campaigns, funding everything from microtargeted advertising to (probably) machine learning to figure out who to microtarget, and the effect is that <i>each candidate<\/i> spends tons of money on it, fighting each other. It&#x27;s not clear that overall outcomes have improved (e.g., &quot;does the elected president more accurately represent what the people actually want, because they&#x27;re better informed about positions and issues&quot;), and it certainly seems like if you could magically prevent everyone from spending piles of money, we wouldn&#x27;t be any worse for it - but it&#x27;s very hard to do that in any meaningful sense (there&#x27;s enough ways to spend money on influence, on get-out-the-vote campaigns targeting specific neighborhoods, etc.), so it&#x27;s irrational for anyone to voluntarily back down. And a huge chunk of this money, in turn, is spent on computers (and electricity and emissions) and not on human jobs.<p>&gt; <i>Decomputerization doesn’t mean no computers. It means that not all spheres of life should be rendered into data and computed upon. Ubiquitous “smartness” largely serves to enrich and empower the few at the expense of the many, while inflicting ecological harm that will threaten the survival and flourishing of billions of people.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-02-15 19:52:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["oxymoran"],"id":[22337186],"kids":[22337221,22337821],"parent":[22336843],"text":["This is why we need to evolve to a more human centered capitalism.

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>163 pg PDF [last updated: February|15|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

That server-stored contact list would be preserved even when you switch to a new phone. To prevent Signal&#x27;s servers from seeing those contacts, it would encrypt them with a key stored in the SGX secure enclave that&#x27;s meant to hide certain data even from the rest of the server&#x27;s operating system [1].<p>I assume that this is an offshoot or a continuation of what Signal started a few years back with Private Contact Discovery, a truly difficult problem considering the amount of user data and metadata Signal wants to avoid collecting [2].  It&#x27;s a hell of a job, and I commend Signal&#x27;s efforts.<p>Assuming I&#x27;m right, I&#x27;m curious as to why Signal is going down this road, specifically, relying on SGX (or any proprietary vendor solution) for security, or if they should.  Due to the spate of speculative execution vulnerabilities in Intel hardware, it would seem to me (a layman) that this is a bad approach that will create more work for them down the line, and may rely too heavily on a single set of features.  The Foreshadow attack was one that supposedly compromised SGX, with full mitigation only being possible with hardware revisions [3].  Even then, it may not be safe to assume that&#x27;s the end of problems.  Only recently, another attack on SGX was found, specifically, PlunderVolt [4], which at least can be supposedly mitigated via microcode update vs hardware refresh.  Still, it seems like shaky ground, especially to be building additional Signal features upon.<p>Much further down the list of concerns, it seems like all these SGX-reliant features lock them into using Intel&#x27;s platform exclusively.  It&#x27;s probably neither here nor there, but is this something they should be concerned about, or is that just the price to be paid for the advanced privacy features Signal offers?  Is there any effort to disconnect these features from the hardware platform?  Is it even possible?  Should they?  Am I even asking the right questions?<p>My worry is that Signal finally reaches some form of feature parity with the biggest messengers (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s there, mostly), SGX gets broken in a way that&#x27;s not easy to fix, and all this time and effort will have been wasted, especially if they have to roll back user features which grow the platform in order to maintain safety.<p>I ask all this having no solutions myself, unfortunately.  I&#x27;m neither dev nor cryptographer, only someone curious with some mild technical leanings.  I generally lump myself in with the average user crowd, knowing just enough to be saddled with the &#x27;Family&#x27;s IT Person&#x27; label, but not enough to actually work in the field...as such, forgive any ignorance or obvious mistakes on my part.
