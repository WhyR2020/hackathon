Google’s cloud business in particular requires it to convince business clients it can handle sensitive data and work on discrete projects. This has brought it more in line with its secrecy-minded competitors.<\/i><p>The article fails to mention a certain Anthony Levandowski [0] and biases towards anti-innovation and anti-activism narratives, in particular. Sensitive documents can&#x27;t be just kept lying around esp when industrial espionage [1] and intellectual property theft is a thing [2].<p>&gt; <i>Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. demand that workers operate in rigid silos to keep the details of sensitive projects from leaking to competitors.

It was such a drastic change from the otherwise quite transparent culture at Amazon that it almost felt un-Amazon-esque. To me, those teams, back in the day, felt as if had a culture of their own separate from the rest of the company. The silos were rigid, and that was by design. These days you&#x27;d find, by default, certain teams keep their docs under wraps forever (even post-launch). Some teams continue to commit to transparent documentation.<p>I missed the open culture which was curtailed (a necessity, though took a bit too far by some orgs) but I see why Amazon needed to do that. You could not possibly trust all 600K employees going through the system with high churn. The learnings &#x2F; information weren&#x27;t <i>pull<\/i> anymore, you had to get it <i>pushed<\/i> to you, on a case by case basis, and the principal engineers became the common thread through which Amazon&#x27;s culture and engineering fabric was woven.

Everyone there is very smart and depending on your tastes, it can be pretty fun to be in meetings where you try to explain Davidsonian ontology to perplexed business people. I suspect a decent fraction of the technical staff are reading this comment thread. There are also some genuine technical advances (which I wish were more publicly shared) in inference engine architecture or generally stemming from treating symbolic reasoning as a practical engineering project and giving up on things like completeness in favor of being able to get an answer most of the time.<p>There were also some big negatives, mostly structural ones. Within Cycorp different people have very different pictures of what the ultimate goals of the project are, what true AI is, and how (and whether) Cyc is going to make strides along the path to true AI. The company has been around for a long time and these disagreements never really resolve - they just sort of hang around and affect how different segments of the company work. There&#x27;s also a very flat organizational structure which makes for a very anarchic and shifting map of who is responsible or accountable for what. And there&#x27;s a huge disconnect between what the higher ups understand the company and technology to be doing, the projects they actually work on, and the low-level day-to-day work done by programmers and ontologists there.<p>I was initially pretty skeptical of the continued feasibility of symbolic AI when I went in to interview, but Doug Lenat gave me a pitch that essentially assured me that the project had found a way around many of the concerns I had. In particular, they were doing deep reasoning from common sense principles using heuristics and not just doing the thing Prolog often devolved into where you end up basically writing a logical system to emulate a procedural algorithm to solve problems.<p>It turns out there&#x27;s a kind of reality distortion field around the management there, despite their best intentions - partially maintained by the management&#x27;s own steadfast belief in the idea that what Cyc does is what it ought to be doing, but partially maintained by a layer of people that actively isolate the management from understanding the dirty work that goes into actually making projects work or appear to. So while a certain amount of &quot;common sense&quot; knowledge factors into the reasoning processes, a great amount of Cyc&#x27;s output at the project level really comes from hand-crafted algorithms implemented either in the inference engine or the ontology.<p>Also the codebase is the biggest mess I have ever seen by an order of magnitude. I spent some entire days just scrolling through different versions of entire systems that duplicate massive chunks of functionality, written 20 years apart, with no indication of which (if any) still worked or were the preferred way to do things."],"time":["2019-12-13 19:04:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stereolambda"],"id":[21783377],"kids":[21784169,21789946],"parent":[21781597],"text":["Knowledge bases should work in principle. There are many issues with filling them manually: a) the schema&#x2F;ontology&#x2F;conceptual framework is not guaranteed to be useful especially when done with no specific application in mind b) high cost of adding each fact with little marginal benefit etc. But I don&#x27;t think it outweighs the issues of &quot;pure&quot; machine learning that much: poor introspection, capricious predictability of what you will get, and if you want to have really structured and semi-reliable information you will probably have to rely, at some point, on something like Wikipedia meta-information (DBpedia). Which is really a knowledge base with its own issues.<p>I think what really stopped Cyc from getting a wider traction is its closed nature[0]. People do use Princeton WordNet, which you can get for free, even though it&#x27;s a mess in many aspects. The issue and mentality here is similar to commercial Common Lisp implementations, and the underlying culture is similar (oldschool 80s AI). These projects were shaped with a mindset that major progress in computing will happen with huge government grants and plans[1]. However you interpret the last 30 years, it was not exactly true. It&#x27;s possible that all these companies earn money for their owners, but they have no industry-wide impact.<p>I was half-tempted once or twice to use something like Cyc in some project, but it would probably be too much organizational hassle.

And if you give the AI an unfair mechanical advantage, your model isn&#x27;t going to have to learn nearly as good of strategy. I will say however - this is the closest to realistic I have seen - but is still lacking.<p>The two main measurable parameters of performance are:\n1 - reaction time\n2 - rate&#x2F;volume of actions (i.e. Actions Per Minute)\nAnd I would argue some there should be an additional consideration of some form of:\n3 - mouse-click accuracy<p>I read through the details of the implementation, and they did decent at 1, 2 but overall need to do better.<p>Their reaction times end up as a random draw between 170-270ms. I think raw, simple visual reaction times for a pro gamer could be ~200ms, BUT that’s just for a simple “click this button when the light changes” type of tests. There are “complex reaction time” tests where you sometimes click, but other times don’t (eg a red or green light), and reaction times in that case are around ~400ms. I think if a pro is in a game situation where they anticipate their opponent will take some action and are ready to immediately respond, 200ms is a fair reaction time. But that’s not the usual state through a game, and the bot effectively has that perfect anticipation mindset at all times. So not crazy, superhuman reactions, but definitely not completely realistic&#x2F;fair either.<p>In regard to action rate, they allow the model to take 1 action every 7.5 ms - which translates to 450 APM. The very best pro gamers are in the 300-350 APM range. And i think a humans actions include various thoughtless click spamming (which AI doesn’t need to do), as well as visual map movement&#x2F;unit examination that an AI would not need as much of with a direct, comprehensive feed available information. So the sustained 450 APM seems pretty superhuman to me - BUT dota 2 is much less of a APM intensive game, and certainly sustained APM isn’t as important. And humans get get higher APM in important burst moments whereas this AI is at an exact fixed rate of 450 APM. So all-in-all, the APM is maybe fair (at least close to fair)<p>The mouse click accuracy piece, however is pretty unfair if the ai can make precise clicks across the screen with no affect to reaction time. This factor isn’t considered at all by the AI team. I feel they should either add in some randomization to simulate inaccuracy, or cause delayed reaction time based on how far the mouse would have to move.<p>With all these factors combined - I still feel this is not quite a fair test. But it’s closer than other’s I’ve seen, and it’s still a very impressive overall achievement! I’d love to see them go the small extra distance of constraining these mechanical performance parameters just a bit more. I feel that would make a BIG difference in the level of strategy required to beat the best humans.

A research work in academia is an original contribution to a specific field that meets certain criteria of: writing and technical rigor, objectivity and completeness. It is the community of that field who judges your work on these criteria.\n* What constitutes a research question is a hard problem (you need to compute your cost of opportunity: time, complexity, resources and impact) that only comes with experience. Choose badly and you might end up empty-handed after many years of work. At the beginning you rely on your advisor for guidance on this but with time you begin to smell the low hanging fruits and proceed with certain &quot;independence&quot;.<p>Regarding the article, it is not clear whether the OP made a comprehensive review on the relevant and related literature. Without that, no research question can even begin to be formulated. No research is completely isolated from what has been already done and it is the job of the student to identify where it &quot;fits&quot;. If it is really a completely novel subject then I would strongly discourage the OP from working on it if she were to do it in the context of a PhD program, for her own good and sanity.<p>Of course, this is not to say that her work has no value (it might have even more value that what she could have done in academia) but that is not the point.

Not everyone get high&#x2F;wired&#x2F;&quot;sped up&quot; on it. Not a wonder drug for everyone. May help with depression induced by anxiety induced by not getting shit done (not necessarily by getting something done, but instead switching attention away from things not done).<p>My whole life I was not able to do much of mental work during the day, with my most productive time being around midnight +- 3-4 hours. I kinda just lived with it considering it being due to the way I grew up. I got my first full time job at around 25 yo (before that it was freelancing) and got hit hard with a &quot;normal&quot; schedule (be at work at 8am, leave office at 5pm, try to fall asleep at 11pm to be ready to wake at 7am next day). That was a time I started drinking coffee. It used to give me goosebumps, even at a small sip from a typical office low-end brewing machine. Did not really helped much, but I think it gave me that initial boost and I stuck with it. Nowadays I almost never drink tea (used to be my exclusive brewed beverage) and mostly drink coffee.<p>Fast forward in my earlier 30ties. I get quite regularly severe depression-like (never diagnosed) periods. Trying different things, reading a lot online. Eventually meeting with psychiatrist explaining what is going on (can&#x27;t do stuff during the day, getting depressed quite regularly about it, bunch of other shit) suspecting all of that causing anxiety which metamorphosing into depression. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it is true physiological condition or just some period in my life where my habits and life stage got in conflicts with each others. I read about ADHD and it seemed quite familiar. I also considered bi-polar condition, but psychiatrist ruled it out.<p>As for ADHD, psychiatrist was very reluctant to write such a diagnose given that I had relatively good life (good income, lack of destructive impulsive actions affecting life quality, family, job, etc). He started me at 5mg extended release. It did literally nothing. Over months trying he bumped it to 25mg XR and after that failed to produce any noticeable effect, he suggested to try 20mg instant release twice a day. Safe long-term maintenance dose accordingly to FDA is 70mg. At that point I certainly felt some effect, but I am not quite sure it is what everyone think it feels like.<p>First of all, very counter-intuitive - amphetamine often makes me sleepy and tired. But if I try to take a nap, I almost never can truly fall asleep. Most of the time I just end up laying in the bed with closed eyes. The whole experience doesn&#x27;t feel energizing or euphoric at all.<p>Secondly, on many days it appears to reduce anxiety about &quot;getting something done&quot; to the point where I did not experience my regular depression episodes this year.<p>With instant release, I have to take it twice a day. I often forget to take second pill. Sometimes I forget to take a first one. I tried nicotine vape earlier, and i dont think i ever forgot to take vape mod with me, or keeping it full and charged.<p>With 20mg instant release I sometimes experienced &quot;locked down&quot; feeling, which I found quite unpleasant. Not sure if it is that &quot;focus&quot; feeling everyone is talking about, but it certainly was different from focus I get when I am &quot;in the zone&quot; (the pleasant one). My solution was to break 20mg in half and take 10mg each 2hrs. Downside - I get more chances to forget about it during the day.<p>Going higher than 20mg twice a day seems to be pointless, as I already prefer to break 20mg twice a day to 10mg four times a day. It also raises blood pressure noticeably, and I would expect higher dose will do it even more. Effects of it are certainly not pleasant enough for me to even consider taking it recreationally. But it seems to help with depression&#x2F;anxiety episodes - so far one year, will see how it will feel next spring, as it is the time I had the most of these episodes. So it seems this crutch is helping me somewhat."],"time":["2019-12-14 17:56:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HocusLocus"],"id":[21781489],"kids":[21784829,21781743,21785531,21782295,21783282,21782172,21782368,21788769,21783575,21782795],"parent":[21778566],"text":["What&#x27;s next, &quot;America&#x27;s caffeine epidemic&quot;?<p>Interspersed with all this pedantry is a smarmy judgement towards stimulants and COMPLETE LACK of context of the times, and a lack of any societal or species context that recognizes the BREATHTAKING ACHIEVEMENTS during said times of &quot;Oh so bad bad we should be ashamed it&#x27;s an epidemic!&quot;  There&#x27;s an undercurrent here that is almost criminal.<p>The sin is not excess, certainly at 5mg a dose.

When we look in the server logs, we find a user agent string that indicates a user is running iOS 11.4.1.  My theory is that the older version indicates that the client&#x27;s mobile device has run out of storage space.  The device can&#x27;t download the update to iOS 13.x since there is insufficient storage available on the device.<p>Even if the user frees-up some space on their device, not enough to upgrade to iOS 13.x, but enough to run our app theoretically, our app still fails to run for them.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the native app that contains the webview that runs our web app doesn&#x27;t solve the problem either.  My theory is that there are truncated versions of some of our javascript files left over from when the device ran out of storage that don&#x27;t get re-downloaded even when storage is later made available....<p>I&#x27;ve been telling people to free-up space on their device and upgrade it to iOS 13 to fix the problem.

And to be fair, for most startupy types of companies that need to iterate fast, that is what you want to optimize for.<p>My interview screening question was pretty simple- &quot;Is node.js single threaded or multithreaded?&quot; And to most, they spit back the blogspam headline- &quot;Single threaded!&quot; I think the most correct answer is &quot;its complicated&quot; but would accept that because most people would say that is the &quot;right&quot; answer. So I would follow up with- &quot;what exactly happens in a default installation if we have say... 5 requests come in at exactly the same time to just return some static content from disk?&quot; (Node&#x27;s default threadpool is 4). And here is where you could see their understanding just fell apart. Some would say they would be handled entirely synchronously, others completely in parallel- but then had no idea what the cause of the parallelism was. Very few actually understood that node is an event loop executing javascript backed by a threadpool for async operations.<p>Before reading this post, I was like eh this is a waste of time- its typical medium bullshit- they almost certainly found they were doing some blocking call in the event loop and then removed it and voila, 30x speedup.

Mueller rapes and kills twelve boys. About roughly 00:55 Representative Adam Schiff who will also be leading an impeachment effort, also requests the same deal as Nadler, and then tries to make a case for getting more than Nadler and Mueller. Adam Schiff rapes and kills three boys. Mueller and Schiff all receive $3 billion dollars each for joing the group. Nadler came back to witness these two rape to make sure they were all bound together under one purpose: keep Trump in power, and also to confirm the payments to each, including his $10.5 billion dollar payment.<p>Between Mueller and Schiff turns, the group issues orders for ten women to begin prepping more boys for rape. They are former friends and family of Brian Schlenker, and also some long standing Illuminati members who include Elsa Hosk, Gigi and Bella Hadid. Again, the &quot;prep&quot; these females engage means they perform oral sex on the boys’ penis and anus, as a child rapist like Henry Porter would, while trying to remove fecal matter from the boy prior to handing them over to be raped and subsequently murdered.

My knowledge of public health is indirect, but my dad spent his entire career in that sector. The article&#x27;s portrayal of the public sector versus the private sector is slanted.<p>Here is a fact that many people don&#x27;t want to admit but is widely acknowledged within the public health sector: UN organizations like the WHO are indispensable, but also among the most bureaucratic, ineffective, and inefficient entities on the planet. There is a reason that the impetus for hiring McKinsey came from inside the WHO itself. Private-sector organizations like Gates Foundation have been welcomed into the field not only because of their resources, but because of their effectiveness and organizational capabilities.<p>The second point is that governments in developing countries are corrupt and direct aid money is quickly siphoned off and dissipated.<p>The third point, following from the first two, is that the United States&#x27; foreign aid efforts have always relied heavily on consultants and public-private partnerships, and have been extremely effective. Say, for example, USAID wants to address infant mortality in Bangladesh. It doesn&#x27;t give money directly to Bangladesh. It gives money to a consulting firm, which hires &quot;boots on the ground&quot; (doctors, etc.) and  secures supplies. USAID and the consulting firm then work closely with the health ministry in Bangladesh to execute the vaccine program.

Another option is to allow the customer to share in the profits of the advisor through some type of customer ownership like you see with companies like Vanguard or with credit unions.<p>VC funded robo-advisors like Wealthfront have no solution to this problem.  In order for them to be trusted with full control of your money, they would have to be satisfied with growing their profit simply by increased customer base and not want to increase profit per customer.  Publicly owned or privately owned VC backed companies simply don&#x27;t work like that.  There is a constant need to continually increase profits.  It is just a matter of time until someone at robo-advisors says &quot;we can make more money if we add this fee&quot;.

This exists today in the form of things like Uber Pool. Without a driver you might get one additional passenger in a car.<p>That&#x27;s the main mechanism.

These days, I&#x27;m no longer very involved with the day-to-day of the project.<p>Now that it&#x27;s no longer a young project, here are some musings about Huginn and responses to people&#x27;s comments in this thread, in no particular order.<p>I&#x27;ve found that Huginn excels as a scheduled web scraper with lightweight filtering. That&#x27;s what I use it for. On the other hand, while you can write custom code in it, Huginn is pretty poor at implementing any sort of complex logic, and is even worse at bidirectional syncing between systems, which is something people often want it to do, but for which it wasn&#x27;t designed.<p>If IFTTT or Zapier meet your needs, awesome! No need to run and monitor your own service. I personally choose to run Huginn on my own hardware in large part so that I&#x27;m comfortable giving it website cookies and passwords.<p>Some examples of what I use Huginn for these days:<p>- Watching Twitter in realtime for high standard deviation spikes in certain keywords, such as &quot;san francisco emergency&quot; or &quot;san francisco tsunami warning&quot;, which then sends me a push notification, or &quot;huginn open source&quot;, that goes to a digest email (and I imagine will trigger because of this thread).<p>- Watching Twitter for rare terms and sending me a digest of all tweets that match them. Also sending me all tweets from a few Twitter users who post rarely, but that I don&#x27;t want to miss.<p>- Scraping a number of rarely updated blogs that don&#x27;t have email newsletters and emailing me when they change. Some use RSS, most are just simple HTML scraping.<p>- Pulling deals from the frontpage and forums of slickdeals and craigslist and filtering them for certain keywords.<p>- Sending an early morning email if it&#x27;s going to rain today.<p>- Watching ebay for some rare items.<p>- Sending my wife and me an email on Saturday morning with local yardsales from craigslist.<p>- Watching the HN and producthunt front pages for certain keywords.<p>Basically, anytime I find myself checking a website more then a few times, I spend 20min making a Huginn Agent to do it for me.<p>I think one reason Huginn has worked well for me is that I don&#x27;t try to make it do too much. I use it for scraping data and gentle filtering, and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s been super helpful for alerting me to interesting content for The Orbital Index, my current project, a weekly space-industry newsletter.
