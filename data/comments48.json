Not even necessarily talking about scale of data or scale of performance, but organizational scale. Getting dozens or hundreds of engineers aligned around best practices, tooling and local development for Spark is both challenging and extremely rewarding. When you have everyone buy into Spark as not just an execution environment but a programming paradigm, it really unlocks some cool potential. If anyone cares this is how I&#x27;ve found to best get Spark users riding on rails:<p>* Use a monorepo to &quot;namespace&quot; different projects&#x2F;teams&#x2F;whatever. Each namespace has its own build.sbt for Scala jobs and Conda&#x2F;Pip requirements file for PySpark. This gives you package isolation so that different projects can bump requirements at their own pace. This is crucial in larger organizations where you might have more siloed development or more legacy applications.<p>* Build each project in the monorepo into a separate Docker image and tag it accordingly with some combination of the branch and namespace.<p>* Deploy applications onto Kubernetes by invoking the SparkOperator (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;spark-on-k8s-operator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;spark-on-k8s-operator<\/a>), This abstracts away a lot of the hassle of driver&#x2F;executor configuration and gives you nice out-of-the-box functionality for scraping Spark metrics.<p>* For local development, use some type of CLI or Makefile to build&#x2F;run the image locally. This is where the implementation diverges somewhat from using SparkOpelrator (unless you want to tell your employees that everyone needs to run Kubernetes on their local machine, which we thought would create too much friction).<p>* For orchestration, write a custom operator for Airflow that submits a SparkOperator resource to the Kubernetes cluster of your choosing. The operator should supervise the application state, since the SparkOperator doesn’t quite do that well enough for you. This is something I wish we had the opportunity to open source.<p>* Where it gets tricky is building Spark applications locally and running remotely, Say you built a job locally and tested it on a small subset of your data. Now you want to see what happens when you run across a full dataset, requiring more than 16gb of memory (or whatever the developer has on their laptop). You need some way to build your image locally but schedule it remotely. This could be done via the same CLI or Makefile, but you end up with a lot of images and it gets pretty costly. I’m sure we would have figured it out eventually if we didn’t all get laid off last month :P<p>* BONUS: Use Iceberg or Delta (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iceberg.apache.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iceberg.apache.org&#x2F;<\/a>) (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delta.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delta.io&#x2F;<\/a>). These are storage formats that work with distributed file storage like HDFS or S3 to partition and query data using the Spark DataFrame API. You get time travel, schema evolution and a bunch of other sweet features out of the box. They are an evolution of Hadoop-era partitioned file formats and are an absolute must for organizations dealing with lots of data &amp; ML infrastructure.<p>This post took up more time than I had wanted, but it actually feels good to write down before I forget. I hope it is useful for someone building Spark infrastructure. I&#x27;m sure others have a completely different approach, which I&#x27;d be curious to hear! As someone whose full time job was basically just to orchestrate Spark application development, I can say for certain products like this are needed in order for the ecosystem to thrive, and I would probably have given you my business had the circumstances been correct.

A good (and well-known) school. MIT, Stanford, CMU, UW, Waterloo, you get the picture.<p>2. A good (and well-known) employer. FAANGs in particular. Ideally as an FTE but internships are good signals here too.<p>3. To be known for something you&#x27;ve done. Well-used open source project, well-known blog, that sort of thing.<p>(1) and (2) fall into the category of &quot;social proof&quot; [1] and whether you like it or not, social proof can take you pretty far in life. Like in my case, it didn&#x27;t take that long from working at Google to getting cold-called almost constantly (and I guarantee you there&#x27;s nothing special about my situation).<p>My own job seeking experience (pre-Google) tends to be pretty similar to the numbers in this post (applications to interviews to offers). For those of you sending out hundreds of applications let me offer you some advice because I see a lot of people making easy-to-fix mistakes.<p>Hiring is a popular topic on HN and you see the same comments. There are always people who call a hiring pipeline a failure because a good candidate got rejected. This is the wrong way to approach this. The process is asymmetric.<p>A candidate is trying to get through each stage of the pipeline and get hired by somebody. Ideally they want multiple offers to boost the offer they end up accepting. &quot;Success&quot; is accepting an offer.<p>Below a certain size, a company wants to fill a role. It&#x27;ll have N applications and the pipeline is designed to have filters along the way to winnow down that number to fill the role. &quot;Success&quot; is filling that role with someone sufficiently good. They don&#x27;t have to be the best. Technical skills matter but usually only to a point. You have to bear in mind that you are a cog that needs to fit into an existing machine. Each step of the process gets increasingly time-consuming so the more you can weed out at the earlier stages while still filling the role, the better.<p>Large companies are similar except you don&#x27;t tend to be interviewing for a particular role. There is a constant hiring pipeline. Recruiting may well be a separate org. You can use this to your advantage.<p>So, let&#x27;s make up some numbers for our waterfall:<p>- Recruiting receives 100 applications<p>- The 20 best get sent to a hiring manager<p>- They may well eliminate half for various reasons passing on 10 to one of their engineers<p>- That engineer may well filter out half too meaning 5 will get called<p>- 3 of those will get interviews<p>- 1 will get an offer, another will be the backup<p>Like I said, completely made up but still instructive. And I&#x27;d say it wouldn&#x27;t be too far off the mark for a mid-sized company.<p>The first thing is you need to get through a company&#x27;s recruiting&#x2F;HR filter. Well they look at the requisition (&quot;req&quot;) they have and try and see if the application seems to fit the criteria and I really do mean <i>seems to<\/i>. This is what I call the buzzword filter. Anecdote: I once had a conversation with a recruiter who said--and I&#x27;m not making this up--&quot;I can see you have 6 years of Java experience but do you have any J2SE experience?&quot;<p>Some of it isn&#x27;t buzzword related. Like if the req calls for leading a team, they&#x27;ll look to see if you&#x27;ve led a team in the past. Depending on the company, the seniority of the position and so forth, factors like your school and previous jobs may come into play. Length of employment is a factor here.<p>So how do we approach this to pass this filter? Well we need to cater our resume to the job posting and see how it fills the criteria. We need to have sufficient buzzwords but not too many and not any we can&#x27;t back up. This may hurt us later. Then again, it&#x27;s completely valid to try and pass through early stages and deal with that problem later.<p>One point to consider is that the half the applications the hiring manager may never see. To be fair, a lot of job applications are garbage. My numbers are actually pretty generous. I&#x27;ve had people tell me that 90% of applications can be immediately rejected.<p>The hiring manager will have their own criteria and biases. They&#x27;re trying to judge if you&#x27;re someone who will fit on the team. Here lots of short jobs can hurt. There are cultural factors too eg in the UK I found having contracting on your CV would really hurt you for full-time roles (this was years ago; I can&#x27;t speak for the current conditions).<p>Basically the hiring manager is looking for red flags.<p>The engineer will typically be looking for technical suitability. It&#x27;s from this point onwards that various (ideally cheap) negative filters are used to try and reduce the numbers further.<p>And this is what a whiteboard coding test should be: a relatively easy problem just to see if you&#x27;re not an idiot. FizzBuzz is easy for a reason. Engineers fall into the trap of thinking the problem needs to be hard. This actually reduces the effectiveness of the signal as you&#x27;ve turned a useful negative filter into a crap shoot of whether or not you know the &quot;trick&quot;. For example, I had whiteboard coding problem once to reverse bits. Turns out (I found out later) this can be done in O(log n). I had never had need for such a trick so didn&#x27;t know it. So what did that test accomplish exactly? Bit-fiddling is applicable to certain classes of programming, just not any I had and (more importantly) not the one I was interviewing for.<p>An early stage startup may simply be the hiring manager responding to emailed applications and they&#x27;ll hire the first suitably qualified candidate they find because they really don&#x27;t want to be doing this. A larger company may filter everyone through and then pick the &quot;best&quot; to extend an offer to.<p>So when you apply for a position, I would encourage you to think about what process that company has for hiring and treating it as a waterfall that you need to get through. Find out what you can about their hiring process. If you can&#x27;t find out, make up something that seems reasonable given the type of company they are and their size.<p>The most important step for your application is to make it through the first 1-2 filters as those tend to be pretty dumb. Your CV needs to stand out from a hundred others in some way. A known school or employer is a good one. Absent that, allowing them to see some evidence that you can communicate in written form and&#x2F;or actually code is a big plus.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Social_proof\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Social_proof<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-11 06:29:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["urlgrey_"],"id":[23143121],"kids":{},"parent":[23132387],"text":["I enjoyed the write-up.

Think of audio in digital terms as just a series of numbers. A waveshaper is just a simple mathematical function. To apply it, you literally just apply the function to each value in the input stream and there&#x27;s your output stream. There&#x27;s no memory or interesting algorithms going on. It&#x27;s the audio equivalent to calling map() on your list of samples with some lambda to produce a new list of samples.<p>Of course distortion pedals do that in the analogue domain using circuitry, which has some additional complexity because transistors and diodes and friends don&#x27;t behave exactly like mathematical functions. There&#x27;s &quot;sag&quot; and some other physical effects that cause the output to also somewhat depend on previous input.<p>Even so, that can generally be modelled using a simple convolution. Each output sample is calculated by taking some finite number of previous input samples, multiplying each of them by a weight factor, and then summing the results.<p>Does that sound like a neural net? It is. That&#x27;s what we call them <i>convolutional<\/i> neural networks. Convolution is bread and butter in DSP. You can easily generate one that produces the same effect as some piece of hardware or acoustic environment by running an impulse (a single 1.0 sample surrounded by silence) through the system and then recording the result.

Using it with all the knobs at noon is not consistent with this, it usually gets used with a tube amp that is already on the verge of distortion, and then you use the TS with the volume turned up a lot (3&#x2F;4-max) and the gain quite low, this might be part of why this sounds so bad to me.<p>There are actually two different trains of thought on guitar effect modeling:<p>- Model it based on input &amp; output waveforms like he&#x27;s doing<p>- Actually model the circuit as an electrical simulation and then pass the signal through that.<p>I have personally found the second approach to be way more realistic and satisfying.   The Yamaha THR amps work this way and they&#x27;re really amazing.<p>One of the tricks here is a listener might not be able to tell a difference, but the guitar player picks up on a perceived change in how the guitar feels with these effects.   A tube screamer has a lot of compression built into it for example.   It causes everything to play to sound a little dirtier for the same amount of picking energy you put into the guitar.   It will cause the player to play a little more lightly than they would without the effect.  This is the kind of thing that makes a player reject the model and want to stick with the real thing, whereas the guy in the naive lab building the model thinks it&#x27;s great cause they&#x27;re not even playing an actual guitar through it.   Once a skilled player tries it the &quot;feel&quot; is a dead giveaway which is which.<p>It&#x27;s easy for some of this stuff to get lost on the electronics crowd if the background is electronic music.  An actual acoustic piano is the only keyboard based instrument that has anywhere near the nuance that a guitar has, and a guitar still has way more weird stuff going on with dynamics and articulation.

NiFi helps decouple those roles, so that the operations of dataflow can be actively managed by a dedicated support team that is more tightly integrated with the &quot;mission&quot; of their dataflow.<p>NiFi additionally offers some features that most programmers skip to help with the resiliency of the application.  For example:<p>- the concept of &quot;back pressure&quot; is baked into NiFi. This helps ensure that downstreams systems don&#x27;t get overrun by data, allowing NiFi to send upstream signals to slow or buffer the stream.<p>- data provenance, the ability to see where every piece of data in the system originated and was delivered (the pedigree of the data). Includes the ability to &quot;replay&quot; data as needed.<p>- dynamic routing, allowing a dataflow operator to actively manage a stream, splicing it, or stopping delivery to one source and delivering to another. Sources and Sinks can be temporarily stopped and queued data placed into another route.  Representational forms can be changed (csv -&gt; xml -&gt; json, avro), and even schemas can be changed based on stream.<p>Anyone can write a shell script that uses curl to connect with a data source, piping to grep&#x2F;sed&#x2F;awk and sending to a database. NiFi is more about visualizing that dataflow, seeing it in real-time, and making adjustments to it as needed. It also helps answer the &quot;what happens when things go wrong&quot; question, the ability to back-off if under contention, or replay in case of failure.<p>(disclaimer: affiliated with NiFi)"],"time":["2020-05-11 23:38:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["banjoriver"],"id":[23146214],"kids":{},"parent":[23144450],"text":["NiFi is vey good at reliably moving data at very high volumes, low latency, with a large number of mature integrations, in a way that allows for fine grained tuning, and i&#x27;ve seen first hand that it is very scalable. It&#x27;s internal architecture is very principled: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nifi.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;nifi-docs&#x2F;html&#x2F;nifi-in-depth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nifi.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;nifi-docs&#x2F;html&#x2F;nifi-in-depth.ht...<\/a><p>Out of the box it is incredibly powerful and easy to use; in particular it&#x27;s data provenance, monitoring, queueing, and back pressure capabilities are hard to match; custom solution would take extensive dev to even come close to the features.<p>It is not code, and that means it is resistant to code based tooling. For years it&#x27;s critical weakness was related to migrating flows between environments, but this has been mostly resolved. If you are in a place with dev teams and separate ops teams, and lots of process required to make prod changes, then this was problematic.<p>However, the GUI flow programming is insanely powerful and is ideal when you need to do rapid prototyping, or quickly adapt existing pipelines; this same power and flexibility means that you can shoot yourself in the foot. As others have said, this is not a tool for non technical people; you need to understand systems, resource management, and the principles of scaling high volume distributed workloads.<p>This flow based visual approach makes understanding what is happening easier for someone coming later. I&#x27;ve seen a solution that required a dozen containers of redis, two multiple programming languages, zookeeper, a custom gui, and and mediocre operational visibility, be migrated to a simple nifi flow that was 10 connected squares in a row. The complexity of the custom solution, even though it was very stable and had nice code quality, meant that that solution became a legacy debt quickly after it was deployed. Now that same data flow is much easier to understand, and has great operational monitoring.<p>Some suggestions:\n- limit NiFi&#x27;s scope to data routing and movement, and avoid data transformations or ETL in the flow.  This ensures you can scale to your network limits, and aren&#x27;t cpu&#x2F;memory bound by the transformation of content.\n- constrain the scope of each instance of nifi, and not deploy 100s of flows onto a single cluster.\n- you can do alot with a single node, only go to a cluster for HA and when you know you need the scale."],"time":["2020-05-11 21:52:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unixhero"],"id":[23151519],"kids":{},"parent":[23144450],"text":["Phew!

Right now musicians are not getting revenue from PRS as no pubs&#x2F;shops are playing music right now.<p>Some &#x27;Peel Sessions&#x27; got released on &#x27;Strange Fruit&#x27; including the seminal &#x27;the orb&#x27; epic track &quot;A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From The Centre Of The Ultraworld (Loving You)&quot; that was put together by Jimi Cauty, who subsequently left &#x27;the orb&#x27; to be one half of The KLF. Hence the Peel session of The Orb and the original pressing of the aforementioned track were the only truly awesome stuff they released.<p>Incidentally this excellent blogpost of Peel Sessions does not include this particular 1989 classic.<p>Note that first time round you would wait until Thursday 11 p.m. to tune in to John Peel on FM radio and record the good stuff with a spare cassette. You might record over that cassette a week or two later. Everything could be ordered through an independent record shop if you wanted it for real, expect one of a thousand pressings though.<p>You would need to remember names of artists and their tracks from the radio, no rewind unless you had that tape running. Discographies didn&#x27;t exist like now so you never knew if an alias of an artist was the artist you knew already or a new one.<p>I respect people that piece all of this together today, however, somewhere in the BBC they have this archived and they could sort out the licensing problems the way it works on streaming platforms.<p>Licensing problems are mostly due to defunct labels and who gets the royalties. For instance, if in 1988 &#x27;A Guy Called Gerald&#x27; was part of &#x27;808 State&#x27; on the &#x27;Creed&#x27; label, then, in the Peel session, if it get replayed, where does the money go? The other members of the group went to be signed by ZTT leaving A Guy Called Gerald to do his own stuff in a different direction. The Peel session fell in-between albums with tracks from the old and the new. Sorting out the monies is tricky for the BBC to do but YouTube manage monetisation easy enough."],"time":["2020-05-12 00:53:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bufordtwain"],"id":[23149527],"kids":[23150404],"parent":[23147372],"text":["Many of his complete shows can be downloaded as mp3&#x27;s, see the following for instructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peel.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mooo_Server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peel.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mooo_Server<\/a>.<p>Also there is an online radio station inspired by Peel: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dandelionradio.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dandelionradio.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-12 03:15:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["onion2k"],"id":[23151525],"kids":{},"parent":[23147372],"text":["This is awesome!

I spent a couple months architecting and implementing i18n and translations, for example. I looked at GNU language files and other formats and made our own JSON based one.<p>I tried my hand at static site generation, and it basically takes an existing site and renders certain URLs from the config (including looping through variable values) as a specific browser would fetch them. If you serve different versions of a resource to different browsers (eg mobile browser or css vendor prefixes) you’d have to generate different directories for each one, which can be cleanly chosen by a web server based on the user agent string.<p>This led to a whole host of issues that made us refactor our framework’s server-&gt;client data exports into two parts: session data and regular config data. So a static page would not have any session data. Any experience of being logged-in would have to be added via Javascript or widgets hosted in iframes.<p>We also have scripts like “combine.php” and “update.php” which minify and combine files, or look at file modification times and set up metadata with timestamps and hashes to use for subresource integrity.<p>Actually, I would say that the idea of “static site generation” can be a special case of CACHING. To achieve 90% of the benefits, just host your site through a CDN and set your web app server as an origin server. Pages can be rendered on demand and then cached on a CDN. You will have to separate out your session stuff, though! And any dynamicall generated content will need to go under that.<p>Finally...

And all without changing HTML into a JSON or Yaml representation. It just works in VSCode. The number of years of HTML being an relative of the SGML&#x2F;XML family (pedants calm here, you know what I mean) shouldn&#x27;t be thrown away just because it&#x27;s not immediately available in JS.<p>I think one thing I would love to see from JSX is for it to start growing outside of the React world. Vue seems to be trying. Until React came along, we really had no compile time checking on templating languages at all. I think the reason for that, is, in part, because the templating aspect was always thought of as &quot;dirty&quot; that you shouldn&#x27;t mix JS and the view parts. I think React debunked that notion. I&#x27;ve never been as productive in creating UIs as I have when I&#x27;m working in React. And a lot of that is because I call my backend, I get a typed object back, I tell the UI to use &lt;div&gt;{response.medication.firstName}&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; and if we ever change the structure of medication? I get full help from the compiler that that view will no longer work... If you haven&#x27;t used React you might not get the full power of that.<p>Even if I am a React fan, it doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t think other frameworks won&#x27;t ever take over, but I think at this point, the one that may eventually eclipse React is probably going to have native JSX support."],"time":["2020-05-11 20:21:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neilv"],"id":[23144931],"kids":[23163019],"parent":[23142300],"text":["An early alternative would&#x27;ve been to use an integrated language for both HTML and JS features, like Curl, published in 1997:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curl_(programming_language)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curl_(programming_language)<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1504&#x2F;IJWET.2003.003259\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1504&#x2F;IJWET.2003.003259<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;cag&#x2F;curl&#x2F;wwwpaper.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;cag&#x2F;curl&#x2F;wwwpaper.html<\/a><p>(Disclosure: I worked at the Curl commercial spinoff.)<p>Or, many Lisp people just used s-expression data for HTML, and Lisp for everything else.

Notably in the reverse case, when you have unavoidable links between these layers (since no useful abstraction isn&#x27;t leaky), the benefits of expressing everything in one language are considerable (e.g. when refactoring)."],"time":["2020-05-11 18:37:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BenoitEssiambre"],"id":[23147781],"kids":{},"parent":[23142300],"text":["The section on templates should mention lit-html, the modern way of doing this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lit-html.polymer-project.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lit-html.polymer-project.org&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-12 00:17:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["one-punch"],"id":[23143345],"kids":[23143395],"parent":[23142300],"text":["Reminds me of the “Shakespearean Templates“ [1] from the Yesod web framework [2].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;developing-web-applications&#x2F;9781449336868&#x2F;ch04.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;developing-web-applicat...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yesodweb.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yesodweb.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>Copied below to save you a click:<p>Hamlet (HTML)<p><pre><code>    $doctype 5\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;#{pageTitle} - My Site\n            &lt;link rel=stylesheet href=@{Stylesheet}&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;h1 .page-title&gt;#{pageTitle}\n            &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of your friends:\n            $if null friends\n                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I lied, you don&#x27;t have any friends.\n            $else\n                &lt;ul&gt;\n                    $forall Friend name age &lt;- friends\n                        &lt;li&gt;#{name} (#{age} years old)\n            &lt;footer&gt;^{copyright}\n<\/code><\/pre>\nCassius (CSS)<p><pre><code>    #myid\n        color: #{red}\n        font-size: #{bodyFontSize}\n    foo bar baz\n        background-image: url(@{MyBackgroundR})\n<\/code><\/pre>\nLucius (CSS)<p><pre><code>    section.blog {\n        padding: 1em;\n        border: 1px solid #000;\n        h1 {\n            color: #{headingColor};\n        }\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nJulius (JavaScript)<p><pre><code>    $(function(){\n        $(&quot;section.#{sectionClass}&quot;).hide();\n        $(&quot;#mybutton&quot;).click(function(){document.location = &quot;@{SomeRouteR}&quot;;});\n        ^{addBling}\n    });\n<\/code><\/pre>\nFor those curious, the above is implemented in the metaprogramming framework of Template Haskell."],"time":["2020-05-11 17:44:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lisper"],"id":[23143873],"kids":[23146246],"parent":[23142300],"text":["This sort of thing is easy in Lisp:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edicl.github.io&#x2F;cl-who&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edicl.github.io&#x2F;cl-who&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-11 18:28:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anonytrary"],"id":[23150400],"kids":{},"parent":[23142300],"text":["&gt; I think it&#x27;s a fine enough solution, but the fact that it&#x27;s a different syntax from your standard js objects encourages people to consider the VDOM objects as &quot;not normal data&quot;, but they are.

Updates are the main reason why you want to treat HTML as structured, because you can&#x27;t map data changes to DOM changes without some knowledge of the underlying DOM structure.<p>Then there&#x27;s no mention of E4X (or the lesser-known E4H by Ian Hixie). We&#x27;ve had a proposed syntax, so what went wrong and why not revive it?<p>Again, updates. Creating the initial DOM state isn&#x27;t that bad. E4X is an incremental improvement over innerHTML. What matters is updates, and the main difference between JSX and E4X is that E4X created _new_ DOM for every invocation, while JSX is typically used to create a new _description_ of the DOM, which is applied to existing DOM to update it.<p>Any proposal for adding HTML syntax to JS is completely jumping the gun if it doesn&#x27;t address this point. The syntax matters way less than the semantics on what such markup expressions actually evaluate to and how that result is used to update the DOM.<p>THen, statements like this:<p>&gt; This is rubbish for obvious reasons - composing the strings is bug-prone, no typing&#x2F;linting etc etc. We then have to turn them into elements with the less than elegant:<p>don&#x27;t hold up.<p>lit-html[1] (I&#x27;m a maintainer) works very much like this and it excels at composition and turning markup into structured data. The complaint is very much in the vein of complaining about embedding a language into strings and saying that just programming with strings. Well, basically every programming language is just strings, with a defined grammar and tools that enforce and extract the structure. This is no different with embeddings, and JS tagged template literals were specifically designed to make embedded languages more useful.<p>lit-html uses the browsers HTML parser to parse the strings, enforcing that they&#x27;re well-formed. It creates HTML &lt;template&gt; elements that are efficiently cloned for new DOM, and it remembers where the dynamic expressions are in the DOM to efficiently update it on repeated renders. It interpolates data post-clone, so it&#x27;s robust against XSS. It has a plug-ins for VS Code, TypeScript, eslint, and more, for type-checking, highlighting code-completion, and linting of templates.<p>Which is just to say that string-based templates are a great option that _do_ allow for fast updates, type-checking, composition, and structure, with standard syntax available today.<p>Finally... there are a couple of recent proposals for JavaScript that affect this area. The records and tuples proposal might make it very efficient to describe DOM in object notation. The block parameters proposal[3], though probably defunct now, proposed adding something akin to Kotlin builders, which would have allowed for the attribute&#x2F;children structure we need for markup.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lit-html.polymer-project.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lit-html.polymer-project.org&#x2F;<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-record-tuple\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-record-tuple<\/a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samuelgoto&#x2F;proposal-block-params\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samuelgoto&#x2F;proposal-block-params<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-11 18:48:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Seb-C"],"id":[23150049],"kids":{},"parent":[23142300],"text":["I actually wish we had more advanced features in HTML itself.

A further three studies based on the data of about 200,000 individuals from 30 countries debunked these lay beliefs as illusionary by revealing that cynical (vs. less cynical) individuals generally do worse on cognitive ability and academic competency tasks. Cross-cultural analyses showed that competent individuals held contingent attitudes and endorsed cynicism only if it was warranted in a given sociocultural environment. Less competent individuals embraced cynicism unconditionally, suggesting that-at low levels of competence-holding a cynical worldview might represent an adaptive default strategy to avoid the potential costs of falling prey to others&#x27; cunning.<p>In toxic and mismanaged environments, being a cynic from the sidelines can be a better political strategy than being the positive person in the trenches trying to find solutions and compromises."],"time":["2020-05-11 03:24:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bonestormii_"],"id":[23138574],"kids":{},"parent":[23131350],"text":["I love this short post.

What unlocked it form me was realizing that FRACTRAN programs can be thought of as a list of chemical reactions that are tried sequentially, where if any succeed we start back at the first reaction.  Since fractions are reduced, there is an arbitrary constraint that the reactions have no <i>catalysts<\/i>, which are chemical species that are both reagents and products in the same reaction.  Also, unlike real chemistry, reactions don&#x27;t have to conserve mass&#x2F;energy.  (If you like, a FRACTRAN program is a list of rewrite rules in a commutative monoid, where a rule only applies if none of the previous can apply.)<p>With this in mind, you can write a program that takes two numbers, represented as the numbers of A and B species, and returns the sum as the number of C species like so:<p><pre><code>   A -&gt; C\n   B -&gt; C\n<\/code><\/pre>\nOr, how about multiplication instead?  We need some intermediate products U1, U2, and X to calculate this:<p><pre><code>   U1 + B -&gt; U2 + C + X\n   U2 -&gt; U1\n   U1 -&gt; 0\n   X -&gt; B\n   A -&gt; U1\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis does, roughly, &quot;for each A, take each B and add it to C.&quot;  Since adding something to something is destructive, it uses the X species to save the old value of B.  The presence of U1 or U2 indicates the program is in this addition loop.<p>There is something wonderfully simple about FRACTRAN as a model for computation.  Even Turing machines seem complicated in comparison.<p>By the way, Conway in his &quot;FRACTRAN: a simple universal programming language for arithmetic&quot; describes how to construct larger programs with control flow.  From the above point of view, you essentially add a new species like LINE100 to the left-hand side of each reaction and a corresponding LINE101 to the right-hand side.  In this case, the program would go from &quot;line 100&quot; to &quot;line 101.&quot;<p>---<p>While there is an obvious way to write an interpreter for FRACTRAN, on anything but the simplest of programs it will run absurdly slowly due to the fact that everything is done with unary arithmetic (in the exponents of the primes).  Is your input an ASCII-encoded string and you want to get the first character?  You&#x27;re going to need a loop that repeatedly subtracts 256 from the input to do modular reduction.  Good luck parsing anything substantial before the universe dies!<p>Someone figured out how to accelerate these sorts of loops.  It seems like it looks for constructs that add or subtract constants to the state variables, and then it skips over the intermediate steps and calculates their total effect.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pimlu.github.io&#x2F;fractran&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pimlu.github.io&#x2F;fractran&#x2F;<\/a>  (It looks like it was a term project, and they have a paper about it in the GitHub repository.)"],"time":["2020-05-11 20:15:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Matt3o12_"],"id":[23138815],"kids":[23139774,23139748,23138868,23139238,23139885,23138837],"parent":[23138532],"text":["&gt; “While others were facilitated by their embassies concerned and were taken for quarantine, officials from the German embassy informed the Indian bureau of immigration that Ziebat is a wanted criminal in their country with several cases of assault and other crimes registered against him.

A marketing website, a domain name, a cute logo for a vanity project masquerading as security research. Basically every one of the &quot;seven&quot; vulnerabilities boils down to &quot;if someone can flash the SPI of the thunderbolt controller then xxx&quot; but if they can flash the TB SPI, then they can also flash the BIOS SPI which has a lot of the same &quot;vulnerabilities&quot; but arguably is more impactful. The reason they only mentioned TB is because the BIOS stuff is well known and you can&#x27;t put your name on it.<p>Let&#x27;s break down each of the &quot;vulnerability&quot;.<p>1. &quot;However, we have found authenticity is not verified at boot time, upon connecting the device, or at any later point.&quot; This is actually false. Like, the author either didn&#x27;t experiment properly or is lying&#x2F;purposely misleading you. The firmware IS verified at boot for Alpine Ridge and Titan Ridge (Intel&#x27;s TB3 controllers). They aren&#x27;t for older controllers which does NOT support TB3. When verification fails, the controller falls back into a &quot;safe mode&quot; which does NOT run the firmware code for any of the ARC processors in the Ridge controller (there are a handful of processors where the firmware contains compressed code for). I&#x27;m willing to bet the author did not manage to reverse engineer the proprietary Huffman compression the firmware uses and therefore couldn&#x27;t have loaded their own firmware. Because if they did, it wouldn&#x27;t have worked. Now the RSA signature verification scheme they use to verify the firmware does suffer from some weaknesses but afaik doesn&#x27;t lead to arbitrary code execution (on any of the Ridge ARC processors). I would love to be proven wrong here with real evidence though ;)<p>2. Basically the string identifiers inside the firmware isn&#x27;t signed&#x2F;verified. This has no security implications beyond you can spoof identifiers and make the string &quot;pwned&quot; appear in system details when you plug the device in and authenticate it. Basically if you&#x27;ve ever developed custom USB devices you can see how silly this is as a &quot;vulnerability.&quot;<p>3. This is literally the same as #2.<p>4. Yes, TB2 is vulnerable to many DMA attacks as demonstrated in the past. Yes, TB3 has a TB2 compatibility mode. Yes, that means the same vulnerabilities exist in compatibility mode which is why you can disable it.<p>5. This one is technically true. If you open the case up, and flash the SPI chip containing the TB3 firmware, you can patch the security level set in BIOS and do stuff like re-enable TB2 if the user disabled it. But if I were the attacker, I would instead look at the SPI chip right next to it containing the UEFI firmware and NVRAM variables (most of which aren&#x27;t signed&#x2F;encryption in any modern PC).<p>6. SPI chips have interfaces for writing, erasing, and locking. If you have direct access to the chip you can abuse these pins to permanently brick the device. Here&#x27;s another way: take your screwdriver and jam it into the computer.<p>7. Apple does not enable TB3 security features on Boot Camp. I guess this one is vaguely the only real &quot;vulnerability&quot; although it&#x27;s well known and Apple doesn&#x27;t care much about Windows security anyways (they don&#x27;t enable Intel Boot Guard or BIOS Guard or TPM or any other Intel&#x2F;Microsoft security feature).<p>Not that it matters but my personal experience with TB3 is that I&#x27;ve done significant reverse engineering of the Ridge controllers for the Hackintosh community."],"time":["2020-05-11 05:22:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justaguyonline"],"id":[23138261],"kids":[23139006,23138376,23138778],"parent":[23137979],"text":["What would it take to have a Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB C condom?

Kalinske claims the Japanese president of Sega, Hayao Nakayama, forced him to launch the Saturn in NA before Kalinske was ready, and because of that, the Saturn failed and Kalinske resigned shortly after. As always, it&#x27;s best to approach with caution when CEOs are assigning blame for company failures under their tenure.<p>The reality is far, far more complicated. Kalinske himself was against the Saturn going back to 1993, due to the predicted high cost of the console. This in turn led to the development of the 32X add-on for the Genesis as a low-cost entry into the 32-bit generation in NA, but the 32X failed spectacularly.<p>Most relevant, however, is that Sega failed to adequately compete against Sony in terms of garnering third-party support, both in Japan and NA. This is discussed at length in the excellent book Revolutionaries at Sony by Reiji Asakura (English translation available). The Saturn was difficult to develop for and Sega did not have good development tools early on.<p>Also worth reading is the recent account from former Sega president Hideki Sato, who was the head designer of the Saturn.

Here are some of the reasons I love them so much:<p>- The most popular motivation: the ability to write proofs about your programs, using the same language for both programming and proving. It&#x27;s so satisfying to write code and prove it correct (with a type checker to catch your mistakes), but so few people get to experience this feeling.<p>- Of course, you can also use dependent types to just write proofs for the purpose of doing mathematics, without any programming. I&#x27;ve written about my experience doing that here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephanboyer.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;134&#x2F;my-hobby-proof-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephanboyer.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;134&#x2F;my-hobby-proof-enginee...<\/a><p>- But dependent types are also useful in ordinary everyday programming! Many &quot;features&quot; of programming languages that we use at work are actually just limited special cases of the general idea of dependent types. For example, in a dependently typed language, you don&#x27;t need special support for generics—you get it for free!<p>- Dependent types also eliminate much of the need for macros. In Rust, for example, you might use a macro to generate a JSON parser for a given type. If you had dependent types, you could just write a function that takes your type as an argument and returns the parser!<p>- Of course, there&#x27;s that famous example of length-indexed vectors. The idea is that you can keep track of the sizes of your arrays in their types, and statically prevent out-of-bounds errors. So, for example, trying to get the first element of an empty array would be a type error.<p>- Haskell&#x27;s generalized algebraic datatypes are another example of a limited special case of the full power you&#x27;d get from a dependently typed programming language.<p>- Another example: some languages have special support for existential types in some form or another. For example, Rust has  something called &quot;impl Trait&quot; which is a limited use of existential types. This is another thing you get for free with dependent types (or rank-2 polymorphism).<p>- Other examples of things you get for free with dependent types: type aliases, higher-kinded types, higher-rank types, and compile-time code execution.<p>Dependent types may seem complicated at first glance. But after seeing how all these programming language features collapse into a single unified framework, you might change your mind: dependent types are extremely simple compared to the cornucopia of concepts we have to learn in their absence! I strongly believe that programming languages have grown too complex, and dependent types have the right power-to-weight ratio to cull that complexity."],"time":["2020-05-11 13:23:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["auggierose"],"id":[23142119],"kids":{},"parent":[23139972],"text":["If you want to read a somewhat longer treatise about dependent types and language, try the book &quot;Modal Homotopy Type Theory&quot;.

It must be nice to wax about theoretical problems and theoretical solutions when one thinks he is secure about where his or her check is coming from.<p>Let me tell you about what is happening in New York. On Saturday I saw a line three blocks long. Not tiny blocks. New York sized long blocks. That was a line filled with mostly blacks and latinos, some with children. It was barely moving. At the end of the line there was national guard giving out small shopping bags on onions, carrots and potatoes. Based on me timing it I estimate it took ~3 hours for someone joining at the end of the line to get what is, objectively, $10 worth of vegetables if bought in one of the supermarkets targeting poor Hispanic community. The only reason why they are standing in that line for three hours is because that $10 to them is money. Oh and if your state unemployment claim is &quot;pending&quot; then you do not get the fed $600&#x2F;week unemployment either.<p>There&#x27;s a very popular Bar&#x2F;restaurant in Bushwick ran by a great but rather odd dude. 191 Knickerbocker. I guess he is relatively well off or he is good enterprising guy who manages to raise a lot of money. It provides free meals a couple of times a week. No questions asked. They are not much but they would certainly get you through the day. It has a half a block long line, split relatively evenly between latinos and whites. Initially the latter group did not want to be seen in the line, hiding their faces when others whom they thought were in the same socio-economic demographics went by. Occasionally you would see people crying. By now they don&#x27;t care -- just avoid eye contact.<p>About a week ago on Saturday one of the chefy driven relief trucks showed up. The went around the <i>entire block<\/i> by the middle of the day. When the people got there, they got two small paper bags of vegetables. The lines was mostly latinos. From talking to a couple of people who were volunteering they estimated about 4 hour wait between the time one joined the line and the time to get those bags.<p>My wife, who worked a white collar medicine related field was laid off and filed for unemployment in mid-march. Her unemployment claim is still pending. She&#x27;s not alone. There are people who lost their jobs around beginning of March who are in the same boat. The NYS unemployment system does not have real time status. It does not have messaging. Its call system does not support queuing! People redial hundreds of times a day through the maze of prompts just to be disconnected because there are too many people calling.  She legitimately lost it a couple of times. If I was not still making money, we would have been eating through the savings to cover rent.  We rent our apartment from a family who lives in the same building. Both of them have been laid off. Neither of them have been able to get unemployment -- their claims are &quot;pending&quot;. Every week they look more and more terrified as the only thing that lets them to put food on a table is me paying rent. And there&#x27;s an eviction moratorium now until August, which means I can , at the cost of ruining a relationship with the landlord to whom I&#x27;m paying market rent, stop paying them. Oh and NYS unemployment fund is running out of money.<p>Last week the first of my wife&#x27;s friends who used to only worry about when they would be able to go out to do &quot;girl&#x27;s brunch&quot; have been laid off.  The laid off person is shell shocked. At the end of April their company was absolutely convinced there were no layoffs coming.<p>We are only in the first act.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as easy as startup-vs-big-corp.<p>Second, it depends a lot on what excites you. One way I&#x27;ve heard it expressed is &quot;Starters&quot; vs. &quot;Finishers.&quot; Some people love turning an idea into reality, but lack the patience to polish the experience. Some people prefer the polish work to starting with a blank slate. It helps to know if you are one or the other (or neither). In start-ups, you spend a lot more time in zero-to-reality rather than reality-to-polish mode. In big companies, it depends on what team&#x2F;project you&#x27;re on.<p>Sometimes, excitement levels increase by spending some time away from a task. If, for example, you schedule all your meetings on Wednesday, it will mean you&#x27;ve been away from any project work for 24 hours by the time you look at it on Thursday, potentially with a fresh set of eyes.<p>There&#x27;s probably a lot of other factors at play in what makes someone excited for work.

You do not have an assigned desk and are not allowed to sit at a certain desk for more than 2 hours. (Yes, many&#x2F;most of us think this is the height of stupidity - it&#x27;s like being back in college and everyone is working in the library and you have to have a backpack to carry all your stuff from place to place). Of course, this whole seating arrangement is a nightmare in a social distancing situation. What they are saying now is that when we go back you can sit at a desk the whole day, but every other desk must be empty. So, intead of having enough desks for 50-75% of people, there will only be enough for 25-37.5% of people.

The pandemic and the world wide panicked response to it is merely accelerating the trend. However, it&#x27;s a logical trend and many of us were already dealing with remote teams for a few years.<p>IMHO many people will actually revert back to their old behaviors for the simple reason that offices are still there and as restrictions lift in the next weeks there will be lots of pressure to show up on people.<p>What will take longer is changing processes to facilitate working remotely. Many smarter companies are probably looking to make this a permanent thing in their companies; because it makes sense and it undeniably can work. For developers it&#x27;s easy, just do what the OSS folk are doing for the last decades; it works. And the stuff they were doing instead always was in any case a bit challenged in terms of actually working as advertised.<p>However, the rest of the world will need a bit longer to discover how to work asynchronously.<p>Also there&#x27;s the notion that a lot of work is actually completely redundant and pointless. Big corporations are just as bad about generating bureaucracy as governments are. Fat profits can cover up a lot of bad management. A cynical reason for remote work not being much of a disruption is that lots of people weren&#x27;t actually doing anything important anyway. So, them doing a poor job of something that never mattered to begin with is completely OK. Of course the next logical step is getting smarter about eliminating such jobs. A curious thing in today&#x27;s economy is that this does not seem to happen nearly as often as you&#x27;d expect. Rather the opposite and people self congratulate each other to ever more surreal levels of dysfunctional behavior.<p>In any case, seeing a productivity boost if you eliminate 1-2 hour (twice per day) commutes at stupid o&#x27;clock from people&#x27;s life should not come as a surprise.
