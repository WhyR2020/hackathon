While potential competitive advantage is one reason to pursue research and development, taxes and the interplay between tax and corporate accounting are another reason (even prior to 1981).<p>While taxes paid by corporations benefit the general public, from the corporation’s point of view taxes are money out the door with zero possible return.  So what does a prudent corporation do with its profits?  It recognizes that they are potential capital and seeks to maximize the risk-adjusted return on capital.<p>It can bank them at the risk-free rate of return, but we should remember taxes will take a healthy chunk out of that return on the front end.  It can pay them out to investors as dividends (increasing the return on remaining capital by reducing the denominator).  Note that under rational tax schemes the risk adjusted return on capital should be equivalent to investing at the risk free rate of return (modulo management of cash-flow risks).  It can buy riskier assets with higher return, such as other companies.  And it can make much riskier investments, like research and development.  As with most things financial, the best overall risk adjusted return on capital is diverse in both kind and in risk level.  It should do all of those things (treating dividends as equivalent to investment at the risk free rate of return), with the proportion going to each tuned to achieve the aggregate optimum(1).  Also, can you see how a regulated utility with(like AT&amp;T of old) would find R&amp;D attractive for spicing up its asset mix?<p>Think of R&amp;D as producing a stream of lottery tickets with the drawing in the distant future.  Those lottery tickets (for a tech company) can pay off in two ways.  One is that they could produce or enhance a revenue stream.  The other is that they could reduce risk in the form of patents (reduce competitive risk and risk of patent suits by threat of countersuit).  Both of these payoffs improve risk adjusted return on capital (by generating return or reducing risk).  The neat thing about R&amp;D for a company that’s paying real taxes is that much of the cost is (from a tax point of view) is an expense.  In other words, that allocation of capital doesn’t have the upfront bite taken out of it that occurs when profits are directed to risk free assets. Looking at this from a risk-adjusted return point of view, having a real tax burden increases the appetite for risk by decreasing the relative attractiveness of the risk-free alternative after taxes.  This is doubly true for expenditures that look like expenses to tax collectors but look like capital investment for corporate accounting purposes.<p>None of this holds true if a company isn’t paying much in the way of taxes on its profits.  It doesn’t mean some amount of R&amp;D isn’t still attractive, but the appetite for risk is lower.  And let’s be clear, R&amp;D in research labs is the riskiest kind of R&amp;D.<p>Well, you might say, the 1981 R&amp;D tax credit is sweeter than a deduction.  Doesn’t that tilt the scales back?  Yes, but subject to the limitations of the tax credit (which are numerous).  But, like the deduction, the tax credit is much less valuable for companies that aren’t paying taxes on their profits.  And, to be clear, this is a Reagan measure taken with full knowledge of what was expected to happen to corporate tax rates and the impact that might have on R&amp;D investment.  It’s a partial mitigant for that, nothing more.<p>I am fully aware that I have murdered both CAPM and the practice of accounting in compressing this down to a reasonable post with what I hope is a clear narrative.  My apologies to practitioners of both.<p>(1) An important aside: People make equity investments to take more risk in the expectation of higher return.  Beyond the cash cushion necessary for minimizing cash-flow risk, massive cash hoards do nothing but dilute the risk (and return) rational investors are actively seeking to take.  There is some argument to be made that large tech companies keep huge cash hoards because their core businesses are riskier than they appear (esp black swan events), but it probably has more to do with founders desire for independence."],"time":["2020-08-19 00:49:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["totesraunch"],"id":[24205142],"kids":[24207439,24209608],"parent":[24200764],"text":["This is Capitalism.

You lost me when you said i have to train models? Are you assuming that software developers want to train machine learning models to do something as simple as creating some test data? In reality - I reach for tools that make things easier for me, which includes not having to read a ton of documentation, download new external tools, and things that &#x27;just work&#x27;.<p>It is 100% easier for me to export a little production data to test on (and maybe sanitize), or to write a small script to generate a few users and those things I need to test.  Plus - then I know exactly what I&#x27;m going to get. A lot of times, after I&#x27;ve done this once, it will work for a good while as well - if I do change the schema, I can add some additional data for that column, and go from there, or otherwise.<p>For those companies who have &#x27;messy&#x27; fixture data - is the <i>tool<\/i> the issue? My take is that the difficulty with maintaining the data could contribute to this issue, but is also more an issue of simply bad housekeeping - e.g. rushing and not tending the garden. While your system might handle this, your system also seems to require a different skillset (e.g. specific training&#x2F;knowledge) than the standard QA developer might have.<p>If I did use it, i&#x27;d prefer it to be much easier to use - if I could include a ruby gem, and incorporte it into the testing progress, e.g. an &#x27;after&#x27; hook after migrating the db, that would be ideal.

Make no mistake, the latter course remains very, very possible. At their peaks, no one would have believed this fate would take Common Lisp, Ada, Oberon or Pascal. Each had a vigorous ecosystem and numerous devoted users and implementers. Each still has devotees in its obscurity, but each&#x27;s present obscurity is undeniable.<p>These truths must be voiced, and acted on, if Rust is not to share the fate of those once equally-vigorous languages.<p>The first uncomfortable  truth is that the numbers <i>matter<\/i>. It is not enough, for a language to succeed, to gain new users, trying out the language, at a satisfying rate. They must also remain users, and must find, before they give up, that early difficulties adjusting fade. They must find the language better, on <i>all<\/i> the axes that really matter, for the problems they face, than what they have used before. Hard as it may be for it fans to believe, this is not the universal experience. Rust is stronger on some axes than the languages people come to it from, and weaker on others. It must become strong on all.<p>The borrow checker, as it is implemented, ultimately turns away too many new users before they achieve proficiency, and burdens exploratory designs when they are least ready to carry it. The slowness of builds is an enduring impediment to production use that will not continue to be excused. The NPM-like ease of falling into unwise dependency on abandoned library components, and the permanence of unfairly-claimed names in the repository, are traps that lead to troubling experiences. Scrupulous users will identify other problems.<p>To achieve maturity is not the norm, for any language. It is, it must be repeated, a game of numbers. A large-enough number of people must be motivated to try it. A large-enough subset of those must find enough to like to motivate them to continue learning. Enough of <i>them<\/i> must stay long enough to learn enough to do their regular work in the language. And, enough of those still on board must find a place where they can actually do their work in the language. If any of these <i>numbers<\/i> is not large enough, for long enough, the language will unavoidably fade into obscurity, deserved or not.<p>As popular as Rust already is in some pockets of the wide internet, these numbers are not now large enough for Rust to endure and not fade. The window during which its newness and trendiness are enough, on their own, to motivate people to try it is rapidly closing.<p>While nothing can guarantee success, many things can guarantee failure. One of the latter would be not to change what keeps the numbers down. Needed changes will be unpopular with self-selected early adopters who overcame difficulties and have little contact with those who did not, and left; but change is necessary.<p>The first and most uncomfortable change needed is to make the borrow checker less draconian. Allow beginners to know how many violations they have, yet run. A running and useful program motivates improvement at every level, ultimately including rigor. Dead code benefits no one, howsoever clean it is.<p>Beginners exploring the language need early, even if partial, successes. Everyone exploring the design of a new program has far more urgent concerns than borrow rigor. Those can always be returned to, in time, and will be if they remain visible. Allow libraries with violations to be used, and even to be shared, unguarded by &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks; still noting, in each build, how many violations remain.<p>Rust&#x27;s reason for being invented was to displace unsafe languages from use where they are most harmful, most particularly C. In this it is, however resolutely, failing. The C users who remain have seen many, many languages rise to popularity and fade away, and have resisted all temptation. They are self-selected to continue resisting temptation. Most remaining C users love it for its faults. They are proud to overcome C&#x27;s faults, individually, without help.<p>Most former C users who might have jumped already did. Many jumped to C++. Coding C++98 is enough like coding C that the merits of Rust, particularly its modernity and its initial simplicity, had appeal. But Rust has become complicated, and C++ has evolved, through C++11, C++14, C++17, now C++20, soon 23, and 26. Coding C++20 is little like coding C++98; 98&#x27;s temptations to unsafety do not appeal.<p>Furthermore, C++ is and will remain a much stronger language than Rust for capturing semantics in libraries. Moving to Rust means a dizzying step down in expressive power, both in ability to capture semantics in libraries and to use the uniquely powerful libraries it has enabled. While such power is needed in a minority of applications, it is needed badly there. C++ is not being displaced by Rust.<p>New Rust users are coming, predominantly, from other languages instead, notably Java and Go, and scripting languages. Rust is an overwhelmingly better design than the first two, and runs overwhelmingly faster than the others. But its safety, when borrow-clean, does not distinguish it from them. The appeal of safety is not what wins the users it gains today.<p>Rust wins users from these languages by being a better experience. The borrow checker is just tolerated, in exchange for the language&#x27;s modern and substantially more powerful design, including its Drop trait that enables programmed control of resources, its default const and default pass-by-move semantics, and the careful, comprehensive and coherent design of its built-in and core library types.<p>If Rust succeeds and does not fade, it will be by playing to these strengths among current users of these other languages, but moreso by resolving its weaknesses. The painfully slow compiler can and must be replaced, if it cannot be fixed. The library ecosystem must be made a strength, not a cause of weakness and fragile dependency. And the borrow checker must become an aid to rigor, not a gauntlet for beginners to suffer and, too often, fall to.<p>Rust&#x27;s future will be assured only when more complain of its flaws than boast of its successes."],"time":["2020-08-18 20:06:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nickx720"],"id":[24200392],"kids":{},"parent":[24199424],"text":["Great news :)"],"time":["2020-08-18 18:07:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blargmaster33"],"id":[24200961],"kids":{},"parent":[24199424],"text":["More SJW?"],"time":["2020-08-18 18:47:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["mseepgood"],"id":[24200527],"kids":[24200956,24200985,24201334,24200703,24200774],"parent":[24199424],"text":["&gt; in the middle of a global pandemic<p>&quot;global pandemic&quot; is a pleonasm."],"time":["2020-08-18 18:15:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["whynotwhynot"],"id":[24201997],"kids":[24204078,24203322],"parent":[24199424],"text":["I tried getting into Rust, but found its ownership model to be a bit too cumbersome (for me, maybe not for you.)<p>I&#x27;m playing with various PLs designed for safe concurrency, including this one called Pony:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24201754\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24201754<\/a><p>Hopefully not off topic, as both Rust and Pony share a similar agenda."],"time":["2020-08-18 20:03:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bzb4"],"id":[24200020],"kids":{},"parent":[24199424],"text":["What I want to see is a Firefox foundation."],"time":["2020-08-18 17:41:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajross"],"id":[24199819],"kids":[24199904,24199892,24199907,24199879],"parent":[24199424],"text":["Does it seem tone-deaf to anyone else that this blog post is clearly written from the perspective of and to be interpreted as the opinion of the Mozilla project leadership and not the &quot;Rust Project&quot;?<p>I mean, if there&#x27;s any time where you want to be clear about the distinction it would be now, right?

But, of course, we do discuss the computational aspect (i.e. the Gauss algorithm) because this is exactly what makes linear algebra so useful: many questions can be answered extremely efficiently.<p>Whether you want to frame things in the language of category theory or not, is up to anyone, but the &quot;standard mathematical treatment&quot; is quite beautiful and intriguing already (if I want to feel inspired, I open up my copy of Halmos&#x27;s &quot;Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces&quot;, not necessarily the best introduction for someone who is new, but very beautifully written for someone who has already seen linear algebra)."],"time":["2020-08-18 13:47:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["CharlesMerriam2"],"id":[24196330],"kids":[24196642,24196768],"parent":[24196080],"text":["Meh.

The term is usually translated as “visualize” instead of imagine, although we’re not just dealing with some visual picture of ourselves. I think the word “imagine” is great because we imagine that we really are a Buddha in the form of this figure. Not only do we imagine looking like this figure, but we also imagine speaking, thinking, helping others and experiencing pure enjoyment with all our senses like it does. We also imagine having all its good qualities, such as equal love and compassion for all beings and deep understanding of everything. Of course, to do this successfully we need to have trained beforehand in each of these qualities with sutra practice. Putting them all together with deity-yoga, then, is like a dress rehearsal for actually being a Buddha. By rehearsing now, we build up powerful causes for attaining enlightenment.

It&#x27;s a tool that helps you bring offline files, such as CSV, Excel, and JSON files, into Postgres database. You can also process your data before uploading it using a spreadsheet-like interface or by writing a custom Python script. Once your data is in the database, you can query it using any third party tool (credentials will be provided). You can also access your data via REST API (powered by PostgREST) or create custom endpoints to serve a more specific use case.<p>A bit about the tech:<p>Currently, we support .csv, .json, .xls, .xlsx files. For data processing, we use Pandas, so if you are comfortable using Python, you can write your own custom functions to process the data. We also give you a free shared Postgres database to test the tool with (your data is isolated and hidden from others). Each one of these databases come with an instance of PostgREST preinstalled, so you can query your database using REST API ([<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7....<\/a>).

Somehow most of a century later, the intelligentsia persists in claiming that views such as these (i.e. those also of Dawkins et al.) are somehow &quot;childish&quot; or &quot;culturally illiterate&quot;.<p><i>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can&#x27;t for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-08-19 01:26:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["OneGuy123"],"id":[24205428],"kids":{},"parent":[24196417],"text":["His father caused his &quot;lack of desire to speak&quot; by beating him for each speaking error while he was a child.<p>Dirac solved this error as best as a child could: by not speaking.

In this game, you have different stats and you must increase each stat. For example, in a typical game you may have:<p>- Health\n- Attack Level\n- Money\n- Magic Level<p>In games, you try to increase each of these stats to create the best and strongest character. Life is very similar, but the stats are:<p>- Work\n- Social Life\n- Money\n- Fun\n- Relationship\n- Family\n- Sleep\n- Exercise\n- Relaxation<p>If all you do is spent all your time on Work, all the other stats will be lacking and ultimately you will have a weak character. Your work may be at 99&#x2F;100, but your Sleep may be 20&#x2F;100, or your relationship&#x2F;family may be 40&#x2F;100. So, the way I switch off work is that at 1:00PM I take 1 hour off of work (no matter what.) and I do not feel bad about it because it is ultimately increasing my Relaxation&#x2F;Fun stat. At 5:30PM, I stop work entirely to focus on everything else in life such as Fun, Relationships, Family, Exercise, Social Life.<p>I find it very strange how well this model works for me.

Here are some general tips.<p>* Keep them separated. Never have work on your personal devices. Have a work phone and a personal phone. Have a work computer and a personal computer.<p>* Have a place to work. My SO and I have a dedicated office. If you don&#x27;t have one, make a space somewhere that you can work at and work there consistently.<p>* Keep a schedule. This is tough. I&#x27;m several TZ away, so sometimes there are meetings at 9pm my time.  I generally get a pass on those. But if I have to attend, I make up the time somewhere the rest of the week. I&#x27;ll use that time to bank, clean, errands, etc. Generally, though, I can stay 8-5.  I love having nearly half my day all to myself to do thought work before anyone else starts working.<p>* Have a daily transition plan. This allows you to transition into work and transition out of work. I usually leave an open task for me to start first thing in the morning. That helps me transition into my work day. For transitioning out, I am the chef of the family, so at 5 I start prepping the kitchen.<p>* Set boundaries. Don&#x27;t let people expect you to be accessible all the time. During specified work hours, yes. But not all the time.  Also, set boundaries with family. They&#x27;re not allowed to take advantage of the fact that you work from home by asking you to run all the errands, do the laundry, make the calls, etc. This isn&#x27;t a problem I have ever had, but some people I know do have it and well, it makes for stress and nobody needs more of that."],"time":["2020-08-18 20:02:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hotgeart"],"id":[24196728],"kids":[24197367],"parent":[24196433],"text":["I&#x27;ve two PCs (one work and one personnal).<p>At 5PM my work day is over and I go for a walk (4-5 km).

So your work items all go in a tub that gets closed and put out of sight during the evening.<p>Keeping the work space clear of non-work related items, clean, and tidy. If you&#x27;re constantly looking at a half-finished Lego model, or electronics project, etc, during work then you are getting distracted. Clear your desk of distractions.

You&#x27;ll probably note a theme of &quot;boundaries&quot;.  This isn&#x27;t all that different conceptually from setting healthy boundaries in order to maintain a work&#x2F;life balance in normal office-going times, but some of the specifics can change when you&#x27;re working and living in the same space.<p>* Have a separate computer for work and personal stuff.  Don&#x27;t have your work email&#x2F;Slack&#x2F;whatever signed in and loaded on your personal computer.<p>* Delete work apps&#x2F;accounts (Slack, work email) from your phone.  Especially now since you&#x27;re home nearly all the time, you don&#x27;t need them on your phone anyway.  If you&#x27;re signed into any web apps on your phone, sign out of them.<p>* Set yourself time limits.  You work between X:00 and Y:00 every day.  When Y:00 comes, you shut down the work computer and do something else.  If this is too inflexible, set yourself a 30-60 minute range, and when you hit the beginning of that range -- set an alarm if you need it -- be mindful of what you&#x27;re working on and make sure you can wind it down by the end of the time period.  You can also try to schedule phone&#x2F;video calls or other socially-distant activities for right around your stop time to force you to stop and get into another mindset.<p>* When work is done, put everything work-related away.  If you tend to keep paper notes or use a whiteboard, find a place to put them so you can&#x27;t see them.<p>* When you stop working, go outside and go for a walk.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be long; just 30 or even 15 minutes is fine.  Don&#x27;t be on your phone while you walk.  Just walk around outside and take in the atmosphere.  (Obviously if you are in a COVID-vulnerable group, be careful, and don&#x27;t go out if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable with it.)<p>* Wear different clothes when you&#x27;re working vs. not.<p>* I get that you have a relatively small space overall, but if you can keep a consistent work area (that you don&#x27;t generally use for other non-work things all that much), try to keep to your workspace while working, and keep out of it while not working.<p>* In your free time, adopt activities that occupy your mind.  Whether that&#x27;s reading a book, learning a language, or whatever, it&#x27;s up to you.  Mindless web browsing will make it easy for your brain to drift back to work, but if you&#x27;re doing something mentally engaging, it&#x27;s more likely work thoughts won&#x27;t intrude."],"time":["2020-08-18 22:57:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["apapli"],"id":[24196825],"kids":{},"parent":[24196433],"text":["Put on an old James Bond movie from the 60s and let my mind slow down a bit once I’ve done all my family and household duties.<p>Or fire up flight simulator 2020, which has just been released and explore some amazing place from the air."],"time":["2020-08-18 11:42:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ringe"],"id":[24203282],"kids":{},"parent":[24196433],"text":["Ah,I replace the siding of the house, after adding more insulation.

Perhaps these are smarter than home clothes. Maybe a light shirt or collared t-shirt with some trousers. Wear the same as if you were meeting your boss (or their boss!).

Which makes many suspect widespread overconfidence in claims about what we know can’t be there, because if so we would have seen them already.&quot;<\/i><p>Hanson here appears to be backing up his claim with three hyperlinks. One thing that troubles me about rationalist-affiliated writing is that it tends to rest on what <i>looks<\/i>, at first glance, like a decent evidence base, but this evidence often breaks down under a little scrutiny. \nFor example:<p>• Hanson&#x27;s first link is to a recent <i>National Geographic<\/i> article that summarizes an archaeology finding from Bronze Age China. The summary is, IMO, misleading in one key respect. It calls the find &quot;astonishing&quot; because &quot;parts&quot; of the site &quot;date back 4,300 years, nearly 2,000 years before the oldest section of the Great Wall—and 500 years before Chinese civilization took root on the Central Plains.&quot; The Great Wall reference is a non sequitur: it&#x27;s a bit like saying that a find from the Old Kingdom of Egypt is astonishing because it dates back to two thousand years before the building of a Roman aqueduct. There&#x27;s no real connection, and it&#x27;s not at all news that agricultural civilizations existed in China circa 2300 BCE. Whether we want to call these societies &quot;Chinese civilization&quot; or not is debatable. But this finding, while really interesting and cool, is very different from what Hanson seems to be reading it as -- which is to say, as evidence for the belief that future discoveries might yield signs of &quot;advanced civilizations&quot; which <i>far predate<\/i> the Bronze Age as it&#x27;s currently imagined. After all, in 2300 BCE, written records and urbanized societies already existed in a fairly large swathe of Eurasia.<p>• His second link is simply to the Wikipedia page for Göbekli Tepe. Which is a totally fascinating site, I agree. It certainly does have unique features, such as the megalithic carvings. But again, it is <i>not<\/i> evidence of an entirely unknown &quot;advanced&quot; civilization; instead, the people who built Göbekli Tepe clearly fit into the existing archaeological record relating to the Neolithic Near East. We&#x27;ve known for some time that early agricultural societies were emerging in the fertile crescent around the same time as this site. What&#x27;s fascinating about this site is that it appears to predate agriculture in the region. However, it <i>is<\/i> thought to fit into a transitional stage (&quot;Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on Karaca Dag 30 km [20 mi] away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated&quot;). So again, IMO this has nothing to do with his claim about &quot;lost&quot; civilizations which don&#x27;t fit into our existing chronology.<p>• The final link is to a <i>Nature<\/i> write-up from two years ago relating to a contested claim about when humans arrived in the Americas. Again, this has nothing to do with evidence for an &quot;advanced civilization&quot; that has previously not been discovered.<p>All three of these links reference really interesting and important work which I very much hope continues to be funded and elaborated on. I&#x27;m convinced that there are incredible mysteries in store in the future, especially in the field of underwater archaeology. Yet to my reading, none of these reports relate to phenomena that scholars &quot;confidently predicted would never be found.&quot; Any archaeologist or historian with a sense of humility will gladly admit that there are a huge number of unknowns in the historical record. None of this can be leveraged as a basis for the existence of &quot;lost advanced civilizations&quot; (by which he appears to mean agricultural or otherwise technologically-advanced civilization that far predate the Agricultural Revolution as its currently understood, and which were forgotten after some kind of hypothetical period of decline).<p>For that, you need what Hanson waves away: actual archaeological or historical evidence."],"time":["2020-08-18 22:34:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baddox"],"id":[24204036],"kids":[24206777],"parent":[24202308],"text":["&gt; Here the key question here is: what sort of things should you expect to have already seen, if they were really there?

Kotlin was designed in 2009-10, in the Java 7 days, around the time of the Oracle acquisition, and at a time of stagnation for Java due to Sun&#x27;s decline. At the time, Android was also quite similar to Java. Kotlin was a great design in those conditions. Things are very different today.<p>Kotlin&#x27;s design goals are now contradictory. It seeks to be a low-overhead language, i.e. provide abstractions that don&#x27;t add overhead over the target platform, give access to all platform capabilities, and at the same time target multiple platforms -- Java, Android, LLVM and JS -- over <i>none of which<\/i> does Kotlin exert much influence (maybe a bit on Android). Since 2010, Java has moved away from Android, to the point that there are very big gaps between the two, and they&#x27;re only growing.<p>By both trying to target multiple platforms (with no say in their design) and trying to add little or no overhead, Kotlin will soon find itself in a bind. It&#x27;s coroutines are in conflict with Java&#x27;s upcoming virtual thread&#x27;s design, and its inline classes will cause problems with Java&#x27;s Valhalla vs. Android. Kotlin will have to choose to either give up on low-overhead abstractions, give up on some of its platforms, give up on giving access to full platform capabilities, or split into multiple languages, each targeting a different platform. For example, if Kotlin&#x27;s inline types will make use of Valhalla, then they won&#x27;t work on Android, at least not without much overhead.<p>TL;DR: A full-capability, low-overhead, multi-platform language is hard to pull off in the long run when you have low market share on all of those platforms (except Android) and little or no influence on any of them.

Kotlin, in my opinion, is a better Java. It does a pretty good job of providing a nice syntax for it, and these benefits are the first things that are explained in beginners tutorials to Kotlin.<p>But, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything new. There are so many things it could do to fix long-standing problems with Java, which Jetbrains refuse to implement due to the fact that the implementation will not be natural to the JVM.<p>An obvious example is generic functions, or multimethods. This was discussed on the forums, but quickly dismissed with one of the main reasons being that it would have to introduce a new dispatch mechanism and so wouldn&#x27;t be natural on the JVM. This argument has been made to dismiss many suggested features.<p>Another reason Jetbrains uses dismiss suggestions is that the new feature would make the language more complicated and difficult to learn. The refusal to implement some kind of macro facility falls into this category.<p>At the same time, this position leads to truly bizarre language behaviour such as the strange behaviour where declaring a function inline changes the semantics of the code.<p>This insistence that the JVM dictate the features makes even less sense since they also have native as well as JS code generators.<p>The only unique Kotlin feature that I can think of which is not a result of the JVM is their support for suspending functions, which is used to implement their async framework. The problem here is that it semantics can be really confusing, and can in fact lead to deadlocks if you have a library the needs to be exposed to Java which internally is implemented using suspending functions. If these functions are then called by Kotlin code which itself use suspending functions, you can end up with really strange behaviour."],"time":["2020-08-19 13:14:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mancini0"],"id":[24199008],"kids":{},"parent":[24196057],"text":["I love it.

There have been some deeply shameful moments... the researcher in another department who went out of her way to engage with me, until I mistook her for somebody else for an entire elevator ride. The student I ran into downtown who was hurt because his prof couldn&#x27;t recall basic details of his project - I literally did not know who he was on account of his bike helmet, despite having in him in class not even a day before.

Tech conferences are the worst.<p>Assuming we ever get to work in close quarters again, try guessing at the identity of your co-workers from behind. Almost always you&#x27;ll be positive whom you&#x27;re looking at. But not every time. For most people, it would be enough for the subject to turn around and provide a clear view of their face.

I only learned what to call it about 5 years ago. But it is not total and complete. I recognize faces when I see someone I know where I have seen them before. But if I see someone I know in a new location I have never seen them, I do not initially recognize them. But as soon as they speak to me, and I hear their voice, suddenly I recognize them. One of my earliest memories when I was in elementary school, first grade, is being with my mother at the Kmart. I was upset because I wanted to go home, and she had this long conversation with someone, seemed like almost an hour, which I found excrutiating. I did not know who she was talking to. When we left, I complained, &quot;who was that person?&quot; My mother gasped, &quot;catmistake! [not my real name] That was your homeroom teacher! You see her every morning in school!&quot; I could not believe it. I knew this woman well. I think I may have been in love with her. Just recently, in a gas station I see this guy shaking hands with someone else, not 6 feet away, full view. He looked interesting, but I didn&#x27;t know him until he walked up to me, &quot;hey catmistake.&quot; It was my friend that I was staying with for the previous two months, knew for 20 years, that I had just seen about a half hour before at his house. It is freaky, going from seeing someone as a complete stranger and then suddenly recognizing them. It is difficult to explain the transition. I had balance problems as a child, and fell down the hardwood stairs on my head nearly every day until I figured out how to lean back when stepping forward. So I think it is permanent brain damage causing it. Doesn&#x27;t get me down, but I have been abused for it, &quot;friends,&quot; that are aware of it, know when to expect it, and screwing with me.

For example, something that has been tripping us up lately is that our Twitter integration relies (partially) upon the official t.co link shortener[2], and yet, due to modern browser rules related to W3C Referrer Policy[3], the t.co link&#x27;s path segment is often not transmitted to the analytics provider, and thus the source tweet for traffic cannot be easily ascertained.<p>I firmly believe in privacy and analytics without compromise[4], so the team is trying to come up with ways to at least quantify shadow traffic at an aggregate level, and to ensure legitimate user privacy interests are honored, while making sure they don&#x27;t break legitimate privacy-safe first-party analytics use cases.<p>As a developer, something that concerned me recently was realizing that Sentry, the open source error tracking tool with a SaaS reporting frontend and a JavaScript SDK[5], gets blocked in many conservative  browser privacy setups.
