With Caddy and its ask point we just created a simple microservice which is hit each time there is a request to Caddy to issue the certificate, returns status 200, and we are good to go. It has been marvellous to use in our k8s setup with Redis plugin.<p>I&#x27;m also really happy that you improved startup time with 2.2.0rc1, because we had problems as our setup is massive (over 8000 domains and certificates).

Following this space for a long time, Nikola has always been by far the shadiest of all these companies.<p>They were one of the very few companies that claimed revolutionary battery technology. This is an instant red flag and a huge one. New revolutionary batteries don&#x27;t just just happen.<p>Sila Nanotechnology, is only replacing anode materials, and they have been at it since 2012 and don&#x27;t expect to be in cars until 2025. Quantum Scape, who want to make Solid State Li Anode batteries is not gone be in cars until 2025.<p>There were a number of other companies who also did this &#x27;we have revolutionary batteries&#x27;. Some actually believed they did. Dyson is a good example, they wanted to create a car, and to achieve their targets, they invested lots of money including in batteries. However since they are a honest company they eventually admired that they couldn&#x27;t hit their engineering targets and abandoned the project.<p>A Nikola competitor in the arena of bullshit spinning is Henry Fisker. His first company made lots of nonsense claims, including about batteries, but unlike Nikola they actually went threw the trouble and made some investment in future battery tech, just not credibly commercial ones. They went bankrupt. His new company is right back to the old bullshit spinning way but they have lower their ambitions and just open say they want to buy the VM MEB platform, now they are gone be the most &#x27;sustainable&#x27; among other claims.<p>As a comparison, Tesla &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; technology at battery day will likely not be a silicon anode or a lithium anode, those are simply not ready for commercial use. Revolutionary battery technology would be 10-20% energy density improvment and 30-50% longer lifetime maybe 2x faster production speed, and Tesla has been working on this for 5-10 years and have spent many 100s of millions acquiring a set of companies and having research agreement with multiple universities that all work in collaboration. In total I would guess to really bring a new cell to market at scale, you are talking 5-15 years and 5 billion $, and that is still with basically conventional cell chemistry.<p>Much of the same can be said about Fuel Cells. Toyota, Honda and also the Koreans have been banging their head against the fuel cell wall for 30 years, with heaps of government money to back them up. They know they can&#x27;t make it work, even with their massive resources. In personal vehicles they are not competitive against EVs in the slights (while also not being an improvement in CO2 compared to Gas) while in trucks they are not competitive with Disel or Natural Gas, and soon electric trucks are gone take the majority of routes over as nobody can compete with their price on these short and mid distant routes.<p>But Nikola are gone make it, and not for a geographically small place like Japan, but for the gigantic US without much government support either.<p>Another topic is that of product announcements. If you follow Nikola for many years, or you go back to 2016 and look at their announcements there is a funny effect that happens. People can say about Elon Time what they like, but mostly the products actually do come out and often are improved over the original announcement in a number of ways. Nikola shows the exact opposite pattern. It goes something like this, announce revolutionary new product but its 3-5 years out. Then progressively lower the specs over time, while pushing the time to market out further.<p>The hype for anything EV related has been insane. Quantum Scape is a fine company for example, but they have valuation that is insane for a company that is not gone make real money for many years and not gone make profits for many more after that. They essentially have a technology that requires a totally new manufacturing system, while competitors like Sila can put their materials in existing facilities claim the same level of improvements. I wouldn&#x27;t expose myself to a unique technology with so much competition<p>There are tons of EV startups and they differ widely from Lucid, Rivian being serious companies step by step putting in place a solid car company. Dynamic companies like NIO coming out of China. And there are the bottom feeders like Nikola, Fisker and others that surf on the hype.<p>This is gone be a massive market shakeout with Tesla being the leader hunted by everybody. Slow moving giants like VW, Toyota and so on finally realizing whats happening and taking methodical step after step. And a massive wave of startups from around the world, especially China trying to be next next big thing.

Quite the opposite - I’m optimistic that things are moving in the right direction. I mean, it can’t get worse:<p>- Shutdown my consulting  Business in February because I didn’t feel comfortable with being around new people constantly with a t-cell deficient immune system.\n- My boyfriend abruptly stopped his antidepressant and quietly completed suicide in his apartment alone. No indication anything was off.  It’s been tough to manage such a loss alone during a pandemic where social distancing is important.\n- I am left with his orange tabby cat; and with the unrelenting frustration in trying to reason with people who never lost their lover to suicide, with multiple “it’s not your fault” conversations. I’m conflicted in that these people are the ones who are standing with me, but I can’t hear this logic again. \n- Just a few days ago, six months later, I acknowledged what would’ve been his 33rd birthday and also our anniversary. I couldn’t find anything to actually celebrate or anyone to celebrate it with because of COVID. Still waiting for a good time to even have a proper memorial.\n- My roommate couple friends moved back home to the Midwest. As the master tenant, I’m responsible for the difference in rent, nobody is moving to SF really; but may have a roommate come October.\n- My best friend in San Francisco died of cancer late March. \n- We were supposed to have dinner the last week of February,\n- and all of us were supposed to celebrate my April birthday together at a Honey Dijon show;\n- and go to the Maceo Plex day party on Treasure Island in May. Yep, as both of them are gone and both of those events will never happen, that calendar event was a rough thing to forget to cancel.<p>On the bright side, I had time to crash course my way into sharpening my CS skills for flavor of the week programming languages, turned half my garage into a wood shop; created an IoT paradise at home or “who needs an Alexa when Jenkins will do,” been building the tabby a “catio” so he’ll get some outside time, started getting into the fun world of circuit board reworking out of a BIOS Flashing disaster, and enjoying the work of cooking all my meals.<p>I’m not too stressed about work.

They&#x27;ve done a mostly brilliant job in creating a very minimalistic Civ-style 4x game. Has two modes: a 30 turn game in which the player with the highest score wins. Building wonders and temples gives more points than conquest, so that mode is a very stripped down version of a cultural victory goal. And then there&#x27;s the free-for-all mode, with no turn limitations and the only possible victory is conquest. I mostly play the latter.<p>There&#x27;s a simple tech tree. Diplomacy is done in an interesting way, and I wish more games would emulate it. There&#x27;s no direct negotiations, relationship scores, or anything like that. Instead, you have to measure how they feel about you by the way they act. They give you a greetings when you first meet. If they laugh at you or are suspicious, then they&#x27;ll probably attack immediately. If they worship you or condescendingly pat you on the head, then they won&#x27;t attack for a while.<p>And this is also built on by judging them based on further actions. If you move a unit adjacent to theirs, and they don&#x27;t attack it, then you know they&#x27;re trustworthy for a time. And you can subtly manipulate their feelings towards you by doing things like not counter-attacking even when they&#x27;re attacking you. This is useful in a multi-front war when you&#x27;re losing. You can make the decision to concentrate an offensive on one front when your defenses can possibly hold on a second front. If the enemy isn&#x27;t hellbent on your destruction, they&#x27;ll possibly just stop attacking and do something else. If you accurately guess that they hate another nation more than they hate you, then attacking the hated nation will get them to consider you acceptable. It&#x27;s a bunch of big gambles and an interesting ones. Judging the other nations&#x27; attitudes towards you by intuition alone.<p>That definitely adds a little nuance to the conquer-the-world bits. Most games are over in 30 minutes or less, though occasionally they stretch out when you&#x27;re evenly matched.

Unlike the real world where the governors and rulers are (at least on a superficial level) bounded by international duties, social &amp; historical conditions, and the people under governance. In <i>Civilization<\/i>, the player is free to adopt any economic policies or political systems, as long as they give the maximum material benefits in the current situation. This can lead to some absurd strategies that don&#x27;t make much sense. For example, abolishing republicanism in favor of absolute monarchy in the 21st century for a few turns before jumping back, without any regards of real-world consequences whatsoever, since the player is the eternal dictator of life.

That&#x27;s not surprising, in retrospect; neither of its major contemporaries, the Commodore PET 2001 nor the TRS-80 Model I, does either, despite being developed by major corporations with substantial resources.<p>He doesn&#x27;t explain why the Apple II+ (1979)—after the II&#x27;s market success was proven—doesn&#x27;t support lowercase letters. Even if software uses graphics mode to display lowercase letters, the II and II+&#x27;s keyboard does not have physical&#x2F;electrical support for detecting shifted letters. Since graphics mode is cumbersome and slow, word processors for the II and II+ typically use reverse video to indicate capital letters, and use another key like Escape as a shift toggle. A popular alternative is the shift-key mod that fattire mentioned, which requires soldering of a wire to one of the paddle ports.<p>The lack of support is because the company was working on the Apple III (1980), which it expected would quickly obsolete the II series. The III has built-in 80-column text and full lowercase support, at both the character-font and physical-keyboard levels. Apple had incentive to not make the II too attractive.<p>Neither Woz nor anyone else at Apple expected that a) the III would quickly fail, and b) the II series would remain Apple&#x27;s bread and butter. Without the III&#x27;s distraction the II+ would surely have had built-in lowercase software and hardware support, or there would have been another II around 1981 with such. As it were, the III took up so much of Apple&#x27;s resources that the Apple IIe did not appear until 1983, by which time the IBM PC had surpassed the II series."],"time":["2020-09-10 21:23:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["robterrell"],"id":[24435475],"kids":{},"parent":[24433135],"text":["When I was a kid, I used to buy EEPROMs at the local electronics store and burn them with the Apple ][ lower-case characters.

Once people see the flooding of TLDs (like handshake TLDs which are easily and cheaply available to general public on Namebase (namebase.io) or Bob wallet(Bob wallet.io)) and when they realize TLDs are the new equivalent of .coms, they would realize that it&#x27;s just the TLDs that matter for auth aspect and the subdomains are more functional within the company (like mail.google and chat.google)\nThe only people to lose are the scammers and ICANN."],"time":["2020-09-11 01:27:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Bnshsysjab"],"id":[24437232],"kids":[24438419,24441366],"parent":[24436717],"text":["I’d love $myhandle.sucks but alas the domain registrar decided to charge extortion rates in the hopes that large companies register their own domain to prevent hate sites &gt;_&gt;"],"time":["2020-09-11 00:31:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gfaure"],"id":[24437366],"kids":[24437516,24437697,24437548],"parent":[24436717],"text":[".calvinklein? .bananarepublic?

I can understand some Python library failing during the auto update process needing a rollback, but needing a complete reimage to fix the situation? How does that even happen?<p>&gt;  new protocol for the letsencrypt challenges was released, announced in some obscure corner of the web and bit by bit the old method of issuing new certificates was deprecated. You would not have known this unless you interacted with Letsencrypt on a daily basis, but like most of these things their whole value lies in NOT having to interact with them all the time.<p>Let&#x27;s Encrypt also sent out emails to people still using the old method at least two months before the old method was phased out. You have to provide an email address when setting up LE exactly for this reason. The only explanation I can think of for why the author wouldn&#x27;t have received an email is that they did not execute a renew check for their certificate in the three months leading up to the change of service, which is going straight against LE&#x27;s guidelines (you should check more often, exactly for this reason). This is the<p>&gt; which is odd because after all <i>the situation hasn’t changed and if it worked last time it should still work this time<\/i><p>The situation obviously _has changed_ otherwise the venv wouldn&#x27;t have been updated. Libraries get bugfixes even if those don&#x27;t apply to you specifically; deal with it. You&#x27;re not the only customer here.<p>&gt; I understand that Letsencrypt needs to stay with the times. But the Letsencrypt folks should also understand that in the greater scheme of things certificates are not the most important thing in life and that causing your end users this level of grief is in the longer term not in the projects’ best interest.<p>Web security is not a &quot;set and forget&quot; thing. It&#x27;s not a toggle button from &quot;insecure&quot; to &quot;secure&quot;. If you want a zero-maintenance certificate solution, get a managed server and get someone else to handle the annoying stuff for you.<p>&gt; The machine that this is all running on will need a much more recent version of its OS. That means I’m going to have to migrate a whole bunch of data to another machine in order to be able to do this without downtime.<p>This is unsurprising coming from someone who wrote a blog about why they don&#x27;t like to update. However, the assumption that the entire host OS needs to update just to use a new piece of software is simply wrong. Things like Docker and LXC make it trivial to run newer software without upgrading the entire system. It also forces the software into a contained space to prevent the catastrophic failure the author had to deal with before.\nFrom what I can tell from a Shodan check for this domain, the author still seems to be running Ubuntu 14 (which went EOL last year). That probably explains why the author is afraid that they will need to upgrade their server. However, if you&#x27;re running on a software stack whose LTS support has already been dropped, you&#x27;re just postponing the inevitable by not planning an upgrade plan already. Blaming Let&#x27;s Encrypt for potentially not supporting a platform nobody else supports is a silly excuse.<p>I agree that Let&#x27;s Encrypt has its issues. Sure, their client can use some thinning, their decisions are sometimes confusing, but the normal situation is not nearly as bad as the author describes here. If you&#x27;re bothered by the official client updating things, use a different client; there&#x27;s plenty of them."],"time":["2020-09-10 12:10:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["perryizgr8"],"id":[24433389],"kids":{},"parent":[24430260],"text":["The big fact of the matter is that https is usually unnecessary for most websites.

So cheap, in fact, that it’s too good to be true. In reality, all flash memory is riddled with defects — without exception. The illusion of a contiguous, reliable storage media is crafted through sophisticated error correction and bad block management functions. This is the result of a constant arms race between the engineers and mother nature; with every fabrication process shrink, memory becomes cheaper but more unreliable. Likewise, with every generation, the engineers come up with more sophisticated and complicated algorithms to compensate for mother nature’s propensity for entropy and randomness at the atomic scale.<p>These algorithms are too complicated and too device-specific to be run at the application or OS level, and so it turns out that every flash memory disk ships with a reasonably powerful microcontroller to run a custom set of disk abstraction algorithms. Even the diminutive microSD card contains not one, but at least two chips — a controller, and at least one flash chip (high density cards will stack multiple flash die).&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;The embedded microcontroller is typically a heavily modified 8051 or ARM CPU. In modern implementations, the microcontroller will approach 100 MHz performance levels, and also have several hardware accelerators on-die.<p><i>Amazingly, the cost of adding these controllers to the device is probably on the order of $0.15-$0.30<\/i>,<p>particularly for companies that can fab both the flash memory and the controllers within the same business unit. It’s probably cheaper to add these microcontrollers than to thoroughly test and characterize each flash memory chip, which explains why managed flash devices can be cheaper per bit than raw flash chips, despite the inclusion of a microcontroller.<p>The downside of all this complexity is that there can be bugs in the hardware abstraction layer, especially since every flash implementation has unique algorithmic requirements, leading to an explosion in the number of hardware abstraction layers that a microcontroller has to potentially handle. The inevitable firmware bugs are now a reality of the flash memory business, and as a result it’s not feasible, particularly for third party controllers, to indelibly burn a static body of code into on-chip ROM.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;From the DIY and hacker perspective, our findings indicate a<p><i>potentially interesting source of cheap and powerful microcontrollers for use in simple projects.<\/i><p>An Arduino, with its 8-bit 16 MHz microcontroller, will set you back around $20.<p><i>A microSD card with several gigabytes of memory and a microcontroller with several times the performance could be purchased for a fraction of the price.<\/i><p>While SD cards are admittedly I&#x2F;O-limited, some clever hacking of the microcontroller in an SD card could make for a very economical and compact data logging solution for I2C or SPI-based sensors.&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-10 06:05:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saagarjha"],"id":[24429270],"kids":[24432224],"parent":[24428755],"text":["microSD cards are part of the reason why I always amazed at how much stuff we can fit into such a small package."],"time":["2020-09-10 07:49:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["synack"],"id":[24428807],"kids":{},"parent":[24428755],"text":["(2013)"],"time":["2020-09-10 06:09:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moonchild"],"id":[24429970],"kids":[24432862],"parent":[24410641],"text":["&gt; since registers are specified in sub-byte nibbles, one needs very good memory and tons of experience to predict what goes where<p>Nope, you just need to use octal instead of hex - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20041117160755if_&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dabo.de:80&#x2F;ccc99&#x2F;www.camp.ccc.de&#x2F;radio&#x2F;help.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20041117160755if_&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dab...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 10:00:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[24410683],"kids":{},"parent":[24410641],"text":["Discussed a bit at the time: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13938935\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13938935<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 19:36:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ficklepickle"],"id":[24443918],"kids":{},"parent":[24410641],"text":["I thoroughly enjoyed that.

Illegally, by UK laws, and refuse to be held accountable for that in their own courts. Not that the judge even tries to demand reasonable treatment for Julian Assange from the prosecutor.<p>UK laws are very clear on what should happen in this case: because of the government&#x27;s treatment of Assange the case should be thrown out, because obviously the government has acted illegally against him on MANY occasions, they don&#x27;t even give him his rights INSIDE THE COURTROOM (to talk to his lawyer privately and however much he wants without interference). The government DOES NOT have the right to sue somebody for anything once they have tortured him. Once they have lied about the case, they lose the right to sue. Once they refuse medical aid to a prisoner, they lose the right to sue. They have spied on his communication with his lawyer, again grounds for dismissal. They are obviously not feeding him right, which again would normally disqualify the government&#x27;s case. Or at the very least, warrants a delay in the case with him decently taken care of until he is once again strong and fit enough to stand trial. Note that this is completely independent of the merit of the case itself: the QC in any normal case like this would never be allowed to make their case without fixing these issues first. Some of these reasons for dismissal the judge has seen happen right in front of him with his own eyes.<p>Then there is the fact that the UK government does not have evidence against Assange on this crime (because he violated US law, not UK law), furthermore I do not see how it could -legally- obtain any such evidence.<p>And yet this farce continues. The judge systematically refuses to face issues of fairness of the case and is obviously intimidated by the government.<p>This shows one thing very clearly : the United Kingdom&#x27;s government (the &quot;executive&quot;) has ZERO intention of following through on their commitment to either follow their own laws, respect human rights and has no qualms whatsoever to threaten their own branches of government, when they want to violate laws.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)30383-4&#x2F;fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 15:47:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DiogenesKynikos"],"id":[24431100],"kids":[24431773,24431972,24432057],"parent":[24430207],"text":["The surreal aspect of this is the UK prosecution&#x27;s assertions that the US prosecution is not politically motivated. All you have to do is look at the speech that CIA Director (now Secretary of State) Mike Pompeo made about Wikileaks and Assange in April 2017.[1] These passages give a taste of his remarks:<p>&gt; It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.<p>&gt; No, I am quite confident that had Assange been around in the 1930s and 40s and 50s, he would have found himself on the wrong side of history.<p>&gt; We know this because Assange and his ilk make common cause with dictators today.<p>&gt; That Assange is the darling of terrorists is nothing short of reprehensible.<p>&gt; No, Julian Assange and his kind are not the slightest bit interested in improving civil liberties or enhancing personal freedom. They have pretended that America’s First Amendment freedoms shield them from justice. They may have believed that, but they are wrong.<p>&gt; Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value. He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous. He is a fraud—a coward hiding behind a screen.<p>&gt; First, it is high time we called out those who grant a platform to these leakers and so-called transparency activists. We know the danger that Assange and his not-so-merry band of brothers pose to democracies around the world. Ignorance or misplaced idealism is no longer an acceptable excuse for lionizing these demons.<p>&gt; Third, we have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us. To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.<p>But if you listen to the UK prosecutor, Assange is just being prosecuted because some low-level prosecutor in the US decided, on their own initiative, to build a case against him. The fact that high-level officials in the US government have been openly calling for an example to be made of Assange is supposed to be irrelevant.<p>The UK should have dismissed this extradition request out-of-hand when it was first made, given the obvious political motivations behind it.

Maybe this could be fixed in a json extension which allows words to be read as strings of themselves but if you extend json you lose any interoperability. Json also doesn’t have comments.<p>There are some arguments for or against alists&#x2F;plists instead of json “dictionaries”. An obvious point is that only one of these allows for non-string keys. A weak concern I have is about using “the wrong type”, eg if you use an array you sort of imply an ordering, and an object an unordered mapping, so should you put unordered data like a set in an array or should you have a map full of null values?<p>In recent years, languages with tagged unions like haskell or rust have become more popular. I feel like there’s no satisfying way to write such a thing as json (relying on field names to disambiguate is only sometimes possible and feels tricky to read, having an object with a tag field or an array of [tag, value] feels unnatural. With a sexp you can just write it with a list of tag and args but because everything is lists, it doesn’t feel so unnatural.<p>This isn’t related to json vs sexps but having a difference between &quot;123&quot; and 123 in your text format kind of sucks. Either the parser will reject one or go to the trouble of parsing both or there’s a semantic difference between them which feels worse.

The most recent rise in cases, to more than 2,600 a day, is particularly unsettling.<p>One thing the article briefly mentioned but didn&#x27;t really dig into (IMO) is that the peak of 5,451 cases on April 5th is basically a meaningless number and that it is important to try to figure out what the real number should have been.<p>On April 5th, the UK was only doing 16,000 tests a day and had a nearly 40% positive rate for tests. Only very sick people were being tested. That implies that the 5,451 cases detected that day is a vast undercount of the actual number of new cases at that point. It is bad data science to keep reporting that peak case number in comparison with the current case numbers as if it means anything.<p>So how many new cases were there on April 5th? No one knows for sure, but various estimates based on community surveys guess that it was more like 100,000&#x2F;cases per day. That would be a very different graph than what gets attached to every news story.<p>Compare that with now, where the UK is doing ~200k tests a day (over 10x!). We also have much better community survey data now and can estimate that there are about 3,200&#x2F;cases a day right now. The daily testing is picking up the majority of those expected cases.<p>So if you actually compare numbers that are comparable (~100k cases&#x2F;~1000 deaths with ~3k cases&#x2F;~10 deaths), you get a much better idea of what is actually going on. Demographics are definitely working in our favor now, which keeps death rates lower. But it&#x27;s not like we have &quot;solved COVID treatment&quot; and can cure everyone now because we know to use steroids. It&#x27;s mostly that there just aren&#x27;t nearly as many people getting it right now as there were at the peak. Even if tomorrow we detected 5,451 cases again, there&#x27;s no reason to expect that the death rate should approach the peak because we are getting much closer at detecting all the sick people than before."],"time":["2020-09-10 12:44:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ck2"],"id":[24428156],"kids":[24428204],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Steroids.

One solution would be to adjust the cycle threshold used now to decide that a patient is infected. Most tests set the limit at 40, a few at 37. This means that you are positive for the coronavirus if the test process required up to 40 cycles, or 37, to detect the virus. Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk — akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said. Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive, agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. “I’m shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,” she said. A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35, she added. Dr. Mina said he would set the figure at 30, or even less. Those changes would mean the amount of genetic material in a patient’s sample would have to be 100-fold to 1,000-fold that of the current standard for the test to return a positive result — at least, one worth acting on.<\/i><p>Every published &quot;case&quot; should include the PCR cycle threshold to enable statistical analysis."],"time":["2020-09-10 04:41:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lukehutch"],"id":[24427371],"kids":[24427841,24427472],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Because the average of infection has dropped by over 20 years."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:53:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kristianpaul"],"id":[24427672],"kids":{},"parent":[24426131],"text":["So the metrics where misleading because testing was not constant and&#x2F;or performed same way across the same population distribution?"],"time":["2020-09-10 02:37:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["laurencerowe"],"id":[24429544],"kids":{},"parent":[24426131],"text":["This article could really do with a discussion of how the positive test rate is increasing over the past month, see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e26349e5-29d4-4797-96ea-a09aac8cd652\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e26349e5-29d4-4797-96ea-a09aac8cd...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 08:39:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pieceofcakedude"],"id":[24428515],"kids":[24428543,24429350],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Because we&#x27;re relying on a test which can barely be trusted.

The second is debuggability if your language and tooling doesn&#x27;t have native support for coroutines; look up &quot;stack ripping&quot;.<p>And then, to top it all, he forgot to tell you that most event loop frameworks allow you to run an event loop on each core, i.e., multithreaded, so you have both events and threads.<p>&gt; A thread has access to the same address space as other threads in your process, and can do whatever they want with it.<p>The same holds with any event handler invoked by the event loop.

You&#x27;ll probably mess it up, and the symptoms will show up in an unrelated part of the program 10 minutes later.<p>These sentences assume that whoever is reading this is an ignorant fool.

So you have to decide how these separate processes should communicate.<p>If you&#x27;re going for shared memory, you&#x27;re back to square one, except that sharing is cumbersome because data is mapped to different addresses in different processes, so pointer-based structures can&#x27;t be shared... At least C++ has a Boost library that mimics the usual containers (vector, map, set) by using special offset-based &quot;pointer type&quot; so they can be safely shared. And you _still_ must synchronize access to shared data.<p>If you go for the no-shared approach, well, you have to send data through socket, pipe, or a message queue. So you have to design some marshalling and communication protocol (or use a library), but the major drawback here will be performance: each send&#x2F;receive requires a user-kernel transition, AND, copying data between user- and kernel-space. Twice (once from sender -&gt; kernel, the other time kernel -&gt; receiver).<p>If the MQ implementation is clever (like on Solaris), the communication buffer will get mapped into both processes so you can get away with copying the data only once, provided the MQ allows you to &quot;peek&quot; and consume data without copying it out from the shared buffer first.<p>&gt; This is not only much more robust, but it scales better, since you could distribute these programs across multiple computers later on.<p>This is presented as if distributing across machines is simple matter. What is not mentioned is that communication between processes on the _same_ machine will NEVER fail. As soon as you have network, random latency increases or network outages will kill performance or expose a whole new class of bugs.<p>&gt; Second, your language designers are lying to you.

It is easy to reason about and debug.<p>It easily takes advantage of all the CPUs on the server. You can run a single VM instead of breaking up your application into multiple servers, each of which only uses one CPU (via containers or OS processes) and trying to coordinate between them.

We&#x27;ve been making heavy use of it ourselves.<p>We&#x27;ve also done some crazy, fairly-complex, maybe-niche stuff in Django, and built these out into some libraries you might find interesting to browse through:<p>1) Djblets (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;djblets&#x2F;djblets\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;djblets&#x2F;djblets<\/a>) — A big ol&#x27; utility library for Django that provides:<p>* Foundations for loadable extensions (just like browser extensions) for Django projects<p>* Support for defining flexible integrations for third-party services (Slack, etc.)<p>* Avatar support (gravatars, file uploads, URL-based avatars, and custom backends)<p>* Datagrids (with user column customization)<p>* A foundation for REST APIs<p>* Dynamic site settings<p>* Stuff to make privacy&#x2F;PII&#x2F;consent a first-class citizen in codebases<p>* And just a ton of other things that we found useful in Review Board and wanted to make more widely-available.<p>2) Django Evolution (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;beanbaginc&#x2F;django-evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;beanbaginc&#x2F;django-evolution<\/a>) — A precursor to Django&#x27;s migrations support (and the reason we were on Django 1.6 for so long — the in-development version cooperates with migrations now). We inherited and maintain this project. It provides an alternate way to specify database schema changes, and has the benefit of just being far faster to apply migrations, through a built-in optimizer. This <i>significantly<\/i> reduces upgrade times for large installs (super important for many of our Review Board customers).<p>All open source, and might be interesting to look at, who knows.
