On the other hand, you can also build your own Eurorack modules (see the DIY forum on Muffwiggler for that), which can be a lot cheaper.<p>Something else I was thinking about was that if the main problem the guy in the video was trying to solve was that the knobs and switches on his modules were too difficult to manipulate with his prosthesis, then he could have tried the HackMe Vectr[5][6], which would have let him simply wave his whole hand around above the module to send out three voltages from his hand movements in three dimensional space.  Mind control is, of course, way cooler, and doesn&#x27;t require movement at all.<p>Finally, I was also thinking about how his modular interface might have been designed with opto-isolators, to minimize the risk of voltage inadvertently being sent back from the modular in to his arm, should he plug his cable in to an output rather than an input.

The backend automatically sorts the diagram into a graph and generates the audio as the user builds the program. So by the end, the programmer has used their ears to measure whether the program can indeed compute audio for the diagram in realtime. (And the corresponding classes for signal computation are designed with soft realtime scheduling in mind.)<p>* Max is a general purpose programming language where the user creates and connects various branches of different Rube Goldberg machines together in a GUI. This appears superficially similar to DSP diagrams above. But each object in the chain can do anything from simple realtime appropriate math to doing file i&#x2F;o while allocating large chunks of memory. There&#x27;s no easy way to tell which of these Rube Goldberg objects are realtime safe. Plus one can iterate infinitely and recurse into already recursive chains of calls with ease. (The MSP engine prohibits recursion.)<p>Due to lack of constant aural feedback for Max diagrams, users typically keep a separate, erroneous mental model of all the Rube Goldberg machines in their short-term memory. In fact, most users practice a novel form of cryptography I call &quot;Fresco-based write protection&quot;: the user keeps drawing and connecting more Rube Goldberg machines atop one another until their short-term memory becomes the only private key that can decode them. Given about 30 minutes for the frescoes to &quot;dry,&quot; this technique is proven secure even against rubber hose attacks.<p>For maximum frustration, Max&#x2F;MSP has objects which let the user hook Rube Goldberg machines up to a DSP graph, and vice versa. And I mean maximum frustration: while such inter-diagram connections give users functionality they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have, they also give users the false-confidence necessary to schedule a performance that ends up with that user staring at a silent laptop and muttering, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand, this worked fine on Tuesday.&quot;<p>Edit: clarification"],"time":["2020-02-17 17:54:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["H1Supreme"],"id":[22351666],"kids":{},"parent":[22346556],"text":["I&#x27;ve been using MaxMsp for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve been writing software for much longer.

Audio signals are roughly what you might expect if you are familiar with analog audio processing: plug one box into the next, and data is constantly flowing.

For example: if a single message is sent to two different objects, then those two objects send a message to a third (diamond shape), the third object will be executed twice, despite all of this happening in the same logical time-step. Execution order also depends on the position of the objects in the canvas, IIRC.<p>The semantics are at least partially historical, because when Max was originally developed, real-time DSP wasn&#x27;t available.<p>[0]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;msp.ucsd.edu&#x2F;Publications&#x2F;dartmouth-reprint.dir&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;msp.ucsd.edu&#x2F;Publications&#x2F;dartmouth-reprint.dir&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-17 17:40:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["raptorraver"],"id":[22348210],"kids":[22348559,22350044,22348878],"parent":[22346556],"text":["Opensource alternative Pure Data is also worth mentioning: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puredata.info&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puredata.info&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-17 16:14:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pier25"],"id":[22349328],"kids":[22350878],"parent":[22346556],"text":["Also check out GEN which was recently added to Max.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eDYs2UZzhI4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eDYs2UZzhI4<\/a><p>It&#x27;s a low level DSP engine that is already used in Ableton Live and embedded systems for modular synths."],"time":["2020-02-17 19:03:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sideb0ard"],"id":[22349548],"kids":[22350144],"parent":[22346556],"text":["If you&#x27;re in SF in march and interested in Max&#x2F;MSP, my conf&#x2F;music festival, Algorithmic Art Assembly, has a workshop on Creating Digital Instruments with Max&#x2F;MSP - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aaassembly.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aaassembly.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;<\/a> (conf also features Miller Puckette, Curtis Roads and many more!)"],"time":["2020-02-17 19:39:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jcelerier"],"id":[22348463],"kids":{},"parent":[22346556],"text":["If anyone&#x27;s interested - I&#x27;m working on ossia score (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ossia.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ossia.io<\/a> ; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OSSIA&#x2F;score\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OSSIA&#x2F;score<\/a>) which is a bit like Max &amp; PD, but the dataflow is integrated directly in the timeline which allows for better expressibility of evolution of time in the artwork."],"time":["2020-02-17 16:46:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pmoriarty"],"id":[22349085],"kids":[22349193,22350013,22349182,22352490],"parent":[22346556],"text":["I have a real problem with visual languages like Max and PureData (and all the other visual languages I&#x27;ve ever seen).<p>They seem like a good idea, and might be fine for computer-phobic people just starting to be introduced to programming, but whenever one tries to make anything even a little complex in them they inevitably become a mess of spaghetti-code.<p>Languages like these also don&#x27;t have the almost hundred years of research and effort in to creating an ecosystem around them like text-based languages do.<p>There&#x27;s no way to grep, diff or sed the source while remaining on the visual level.

And while I understand where he is coming from in always wanting the object to meet its invariants until it is destructed, I think this approach will make code harder to reason about rather than easier.<p>I&#x27;m a huge proponent that classes should be fully configured on construction and should stay that way until the end of their life-cycle. I really dislike classes that are only partially configured on construction, and then you have to call other methods to complete their initialization. Then every method in the class has to have guard code to check whether the object has been fully initialized. And if you really want to code defensively users of the class also have to handle the case where an instance of that class hasn&#x27;t been fully initialized, either by checking before calling a method, or by catching exceptions . It complicates things for both the user and the implementator of the class, not to mention adding computational overhead on both sides of the API.<p>If you require objects to be usable after they are moved from then, every object with a move constructor will either need to do extra work during the move to keep itself in a valid (but different) state, or it will need to support being in a partially configured state. In some cases it will be inexpensive to create a valid state (say change an object to point to a preallocated singleton), but in others it would completely defeat the benefit of doing a move to begin with, so you are back to supporting partially configured objects.<p>In the end this seems like a lot of work to keep moved objects valid, when in practice the vast majority of moved objects are implicitly moved temporaries, that are impossible to used after they are moved. And for the cases where an object was explicitly moved, the misconception that you shouldn&#x27;t use an object after moving it is already well ingrained enough that it rarely happens by accident.<p>I can see putting in sentinels and asserts to sanity check that objects aren&#x27;t being used after move (and typically do), but I&#x27;d still prefer to treat use-after-move as the bug, than complicate the normal uses of the object to support an unnecessary corner-case.<p>Edit: Reworded a few sentences for clarity."],"time":["2020-02-17 20:53:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["butterthebuddha"],"id":[22349851],"kids":[22349889,22351492,22349944,22351920,22350117,22352248,22349919,22350902],"parent":[22349302],"text":["Move semantics are a great addition to C++, but off the top of my head, there are two warts:<p>-  C++ moves are not destructive (as compared to move semantics in Rust).

Frankly, this is annoying, because I now have to pay the overhead of std::optional for no good reason (and also use a C++17 compiler, which is not always available).<p>- the syntax for rvalue references and perfect forwarding references is the same, which is the cause for much confusion, especially among beginners.

And is it not a common idiom, when writing a move constructor for a class that has an explicit no-argument constructor, to leave the moved-from object in the same state as if it were newly constructed without arguments?

Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.<p>A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer&#x27;s idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer&#x27;s spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.<p>A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer&#x27;s apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.<p>Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently contained in a secure way. Real-world programming, however, requires care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-17 12:10:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["empath75"],"id":[22347187],"kids":[22348203],"parent":[22343713],"text":["&gt; Houdini’s fondness for reading extended to magazines, too: after his famous escape from inside a locked safe behind a screen, which took mere seconds, he spent the next fifteen minutes back stage, idly reading a magazine, after which he dotted himself with water and burst forth, looking properly sweaty and exhausted<p>TurboTax famously does this.

It happens instantly, of course, but they spend about 10 seconds showing you loading bars so you think that whatever it’s doing is difficult.<p>I’m a big fan of magic, and the main thing to take away from magic is this — none of us perceive ‘reality’. Our minds create a simulation of the world based on very limited and error prone input.

Plus, yearbooks were collected from all over America so there&#x27;s less chance of the data being skewed toward the &#x27;hipper&#x27; states. (I&#x27;m not an expert on which states those would be but I&#x27;m presuming places like California and New York are closer to the top in that ranking?)"],"time":["2020-02-17 16:45:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kickout"],"id":[22347930],"kids":[22348346],"parent":[22347393],"text":["Very cool.

It&#x27;s i3 with Ubuntu but it comes with sensible defaults, a nicer theme and shortcuts to all the configs you could need out of the box. It really makes things a lot easier than using just i3, especially when doing a fresh install (it&#x27;s available both as an installable image and as a package - I&#x27;ve had no issue with either).<p>Some default shortcuts are different so if you&#x27;ve been using i3 for a while you&#x27;ll have to iterate a bit over the config to get to a comfortable point, but it&#x27;s the same config file. I also changed the default terminal back to gnome term, since their default one doesn&#x27;t have a scrollbar, but again it&#x27;s pretty easy to do and you only do it once.

Each project usually has totally different workspace configurations.<p>For example:<p>Project1 might have workspaces 1: dev, 2: mail, 3: tail -f access.log<p>Project2 might have workspaces 1: photoshop, 2: mypaint, 3: shell<p>Project3 might have workspaces 1: trello, 2: research<p>...<p>This is like tmux sessions. I can have multiple sessions, each session has multiple windows and panes. In tmux this works very well but in i3 you can&#x27;d do that.<p>I&#x27;m currently emulating this by running five independent i3 copies on five displays :1, :2, :3, :4, :5 and I switch between displays to switch to another project.<p>2) Static tiling<p>I3 is a dynamic tiling manager, which means it uses the entire screen. However, once you establish your workflow, you often have windows that take 1&#x2F;3 of the screen and are 1&#x2F;3 off the top, etc. and you don&#x27;t really want them to take the entire screen because it makes you less productive and it feels weird. Also, once you establish your workflow, you don&#x27;t want the workspace to change or resize. You just know where everything is and don&#x27;t want a slightest disturbance in your workflow.<p>This is often hard to do in i3 and you need to use tricks such as vertical and horizontal splits of empty terminals to put the app where you need it to be. And it&#x27;s extremely easy to mess this up, if you accidentally open a new terminal. Then your app resizes and shifts, and when you close the accidental terminal, it&#x27;s no longer where it was because of many vertical and horizontal splits.<p>I found Notion window manager that is static tiling but I haven&#x27;t tried it. It can also have tabs inside static tiles, which makes it very interesting.<p>3) Run or raise<p>Run or raise starts a program if it&#x27;s not running, focuses it if it&#x27;s running, and hides it when no longer needed.<p>For example, pressing alt+n starts and shows a notepad if it&#x27;s not yet running. If it&#x27;s running, it focuses the notepad and pressing alt+n again hides it.<p>I3 doesn&#x27;t have this feature but it can be emulated via xdotool and scratchpads.<p>4) Using fzf instead of dmenu<p>Dmenu is nice but you need to type too much. The solution is to use fzf instead of dmenu.<p>I&#x27;m currently displaying a floating sticky terminal window that runs fzf, gets my input, performs the action, and disappears. It&#x27;s so much faster than dmenu.<p>5) Using fzf to switch apps, workspaces, workspaces-of-workspaces<p>Often, when you&#x27;re working on project2, you remember you had similar idea&#x2F;code&#x2F;notes in project4. You then have to switch to display :4, then switch to correct workspace and find the info.<p>This could be simplified by using fzf and just instantly switching where you need.<p>6) Using alt-tab to switch back to previous place you were.<p>Let&#x27;s say you switched from appx in project2 on display :2 to appy in project4 on display :4, and now you have to cycle between them. You can&#x27;t do that right now so the workflow isn&#x27;t perfect and there&#x27;s a lot of drag."],"time":["2020-02-17 21:48:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["agumonkey"],"id":[22349699],"kids":{},"parent":[22349453],"text":["my arch setup uses i3, it&#x27;s not the only tiling wm but it&#x27;s really nice, light and efficient."],"time":["2020-02-17 19:58:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["purplezooey"],"id":[22350620],"kids":[22351005],"parent":[22349453],"text":["Why isn&#x27;t i3-gaps merged by now?"],"time":["2020-02-17 21:51:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tigrezno"],"id":[22350056],"kids":[22350121,22351000,22350954],"parent":[22349453],"text":["Still no gaps support on main branch.

A print function that takes many types of argument, for example. Second, you can provide multiple arities to mimic optional arguments in a language that doesn&#x27;t have them.<p>But the example in the argument, where the overload is for providing two different versions that do different things with their arguments, is not something I&#x27;d want to see in real code. There&#x27;s just too much opportunity for confusion. For example, if I were familiar with `float area(int)` as a function that calculates the area of a circle, and and then encountered `area(int, int)`, I would guess that the return value is a float, and that the two ints are now the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of an ellipse.<p>And I&#x27;m having a hard time coming up with a better example for the article.

[0]<p>&gt; I am the engineering manager for the DDoS protection team and this morning at 11:06 UTC we tweaked a rule that affected one of our signals. The signal relates to the HTTP referer header, and we have a piece of code that looks at invalid referer headers. In this case we tweaked it to include not just &quot;obvious garbage&quot; but &quot;anything that does not conform to the HTTP specification&quot;... i.e. is the referer a URI? If not then it contributes to knowledge about bad traffic.<p>&gt; So... why did this impact npmjs.org? It turns out that a lot of NPM traffic sends the referer as &quot;install&quot; which is invalid according to the HTTP specification. As NPM is also a heavily trafficked site this resulted in the DDoS systems picking this up and treating the traffic as a HTTP flood and determining that a rate-limit should be applied.<p>&gt; When we noticed that NPM was seeing an increase in HTTP 429s (as seen on Twitter) we contacted NPM and started an internal investigation. As soon as we identified the root cause we reverted the change, which was at 13:00 UTC.<p>&gt; We&#x27;ll note that NPM and 1 other site use the referer for purposes outside the HTTP spec and we&#x27;ll update our systems to ensure that this does not happen again.

Here we explore whether transformers can similarly learn to reason (or emulate reasoning), but using rules expressed in language, thus bypassing a formal representation. We provide the first demonstration that this is possible, and characterize the extent of this capability. To do this, we use a collection of synthetic datasets that test increasing levels of reasoning complexity (number of rules, presence of negation, and depth of chaining). We find transformers appear to learn rule-based reasoning with high (99%) accuracy on these datasets, and in a way that generalizes to test data requiring substantially deeper chaining than in the training data (95%+ scores). We also demonstrate that the models transfer well to two hand-authored rulebases, and to rulebases paraphrased into more natural language. &quot;<p>The performance numbers are pretty impressive IMO. But learning from synthetic datasets is pretty perilous, hard to say if it&#x27;ll generalize well. Kudos to them for putting out a live demo."],"time":["2020-02-17 20:46:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["asacalowww"],"id":[22349142],"kids":[22349168],"parent":[22347039],"text":["Just tried a set of classic non-monotonic reasoning statements and it didn&#x27;t like it much: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rule-reasoning.apps.allenai.org&#x2F;?p=Penguins%20are%20birds%0ABirds%20can%20typically%20fly%0APenguins%20cannot%20fly%0ATweety%20is%20a%20bird&amp;q=Can%20tweety%20fly%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rule-reasoning.apps.allenai.org&#x2F;?p=Penguins%20are%20...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-17 18:32:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scribu"],"id":[22349113],"kids":[22349147],"parent":[22347039],"text":["It doesn&#x27;t seem very precise.

Also here&#x27;s the abstract for anyone so stupid as to comment before reading:<p>Inverse associations between soy and prostate cancer and the contribution of hormones to prostate cancer prompted the current study to determine whether soy protein could alter serum hormones in men. Thirty-five men consumed milk protein isolate (MPI), low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (SPI) (low-iso SPI; 1.64 +&#x2F;- 0.19 mg isoflavones&#x2F;d), and high-iso SPI (61.7 +&#x2F;- 7.35 mg isoflavones&#x2F;d) for 57 d each in a randomized crossover design. Twenty-four-hour urine samples indicated that urinary isoflavones were significantly increased by the high-iso SPI relative to the low-iso SPI and MPI. Serum collected on d 1, 29, and 57 of each treatment revealed that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and DHT&#x2F;testosterone were significantly decreased by the low-iso SPI [9.4% (P = 0.036) and 9.0% (P = 0.004), respectively] and the high-iso SPI [15% (P = 0.047) and 14% (P = 0.013), respectively], compared with the MPI at d 57. Other significant effects included a decrease in testosterone by the low-iso SPI relative to the MPI (P = 0.023) and high-iso SPI (P = 0.020) at d 29; an increase in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate by the low-iso SPI relative to the MPI at d 29 (P = 0.001) and relative to the MPI (P = 0.0003) and high-iso SPI (P = 0.005) at d 57; and increases in estradiol and estrone by the low-iso SPI relative to the MPI at d 57 (P = 0.010 and P = 0.005, respectively). In conclusion, soy protein, regardless of isoflavone content, decreased DHT and DHT&#x2F;testosterone with minor effects on other hormones, providing evidence for some effects of soy protein on hormones. The relevance of the magnitude of these effects to future prostate cancer risk requires further investigation."],"time":["2020-02-17 03:09:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["tmarsden"],"id":[22344984],"kids":[22345017],"parent":[22344652],"text":["So the soy boy meme is now backed by a scientific study.<p>EDIT: I didn’t realize the study was from 2005.

There is a lot of specialization, so you can definitely get away with only programming (or only doing SRE, or only developing build&#x2F;testing tools, or only maintaining production machines, or only developing Linux on embedded devices, etc.)  I think that is where you want to aim if you don&#x27;t care about the details of the &quot;full stack&quot;.

This list of questions can provide some ideas for starting points if you pick and choose carefully, but not all of the questions are a good idea.<p>Specifically: While it&#x27;s important to listen to your employee&#x27;s complaints about the company, it&#x27;s equally important to avoid giving them the wrong impression that you&#x27;re going to fix everything for them. Questions like &quot;If you were CEO, what&#x27;s the first thing you would change?&quot; or &quot;Are there any aspects of our culture you wish you could change?&quot; or &quot;What’s the No. 1 problem with our organization, and what do you think&#x27;s causing it?&quot; can make employees resentful of the company when the manager can&#x27;t actually make changes.<p>Many of these questions can also create a false expectation that it&#x27;s the manager&#x27;s job to solve all of the employees&#x27; problems for them. It&#x27;s important to listen to your team and work to improve their situations, but it&#x27;s equally important that you work on empowering them to solve their own problems where possible. A common mistake for first time managers is to try to absorb every small issue their team encounters, which creates an unsustainable atmosphere of dependency on the manager.<p>Another common mistake of first-time managers is forgetting that managers must also represent the company to the employee. As a first time manager, it&#x27;s tempting to think you&#x27;re going to be the super manager you never had, using your powers to fight back against the company and make everything right for your employees. In reality, you need to balance the employee&#x27;s wishes against the company&#x27;s direction. You can&#x27;t force the tail to wag the dog. Make sure you communicate what is and isn&#x27;t within your power to change. Avoid commiserating with employees with employees about minutia, and instead set a tone of professionalism and reasonable boundary-setting.<p>Most importantly: Don&#x27;t forget to reiterate the organization&#x27;s goals, project updates, and other company information to employees. It&#x27;s easy for managers to forget that their employees might not see or hear important developments unless their manager communicates it down the chain. As a manager, it&#x27;s your job to keep your employees informed and up to date. Simple updates in the form of &quot;Your work on X project is very important for the delivery of Y product, which the CEO identified as our top priority for retaining customers&quot; are much more effective than &quot;When do you think X project will be finished? We really need it.&quot; Context and relevance are critical for helping your team make the right decisions."],"time":["2020-02-16 16:19:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kreetx"],"id":[22342059],"kids":[22342079],"parent":[22341138],"text":["I don&#x27;t understand the negative attitudes here.

I&#x27;m a diplomat, and currently learning my fourth language to the C1+ level.<p>When we learn languages, it&#x27;s a full time job. It was 9 months to learn Mandarin to a  B1, 6 months to a C1+ in Spanish, and I&#x27;m currently at a B1 in Estonian after 5 months.<p>There are several things I think are crucial after years of full time study (note: this assumes you&#x27;re going for professional fluency, not just touring around the country where interactions are largely scripted and predictable):<p>* There is no substitute for production - you must speak the language with a native speaker (not an app) and talk about topics that are relevant to the kind of scenarios you anticipate. We spend the first several months discussing current events in target language - at first scripted, then later free form. This builds vocabulary and helps fluency. This is quickly expanded to discussing current events in depth and participating in mock debates.<p>* Give mini presentations - target 3-5 minutes of talking about a relevant topic with little prep time. The difference between intermediate and advanced is the ability to move from discussing only facts to making a coherent argument. Native speakers will often not be able to follow your train of thought without learning to connect cause and effect using structures appropriate for your language.<p>* Interview native speakers - prepare 2-3 questions about a particular topic and check your comprehension by translating their answers to English. This obviously helps build your comprehension, but also helps to learn to &quot;automate&quot; comprehension while you are thinking about something else. If you can take notes in English while a native speaker is talking at normal speed (and achieving 90%+ accuracy), it will make it easier for you to participate in normal speed conversations.<p>* Read target language news - this is critical for expanding vocabulary and learning colocations - knowing what verbs are used in particular contexts (e.g., do they say &quot;I talked <i>with<\/i> X&quot; or &quot;I talked <i>to<\/i> X&quot;. Do they say country X shot, launched, or threw a rocket?)<p>Bottom line - language learning is not just about the number of hours you put in. The quality and type of practice you do matters a lot. You aren&#x27;t going to be fluent via Duolingo alone.
