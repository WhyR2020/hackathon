Which is definitely high, though primarily for those who sell externally licensed and&#x2F;or non-digital goods.<p>But to me (with my almost decade long iOS developer experience), the bigger problems are:<p>* You cannot install apps on an iPhone (even on a phone that you own) without paying Apple. Without a developer account, an app that you build and self sign works for only 7 days.<p>* If you are an app that exists on other platforms, and&#x2F;or accepts payments on other platforms, you can&#x27;t describe that or even link to it, from your iOS app. Your users need to know that the alternative options exist on their own. See the Netflix sign in screen for a nice example, but realize that 99% of apps won&#x27;t get away with that, only apps the size of Netflix can.<p>* You can only ship apps that Apple&#x27;s inconsistent review board agrees with. And of course, the rules and their inconsistent application keep changing in favor of Apple&#x27;s competing apps, which of course have access to internal APIs and don&#x27;t pay a 30% cut either. Spotify is a good example here, but it&#x27;s worse for many smaller companies.<p>* And now macOS is adopting the worst of iOS&#x27; draconian policies. You won&#x27;t be able to run non-notarized apps on macOS on Apple Silicon based computers at all.<p>Unfortunately there are many who drink the Apple koolaid about all of this being all about security. There are legitimately good things that Apple does which enhance user security, and I welcome changes like the new IDFA policy of iOS 14, but let&#x27;s not pretend that Apple does those because they affect Apple&#x27;s competitors&#x27; business and strengthen Apple&#x27;s (you have to now use Apple&#x27;s sdk for user tracking).<p>But none of the things I wrote about above are about the user, and some of them are actively worse for Apple&#x27;s users  (eg: not being able to buy a book on the Kindle app easily)."],"time":["2020-08-20 18:27:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nostrademons"],"id":[24223746],"kids":[24224518,24223982,24225466,24224600,24223822,24230656,24226241,24228586],"parent":[24222808],"text":["I&#x27;d bet that their end goal is to get them broken up, and have the app store separated from the product.

If you read the copy on the current intermix.io website, I think you&#x27;ll find yourself nodding. (FYI - we got bought by a small PE Fund that is rolling the product into Xplenty, an ETL product).<p>My experience is that monitoring data quality is a still an under-appreciated discipline.

I think giving your users a space where they can take action is a super value-add, we didn&#x27;t have that.<p>- nice work running the tests inside the customer&#x27;s warehouse. That has two benefits for you. 1) you&#x27;re not incurring the cost to crunch the metadata, it can get quite expensive, depending on the number of tables in the warehouse. 2) you&#x27;re avoiding data access issues, getting access to the warehouse was always a hurdle, even though we only needed access to the system tables.<p>- pricing model. I think the per-seat model is the way to go. We tried charging by number of rows, and size of the warehouse (number of nodes), but then you run into weird situations with customers who are dealing with huge historic datasets, but really only look at the last 30 of data.<p>My unsolicited $0.02 is that you think hard about distribution.

Before we begin, we would like to say we&#x27;re really sorry for the inconvenience that was caused by our previous report (Dirty COW). This report is regarding another set of security vulnerabilities we found in another chipset maker, this time in the MediaTek chipset. We&#x27;ll explain what happened and how we work to prevent issues like this in the future.<p>&gt; First of all, we want to thank CTS (h__ps:&#x2F;&#x2F;cts.cudenver.edu&#x2F;) for providing an open program that allows researchers like us to do responsible disclosures. Through their Vulnerability Reporting Program, we were able to report the issues we found to MediaTek and work with them to make sure these issues get patched for your safety.<p>&gt; What Happened?<p>&gt; This is a story about two bugs we found in the last few months.<p>&gt; The first bug (CVE-2017-05591) was an overly permissive domain validation in the bootloader. The bootloader allows the modem to be updated without flashing the complete firmware. The validation is done using the bootloader code running in the processor of the phone. This allowed us to inject our own bootloader code into the program running on the processor and bypass the authentication of the modem. The modem is responsible for communication with the network. In other words, by bypassing the authentication of the modem we can control the phone communication channels.<p>&gt; The second bug (CVE-2017-95881) is a buffer overflow in a very special program called TrustZone. The TrustZone is a security processor in most of the recent phones. It runs a separate operating system in which the kernel is trusted to be free of any malicious code, and has access to the memory, CPU and devices. The TrustZone kernel code runs outside the control of any other code. This bug in the TrustZone code allowed us to replace it with a custom one we designed, without any permissions.<p>&gt; We wrote a special TrustZone kernel code that allows us to gain full control over the phone. It allowed us to bypass all the phone security restrictions. With this custom TrustZone kernel code running, we were able to read the encrypted messages sent by any application. In addition, we also got full control over the device.<p>But finally the AI lost the context, and the topic shifted from insecure to security, and eventually the writing becomes a new marketing advertisement on a secure smartphone, which I&#x27;ve removed in the quote."],"time":["2020-08-21 04:16:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24231272],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-21 04:13:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[24230959],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-21 03:21:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[24230844],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-21 03:04:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["tomc1985"],"id":[24229112],"kids":{},"parent":[24225685],"text":["Every time I see GPT-3 I gsub &quot;Fancypants Markov Chains&quot; and the story always becomes a lot more breathless"],"time":["2020-08-20 23:18:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["KMag"],"id":[24222684],"kids":[24224647],"parent":[24208663],"text":["This article starts out talking about Linux address space layout.

Occasionally they&#x27;re made by an entity which has the sole power to determine outcome, whether by controlling events (discretion of action) or judgement (&quot;It&#x27;s not who votes that counts, but who counts the votes,&quot; as Stalin is claimed to have said).  See also rigged courts and selection committees.<p>Which affords another principle:  be wary those who determine both decisions <i>and<\/i> the assessment of outcomes.  A recent exchange on HN saw the claim that the US Federal Reserve had changed its definition of inflation.  A response correctly noted that whilst the Fed&#x27;s Dual Mandate is to <i>manage<\/i> both inflation and unemployment, both are <i>measured<\/i> by a different entity:  the U.S. Department of Labour.<p>Rather than penalise error, we should instead <i>look to its causes and responses<\/i>.  Is the source <i>systematically biased<\/i>?  Was there <i>poor data<\/i>?  Was <i>analysis<\/i> flawed?  Did the source simply have a <i>bad model<\/i> or <i>poor conceptual grasp<\/i>, arguably the case for Krugman&#x27;s Internet blunder.  Or were they simply careless, and the prediction itself a trivial non-serious cherry-picked element of their work?  That&#x27;s Krugman&#x27;s own admission along with, again, his admission of error:<p><i>I must have tossed it off quickly (at the time I was mainly focused on the Asian financial crisis!), then later conflated it in my memory with the NYT piece. Anyway, I was clearly trying to be provocative, and got it wrong, which happens to all of us sometimes.<\/i>[6]<p>Worse than those who ignore or fail to  correct errors are those who become defensive, engage in projection, invoke  <i>tu quoque<\/i> and whatabboutism, who become hostile and abusive, who deny, and&#x2F;or hide their past, often through secrecy classifications, assertions of privilage, NDAs, nondisparagement contracts, gag orders, outright threats, or unhealthful tea.<p>There&#x27;s one worse level yet:  Those who are openly and flagrantly indifferent to the truth.<p>Such actors are very nearly always dangerous of themselves, whether through presumed or actual immunity or impunity.  The dynamic is well-described in Adam Curtis&#x27;s documentary <i>HyperNormalisation<\/i>.[7]<p>Any circumstance in which factual statements are rewarded for anything <i>other<\/i> than truth valence is ultimately perversely selecting.  This may be punishing bad news, favouring good, or rewarding (usually short-term)  profit (or audience) over truth value.  This last makes any advertising-supported medium inherently suspect.<p>There are four fallacies associated with smart people being stupid:<p>- Egocentrism: overly self-centered, stop caring about outcomes for others.<p>- Omniscience: surround themselves with sycophants.<p>- Omnipotence: believe they can do anything.<p>- Invulnerability: believe they can get away with anything.<p>There&#x27;s a large literature on truth detection.

Except that it&#x27;s not even wrong.<p>To give just one example, rates of alcoholism are higher in South India - both in TN and Kerala [1] - where endemic poverty of the Madhya Pradesh kind doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>We can agree that addiction is widespread and there&#x27;s been a world wide shift in the spending habits of people who earn less than a dollar a day. Banerjee&#x2F;Duflo&#x27;s Nobel Prize is based on that work [2]. Some relevant quotes:<p>&gt; Yet the average person living at under $1 per day does not seem to put every available penny into buying more calories. Among our 13 countries, food typically represents from 56 to 78 percent of consumption among rural households, and 56 to 74 percent in urban areas. For the rural poor in Mexico, slightly less than half the budget (49.6 percent) is allocated to food.2<p>&gt; Of course, these people could be spending the rest of their money on other commodities they greatly need. Yet among the nonfood items that the poor spend significant amounts of money on, alcohol and tobacco show up prominently. The extremely poor in rural areas spent 4.1 percent of their budget on tobacco and alcohol in Papua New Guinea; 5.0 percent in Udaipur, India; 6.0 percent in Indonesia; and 8.1 percent in Mexico.<p>&gt; Perhaps more surprisingly, spending on festivals is an important part of the budget for many extremely poor households. In Udaipur, over the course of the previous year, more than 99 percent of the extremely poor households spent money on a wedding, a funeral, or a religious festival.

A secure system with a switch to turn off the security might work for Linux and a highly technical user, but when you’ve given smartphones to a few billion people, a secure system with a switch to turn off the security is just a target for malware.<p>One of the things I found very frustrating about this article is that it fails to remember the actual history: when the iPhone first came out, jailbreaks were plentiful and powerful... the iPhone tried to be a closed and locked down platform, <i>but failed<\/i> due to the almost continual existence of serious security flaws that allowed for 0-day drops of exploits with almost every new device release (which coincided with every new major iOS release).<p>This means that we can actually look back at the history of the iPhone and answer the question &quot;could the iPhone have been as successful as it was if there had been a switch that allowed users to opt out of Apple&#x27;s complete control of not only whose apps could be installed, but further what <i>kind<\/i> of software could be installed (to let you install things like daemons or extensions to existing apps)&quot; and the answer is &quot;apparently, it could, because it did&quot;.<p>In fact, it is the opposite question that we <i>can&#x27;t<\/i> easily answer: &quot;would the iPhone have been as successful as it was <i>without<\/i> the ability to opt out of Apple&#x27;s closed ecosystem?&quot;... and this is a question where the answer is not at all obvious: for many many years the iPhone very poorly satisfied the needs of users in many countries, and jailbreaking filled the gap. Apple didn&#x27;t get around to having a good Chinese keyboard until iOS 5 or 6 or so, and so Baidu maintained one and seriously encouraged users of their search engine to jailbreak from their landing page. Meanwhile, the feature set was in some real sense anemic, and jailbreaking also filled <i>that<\/i> gap: as a trivial example, Steve Jobs seemed very anti-wallpaper, a feature which didn&#x27;t appear until iOS 4... the number of people who jailbroke just to install wallpaper was incredible ;P.<p>And honestly, I think Apple sort of knew that: I had always gotten the distinct impression that they considered the bugs used by people who jailbroke to be pretty low priority, and they would sometimes remain unfixed for months on end. At some point, the iPhone started to get &quot;good enough&quot; by default, and it was only then that Apple really started to turn down the screws, deciding to fix bugs quickly and even hire jailbreakers who never believed in the cause--those who were willing to play the game as a mercenary for hire--to defend the platform instead of being on the offensive. Today, jailbreaking thereby feels like a niche ecosystem, but it <i>mattered<\/i> for at least half the history of the iPhone, with something like 12% of users being jailbroken (it would quickly fall a bit on new firmware releases and then rise back up).<p>The reality is that <i>innovation<\/i> happens on platforms because of the ability for people to make modifications and enhancements without having to wait for the platform vendor: if iOS had succeeded in truly being a closed ecosystem, Baidu would not have been able to build custom keyboards to support Chinese users as Apple didn&#x27;t get around to supporting third-party custom keyboards until iOS 8. Open platforms thereby get new features faster and can support the needs of many more users from any number of market subsets. Yes: it is the case that a closed system can sort of try to satisfy the needs of at least most people, but you don&#x27;t get there overnight, and even coming up with sane extensibility hooks takes time. The real experiment has thus only recently begun: can a platform where only a single company can decide how to deploy new features continue to maintain its relevance going forward?"],"time":["2020-08-20 18:48:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tonywastaken"],"id":[24228092],"kids":[24228201],"parent":[24208704],"text":["Why don&#x27;t disgruntled app developers just pull their apps from the app stores?

The master tells them that the mind, neither the flag nor the wind, is what is moving.<p>Both sides of the interpretative coin are needed. We must simultaneously understand that QM is epistemic and also that QM is contextual. The author asks,<p>&gt; How do probabilities get into QM?<p>Because knowledge of physical systems is always limited and QM is epistemic, all quantities we manipulate in QM are probabilistic. Further, the Kochen-Specker Theorem requires that some measurements be not fully determined by past history, as a matter of living in at least three dimensions of space. Finally, basic linear logic allows us to replicate most of QM&#x27;s effects with macrostates.<p>While Schrödinger hated this and used his famous cat thought-experiment to try to refute it, children learn about linear logic and probabilities in macrostates when they are given random toys or packs of trading cards, and today we recognize that it really is possible to condition relatively large differences in macrostate observations on single entangled or otherwise-prepared microstates.<p>&gt; In the [Everett] realist approach the history of the world is endlessly splitting;<p>Eh, kind of?

So it turns out that Everett&#x27;s many-worlds analysis is a little tautological.<p>&gt; But how can something so nonlocal represent reality?<p>Finally, a good deep question. There are two parts to the answer, and each are deep enough to warrant a series of lectures. First, the Kochen-Specker Theorem, combined with general relativity, leads to the Free Will Theorem: When we measure particles, we are sending them a query, and they choose how to respond to the query from among the possible replies.

Specific impulse could max out at ~12,000 seconds, drastically higher than the roughly 2,000 s from current hall thrusters. VASIMR creates thrust through a multi-step process. First, it bombards a neutral gas with RF energy in helical waves to ionize the gas and create plasma (it can use multiple gases: argon, hydrogen, or even CO2). Then, it uses magnetic fields and an additional RF coupler to contain and energize the plasma to a superheated state (in the neighborhood of the temperature of the Sun’s core). Finally, a magnetic nozzle ejects the plasma at exceptionally high velocity.

It is closely related to flat-earth, though there is one significant difference: YEC is overtly religious, and specifically Christian.  Other than that many of the forms of argument are the same.  From that experience I have made two observations:<p>1.  These people are not idiots (at least the YECs aren&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t speak for the flat-earthers) and to dismiss them as idiots who will just go away is a serious mistake.  They are <i>very<\/i> good at presenting convincing-sounding arguments, and refuting them can actually be quite challenging.<p>2.  The root of their reasoning is a tacit acceptance of teleology, which cannot be <i>logically<\/i> refuted.  They approach existential questions with the <i>assumption<\/i> that there has to be some kind of point to existence, some transcendent meaning or purpose.  If you accept this premise, then there is actually a logically defensible line of reasoning that leads you to Christianity and thence to the inerrancy of the Bible, and thence to YEC (and even a flat earth if you&#x27;re really being intellectually honest!)  A failure to appreciate this is IMHO one of the reasons that the secular world is having such a hard time effectively resisting these movements.  A life without purpose makes no sense to these people, just as a theory at odds with the data makes no sense to someone with a scientific mindset.  So if science leads you to the conclusion that life has no transcendent purpose (and it does) then, on their world-view, science must be wrong, full stop.

The message was simple: don&#x27;t be those people, listen to the scientific evidence. At the time I thought it was a compelling story, then I found out the story is a myth. [0] Ancient Greeks knew in the 5th century BC that it was round, by the 600s it was more or less unanimously supported by scholars. I&#x27;ve struggled to find a time in history when there was a serious, organized group that believed the earth was flat. Except for now that is, the uncomfortable truth is that this, right now, in 2020, is the peak of flat earth belief in human history.

Who are all the extras that are hanging out at the dig site?

Fished it out for y&#x27;all.<p>&gt; The day after hearing about the Conway knot problem, Piccirillo, then 27, sat down at her desk and began looking for a solution. Because much of her graduate work involved building pairs of knots that were different but shared some 4-D properties, she already knew that any two knots that share the same 4-D space also share sliceness — they’re either both slice or both not slice. Since her goal was to prove that the Conway knot wasn’t slice, her first step was come up with an entirely different knot with the same four-dimensional space, she explains. “Then I’ll try to show that the other knot isn’t slice.”<p>&gt; She spent spare time over the next several days hand-sketching and manipulating configurations of the 4-D space occupied by the Conway knot. “I didn’t allow myself to work on it during the day,” she told Quanta Magazine earlier this year, “because I didn’t consider it to be real math. I thought it was, like, my homework.”<p>&gt; The next step was to try to prove that the knot she drew was not slice. “There are lots of tools already in the literature for doing that,” she says. She would feed the knot iterations into a computer, “and based on the data of the knot, maybe based on how its crossings look or other data that you can pull from the knot, the algorithm spits out an integer.” In less than a week, Piccirillo had created a knot that hit the sweet spot: It had the same 4-D properties as the Conway knot, and it was found by the algorithm to be not slice.<p>&gt; She had suddenly succeeded where countless mathematicians had failed for five decades.

I suspect that they did that specifically\nbecause they couldn&#x27;t really prevent people to share the URL to the image\ndirectly since that&#x27;s a standard feature of the web, so by adding galleries they\ncan &quot;lock in&quot; the content.

In other words, &quot;I&quot; open reddit when &quot;I&quot; want to.<p>2. I haven&#x27;t accessed mobile site in a while but (hopefully) it won&#x27;t have infinite scrolling which means I tire quickly of clicking &quot;Next&quot; and leave the site. An app removes this possibility<p>3.

The larger their user population, the more diverse their user base is and the harder it gets to cater to the needs of each type of user. The folks commenting here are a vocal minority, an important one given many people here are probably early adopters and also have the skills needed to build a Reddit competitor, but it&#x27;s hard to see the reactions of this minority on a dashboard. A problem worth solving IMO but non trivial.<p>Typically initiatives like this come from a team within the company who&#x27;s objective is to improve a key metric, in this case let&#x27;s say user engagement. Some individual in the team probably spotted the trend that users on the app are more engaged than users on mobile web browsers. They then launched an experiment to test getting users over to the mobile app. Many users who end up on reddit via SEO probably don&#x27;t know that reddit has an app and on seeing this end up downloading the app which makes them more engaged with reddit. Overall on the dashboard this shows up as a win where user engagement in the enabled group is up compared to the control and given that they give users an option to continue using the web app there is not a significant user drop. At this point, a decision needs to be made on whether to ship this change or not to ship. Folks making this decision do understand that it might be annoying to some people but the data in this case overwhelmingly supports a ship decision. They talk about it, mention their reservations, but eventually make a decision given the data and don&#x27;t think about it anymore. They also don&#x27;t have to feel the pain as most employees have the reddit app installed and don&#x27;t see this again and again.<p>The key thing to know here is that there are lots of incentives in the company to make this decision a ship decision vs a no-ship decision - the data, the success of the team, the success of the individual who pioneered this change but there is not enough evidence or visible push from users to not make this change. Let&#x27;s say there are some customer reports for this but unless they reach a very high volume no one is going to notice it.<p>Posts and discussions like this are actually a great way to get your word known to companies. This will probably stir a conversation in the team that made this change and hopefully bring out some change in the experience. Don&#x27;t expect it to go away but maybe they will remember your preference of not wanting to use the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 21:11:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
