So many modern applications construct their UI tediously by coding each component and all of the aggregations by hand.  If you take a step back, it&#x27;s usually very easy to see that the configuration of the UI is just data.  Why not just build one layout &quot;engine&quot; and feed it data to generate your UI?  The engine part can use whatever hotness you like, but you only have to write that code once.  The configuration of the UI (the policy) is what changes frequently (the business requirements); not the mechanism underneath. (This doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t have to change the mechanism, you will.  It just requires change at a much slower pace and the changes are bound within the context of the mechanism itself.)<p>This approach separates layers of a system which have different change vectors and velocities.  The mechanism tends to have a much lower rate of change and it&#x27;s where we programmers like to live.

Usually, languages won’t change often, so you can rely on most of those features. Certain well-maintained libraries and APIs won’t change much, so those can usually be baked-in too. The business logic around things like pricing, users, analytics, data visualization, and data processing are likely to have changes. My favorite one for web apps with databases is search.

TypeScript has completely changed how I look at JavaScript particularly its use of interfaces for defining objects and data structures.<p>* Limit your use of dependencies as much as possible.  In my current personal project I am down to 1 dependency.  Dependencies will weigh a project down and prevent nimble shifts of direction.  This also includes frameworks and tools.<p>* Write good documentation and keep it up to date.  Automate the authoring of documentation where you can so that it stays up to date with less manual intervention.<p>* Isolate concerns as much as possible so that a feature can be deleted and replaced with as little effort as possible.<p>* Keep things simple.  This requires lots of extra effort both in planning and refactoring.  When there are fewer pieces and everything is as uniform or consistent change requires far less effort and leaves far less dead code in its place.<p>* Don&#x27;t abstract things for convenience or easiness.  Abstractions are incredibly helpful when they result in simplicity (fewer pieces and fewer ways of doing things).  Absolutely don&#x27;t use abstractions as a means of being clever or for vanity reasons.  Then you just have extra code and the larger a project gets the harder it is test and change.<p>* When other people want to impose their opinions on you push back until they come back with test automation and&#x2F;or strong provable evidence of a better way of doing things.  If they still try to impose their opinions on you, and this will happen, kindly tell them to go fuck themselves.  So much of the stupidity in programming comes from baseless irrational subjectivity.<p>* Test automation.  Its not about how you test, but about what you test.  There is a lot of nonsense out there about how to test.  In my current personal project I have automation in place for code validation, compile checks, command tests in the terminal, service tests.  Soon, as I figure it out, I will be adding test automation for user interaction and user data storage.  However you are able to execute all the kinds of tests you need just do it.

The last one is an obscure bug where a file existence test seems to return bogus results (there is no file in the package cache dir, yet pacman does not go through the download step when such a file is missing, and fails with a NULL pointer assertion  as the later state is inconsistent. Same source code works with flying colors when built on a previous darwin). With some time I could probably add yet another patch to fix that, but I’m left wondering if it’s really worth it now, as if the trend continues as it did for the last three versions darwin20 will be even more painful to support, if at all.<p>ArchMac is not the only one impacted, e.g<p>- nix found a workaround to install on &#x2F;nix but it’s a pain involving APFS volumes and synthetic.conf<p>- homebrew relies on ruby which will be removed in a future version<p>- with the impending Damocles sword of notarized binaries it will be a serious pain to do package management<p>And that’s just the most structural ones.

It seems like people are severely underrating the flu and always have been. Remember when we closed all restaurants and bars and suspended all sports events when the flu killed an estimated 1 million people in 1968-1969? No you don’t because society seemed to have shrugged that one off. Ditto for many years when the flu kills upwards of 600k worldwide [1]\n2. The reported CFR (Case Fatality Rates) across different countries is all over the place causing a lot of panic and overstated mortality rates. Countries like Italy report almost 7% whereas in Germany and South Korea, the CFR makes Covid-19 look like no big deal (Closer to 0.1%). I suspect that’s because Italy is well under counting the true denominator, while countries like SK have tested thousands of people per day making their data much more comprehensive.<p>There’s something unique about this year’s outbreak that seems to resonate deeply with more people. Ultimately it’s definitely not “just the flu” but it’s closer to that then a guaranteed death sentence.<p>We may see more damage from the secondary effects (people losing jobs, runs on medicine and supplies causing people to die) than from the virus itself.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H3N2#Hong_Kong_Flu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H3...<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak_data\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:2019%E2%80%9320_cor...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-16 08:22:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["smt1"],"id":[22590688],"kids":{},"parent":[22590458],"text":["From  How the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Compares with COVID-19:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-03-10&#x2F;how-coronavirus-compares-with-2009-s-h1n1-in-spread-and-Freaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-03-10&#x2F;how-co...<\/a><p>For example: Why was H1N1 allowed to spread around the world more or less unchecked, while countries are going to far greater lengths to try to halt Covid-19? Why did the WHO call H1N1 a pandemic but not Covid-19? Isn’t 12,469 deaths a lot worse than the 26 that have been attributed to Covid-19 in the U.S. so far?<p>That last one is the simplest to answer: Covid-19 is near the beginning of its spread in the U.S., and thus cannot be compared with H1N1’s effect over a full year. If the U.S. death toll from Covid-19 is only 12,469 a year from now, that will likely be counted as a great success. The legitimate worry is that it could be many, many times higher, because Covid-19 is so much deadlier for those who get it than the 2009 H1N1 influenza was.<p>How much deadlier is still unknown, but of the cases reported to the WHO so far 3.4% have resulted in fatalities. That’s probably misleadingly high because there are so many unreported cases, and in South Korea, which has done the best job of keeping up with the spread of the virus through testing, the fatality rate so far is about 0.7%. But even that is 35 times worse than H1N1 in 2009 and 2010. Multiply 12,469 by 35 and you get 436,415 — which would amount to the biggest U.S. infectious-disease death toll since the 1918 flu. Hospitalization rates are also many times higher for Covid-19, meaning that if it spread as widely as H1N1 it would overwhelm the U.S. health-care system.<p>That’s one very important reason governments (and stock markets) around the world have reacted so much more strongly to Covid-19 than to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Another reason is somewhat more hope-inspiring. It’s that public health experts generally don’t think influenza can be controlled once it starts spreading, other than with a vaccine, whereas several Asian countries seem to have successfully turned back the coronavirus tide, for now at least.<p>Influenza can’t be controlled because as much as half the transmission of the disease occurs before symptoms appear. With Covid-19 that proportion seems to be lower, meaning that even though it’s more contagious than influenza once symptoms appear, it may be possible to control by testing widely and quickly isolating those who have the disease."],"time":["2020-03-16 08:11:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gorgoiler"],"id":[22590627],"kids":[22590643],"parent":[22590458],"text":["Gosh, the memories.

Yes, they are &quot;from Italy&quot;, but the title is disingenuous and misleading.<p>Note that the page lists &quot;the editors&quot; (of the magazine) as the authors, and the first signature is by the magazine&#x27;s publisher. The rest appear to be various academic personalities they have reached out to, many of them not from Italy or in Italy.<p>As for the contents, I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with the advice, but this letter is not particularly well written, nor particularly authoritative.<p>For example, this section:<p>&gt; The beginning of the outbreak had the exact same number of infections in China, Italy, and other countries. The difference is that China strongly and quickly locked down Wuhan and all of the Hubei region 8 days before Italy [3].<p>This is an exceedingly poor phrasing, almost seeming to suggest that the outbreak started with a few cases everywhere in the world at the same time. Inadvertently or not, this dovetails with China&#x27;s PR push trying to claim that the epidemic may not have started there (something that is readily disproven by all epidemiological and genetic evidence).<p>Even setting aside the potential for confusion, the claim on its face is clearly baseless. Maybe the outbreak started with ten people getting infected in the Wuhan wet market on the same day (if we go by the wet market theory), while in Italy it started with a single infected person entering the country. Or, vice versa, maybe in China it started from a single infected person, and in Italy it was brought in by ten different people carrying it into the country separately. Who&#x27;s to say?<p>At any rate, if you look at the source for that claim, you can see that it is shifting the timelines to align at some particular point in the outbreak, and it is comparing the time from that point when China imposed the Wuhan lockdown with the time when Italy imposed the whole-country lockdown.<p>The source is certainly more interesting, and gives a better picture of the situation than the letter does (although we have seen similar and better analyses in English for a while). However, the &quot;8 days&quot; figure is somewhat arbitrary. For example, Italy imposed a partial lockdown on the areas of the country where individual cases were found days before they shifted to a whole-country lockdown. Maybe that date should have been compared instead?<p>By the best information currently available, the first case in Italy came from a person who was infected in Germany. According to the letter&#x27;s claim, the outbreak starts with &quot;the exact same number of infections&quot; (one, presumably), and then grows at the same speed. But then Germany&#x27;s timeline should be ahead of Italy, yet it&#x27;s not.<p>Then there is the elephant in the room, of course. If you cannot rely on China&#x27;s lockdown to contain the infection, then the rational and prudent thing to do was not to wait for outbreaks in other countries and impose lockdowns there. It was to restrict and heavily control international travel (cancel flights, test all passengers, force visitors to quarantine, etc.). Would that have been accepted by the public? Would that have been accepted by the authors of this letter?<p>tl;dr: title is grossly misleading, please correct."],"time":["2020-03-15 01:29:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thehoomanist"],"id":[22580063],"kids":{},"parent":[22579598],"text":["Also someone from Italy here: never, ever praise China as it is the same authoritarian state that caused all these deaths by silencing the truth when it mattered the most.

How many back-to-back shifts should I allow? Should people&#x27;s shifts always start at the same time? Can I give some people regular 9-5 schedules? All of the above questions will decrease the strict optimality of the solution, but increase the happiness and long term retention of your workforce.

There is still some interest in optimization?  I&#x27;m shocked!  The message long was &quot;Operations Research is dead.&quot;<p>Gee, I got started in OR (operations research) at FedEx, covered a lot from some of the best people in grad school, taught it as a prof in B-school, and applied it to US national security and some commercial problems.<p>Good to see the interest in some of the flight operations work for Lufthansa -- I was considering (no great progress) some of those problems at FedEx!<p>One commercial problem was allocating marketing resources for some banks.  I was given the formulation, 0-1 integer linear programming with 600,000 variables and 40,000 constraints.  I derived some non-linear duality theory, used the IBM OSL (Optimization Subroutine Library), and in 500 iterations found a feasible solution with the objective function guaranteed to be within 0.025% of optimality!<p>Another commercial problem was some more marketing optimization.  It was also 0-1 integer linear programming, but surprisingly it was just a problem in least cost network flows.  That is also linear programming, but there the simplex algorithm takes on a special form where a basis is a spanning tree of arcs in the network.  A simplex pivot is to add an arc to the tree, thus, yielding a circuit, and running flow around the circuit in the direction that saves money and removing from the circuit, thus, making a tree again, one of the first arcs where the flow goes to zero.  There is a cute variation of the algorithm due to W. Cunningham (one of my profs) based on his <i>strongly feasible basis<\/i>, that avoids cycling.<p>A super nice point about the simplex problem on least cost network flows is if all the arc capacities are whole numbers and if start with an integer basic feasible solution, then the simplex algorithm will automatically maintain an integer basic feasible solution and terminate with an integer solution.  It is good to suspect that a lot of integer linear programming problems are actually just such network flow problems or nearly so.<p>Once I used that stuff to say, for NASA, how to assign signals to satellite channels to minimize some signal interference -- it was an example of the <i>bottleneck assignment<\/i> problem which should be solvable very quickly by some <i>post optimality<\/i> tweaking with the network simplex algorithm.<p>I enjoyed using the IBM OSL, but IBM withdrew it from marketing in about 2003, maybe in favor of marketing C-PLEX.  But it appears that at about 2004 IBM donated the source of the OSL (with lots of pieces, network flow, stochastic programming, etc.) to Riverware which might distribute the open source.<p>I got started with the OSL when I was in an AI group at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab where the OSL was written.  The Watson lab long had some high expertise in optimization -- Gomory (cutting planes, Gilmore-Gomory column generation, etc.) was head of the lab; there was Phil Wolfe (the Wolfe dual, etc.), Ellis Johnson (group theory and integer programming), etc.<p>So, in particular, if still want to do some OR and optimization, get some quite well written software, and save some money, then might look into getting all the IBM OSL code open source."],"time":["2020-03-15 16:36:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ralaruri"],"id":[22583998],"kids":{},"parent":[22582444],"text":["Google OR tools was an excellent resource when I was trying to solve a p-median problem in Python for my operations research course in school.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ralaruri&#x2F;Pmedian&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;PMedianRamziEditFinal.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ralaruri&#x2F;Pmedian&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;PMedianRamzi...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-15 16:34:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["weitzj"],"id":[22582948],"kids":{},"parent":[22582444],"text":["I would imagine that this tool would be helpful if you connect it with a social graph, i.e. self organizing Facebook groups which help each other take care of each other’s children during the Corona outbreak or schedule incident response teams in an organization,like:” who has to  work together?

The settings include the characters to use (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and symbols - each a boolean - so, 4 options for a total of 16 combinations; there is also a length parameter defaulting to 16 - but lets assume that users primarily use 8 - 20 for a total of 12 different values. This gives us a total of 12 * 16 = 192 total values for the settings field). The user is expected to remember the counter in some way - but the default is 1 and we can assume that most users have a counter value somewhere between 1 and 10. The function F() hashes all this stuff up in some sort of unchangeable way (changing it would modify every password and would thus render the whole thing useless) and produces the random password. Let&#x27;s note: the url of the site and the username are both public information. As above, the settings field has ~192 possible values. And the counter has ~10 possible values. The only thing that has significant entropy is the master_password.<p>So, we have an equation that looks like: site_password = F(url, username, counter, settings, master_password). But, as above, we know url and username and there are only about 1,920 combinations that are likely for settings and counter.<p>Let&#x27;s say you use this to generate a password for some site that stores the password in plain text. If an attacker gets that password, they now have the opportunity to brute for the master_password value. A GPU based attacked can attempt a very large number of passwords per second (hundreds of thousands to billions per second, depending on how F() works) in a fully offline manner - the only thing slowing them down is that each master password that they check has to be rechecked against each of the 1,920 combinations for settings and counter. This slowdown is extremely minor when the attacker can run a tremendous number of guesses for the master_password in parallel. The settings and counter field basically work as a salt - but unlike a real salt value that would generally be a 32 or 64 bit number, this salt is super tiny.<p>Anyway, a competent attacker will figure out how to brute force the master_password without too much effort. And the big problem is that that master_password can then be used directly to calculate the site_password for every other site that you log into. A couple reasonable guesses about what counter you used and what settings you likely used for your bank (likely the defaults) and the attacker is in.<p>The combination of settings and counter provide no real security. If a password is stolen from some random low-value website, the attacker has an easy way to figure out your master_password and thus your site_password for actually valuable sites. You have no way to defeat this outside of changing your master_password - which changes the site_password for every site you use which more or less defeats the entire purpose of this scheme.<p>Realistically, the biggest security benefit of this scheme is that almost no one uses this type of stateless password manager because of the other obvious ergonomic problems (ie: you have to somehow remember the value of counter and settings that you picked - which is a pain to do for more than a couple websites). But, that is security through obscurity which has long been (rightly) viewed as bad security.<p>Don&#x27;t use this. Don&#x27;t use any stateless password manager. It&#x27;s fake security."],"time":["2020-03-15 06:15:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yetanotherjosh"],"id":[22594803],"kids":{},"parent":[22580719],"text":["Please try 1Password or LastPass before you shoot yourself in the foot with something so unjustifiably insecure and functionally-hobbled as this. You&#x27;ll see those apps are no hassle at all, this stateless approach really doesn&#x27;t gain you anything but does cost you a lot.<p>What are the upsides to a stateless approach? Convenience&#x2F;simplicity? When you look at the guessing game you have to play to get the right login with this, or the eventual personal state management you&#x27;ll need to track exceptions, it&#x27;s certainly not simpler in practice. Price? LastPass is free for personal use. Works offline? So do LastPass&#x2F;1Password so long as you set them up first. AFAIK there are literally no upsides to this.<p>What are the downsides? Review this thread, all the big ones have been mentioned and there are more:<p>- Master password cannot be changed<p>- If master password is compromised, all your passwords are compromised, regardless of device. (For proper password managers, master password gets access only on the physical devices on which it&#x27;s been synchronized and you can revoke a stolen vault&#x27;s online authorization remotely.)<p>- Rotating a compromised password requires remembering you did it, or a guessing game to find the right iteration of a counter variable.<p>- Master password must be typed in full every time to get a site password. This will encourage you to have a short master password.<p>- Doesn&#x27;t autofill login forms for you, requires copy&#x2F;tab&#x2F;paste.<p>- Master password is typed into a web browser for every single password. Browsers are generally a less secure runtime context than a native application.<p>- Doesn&#x27;t remember the email&#x2F;username you used for services.<p>- Exceptions to password rules imposed by websites (length&#x2F;character requirements or exclusions) cannot be tracked<p>- It&#x27;s not always clear what the name of the site&#x2F;service is to use for the hash function inputs. Is is mybank.com or secure.login.mybank.com? Another guessing game.<p>- Many items above mean you will end up wanting some kind of state to track the stuff this doesn&#x27;t deal with, and now you&#x27;ve implemented your own state solution which is surely far worse than what LastPass or 1Password have built.<p>One &quot;upside&quot; people might claim is that LastPass&#x2F;1Password state servers can be hacked (LastPass was hacked once I think?). But this actually isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it sounds. If attackers get a bunch of (encrypted) vaults, they still have to brute force every vault individually. Furthermore, these providers have everything to lose in terms of reputation if they are hacked, so are financially incentivized to maintain the highest degree of system and software security. Compare that to this solution, which in every way trades aways security and has basically nil financial incentive for secure implementation.<p><i>I keep editing my post to add more reasons not to use this thing.

As is almost always the case with history, the truth is a bit more nuanced and needs more than one conservative&#x27;s blog for a full treatment.<p>The policy did come directly from Henry Ford [1], and in 1926, Ford himself wrote:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;The owner, the employees, and the buying public are all one and the same, and unless an industry can so manage itself as to keep wages high and prices low it destroys itself, for otherwise it limits the number of its customers. One’s own employees ought to be one’s own best customers.&quot;<\/i> [ibid]<p>Although employee turnover may have been a factor, the source material for Tim Worstall&#x27;s quoted excerpt in 2012 continued,<p>&gt; <i>&quot;The $5-a-day rate was about half pay and half bonus. The bonus came with character requirements and was enforced by the Socialization Organization. This was a committee that would visit the employees&#x27; homes to ensure that they were doing things the &quot;American way.&quot; They were supposed to avoid social ills such as gambling and drinking. They were to learn English, and many (primarily the recent immigrants) had to attend classes to become &quot;Americanized.&quot; Women were not eligible for the bonus unless they were single and supporting the family. Also, men were not eligible if their wives worked outside the home. Other groups also offered classes to help immigrants and southern blacks adapt to the Detroit area, but none were so prominent as the Ford plan.&quot;<\/i> [2]<p>And this is where so much more of the nuance really comes in to play, because Ford was a complex character. Among his complexities was a really paternalistic view of his workers and of society; he believed in an idealized, perfect society, and sought to create it and to force others to live in it. [3]<p>The $5-a-day plan solved a handful of problems then. It gave Ford a lot of free advertising in the press, it added a significant amount of pressure to his competitors, it ultimately made his automobile a little bit cheaper, and it supported his paternalism for his workers.<p>You could do worse for a modern analogue for Henry Ford than Elon Musk. He&#x27;s a really divisive figure in a lot of discussions, alternately driven by impassioned visions of a hypothetical society and by larger-than-normal faults. He makes decisions that are part business and part ideology, and so did Ford.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saturdayeveningpost.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;ford-doubles-minimum-wage&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saturdayeveningpost.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;ford-doubles-min...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20121224153214&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.michigan.gov&#x2F;dnr&#x2F;0,1607,7-153-54463_18670_18793-53441--,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20121224153214&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.michig...<\/a><p>[3]: Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford&#x27;s Forgotten Jungle City"],"time":["2020-03-15 19:05:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["austincheney"],"id":[22585218],"kids":[22585247],"parent":[22584241],"text":["The article centers on this:<p>&gt; The point is not so as to be paying a &quot;decent wage&quot; or anything of that sort: it is to be paying a higher wage than other employers.<p>There are a couple of key take things to take away from that.<p>* The employer is less pressured to find candidates.  Candidates will find the employer if it means double wages.<p>* The employer has more choices.  They aren&#x27;t locked into settling for somebody vaguely competent from a limited pool of applicants.<p>* Employees are locked in knowing they cannot go somewhere else for equivalent money.<p>Despite those points there are limitations to this approach.  For example, I have known many low income people who would not join the military even though it could mean double or more in wages.  Likewise I have also known many people who refuse to get into software knowing they could double their wages.  I would also be willing to accept lower wages elsewhere if the work were engaging and meaningful (however a person defines meaningful).<p>The only way that super high wages make sense numerically is if it results in retaining employees for a longer enough period to reduce expenses of employee replacement over a satisfactory time period and results in a premium on choice of employee from the population at large.<p>Wages alone won&#x27;t provide a combination of those though.  There has to be something in addition that makes the employer stand out in world class fashion.  That could be unique opportunities, superior training, an accreditation program, research recognition, or something else.  If this is missing the organization is going to swell with a certain percentage of bad candidates that will decay the organization over time from the inside out.<p>Government agencies emphasize the later more than the former because they have budget limitations on what they are allowed to pay employees and because the later has proven more historically reliable at retainment."],"time":["2020-03-15 19:00:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baybal2"],"id":[22585722],"kids":[22591140],"parent":[22584241],"text":["You boss being generous does not have to mean him being lax.<p>Laxity and lack of seriousness are bad for the company.

(Though it&#x27;s variable, e.g. by directly reloading <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intmath.com&#x2F;cg5&#x2F;katex-mathjax-comparison.php?processor=MathJax3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intmath.com&#x2F;cg5&#x2F;katex-mathjax-comparison.php?pro...<\/a> enough times, I was able sometimes to get load times for MathJax faster than some load times for KaTeX.)<p>• It is surprisingly difficult to get a clear answer to <i>what<\/i> exactly one gets in MathJax, in return for this slower speed. One relatively clear thing is that MathJax supports more features, e.g. last I tried something I considered basic was unavailable in KaTeX (IIRC it was adding a \\label to an equation and referring to it again elsewhere in the page with \\ref). But beyond that, if everything one needs happens to be supported by KaTeX, are there still reasons to use MathJax? One would imagine that someone on the MathJax team, or even a devoted user, would have such a list somewhere, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find one.<p>• One thing I remember reading is that MathJax takes a fundamentally different approach, and that a lot of the time it spends is in measuring things on the page to get things exactly right, while KaTeX is looser about things. I do notice just now that on my mobile, where I have accessibility features turned on to zoom text to a larger default font size, with MathJax (on the above comparison page) all the equations are scaled up such that the font size of symbols in the page matches the font size of surrounding text, while KaTeX gets this wrong. What is the extent of such differences?<p>• Both MathJax and KaTeX support server-side rendering, and the speed differences vanish (for the reader at least) when nothing is being done client-side.<p>On MathML:<p>• Disclaimer: I must confess to an annoyance with MathML proponents because (1) they seem to advocate using MathML even though it has poor browser support. (Even in Firefox where it&#x27;s supported the rendering is often poorer than TeX&#x27;s), and (2) they seem to imagine (somewhat like the &quot;semantic web&quot; people) some ideal world where authors bother to indicate the semantics of their equations (e.g. what a \\sum is a sum over) rather than simply communicate in notation.

I used to write a bit of Common Lisp though I don’t write much of that nowadays.<p>The thing I miss most when writing ocaml is paredit, a mode for emacs to edit sexps keeping them balanced. There is a more generic mode, smartparens, which can be used in other modes but it doesn’t work super well for ocaml: it can’t automatically add the required delimiters (though it isn’t clear that would always be wanted) and it struggles with multi-char delimiters, eg:<p><pre><code>  (* comments *)\n  [| arrays |]\n  {| unescaped strings |}\n  {foo| harder unescaped strings |foo}\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd because the structure of ocaml involved other delimiters that smartparens can’t cope with, you miss out on a lot of structure editing.<p>But that said, maybe it is hard to edit structure that is less plain to see. Swapping two lines like this:<p><pre><code>  let foo = x y in\n  let bar = a b in\n  ...\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSeems like a natural operation but the same thing in lisp is quite an unnatural operation (the indentation style of ocaml hides that the second let is really nestled inside the first). Incidentally paredit has an operation to do this but it’s pretty confusing (something like, take the sexps backwards from the point to the start of the smallest list strictly containing the point and swap them with the sexps going backwards from (excluding) the smallest list strictly containing the point to the start of the smallest list strictly containing the smallest list strictly containing the point.<p>Another ocaml operation would be merging&#x2F;splitting lets into a let ... and. But this would be even more unnatural in the equivalent lisp structure (perhaps one reason is that parallel lets are idiomatic in lisp but sequential lets are idiomatic in ocaml so it isn’t really a common operation to do in lisp).<p>There are a few structure editing features that sort of work in the normal ocaml modes of Tuareg with merlin. One is a “select more” operation which understands the syntax a bit. Another is a forward&#x2F;backward defun operation which works a lot of the time and can be useful. Merlin also offers the ability to expand patterns based on the type they are matching (eg to expand _ into (_,_,_) or to the names of the record fields). There is also a “construct” operation which I’ve not really been able to figure out (I usually just abuse the destruct operation somehow) and some kind of type hole syntax (like this: (??)) which only merlin understands and which really confuses the compiler proper.<p>I’m pretty excited to try out this structure editing improvement, or indeed any structure editing or type-directed editing features."],"time":["2020-03-15 18:02:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pbiggar"],"id":[22587376],"kids":[22588990],"parent":[22573483],"text":["Very cool.<p>We built a structural editor for an OCaml-like language (Darklang).

The main example is &quot;Conan (a C++ package manager) generates the libman file, CMake uses it for its build process&quot;.
