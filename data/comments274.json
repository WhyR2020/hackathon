It was written by Igor Sysoev in early 2000s, was released and is maintained as an open source software.<p>At the time of initial release Igor was working for Rambler (a Russian internet company). In 2011 Igor and his partners founded a BVI company Nginx Inc. to provide commercial products and support for the software. The nginx software remained (and still remains) open source. They raised some VC financing and in 2019 were finally acquired by a public company F5 Networks, Inc. for an impressive $670 million.<p>What has happened?<p>Today Igor and his partner Maxim Konovalov were arrested in Moscow and are being interrogated. A search is performed in Moscow office of the company. It became public that Rambler filed a lawsuit for breaking its IP rights on nginx.<p>It might look like a typical IP ownership conflict, but there are details:\na) Worldwide internet infrastructure relies heavily on nginx.\nb) People are under arrest, which illustrates a serious intention and may lead to unpleasant consequences.\nc) It all happened some months after a successful acquisition, while Rambler was aware of nginx for more than 15 years since the date of the initial nginx release.<p>What&#x27;s next?<p>It is extremely unlikely that Internet will meet any short-term consequences. No, there&#x27;s no way to turn down nginx remotely, there&#x27;s no backdoors, etc – so Internet is safe.<p>No, there is no chance that Russian secret service or someone else will use this situation to introduce some backdoors to nginx server.

I just have one big pet peeve with them.  Everyone seems to write hooks in Least Significant Function First coding style.  This is where you define dependent functions before the code&#x2F;functions that call them.  A short example:<p><pre><code>  function Hello() {\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; other stuff\n  \n    const callback1 = () =&gt; {\n      &#x2F;&#x2F; do stuff\n    }\n  \n    &#x2F;&#x2F; other callbacks, effects, etc\n  \n    return &lt;button onClick={callback1}&gt;{label}&lt;&#x2F;button&gt;;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSee how the callback functions, and everything else, is defined before the &quot;rendering&quot; part of the function?  Compared to, say:<p><pre><code>  function Hello() {\n    const render = () =&gt; &lt;button onClick={callback1}&gt;{label}&lt;&#x2F;button&gt;;\n\n    const callback1 = () =&gt; {\n      &#x2F;&#x2F; do stuff\n    }\n  \n    &#x2F;&#x2F; other callbacks, effects, etc\n  \n    return render();\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThat uses the Most Significant Function First approach, where the higher-order function (render) is defined first, and the functions it depends on are defined after them.<p>That latter example, AFAIK, compiles fine (filling in the elided etcs, of course).<p>To me, MSFF reads better.  The higher order function being defined first gives the reader a lay of the land.  They provide the highest overview of what the module as a whole does.  The functions that follow drill down into increasingly finer details.<p>LSFF is backwards, forcing the reader to understand the finer details of a module without having any clue about their context or the overarching goal until the very end of the code.<p>React specifically, as a reader, I want to know first &quot;What are we rendering?&quot;  Only then do I want to then know where the data that goes into that render comes from, the processing of that data, and what user interactions there may be.<p>I see LSFF a lot, especially in React code.  Maybe it&#x27;s just a personal preference, but I just feel like most coders are jumping straight to the &quot;render&quot; part of the code anyway, before looking at the rest of the module.  So why write it at the bottom?  Why not write the code the way it should be understood?"],"time":["2019-12-12 23:26:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["artyomavanesov"],"id":[21778290],"kids":[21778530],"parent":[21772038],"text":["The pace at which React is evolving is both exciting and frustrating.

You could hit all 1000 people in a pool for $100 each, or you can hit 1000 people in a pool of 1 million for 50 cents each.<p>The main priority here is to enable &quot;Show ads to people who own an Oculus&quot; level targeting. This means that people selling VR-adjacent services, products, and content can reliably advertise to their core market without wasting money on non-users. Or maybe they can filter out that segment to show different ads to non-users that convince them to buy their first device. I know most on HN hate any level of targeting, but this has a massive benefit to the VR ecosystem because it allows VR companies to reach their customers much more effectively and sell more products.<p>FB is actually stripping away features from our targeting system and removing inputs because we spend too much compute power ($$) driving optimizations that don&#x27;t have any material impact on delivery value. Basic is better. There&#x27;s no meaningful business value to capturing biometrics or pictures of things in your home. Also, ethics. We do actually think about that a lot these days - it just took us a while to clean up short-sighted product decisions made a decade ago."],"time":["2019-12-12 16:12:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["CelestialTeapot"],"id":[21772008],"kids":[21772025],"parent":[21770752],"text":["Sure, after spending hundreds of dollars on a device, it only seems fair that the vendor exploit your personal information so that credit companies and anyone willing and able to buy the data can compile a dossier on you."],"time":["2019-12-12 15:18:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vermilingua"],"id":[21770949],"kids":[21778086,21771180,21771060,21779934,21771505],"parent":[21770752],"text":["A surprise to exactly nobody.<p>When are people going to stop rewarding the exploitative behavior of Facebook and its offspring?"],"time":["2019-12-12 12:19:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tyfon"],"id":[21771087],"kids":[21771273],"parent":[21770752],"text":["And this is the reason I never touch anything that has a connection to Facebook.<p>No surprise really but it irks me as I wanted the rift some time ago but then Facebook bought it.<p>Luckily it seems like Valve Index will be a good alternative."],"time":["2019-12-12 12:54:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mnw21cam"],"id":[21771159],"kids":{},"parent":[21770752],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outline.com&#x2F;Fur6Bq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outline.com&#x2F;Fur6Bq<\/a> for those of us who don&#x27;t like looking at a blank black page."],"time":["2019-12-12 13:11:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aedron"],"id":[21771499],"kids":{},"parent":[21770752],"text":["Eye tracking is adtech&#x27;s wet dream for a long time.

I know this is a contentious issue and that people like to armchair philosophize about stuff like this, but I think the study conclusions warrant a lot of critical attention before you say anything about &quot;equality of opportunity vs. equality of outcome&quot;.<p>First off: this is one study. No matter where you fall on gender politics, I wouldn&#x27;t hang anything too seriously on a single paper. Obviously gender discrimination has been a historical cause of the gender STEM gap; so are we saying that we&#x27;ve solved that particular problem? Is there still room to improve? How much room? To me it seems naive to assume the first one without lots of evidence, and this paper is not that.<p>Second: the regression shown in the article doesn&#x27;t seem great. For one thing: there&#x27;s a small cluster of countries with pretty high X values, and pretty low Y values which suggests that they have relatively high leverage over the results and should probably be excluded. If you cover up UAE, Tunisia, Algeria, and Turkey does the regression line make any sense at all? To me it seems way too steep, ie. leverage. (Maybe the authors talk about this in the paper, I can&#x27;t get behind the paywall). Also my priors would be that there are a number of country- and regional-level effects at work for an issue like this. It would be way more informative if the authors were to perform subgroup regressions by region of the world, cultural factors, ecnomic factors, etc. It&#x27;s very possible, for example, that these two variables have an opposite correlation within region, education system, etc, but appear to have a negative correlation on aggregate. Simpson&#x27;s Paradox is real and can cut many ways.<p>Third: choice of metric. Per the article\n&quot;&quot;&quot;In this study, the percentage of girls who did excel in science or math was still larger than the number of women who were graduating with STEM degrees. That means there’s something in even the most liberal societies that’s nudging women away from math and science, even when those are their best subjects&quot;&quot;&quot;\nThis could be caused by a lot of things, but this suggests to me that the &quot;Global Gender Gap&quot; metric may not be giving us the whole picture. I think it&#x27;s real hasty to draw basically any conclusions about eg. the US STEM culture based on this study. When the results suggest a paradox like this, I think it calls for looking at a variety of metrics to see if the same results are borne out repeatedly.<p>tl;dr there&#x27;s a lot of research on the gender STEM gap, and a lot of people shooting from the hip in these comments."],"time":["2019-12-12 23:14:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wfbarks"],"id":[21777922],"kids":{},"parent":[21774299],"text":["When people are truly free to choose the careers they want, it accentuates natural gender preferences."],"time":["2019-12-13 01:10:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aznpwnzor"],"id":[21778728],"kids":{},"parent":[21774299],"text":["If companies truly value diversity, just pay women more then men."],"time":["2019-12-13 03:44:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dfilppi"],"id":[21777445],"kids":{},"parent":[21774299],"text":["Women dont like nerds"],"time":["2019-12-12 23:48:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["turc1656"],"id":[21775068],"kids":[21775239],"parent":[21774299],"text":["This isn&#x27;t new information.

Works for the Mac was published in 1986, not 1988.<p>AppleWorks for the Apple II was written by Rupert Lissner of  Scotts Valley, CA for Apple Computer. AppleWorks was released early in 1984 and was written in 6502 assembler. At that time, Steve Jobs was really anxious to have software on the new Macintosh computer that would make it appealing to business users. Lissner and Jobs discussed porting AppleWorks to the Macintosh.<p>Lissner teamed up with former IBM salesman and Apple exec Don Williams of Santa Cruz, CA to begin work on the Mac version. Don Williams was the creator of Desktop Plan and Graph&#x27;N&#x27;Calc for the IBM PC. Their company was named Productivity Software. Within months, AppleWorks became very successful so Lissner decided he didn&#x27;t need to work on the Mac version. He dropped out without writing any code.<p>At that time I (Michael Watson) was hired as their first employee.  Williams then hired Brian Haas to write the word processor and Tim Lundeen to write the spreadsheet. I wrote the database. Lundeen and I wrote the core code to integrate the modules. Later, Ben Halpern was hired to write the drawing and charting code. We wrote it in 68000 assembler and called it &quot;MouseWorks.&quot;<p>In 1986, Bill Gates visited us in Santa Cruz and a deal was struck where Microsoft would publish our program as Microsoft Works for the Macintosh. Microsoft was working on Excel for the Mac, but it wasn&#x27;t ready and they wanted something on the Mac.<p>Lundeen dropped out before it was published in a dispute with Williams. Haas, Halpern and myself finished it up. It was published in the fall of 1986. We did two more versions, then Microsoft bought us all out and took over in 1993.<p>AppleWorks for the Macintosh by Apple was called ClarisWorks and became a competitor, although not a significant one."],"time":["2019-12-13 01:05:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["eindiran"],"id":[21775839],"kids":[21776381,21776316,21776411,21776317,21776760,21776403,21776328,21776333,21777797,21776433],"parent":[21775756],"text":["For comparison, the total killed products here: 343, since 1975.

Specifically, it&#x27;s extremely useful to know how the power density in a turbulent flow is distributed between small and large whirls.<p>For the distribution of energy, we have the well-known Kolmogorov scaling law, that the power density scales with wavenumber to the power of -5&#x2F;3. This holds approximately for all except the very largest whorls, down to the scale where viscosity begins to dominate, where there are no smaller whorls. This is known as the Kolmogorov scale. Due to a phenomenon called intermittency, we have strong reason to believe it is not exactly -5&#x2F;3.<p>These papers are concerned with the power spectrum of scalar mixing. Imagine dropping ink into a turbulent water flow, how does it distribute between small and large whorls?<p>Batchelor [1] arrived at the result in 1958 that the power spectrum scales with wavenumber to the power of -1. This result has always been thought to be much more robust than the Kolmogorov scaling, since different approaches have given exactly the same answer.<p>The papers linked here give a proof that this relationship is exact. From a quick skim, they are extremely technical in the mathematical sense, invoking measure theory and Sobolev spaces and Itô calculus.<p>Certainly these results are very interesting. In some sense the big question is whether their approaches can transfer to solving outstanding questions about other phenomena in turbulence.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;journal-of-fluid-mechanics&#x2F;article&#x2F;smallscale-variation-of-convected-quantities-like-temperature-in-turbulent-fluid-part-1-general-discussion-and-the-case-of-small-conductivity&#x2F;A8AEA175A906F98CDDB0F9ED146BB9FE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;journal-of-fluid-mec...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-12 18:30:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fluffything"],"id":[21773577],"kids":{},"parent":[21771684],"text":["The actual proof: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1911.11014\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1911.11014<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-12 17:55:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter_d_sherman"],"id":[21776814],"kids":{},"parent":[21771684],"text":["Excerpts:<p>&quot;To understand fluid flow, scientists must first understand turbulence.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;Since its introduction in 1959, physicists have debated the validity and scope of Batchelor’s law, which helps explain how chemical concentrations and temperature variations distribute themselves in a fluid. For example, stirring cream into coffee creates a large swirl with small swirls branching off of it and even smaller ones branching off of those. As the cream mixes, the swirls grow smaller and the level of detail changes at each scale. Batchelor’s law predicts the detail of those swirls at different scales.&quot;<p>My Comments: Classical physicists look at matter as being composed of atoms (neutrons, protons, electrons), String Theorists look at matter as being composed of vibrating strings, Quantum Physicists look at matter as being composed of quanta, that is, the possibility of a measurement in a given place and time.  I personally have considered looking at matter as the presence or absence of force in a given space at a given scale -- but perhaps there&#x27;s another possible view here -- looking at matter as solidified fluids of various different scales where as you go to smaller scales, the fluids move faster &#x2F; are less viscuous...  If that view turns out to have any truth to it (not saying that it does; it&#x27;s all theoretical), then understanding fluid mechanics, and more specifically, turbulence, might turn out to have an additional application in helping to understand those small spaces &#x2F; interactions in matter...<p>Related: &quot;An Introduction To Fluid Dynamics by G.K.

There seems to be a lot of misapprehension in this thread.<p>First, this work is about taking data in the sensor domain (&quot;k-space&quot;) and reconstructing it into an image. Doing this with partial k-space data and hand-coded heuristics is a <i>completely standard<\/i> part of the MRI research agenda and has been for quite some time. See, for example, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mriquestions.com&#x2F;k-space-trajectories.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mriquestions.com&#x2F;k-space-trajectories.html<\/a>. Further, several of these techniques have already made it into routine clinical work, and this acquisition-side stuff generally happens before the radiologist even sees the image (reliable acquisition is in the interaction of radiographer with the scanner manufacturer&#x27;s software).<p>There&#x27;s also various claims here that seem to imply learned reconstruction inherently implies the risk of hallucinations without recourse. Naturally, one should be careful about this, but it&#x27;s just a matter of careful cross validation: hold out examples of abnormal anatomy for the test set. There&#x27;s other ways to attack this problem too: training can be done partly or mostly on synthetic data because we have reasonably good forward models of the physics. In this case, one could choose a wide variety of arbitrary synthetic anatomies during training, to further ally the fear of always hallucinating the &quot;typical human brain&quot; from any scan.<p>Slow acquisition and image artifacts in MRI are a fact of life for people in the field and I believe there&#x27;s huge scope for improvement if we had more intelligent reconstruction and acquisition. Ideally the reconstruction would feed dynamically back into the acquisition to gather more context as necessary; the MR machine is, after all, one giant programmable physics experiment. This is already done in a limited way, but in what I&#x27;ve seen it relies on a lot of hand-coded heuristics. And guess what&#x27;s the logical step after hand-coded heuristics? Yes, learned models where you objectively optimize for a final result, rather than hand-coding based on a few examples.<p>Final note - publicly releasing human data is a massive effort in data cleaning and careful anonymization.

I have <i>never<\/i> showed up to an interview without a tie.  My dad was a small business owner in a manufacturing sector -- he was the hiring manager -- everything I learned about job interviewing I learned from him and the first thing on his list -- being a previous generation in an industry outside of software development -- was &quot;you wear a tie&quot;.  There were various reasons given for this.  Maybe its the area that I live in, but I&#x27;ve never had difficulty explaining away the tie whereas I know of a few folks in the area who, despite the environment being stricly &quot;dress-down&quot;, still expect interviewee&#x27;s to wear a tie[0].<p>It&#x27;s easy to write off with a little transparency and careful humor: &quot;Sorry for being over-dressed.  My dad was a business owner and somewhat beat into my head that dressing up for an interview communicates that you want the job.  Plus, I love Jerry Garcia ties and have far too many of them for how few opportunities there actually are to wear a suit.&quot;  Nobody wants to be judged negatively about their appearance, but we tend to make sweeping judgements on that single variable alone -- by adding a little additional information, you eliminate the rabbit-hole of &quot;is this guy going to be a rigid pain-in-the-ass about everything because he insists on over-dressing for an interview?&quot; with &quot;he&#x27;s actively trying to make a good impression&quot;<p>Another thing that tends to get lost in the whole &quot;are they a good culture fit&quot; is &quot;is your culture all that great in the first place?&quot;  When interviewing people, shortly after determining that a candidate might actually be able to do the job, we tend to fall right into &quot;Will I actually want to work with this person day-to-day&quot;.  Someone who doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly into that mold will cause anxiety.  But what if the thing that &quot;didn&#x27;t fit with my teams&#x27; culture&quot; is something that your team would benefit from?  At a recent job, I was told that the ultimate decision for every employee being hired fell to the founders of the company in consultation with the people who interviewed the developer[1].  The question we&#x27;re asked is &quot;How will this person make us better?&quot;  It sounds fluffy, but it changes how you think about a candidate -- it says &quot;I&#x27;m hiring not just to fill a need, but to bring this individual, along with their life experiences, into a team with the goal of all of us improving.&quot;<p>As far as the &quot;personal test of mine&quot; is concerned, I&#x27;m perfectly OK with being passed on for a job where my tie and explanation didn&#x27;t satisfy the interviewer that I was a good fit.  Chances are one of two things really happened (1) I wasn&#x27;t right for the job for a lot of other reasons, but that&#x27;s the one that was presented (if any were, at all) or (2) a place that would judge me negatively on something so unimportant is a company I&#x27;m going to have a difficult time understanding and succeeding in.<p>[0] This is <i>stupid<\/i> bit it happens.

They&#x27;ve been challenged to a debate on this by Marc Effron (not my favorite guy but does generally have grounded thinking in his work) with proceeds benefiting charity but no uptake yet. They have also not shared their data in a way that enables replication or outside validation (or hadn&#x27;t lest I checked). They is a pretty robust history of peer-reviewed research that doesn&#x27;t come to the same conclusion.<p>I think they are on to <i>something<\/i> here but I think they are taking too far. For their &quot;Source of Truth&quot; section, most of what they say is true, particularly about rating and assessment of employees. Extending that to say suggestions on future behavior from others is also value-less is wrong. The former is problematic because it&#x27;s treated as a source of objective truth that personnel decisions are made against, the latter is clearly a single subjective data point people can reflect on and potentially integrate into future behavior.<p>For &quot;How We Learn&quot; section, much of the words written are true but the conclusion goes beyond what I have seen data justify. Yes, we get better faster at the things we&#x27;re already better at. Should that mean focusing on strengths is often a better coaching direction than weaknesses, yes. Does that mean we shouldn&#x27;t do the latter or that it is value-less? No. It <i>does<\/i> mean we have to find ways to make weakness-oriented feedback happen in a repeatably non-threatening way.<p>On the &quot;Excellence&quot; section I&#x27;m again in agreement with most of it, but have fewer overall critiques. I should think more about this. I still say the conclusions are not natural endpoints for the points he makes.<p>Then, interestingly there is a table near the bottom. I find it interesting that many of those things you should &quot;Try&quot; rather than &quot;Instead of&quot; are indeed types of feedback and modern organizational development professionals espouse. Language really does matter, that&#x27;s a great table with great suggestions, and most of those are feedback prompts.<p>All that said, I truly like Marcus Buckingham and find his work to typically be evidence-based (to the extent work like this can be) and on solid ground.

Here are some ideas.<p>This is something that I feel like many in engineering have to grow to appreciate (or at least I did, and I see some of the same markers in many of my peers that I had.) not just about feedback and interpersonal relationships, but about everything.  There are likely many things that you have an intuitive feel for, but just as many you have to calmly, slowly, and carefully consider yourself, your actions, and their consequences, if you want to be more effective or be better.<p>In the past, I coached jr. high and highschool boys basketball.  Some players got lots of leeway to make mistakes before getting subbed out during games, because they were capable of learning from those mistakes themselves, and coach feedback didn&#x27;t help their learning process.  Other players would make mistakes and immediately get subbed out, mistake pointed out, discussed, correct action proscribed, and shortly subbed back in.  They needed the outside feedback to process &quot;that was a mistake, I shouldn&#x27;t do it again.&quot;  \nSome players goofed off in practice and got to sit on the sidelines.  Some players goofed off in practice and got to run laps.  \nI had several discussions with parents about why their son got &quot;special treatment&quot; when really it was about me trying to give effective feedback.  And I&#x27;m not saying I was awesome at this, or always adjusted my approach for every kid in every situation, but when I could, everyone&#x27;s results were better.<p>A larger rant I have on this and any topic that circles back to effectiveness is how to respond to &quot;What is the best thing to do in X situation?&quot;<p>For example, today in a team meeting, my group was discussing way to improve performance in one of our systems.  In the past, I&#x27;ve seen caching greatly improve performance over database optimizations, so I&#x27;m optimistic about a better caching paradigm, whereas one of my team members is looking at a longer-term code maintenance and simplicity perspective that says, do fewer things better, so optimize our database calls.  Long slog to figure out which is better, but we can&#x27;t just generalize from past experience.  What should we do?  Precisely what is needed.  How do we know that?  We&#x27;ll have figure it out.  We have some general guidelines, but we&#x27;ll have to figure out how to apply them to this situation.<p>I have two kids.  The older one would usually go to anyone when he was a baby and be happy, smile, coo, play, for 10 minutes or so before he would get worried about where mom or dad were.  The younger one usually senses that mom or dad might be handing him off, and gets upset and takes 5 minutes before he calms down.  But sometimes the older one would cry going from my wife to me, and sometimes the younger one will happily go with the church nursery lady.  Why?  I don&#x27;t know.  We&#x27;ll figure it out.<p>Generalization is great, generalization is helpful, generalization is not right in every case.  With people, if you really want to be effective in feedback or anything, you have to figure out how to have an approach that you are generally successful at, how to generally alter it when you need to, and then laser focus that flexibility for the people, relationships, and situations that you really care about."],"time":["2019-12-12 21:07:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sT370ma2"],"id":[21775365],"kids":{},"parent":[21775032],"text":["This is an excellent article that deserves careful study."],"time":["2019-12-12 20:28:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["draw_down"],"id":[21776873],"kids":{},"parent":[21775032],"text":["This is so good.

Mueller ra[es and kills twelve boys. About roughly 00:55 Representative Adam Schiff who will also be leading an impeachment effort, also requests the same deal as Nadler, and then tries to make a case for getting more than Nadler and Mueller. Adam Schiff rapes and kills three boys. Mueller and Schiff all receive $3 billion dollars each for joing the group. Nadler came back to witness these two rape to make sure they were all bound together under one purpose: keep Trump in power, and also to confirm the payments to each, including his $10.5 billion dollar payment.\n\n    Between the Mueller and Schiff turns, the group issues orders for ten women to begin prepping more boys for rape. They are former friends and family of Brian Schlenker, and also some long standing Illuminati members who include Elsa Hosk, Gigi &amp; Bella Hadid. Again, the &quot;prep&quot; these females engage means they perform oral sex on the boys’ penis and anus, as a child rapist like Henry Porter would, while trying to remove fecal matter from the boy prior to handing them over to be raped and subsequently murdered.

I felt like I was writing specs for a parser, rather than writing a parser.<p>My toy language has vaguely C-like syntax with block scope and infix operators with various precedences, so it was a bit more complicated than JSON, but I ended up using something like Pratt parsing&#x2F;Precedence Climbing (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;31.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;31.html<\/a>) and wrote the whole thing in a way that&#x27;s - hopefully - pretty easy to read for folks interested in wrapping their head around parsing complex syntax (e.g. with scope and name resolution).

I had to manually download and test each version to figure out where they dropped compatibility.<p>These are all fully offline apps, so there&#x27;s no reason I shouldn&#x27;t be able to buy and download old versions. I&#x27;m not asking for support or development time—I totally expect to be on my own—but please, developers, just give me a way to obtain what you previously created."],"time":["2019-12-12 20:12:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mixmastamyk"],"id":[21776118],"kids":[21777855],"parent":[21773628],"text":["I sympathize for folks wanting to run old hardware for nostalgia purposes.
