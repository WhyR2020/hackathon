They all pointed to one source as the reason for the sleep issues: stress. And they all wanted to put me on prescription sleeping pills. I said no to that. Sleeping pills are addictive and you have to take them for the rest of your life. As a software developer, I am used to finding and fixing the underlying problem as opposed to the quickfixes these doctors were offering me.<p>After much research I figured out the underlying problem, and the fix for it. The underlying problem is magnesium deficiency. As a software developer I am using my brain more intensely than most people. This is the stress the doctors are talking about. Stress depletes magnesium. The cells in our body depend on two essential minerals for normal function: Calcium and magnesium. Cells go into ON state when calcium goes in, and OFF state when calcium goes out. Calcium doesn&#x27;t go out on its own: magnesium has to go in and displace the calcium. When you are low on magnesium, cells can&#x27;t go into OFF state. When that happens your muscles become stiff and you need massages, and your brain can&#x27;t turn off and you can&#x27;t sleep. The solution is magnesium supplements. This fixed my muscle stiffness issues and my sleep issues. A special compound of magnesium called magnesium l-threonate is especially helpful for sleep because it can penetrate what is known as the &quot;blood brain barrier&quot;.<p>Scientific sources for this are hard to come by.

But I&#x27;m getting tired of the constant reporting of each and every <i>infection<\/i>. What is really relevant is infections <i>of at-risk groups<\/i>. Most infections, <i>nothing happens<\/i>!<p>2) <i>8-15% of all Americans over 70 would die.<\/i> Newsflash: Old people tend to die more often than young people. What is the all-cause i.e. normal mortality rate of the elderly. One number I saw cited: all-cause mortality of 83&#x2F;84 yo&#x27;s in the US ~7 percent. Case mortality rate i.e. <i>with<\/i> infection in Korea among 80+ yo&#x27;s: 7.4 percent. What am I missing here? Are the reported covid mortality rates all normalized by all-cause mortality and they report only real &quot;excess&quot; deaths or are they lumping everything together? This would be so mind-numbingly stupid, I really hope I&#x27;m wrong about this!<p>3) <i>0.9% of them would die.<\/i> That&#x27;s the unconditional number, all age cohorts aggregated. Split them up and the number is clearly skewed by the large number of the elderly (and see 2 above). Now factor in that testing outside Korea, Taiwan etc. is really bad and focused on symptomatic cases. Common estimate of how high are the true numbers of infected is around one order of magnitude. Let&#x27;s assume the official stats are off by a factor of ten. Let&#x27;s further assume that young people (say, below 65) are &quot;more social&quot; or mobile than elderly and thus likelier to get infected. That means a) the undercount is dominated by younger people and b) the mortality rates are off by more than ten. At what point are we getting to mortality rates of common influenza?<p>4) There are basically two ways to die from the virus: a) immune system overwhelmed by virus or b) immune system overreacts. Younger, healthy people ( &lt; 65 yo) seem to die more from b. Now look into <i>who<\/i> are the victims in this cohort and it turns out mostly medical professionals. Due to lack of preparation and equipment, those medical professionals are exposed to disproportionately higher or even extreme quantities of the virus. This seems consistent with b. Also, it means that the mortality rates of younger, healthy people is skewed by counting medical- and non-medical people together.<p>In sum, I think this is a total overreaction and panic that causes huge economic damage (which has a big human cost, in terms of lives lost, as well make no mistake) for what may turn out to be basically nothing.<p>What am I missing?<p>[EDIT: I&#x27;d prefer we focus on the at-risk groups (elderly and pre-existing conditions like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc) instead of just blanket-<i>everybody<\/i>. Isolate the at-risk groups until vaccine and&#x2F;or medication are developed and let everyone else basically develop herd immunity until then. Increase testing. And basically use this as a call for more general health measures, not just virus panic. The immune system depends on sleep, nutrition, mental health&#x2F;hormone balance, etc. With the panic and the economic crash induced by it, all these factors are becoming negative instead of positive factors for most people now.]"],"time":["2020-03-19 14:53:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["im3w1l"],"id":[22624847],"kids":[22625164,22626538,22625055,22624923,22625086,22624900],"parent":[22623972],"text":["Here&#x27;s a scenario I&#x27;m curious about.

The main problem is that the disease is already causing an overload on the health care system in parts of the country while the epidemic has just gotten started. If left unchecked it will peak in about 2.5 months when close to half a million people will likely be in need of hospitalisation with about 150.000 of them in need of critical care. About 40.000 people will die given a mortality of 0.7% (as measured in Korea) and a 70% fraction of the population being infected.<p>There are 520 IC places in the whole of Sweden.<p>Even if these numbers are overstated by a factor 10 - which is possible although the SEIR-model gives even higher numbers (800.000 hospitalised, 200.000 in need of critical care) - it is clear that those in need of critical care will most likely not get the help they need leading to an increased mortality.<p>For a single individual the disease does not seem to be as large a threat as it is being made out to be by some. For a society unused to see people die from infectious disease it stands to be devastating. Either society will have to accept that infectious disease can and will kill people when it is allowed free reign or we&#x27;ll have to do our best to make sure the limit the amount of suffering due to loss of life, loss of quality of life, loss of income, employment, economic potential and other factors as much as possible.<p>What is needed now is a comprehensive testing effort to find out how far the infection has spread over the country. If it turns out a sizeable part of the population already carries antibodies against SARS-CoV2 it will be clear that the disease is not as much of a threat as it seems to be. Comprehensive testing will also allow for the early isolation of infected people and will help in limiting the load on the health care system."],"time":["2020-03-19 15:58:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["helen___keller"],"id":[22627853],"kids":[22636349],"parent":[22627636],"text":["I don&#x27;t have the background to answer your questions, but even if I steelman and assume the worst outcome here (issues with the test, issues with epidemiology, that we&#x27;re crowding out hospitals, that we&#x27;re infecting via hospitals), I would argue that we are still not overreacting:<p>In the original outbreak of wuhan, there could not have been overpreparation because there was no preparation, the outbreak simply happened. So, we should look at wuhan pre-citywide-quarantine to get a feel for what it would look like if we chose to not &quot;overreact&quot;, as originally there was no real &quot;test&quot; being administered, cases were diagnosed by CT scans of lungs for pneumonia, and there were not extreme imposed social distancing or population-wide quarantine.<p>So, any issues we might have in the west, should not apply to the original outbreak in wuhan. And in wuhan the casualties of the outbreak were on the order of 1-5% (i think estimates varied a lot for some of the reasons you list). In any case, it overloaded hospitals and a lot of people died.<p>If the infection reaches a broader population (the &#x27;underreaction&#x27; scenario), it suffices to say the death rate will be a MINIMUM of 1-5%, as obviously the situation would be even worse with a large percentage of the population sick. This would continue until the population reaches herd immunity, estimated 30-60% of population infected.<p>Thus, we can conclude 1-5% of that 30-60% of the infected population would die, which in america ranges from about 1 million to nearly 10 million deaths. This is far far far greater than the yearly flu outbreak. And that&#x27;s assuming that the rapid spread of the disease doesn&#x27;t cause secondary effects through deteriorating supply chains (who staffs grocery stores if 60% of the population is home? who drives trucks to keep supply chains going? who works the amazon fulfillment center?)<p>Thus, I would conclude that the penalties for unabated spread of the disease are <i>so horrific<\/i> that the only reasonable response is something that looks like an overreaction: extreme social distancing, shutting down cities aside from vital functions, etc.<p>Because atleast our groceries stores operate and our supply chains are running."],"time":["2020-03-19 15:36:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rland"],"id":[22627815],"kids":{},"parent":[22627636],"text":["I’m not really sure if we’re overreacting.

PCR was\ninvented in 1983 by Kary Mullis.&quot;<p>So, the test is not trivial, is some\nmicrobiology that, say, before 1983 would\nhave seems impossible.<p>Next Dr. Brix has indicated that the US\nis very careful about the rates of false\npositives and false negatives of the tests\nthey use.<p>Still, for now, apparently we don&#x27;t know\nhow many people in the US are (or have\nbeen) infected.<p>But from the CDC data above, we have some\nokay data (numbers are still small for\naccurate statistical estimates) by age of\nthe fraction of hospital admissions with\nthe virus that got into an ICU and then\nthe fraction that died.<p>Considering the US population over 65, how\nbig is that?<p>Uh, from Google search<p>&quot;US population over 65&quot;<p>get<p>&quot;49.2 million<p>In the United States, the population age\n65 and over numbered 49.2 million in 2016\n(the most recent year for which data are\navailable).

If want to use the 10% number in\nthe CDC text, then that would be 5 million\ndead.<p>So, hurry up step #1 is to slow the spread\nof the virus by a lot of social distancing\nand hand washing.<p>Hurry up step #2 is look for cures by (a)\ntrying old drugs to see if any are\neffective against the virus, (b) get some\nantibodies from some people already cured\nfrom the virus and see if those antibodies\ncan be the basis of a cure, (c) starting\nwith the microbiology, e.g., the molecular\ngeometry, of part of the virus, try to\nconstruct an antibody.<p>Step #3 -- ASAP get a safe and effective\nvaccine and give nearly everyone a shot.<p>In case #1 to #3 happen too slowly, do #4,\nget hospitals ready for lots more\npatients.<p>Unlike some other diseases, some good news\nabout this virus is that everyone who gets\nthe virus can transmit it for only a few\nweeks.<p>So, in simple terms, if the world would be\n100% effective at social distancing for a\nfew weeks, then the world would be free of\nthe virus!

I&#x27;ll keep buying if it wants to keep going down. At a $14-$15 billion market cap, it was a comical steal to hold long-term. It&#x27;s a future $100b market cap company.<p>Pinterest (PINS) here (below ~$12), to be held for a minimum of five years.<p>Grab some financials, the stronger companies. These are not going to collapse, short of the US collapsing. They&#x27;re classic too big to let fail. They survived the great recession, the Fed will inject whatever it has to in order to prop them up. I&#x27;d suggest a basket of JPM, WFC, BAC, GS, MS.<p>IBM (IBM). Below $100 ideally. Their future will be brighter with the new management and they&#x27;re trading for 9-10 times earnings with a good dividend. It was cheap before the crash, it&#x27;s very cheap now.<p>Micron (MU), particularly if you can grab it below $30.<p>Beyond Meat (BYND). I like their valuation at this point, it has been crushed. They&#x27;ve demonstrated strong operational controls on costs and they have plenty of cash. I think they&#x27;ll be fine coming through this.<p>I&#x27;d like to suggest Cloudflare (NET), I don&#x27;t love their valuation here though, it hasn&#x27;t gotten beaten down enough. It was briefly down a few days ago, but it&#x27;s back up again. If you can get it below ~$15-$16, I like it there for a long-term hold.<p>Buy some silver (small position), however you prefer to go about that. The recent shock plunge is an opportunity to be taken advantage of. The same is true about a few other commodities. People are in panic mode, dumping most everything.<p>Luckin Coffee (LK). Big coin flip on the situation in China and the physical space in general with the virus. However, if they survive (presently burning plenty of red ink) they have a decent shot at being the Starbucks of China. They raised some capital in January, they&#x27;ll certainly need it. It had held up well, but cracked today and dropped 13%, rolling back to November&#x27;s prices. Stalk it for the low $20s or below.<p>Medifast (MED). To be held for several years minimum.<p>In the energy industry, Schlumberger (SLB) maybe. Their valuation has gotten very tempting here. $36 to $12 in a month. I don&#x27;t like most of the energy industry, including XOM, CVX, much less OXY or APA or CLR. It&#x27;s an amazing double smashing, from Covid and the oil war.<p>John Deere (DE) is getting close to interesting. I&#x27;d like it below $100. $180 to $106 in the past month, it&#x27;s getting there. I like them a lot more than companies such as Caterpillar (CAT) or 3M (MMM).<p>iRobot (IRBT) has my attention here. They got hammered first from the China trade war concerns previously, then later from Covid as China went down. Their most recent quarter had popped the stock, until they got smacked again by Covid. I might like it below $30 at this point, we&#x27;ll see if it gets there in the coming days or weeks. Plenty of competitive risks with the company, however the value proposition is very interesting now (below one times 2019 sales, 11x operating income).<p>Companies to avoid: retailers (too much risk, not enough upside); airlines (who knows what&#x27;s about to happen to them); the classic FAANGS etc (AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, FB - they haven&#x27;t gotten cheap enough yet to warrant buying); avoid Tesla, GM, Ford; I don&#x27;t like UBER or LYFT here; I don&#x27;t like PayPal, Visa or Mastercard, they were all stupidly overvalued before and still are; I dislike Shopify, they&#x27;re worth $60-$80 &#x2F; share, trading for $336. At current valuations, I&#x27;d avoid Intel, AMD, Cisco, Oracle, nVidia and numerous other larger tech companies (not beaten down enough). I don&#x27;t like most of the classic bluechips at all here, including KO, JNJ, PG, XOM, MCD, CVX, PFE, PEP, MMM, and so on, they&#x27;re just not cheap enough. Give me MCD at a ~9 PE ratio and I&#x27;ll consider it. I&#x27;d avoid the telecoms, including T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, not cheap enough vs growth (plus I just plain dislike them as investments, unless they&#x27;re being given away), they haven&#x27;t been pounded in this. I don&#x27;t like a lot of the more recent class of tech stocks, the Workday generation, their valuations aren&#x27;t crushed enough (stocks like Twilio, ServiceNow, Splunk, Atlassian, etc) and most are either bleeding red ink or barely making money along with having extreme valuations (most still have the bulk of their epic gains from years of running).<p>Delta (DAL) and Southwest (LUV) would both be interesting to track on an intricate basis (you have to stay on top of every little detail about what&#x27;s happening to them and the industry here). DAL is trading for three times 2019 earnings now, LUV is at eight times. If they&#x27;re going to remain independent, survive and get back to normal (whether it takes two years or five etc), this is a steal, and their stock prices will plausibly go lower yet. I&#x27;d stalk them for a cheaper entry yet if I were going to bother.<p>And if I had Berkshire&#x27;s $130 billion in cash, I&#x27;d eat Kraft Heinz, refurbish Kraft, keep Heinz for myself, and then spin Kraft off or sell it in a few years to a peer in the segment. Most companies in that segment aren&#x27;t worth touching here though (that includes KHC), not unless they get a lot cheaper yet."],"time":["2020-03-19 05:59:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryansmccoy"],"id":[22625132],"kids":{},"parent":[22623807],"text":["IMO, the biggest unknown right know is that we don&#x27;t know how long this pandemic is going to last or when the new case curve will start to flatten.

Below is the abstract in full:<p>&gt; Low vitamin D status in winter permits viral epidemics. During winter, people who do not take vitamin D supplements are likely to have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. Vitamin D can reduce the risk of viral epidemics and pandemics in several ways. First, higher 25(OH)D concentrations reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory tract infections (RTIs), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Patients with chronic diseases have significantly higher risk of death from RTIs than otherwise healthy people. Second, vitamin D reduces risk of RTIs through three mechanisms: maintaining tight junctions, killing enveloped viruses through induction of cathelicidin and defensins, and reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system, thereby reducing the risk of a cytokine storm leading to pneumonia. Observational and supplementation trials have reported higher 25(OH)D concentrations associated with reduced risk of dengue, hepatitis, herpesvirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infections, and pneumonia. Results of a community field trial reported herein indicated that 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng&#x2F;ml (125 nmol&#x2F;l) vs. &lt;20 ng&#x2F;ml were associated with a 27% reduction in influenza-like illnesses. From the available evidence, we hypothesize that raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations through vitamin D supplementation could reduce the incidence, severity, and risk of death from influenza, pneumonia, and the current COVID-19 epidemic."],"time":["2020-03-19 23:44:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pcvarmint"],"id":[22632652],"kids":[22640199,22633092],"parent":[22632542],"text":["Seattle has a severe Vitamin D deficiency, due to almost year-round cloudiness.<p>I wonder if that has anything to do with the Seattle outbreak.<p>I live only 3 miles from the Life Care Center nursing home.

I was in the second category.<p>First, my company imposed a hiring freeze. This included both hiring new people or renovating temporary contracts. Then, they relied in natural attrition to shed people. Since many people were contractors, those were the first ones to let go. When that wasn&#x27;t enough, they started laying off full time employees.<p>I was lucky since my team was left mostly untouched, while other teams were dismissed entirely. We did get our bonuses cancelled and salary frozen for a few years, however. That, coupled to higher taxes and inflation, means that my income went down over the years, but at least I had a job.<p>My biggest takeaway is that YMMV (duh!). Many people are concerned now about losing their jobs. In my opinion, companies (particularly large and stable ones) will rely on hiring freezes and attrition to curb their numbers.

There&#x27;s even an argument that the now-debunked butterfly keyboard foray falls into this category (literally <i>nothing<\/i> was wrong with the scissor&#x2F;mbair keyboard, as evidenced by the fact that they&#x27;ve returned to it essentially unmodified).<p>You can make the argument that Face ID&#x2F;3D front scanner has enough &quot;wow&quot; or utility to be a selling point.

However, the Turbo Boost is the same 3.8 GHz which is <i>way<\/i> too low for the 10th gen Amber Lake Y CPUs.<p>Also, at first I thought the video resolutions weird but what&#x27;s going on here is that there is a single USB C output and even with Thunderbolt, that&#x27;s only a 40Gbps bus. So the ICL-Y DP 1.4 support is somewhat less useful here. If there would be two USB C outputs, two 5K monitors could be driven easily, for example. Which the previous generation Intel CPUs couldn&#x27;t because to drive an 5K from DP 1.2 the monitor eats up two display outputs even if physically that&#x27;s delivered on a single Thunderbolt cable."],"time":["2020-03-18 14:15:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WillPostForFood"],"id":[22617250],"kids":[22617311,22624714],"parent":[22615719],"text":["What’s missing from Apple’s lineup now is an a lightweight option.

It was about the bones of a bunch of cave bears that a father and his young son found in Drachenloch Cave in Switzerland in the early 1900s. They called in naturalist Emil Bachler and he got to work finding more bones in the cave, organized in tantalizingly structured ways.<p>&gt; In Drachenloch, however, not only were there [crude stone] walls, but behind these walls were found accumulations of bear bones — the long bones of the legs and more or less complete skulls. The pattern was very consistent. Where such walls were present, bones were present. Where they were absent, bones were rare along the cave walls.<p>These and other deliberate-looking accumulations of bones  (including apparent crude “chests” of limestone slabs enclosing more bones) led Bachler to suggest the idea of a prehistoric cave bear worshipping cult. But a counterargument suggests this explanation is unnecessary. It might just be bears being bears, no cult required.<p>&gt; When cave bears entered a cave to hibernate, they began by scratching nests into the cave fill. In the process, bones and small rocks were pushed aside, often falling into crevices among the fallen blocks. This had two effects. First, it helped to build up accumulations of bones in natural cavities among rocks or among piles of rocks. Second, it protected the bones that did enter such interstices from further trampling and, if they were buried there, from weathering and decay. It is perfectly natural, therefore, that modern excavators should find concentrations of bones in cavities surrounded by rock. Moreover, because further weathering of the cave roof naturally produced subsequent roof fall, it is perfectly normal that such cavities would be covered by slabs of greater or lesser size.<p>I wonder if something similar happened here. Obviously, the lack of a cave is an issue. But it’s a funny connection to something I read randomly a few months ago.<p>Cave bear stuff from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penn.museum&#x2F;sites&#x2F;expedition&#x2F;the-cult-of-the-cave-bear&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penn.museum&#x2F;sites&#x2F;expedition&#x2F;the-cult-of-the-cav...<\/a> which is also a fun read if you like archaeologists sniping at each other."],"time":["2020-03-19 01:25:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["z3t4"],"id":[22618237],"kids":[22618446,22618961],"parent":[22615435],"text":["When building houses you build with what you can find.

I&#x27;ll try to contextualize here what is OpenVidu and where it comes from.<p>Kurento [1] is a WebRTC server which you deploy in your cloud and then control through another application server, of which OpenVidu is one. While Kurento tries to provide generic building blocks to allow creating multiple types of applications, OpenVidu started as a project that builds on top of those capabilities and focuses on the most commonly requested use case: videoconference rooms.<p>From that initial premise, the amount of tasks to do in order to achieve a professional solution seems endless: easy configuration of producers and consumers, with roles and permissions; automatic scaling when the load requires it; dynamic distribution of media flows according to the needs; recording of the sessions; compatibility with different browsers, and also why not, with apps on mobile platforms; filtering the media to apply video effects; the list goes on.<p>Then, problems will happen. And troubleshooting WebRTC issues is difficult, because information is all disperse and nebulous, so one is expected to have all the tools in place beforehand to inspect logs and be able to have an explanation of why something went bad.<p>OpenVidu aims to provide an easy to use framework that can cover all those needs and then some. Its open-source part covers all the basics, and for the last months we&#x27;ve been working on the Pro offering, which tackles the targets of automatic scalability, session monitoring, and automatic instantiation of Kurento Media Server nodes to handle different amounts of sessions (i.e. &quot;elasticity&quot;), among other things. Some of the features listed in the Pro page [2] are ready for prime time, and some are a work in progress.<p>We just released OpenVidu version 2.12.0 [3], which is where a new license version for the Pro tier sees the light. Our team has been for quite a long time in the game of WebRTC, working and learning together with the open-source community while developing Kurento, and now I hope you find that OpenVidu is a nice value proposition and it helps you build your dream application!<p>It&#x27;s late here but tomorrow morning I&#x27;ll be hanging around here to answer any questions.

There’d be similar requirements at the entrance to large venues, government buildings, or public transport hubs. There would be temperature scanners everywhere, and your workplace might demand you wear a monitor that tracks your temperature or other vital signs.
