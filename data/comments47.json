As the product grows the two diverge rather fast."],"time":["2020-05-12 13:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["austincheney"],"id":[23153167],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Normally architects are at the top of the technology decisions along with principles. The focus of architecture is generally two fold:<p>1) Satisfying decisions that please many opposing masters.<p>2) Deciding how the company will build software from its current talent and the expected talent in the marketplace.<p>Consider the architects as the practical application and technical planners that represent the technical things a CTO might bundle together from a senior managerial perspective.<p>—-<p>Things an architects will need to do:<p>1. Make decisions. Know your various competing stakeholders and master written documentation. Be good with influence and always have supporting evidence. Never propose ad hoc decisions or use data that is either invented by you or poorly estimated. This is the essence of your reputation. Push back on decisions that are poorly qualified.<p>2. Place the product first. This means the most principal interest is a balance of generating revenue and pleasing the customer. Everything else be damned. That also means telling people no and putting developer interests as a far lower priority. From a business perspective people understand the answer “no” when there are competing priorities and when their pet priority isn’t fully qualified.<p>3. Account for talent. Temper that previous point against talent availability. For example if there is some giant JavaScript framework out there that there is giant slow, both in development time and execution time, trash and yet the only JavaScript you can find require that framework this must be factor in your proposals and technical planning.<p>4. Plan. Your ideas and proposals must be feasible. Are they things that can actually be built in a given timeframe, with the given talent, and the given resources? How long will it take to build? What are the risks? Will more assets be required? Will more time be required? In what stages and order will it be put together? Your plan should be communicated in two ways: a high level summary for stakeholders and a supporting specification that provides technical details and evidence.<p>—-<p>Things to learn:<p>1. Leadership. Stand behind your decisions. Own them with confidence and yet be willing to accept changes in the face of better evidence. Openly accept fault when your decisions fail in practice.<p>2. Administration. Learn to document data points across a variety of subjects and build knowledge cases.<p>3. Management. Management is a hybrid of leadership and administration. Even if you are not in management yourself you need to empathize with those that are in order to solve for their concerns and influence them.<p>4. Expenses. You need to estimate how much a given technology costs before adding it to a technical proposal. Expenses refer to asset consumption which is much more than money and free software comes with expenses.<p>5. Behavior and motives. You cannot influence people if you have no idea what they want. What people claim to want versus what they actually seek out are often two different things and nobody will tell you that."],"time":["2020-05-12 14:26:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["exabrial"],"id":[23156427],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Empathetic listening, writing, and business accounting!"],"time":["2020-05-12 19:07:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["angled"],"id":[23152711],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Be aware of TOGAF, even if you don&#x27;t use it."],"time":["2020-05-12 13:06:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thomk"],"id":[23154495],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["#1 Put your absolute focus on getting things finished.<p>That can be much harder than it sounds because first you have to master the skill of defining what &#x27;finished&#x27; means. Speak with the stakeholders and, without judgement or resistance, find out what it would mean to them to be &#x27;done&#x27; with this project, phase, milestone, whatever.<p>Let them tell you. The business people should make decisions about the business. They set em up, you knock em down.<p>#2 Strategize on how to get it finished.\nOnce you have an agreement on what &#x27;done&#x27; looks like, then talk with your team in a casual environment with a whiteboard present. Ask your team: Here is our task, what is the best way to get this done? Call on the members of your team who are quiet. Do not mistake being quiet for being out of ideas. Those guys just need a little encouragement to speak up. People say &#x27;there are no bad ideas&#x27; that&#x27;s not true, of course there are bad ideas. However, the environment and tone that you want to set for this meeting is: There is no NEGATIVE JUDGEMENT for your ideas. Get your guys to feel comfortable to spill out everything. Your job is to collect the gems.<p>#3 Assemble the document.\nGet those gems into some sort of order that ends with you being done (see step 1). This is the &#x27;architecture&#x27; phase. You have the task defined, you have the &#x27;how&#x27; defined, now you assemble it into a document that you give back to both the stakeholders and your team for corrections. Repeat as necessary. Group the tasks into phases&#x2F;sprints. Show your work to the stakeholders on a regular basis. If they change course because of that, go back to #1. It&#x27;ll be faster this time.<p>#4 Delegate\nDo your absolute best to give away as much of that work as possible. This will free you up to both help and coach the development team and to update the management team. If you are heads down in code for 50 hours&#x2F;wk every week, you are not leading, you are coding.<p>If you are going to code, abstract up the hardest part of the project and code that only.<p>--<p>TL&#x2F;DR: Train yourself to find the shortest path to done, which often means not using your favorite technology. Part of being a mature leader means to know when to be non-biased and to follow the natural flow of project requirements and staff acumen. Don&#x27;t force that, listen more than you talk at first. Gather information and then produce a document that echos your decisions."],"time":["2020-05-12 16:40:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dandanio"],"id":[23155045],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["You gotta learn Excel."],"time":["2020-05-12 17:32:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["electrotype"],"id":[23152833],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Never stop coding."],"time":["2020-05-12 13:28:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dboreham"],"id":[23153109],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Learn Psychology."],"time":["2020-05-12 14:17:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["29athrowaway"],"id":[23154742],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Read ISO 42010."],"time":["2020-05-12 17:03:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cpx86"],"id":[23154548],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["This is just my very personal and subjective experience, which may or may not apply to your working environment since I&#x27;ve no idea how many developers or teams you have or how your responsibilities are defined. This is at least what I&#x27;ve learnt so far in my environment:<p>- Be transparent about your decisions, motivations and opinions. People will come to you for advice or suggestions for what to do, and if they don&#x27;t understand your thought process that causes unnecessary friction.<p>- Document everything in writing publicly (except confidential&#x2F;sensitive info, naturally) - decisions, designs, ideas, proof-of-concepts. This will be helpful both to your fellow engineers since they can access this information on their own without you having to explain it to them every time they ask, and also helpful to you to recall the context in which you did something. I find myself often going back to notes I wrote months or even weeks ago, to remind myself of e.g. the motivation for why a decision was taken. Having it public also forces you to write in a clear, structured and professional manner since you&#x27;re writing for a broader audience.<p>- In terms of studying, formulate a vision for where you think your software should be within 1, 2 or 3 years, and spend time researching what options can take you there, learning how they work, and so on. I&#x27;ve found InfoQ to be a pretty good resource for keeping tabs on what others are doing in the field.<p>- Be patient. Be prepared to repeat yourself multiple times, sometimes to different people, sometimes to the same people. Be prepared to communicate a lot, and keep in mind to tailor your message depending on who you&#x27;re communicating with.<p>- Learn to let go of details. You will see code and solutions pushed out that you perhaps don&#x27;t fully agree with. Take a step back and consider if it&#x27;s really that important or if it&#x27;s good enough. If something gets pushed that really isn&#x27;t up-to-par, be humble and consider that you might not have communicated the requirements clearly enough.<p>- Make sure to understand the business side of the company, and always take that perspective into account when making decisions. You might from a technical perspective think a piece of software is in desperate need of refactoring, but from a business value perspective it might not make any sense. Be sure that you agree yourself with those kinds of decisions (i.e. don&#x27;t blame &quot;the business&quot;) because you&#x27;ll likely find yourself having to explain and champion them to others who disagree with them.<p>- I realized now that all of the above is mostly &quot;soft skills&quot; and have very little to do with technical skills or training. Which I suppose is the biggest learning I&#x27;ve had so far - for me the biggest gap by far was (and still is) mostly about communicating, working with others, and taking the broader needs of the company into account and not just the technical aspects.<p>Just my 2c - hope it can be helpful to someone."],"time":["2020-05-12 16:45:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ineedausername"],"id":[23153851],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Excel"],"time":["2020-05-12 15:40:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sfj"],"id":[23152768],"kids":[23153059,23153903,23153040,23153409,23152807],"parent":[23152092],"text":["&gt; What do I need to learn&#x2F;do to excel?<p>You need to turn off tool tips immediately.

Just look at how unpopular coupes are in the 2020s (The new Mustang is a crossover SUV! Smart left the United States!

If you need further proof look at places like Singapore where it’s &lt; .1% CFR despite 25k cases&#x2F; large volum of new cases per day.<p>Politics in the US:<p>Watching this unfold in recent weeks it&#x27;s hard not to be cynical and conclude this is perhaps the only reason someone would extend these lockdowns for 3 months."],"time":["2020-05-12 23:29:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["btian"],"id":[23160110],"kids":[23160922],"parent":[23159203],"text":["Sounds like a terrible idea.<p>Doesn&#x27;t closing SpaceX also have national security implications?"],"time":["2020-05-12 23:27:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mydongle"],"id":[23159845],"kids":{},"parent":[23159203],"text":["Fuck man, are we gonna go through the panic buying again?"],"time":["2020-05-12 23:06:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gazelle21"],"id":[23159569],"kids":{},"parent":[23159203],"text":["Expect riots"],"time":["2020-05-12 22:48:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["tamaharbor"],"id":[23159610],"kids":{},"parent":[23159203],"text":["Funny, I always assumed Civil War II would be started by Trump Supporters..."],"time":["2020-05-12 22:51:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["ratfaced-guy"],"id":[23159401],"kids":{},"parent":[23159203],"text":["Fascists."],"time":["2020-05-12 22:36:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["brunoTbear"],"id":[23159778],"kids":[23169885,23159871,23159972,23160511,23160347,23160689],"parent":[23159203],"text":["Notably more negative sentiment in the comments here than I&#x27;ve seen in the past.

JavaScript was a clear choice given how well it pairs with Python, and it was the our most-requested language.<p>We took what we learned from building our Python product, adjusted it to JavaScript’s nuances, and trained the model on 22 million open-source JavaScript files. We then spent months dogfooding, user testing, and applying advanced model filtering techniques to ensure the UX was ready for everyone to enjoy.<p>We think the end-result will help you have more fun writing JavaScript, while also helping you ship software faster.

A first and last name with four middle names in between is not quite an accurate breakdown given the tradition (which, as I understand it, is more akin to the Spanish &quot;uno y dos&quot; surnames), but seemed like a close enough representation that ought to be possible in many systems. Of course, it actually was not possible in many systems, and of all the bizarre handlings of his name perhaps the strangest was the motor vehicle division, which decided to use the first three parts as first name, the second three parts as last name, and then apparently some automated system later on helpfully removed the spaces and apostrophe and truncated after so many characters. The resulting driver&#x27;s license was both comical and nearly illegible.<p>This case was fairly innocent in that it was seldom even annoying. However, even more common seems to be transgender individuals who have completed a legal name change but cannot get the name field updated in automated systems, a case that can cause a great deal of offense. It seems that the underlying cause here is less format assumptions, though, and more immutability, which I worry the article doesn&#x27;t quite hit hard enough. I once had my name simply misspelled in, of all things, a university ERP, and it took over a year of nagging to get it corrected. I got the impression that a consultant had to be brought in to make the change. Years later I worked in the kind of corporation that had a lot of &quot;for life&quot; employees, and it was frustrating how often people&#x27;s usernames no longer matched their names because they had gotten married and been told their username simply could not be changed. Building any system which is e.g. keyed on a name field is absolutely going to cause frustration and expense down the line when someone does something odd like get married. Unfortunately, many software systems make an implicit assumption of immutability by using username as a key for integration purposes, so it cannot readily be changed. MS AD in theory tackles this problem by internally using a GUID to identify users but this is far from complete and username is still critical in some places (mostly third-party integrations), most Linux environments haven&#x27;t even tried to address the problem.<p>Finally, the article&#x27;s section about evaluating whether or not there&#x27;s a real need for a legal name field reminds me of Heath Fogg Davis&#x27;s concept of a &quot;gender audit,&quot; which is similar and helps to address similar situations. Essentially, he calls for organizations to systematically review every case in which a person&#x27;s gender is recorded and determine whether or not it is really required. In many cases there&#x27;s actually no underlying reason (other than someone&#x27;s thinking that gender was a key and immutable component of identity), and the gender field can simply be removed, preventing a lot of down-the-line frustration in handling cases like transgender individuals. In other cases there is a purpose but it&#x27;s one that requires no particular constancy (e.g. selection of pronouns in notifications) and so it&#x27;s better to both make the property readily changeable and, even better, stick directly to the purpose for which you need the information and nothing more--for example, instead of asking for gender, ask the user which pronouns to use."],"time":["2020-05-11 21:11:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjc50"],"id":[23151720],"kids":[23153619,23151894,23156041],"parent":[23142324],"text":["Pleased to see the reference to there not being a concept of a legal name in the UK.

A bit of context in case your not doing ML day to day.<p>So everyone talks about AI, but the dirty secret of our space is that you need a lot of labeled data to train your AI on. Labeling data is a manual process and active learning is a way to use AI to speed up that manual process.<p>The core idea is that you let your model choose what to label next based on how &quot;valuable&quot; the next piece of information is. &quot;Valuable&quot; can be defined in many different ways, the most common is to choose data points that the model is least certain about.<p>ALMa is a utility that makes the engineering aspects of implementing active learning a little easier. When implementing active learning you need to keep track of what data has been labeled (what you train the model on) and what has not been labeled (what you label). The common ecosystem is very array based so this becomes an exercise in tracking offsets that is tedious and error prone. ALMa abstracts that away.<p>----A bit about LightTag ---<p>We make tools to annotate text, entities, classification and relationships. We make it particularly easy to work with larger teams of annotators, through automated workforce management and analytics (IAA, adjudication etc).<p>We&#x27;ve traditionally been on the fence about active learning because you run the risk of biasing your data to whatever model it was that your using.

Proxmox &quot;just works&quot; in the best sense of the phrase. Never had uptime issues or anything (knock on wood). The only bare-metal install at this point is my plex server, which has a special level of importance in my close and extended family, so I baby it a little bit. A lotta bit.<p>I use it for a lot of things - a windows VM for running the mega client (so it&#x27;s always on + isn&#x27;t on a personal machine to snoop around), a postgres server that I use for the dev&#x2F;qa versions of my personal stuff, a jenkins+wekan server, a vm just for minecraft servers, etc etc. It&#x27;s so easy to just spin up a new VM when I need a clean slate for something random.<p>If I at some point actually start my own business, we&#x27;d be a proxmox shop for any non-cloud infra. And the cost-effectiveness of even a handful of 1-gen-old Dell servers on-prem (for things that don&#x27;t need super high availability) is really hard to overstate when your budget isn&#x27;t attached to VC funding. I would not run prod infra on-prem at this point, though: DigitalOcean makes the cloud far too affordable for that. But I&#x27;d probably have all CI, data analysis, etc etc local for a good long while.<p>One gripe I have is their subscription&#x2F;license nag. It&#x27;s annoying and tacky. I would gripe less if they had an option that made it feasible for me, a guy running it in his basement with 0 profit motive, to buy a license. Right now, it&#x27;d be (~$85 * 2 sockets * 4 servers) for me. Sorry, that&#x27;s not happening, I could actually use DigitalOcean cheaper than that (and maybe even AWS). And it would be a huge % of my house&#x27;s tech-related OpEx (compare that to ~80&#x2F;yr for domains, $5&#x2F;mo for my one droplet, $100&#x2F;mo for internet, etc). If I had to name a price, I&#x27;d say $25&#x2F;yr would be about the most I&#x27;d drop (as a guy with a basement server room, of course).

In Go there is one or a small number of way to do something. Contrast that with C++ where there are any number of ways to do something and at least as many styles of coding. Too much choice results in complexity.<p>IMO the generics debate is overblown. The systems I&#x27;ve build with go tend toward heavy data processing (ETL, correlation, extraction and the like) and service (JSON APIs supporting front-ends; event some front ends with Go Templates). Never once was I like &quot;my life sucks because I don&#x27;t have generics.&quot; Fair and balanced: Processing JSON in Go takes some getting used to, especially when the JSON structure changes. However, there are some good libs to help. It&#x27;s just a friction point given the typed nature of Go.<p>The operational simplicity of Go cannot be overstated. Go&#x27;s production of a deployable binary with zero dependencies is a blessing. There&#x27;s an amazing deploy tool you can use called: cp. Compare that to the library version hell that is C++ (and I&#x27;m also a C fan and very experienced dev). No. Thank. You.<p>The cross compilation of Go code works beautifully. Just 2 weeks ago I had to demonstrate a tool to a customer and due to COVID it was virtual. We had problems with MS Teams connecting to our dev platform so literally 15 minutes before the demo I cross-compiled to a Win binary and moved it to the machine hosting the Teams call. Victory.<p>Because of go fmt, <i>all<\/i> Go code looks the same. That&#x27;s a massive advantage to read&#x2F;understand&#x2F;use OPC (other people&#x27;s code).

Always some colleague having smalltalk with another. Always a phone ringing, a person yawning, someone&#x27;s text notification buzzing on a table, someone typing very loudly. Not all the time, but at least every minute or few minutes. Many can&#x27;t concentrate, and the notion to just put on headphones for 8 hours is not healthy.<p>Psychology: Many of us hate the idea that someone behind us might be looking at us, our screen, our work. That there may be someone walking behind us that we know. That the sound of footsteps behind you might be your boss, or a colleague you&#x27;d like to chat with. It might be anyone, and there&#x27;s some desire to want to find out to get closure.<p>Open offices are okay if they&#x27;re part of a range of choices. I enjoy working in open offices sometimes. Sometimes it drives me nuts and there&#x27;s no escape. That&#x27;s not okay. There must be balance and there must be options.<p>For example, semi-open is a great start, because it means sound doesn&#x27;t bounce around in one big space of 60 people, but rather only in the space of 10, and gets limited in sound&#x2F;light traveling due to e.g. plants, windows etc.<p>If there are meeting rooms to meet or organise calls, that means the high-impact activities can be separated. If there are team-rooms, it means you can collaborate without impacting people who you don&#x27;t work with 9&#x2F;10 times, while you can still seek them out in their team room or meeting rooms, or an open-space setting you happen to be in for part of the week, if you do want cross-team collaboration.<p>The idea that teamwork flows best by putting everyone in one giant cage without caring for sensitivity to sound and human psychology, is a joke that in any other field would be seen as a bruteforce idiotic idea. Besides, the economics of non-open offices aren&#x27;t wildly different with the right approach. Sound-proofing to turn a giant area into a set of large areas by installing some glass has barely any impact on cost, but is already a semi-open improvement. There&#x27;s lots of good ideas on the spectrum of every desk in a cubicles vs all desks on a giant football field, it&#x27;s not one or the other and you need to provide balance and options."],"time":["2020-05-12 12:23:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sethammons"],"id":[23153284],"kids":{},"parent":[23151672],"text":["I worked in an open office for 7 or 8 years, and now have been working from my spare room for 2 years.

This was announced by the Bundeswehr IT service provider BWI. The announcement also states that &quot;in future the chat application will also be used for the transmission of information of the protection class &#x27;classified information - for official use only&#x27; (VS-NfD)&quot;.<p>This is surprising in that the use of free software for classified information and its approval by the BSI can sometimes be difficult, as the case of OpenGPG from last year shows. The first tests for the use of Matrix in the German Armed Forces have been running since December last year.<p>Due to the restrictions and protective measures in the wake of the corona pandemic, the Bundeswehr had also expanded the operation of the system to 30,000 smartphones as early as April. This is intended to enable a &quot;simple yet secure means of communication&quot;.<p>Starting this autumn, the Bundeswehr also wants to make it possible for private smartphones to be used for communication via matrix, but not for classified information. To enable private use and communication via chat even during the corona pandemic, the Bundeswehr is currently relying on the proprietary messenger Stashcat, which is available for up to 50,000 potential users.\nDisagreement in Germany<p>Stashcat is also used by other authorities. However, the announcement clearly states: &quot;In the course of further expansion, Matrix will replace Stashcat as the German Armed Forces&#x27; unified instant messaging platform&quot;. Stashcat will therefore only serve as an interim solution.<p>Unlike in centrally governed France, where the matrix system is to be used for all authorities, there is currently still a great deal of disagreement among German authorities about which messenger systems are to be used in the future. Besides the mentioned Stashcat and Matrix, there are currently also tests with the open XMPP standard or Wire.

One thought-provoking bit for me was:<p>&gt; Waymarking was previously employed to avoid explicitly storing the user (or “parent”) corresponding to a use. Instead, the position of the user was encoded in the alignment bits of the use-list pointers (across multiple pointers). This was a space-time tradeoff and reportedly resulted in major memory usage reduction when it was originally introduced. Nowadays, the memory usage saving appears to be much smaller, resulting in the removal of this mechanism. (The cynic in me thinks that the impact is lower now, because everything else uses much more memory.)<p>Any seasoned programmers would remember a few of such things - you undo a decision made years ago because the assumptions have changed.<p>Programmers often make these kinds of trade-off choices based on the current state (typical machines the program runs, and typical inputs the program deals with, and the current version of everything else in the program). But all of those environmental factors change over time, which can make the input to the trade-off quite different. Yet, it&#x27;s difficult to revisit all those decisions systematically as they require too much human analysis. If we can encode those trade-offs in the code itself in a form that&#x27;s accessible to programmatic API, one can imagine implementing a machine learning system that can make those trade-off decisions automatically over time as everything else changes via traversing the search space of all those parameters. The programming language of today doesn&#x27;t allow encoding such a high-level semantic unfortunately, but maybe it&#x27;s possible to start small - e.g. which of the associative data structure to use can be chosen relatively easily, the initial size of datastructure can also be potentially chosen automatically based on some benchmarks or even metric from the real world metric, etc."],"time":["2020-05-11 04:02:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nh2"],"id":[23138228],"kids":[23138305],"parent":[23137345],"text":["&gt; I’m not sure whether this has been true in the past<p>Phoronix.com has a lot of Clang benchmarks over the years.<p>I recall seeing some benchmark that showed that as Clang approached GCC in performance of compiled output, the compile speed also went down to approach GCC levels.<p>But I haven&#x27;t managed to find that exact benchmark yet."],"time":["2020-05-11 04:08:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ndesaulniers"],"id":[23138389],"kids":{},"parent":[23137345],"text":["We plan on starting to track compile times for Linux kernel builds with llvm.

ActionScript was still semi-relevant, but ColdFusion was barely supported anywhere anymore, and FoxPro (in any version AFAIK) hadn&#x27;t been updated in at least six years.<p>Whenever I got annoyed by this, they had this strong attitude of &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot;, and told me that there&#x27;s no reason to rewrite anything.<p>Coldfusion isn&#x27;t the worst language I&#x27;ve used, but ColdFusion code can be extremely difficult to debug, especially before they introduced CFComponents, and after about six months, I quit.  I haven&#x27;t talked to anyone there in a number of years now, but my understanding is that they really haven&#x27;t been able to replace anyone who left, since the number of people willing to do ActionScript and Coldfusion and FoxPro is shrinking every day.<p>Changing to $Hyped_technology has one really good side effect: it attracts talent.

You can frequently determine the balance of power between any two people in an organization by seeing which one has to read and prepare organized documents and presentations, and which one can simply speak and be spoken to. People want to paint pictures of themselves as being able to synthesize knowledge and ideas instantly, utter commands in real time and see them turned into action. In the other direction, they have no time for reading - you must request an audience with them and survive their real-time verbal sparring and probing questions to have your ideas received and considered.<p>My other musing on this is that I&#x27;ve always wondered if there would be value in teams establishing an internship or low&#x2F;mid level position for a technical writer to serve as a <i>team librarian<\/i>. &quot;Easy to search&quot; is good, but &quot;search&quot; itself is not sufficient for many situations - what you need is a person who can answer questions while taking context into account.

At my work, people prefer to write on Confluence for its inline-comment feature (before, they write in Google docs).

The writers will have yet another blocker to just getting stuff written down. The readers won’t know where to look and will have to interrupt people in Slack, as opposed to referring to the knowledge base themselves.<p>Agree x1000 with this point, with emphasis on the point about readers. The probability that someone will write down an important piece of information (and will do it well) is proportional to their perception of the benefit from doing so. If the would-be author thinks nobody would read it, they won&#x27;t write it down in the first place. If they think team members will find it and read it 1,000 times in the next 3 months, then they&#x27;re very likely to write it down.<p>&gt; I believe it has to be easy for people to write a document without having to worry too much about where to put it.

Crucially, I made clear that a &quot;blog post&quot; could be as little as 1 paragraph and a code snippet, it didn&#x27;t have to be big.<p>Blogging had the following advantages: 1. No need to think of &quot;where to put this in the wiki&quot; – just write it in the blog &amp; if we decide to put it in wiki we can move it later 2.

It allowed others on the team to learn from someone&#x27;s experience &amp; improved information sharing &amp; collaboration 5. If I figured out how to solve some issue and someone else ran into it, I could say &quot;go look at this blog post&quot; 6. When we had a new person join the team, during orientation I&#x27;d say &quot;read the last 6 months of blog posts (might take an hour or two) and that helps them understand the team culture &amp; norms <i>way faster<\/i> than they would otherwise 7.

The documents were a mix of bids and research reports intended for external use and internal docs associated with our sales&#x2F;project process. I raised several concerns about our writing process to management and spent many long hours fixing docs at the last minute. But my concerns didn&#x27;t get much traction with management.<p>One day, I discovered that our document identifier issuing system (yes, we had one!) could tell you how many docs had been registered by a particular teams in a given time period. This led me to the finding that our department created a new document something like every 58 minutes of a working year! We weren&#x27;t a software project group, we were in fact a document authoring function that also emitted software and research as a side effect. That observation got some traction with management, and I was funded to develop some how-to-write guidelines for document authors. Bid teams were particularly interested because the cost of document production in bid development often fell directly to the company, not to the eventual customers.<p>In addition to providing a basic &#x27;house&#x27; style for authors, the guidelines also highlighted the importance of easy-to-use doc templates and training for lead authors (e.g. those collating docs produced by multiple people, sometimes by sub-contractors)."],"time":["2020-05-11 17:24:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MattGaiser"],"id":[23141987],"kids":{},"parent":[23141353],"text":["&gt; As much as possible, encourage people to post anything of interest to the public channels.

In the latter case, we&#x27;re putting up extra roadblocks for the writer, because then they&#x27;ll need to spend extra time figuring out where to put their writing in the first place.<p>This is exactly the reason why we build Emvi [1]. I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of different tools and none of them really encouraged people to write stuff down. Not because they weren&#x27;t easy to get started with, or the editor was bad. I feel lost in a big hierarchical structure and was unsure where to put things. I always had to ask someone where to put a new article or where to find an existing piece of information. So a powerful search and focus on writing instead of organizing folders helps a lot. It still requires discipline and if you want a team to write down as much as possible, you need to build the culture. But if you don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re doing something &quot;wrong&quot; in the first place lowers the barrier. Once you have reached the critical mass of articles and put some tags on them, you will start to see connections automatically. Emvi allows you connect everything via mentions (start typing an @).<p>Check out our upcoming user interface [2], it will take this approach even futher.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emvi.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emvi.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emvi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;a-new-experimental-user-interface-QMZgmZG1L5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emvi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;a-new-experimental-user-interface-QMZg...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-11 15:49:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AnonC"],"id":[23143383],"kids":{},"parent":[23141353],"text":["&gt; Based on these stories, you might be determined to demand high writing standards everywhere, <i>right off the bat.<\/i><p>...including writing about COVID-19. :) Sorry, couldn’t help cracking a joke after being exposed to so many memes.<p>&gt; I believe this is the wrong approach though. Context matters. In a team of individual contributors, it’s crucial to share ideas early, to iterate and collaborate on them. Not everyone will have the same level of writing skills. Improving it can take a long time. Lower the barrier, encourage more writing, and people will get more practice.<p>This requires a feedback loop. It’s like writing a program and being satisfied with it yourself, and then someone points to a bug or does a code review and points to issues or areas for improvement. Just lowering the barrier to write without a respectful feedback loop isn’t going to do anyone any good. There are too many blind spots that writers themselves cannot discover.<p>&gt; Where you should enforce high-quality writing is broad or upwards communication, because there clarity is more important than speed and ideation. Here too, it’s important to keep in mind that good writing takes time.<p>Yes, it does take time. But being able to write well not only shows the person’s ability to write, but also clarity in thought and an ability to communicate thoughts to others. In a world where most of the communication, even before COVID-19, is in written form, it’s important to treat every piece that one writes with care. Mastering a language may not be easy. But showing some care while writing is within the reach of many people who need to convey their thoughts to others."],"time":["2020-05-11 17:48:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23146177],"kids":{},"parent":[23141353],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-11 21:47:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["dreen"],"id":[23142128],"kids":{},"parent":[23141353],"text":["I&#x27;ve started working on a Q&amp;A site that parses Slack logs and creates a thread on the site based on me asking people on Slack on how to do different things in our system.

Not everyone is as good of a writer and this skill does not map to coding skills. In the team I&#x27;m currently in, this is definitely a problem and I notice some people are not used to doing this and are effectively struggling to be part of the ongoing discussions.<p>I&#x27;ve met more than a few engineers that in meetings don&#x27;t tend to speak up and in chat channels mostly don&#x27;t engage. Chat channels tend to be dominated by the same people that are also dominating meetings. This is not necessarily a good thing.<p>For better or for worse, this causes side channels to pop up and this is where most of the discussion happens. This is a problem because it by design excludes people. But it&#x27;s needed because you can&#x27;t speak freely in a channel where everybody in the company listens in, including management, individuals you don&#x27;t get along with, etc. Pretending this is not a problem is not helpful.<p>In OSS projects, there&#x27;s a pattern of frequent contributors to be disciplined about how they use communication tools. IRC historically is the place where people discuss in an unmoderated forum. It&#x27;s noisy and chaotic and often not pretty. But it&#x27;s not necessarily there for documenting decisions. That&#x27;s what issue trackers or mailing lists are for. Those tend to have a narrower scope of what is on and off topic.<p>Translating chats into actionable items, or documenting outcomes of discussions is the key thing to do. The larger the project, the more obvious this need.<p>In a corporate setting, the tools for this are comparatively poor and not that good for facilitating asynchronous communication. E.g. Atlassian&#x27;s tools are pretty popular but not great for async stuff. IMHO Jira is slow to interact with and this obstructs effective communication. It&#x27;s notifications, default settings, etc. are basically completely wrong and counterproductive. Absolutely everything requires multiple mouse clicks. IMHO Github issues is vastly easier to deal with for engineers; it&#x27;s also easier to refer to commits and pull requests there. And with github actions integrated, you also get insight into the status of CI. Likewise conflucence is a PITA to use compared to managing markdown files in a git repository or co-authoring a document on Google docs.
