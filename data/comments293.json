I have an MA in linguistics including some NLP from about a decade ago and was looking at a career in academic NLP. I ultimately left to become a programmer because (of life circumstances and the fact that) I didn&#x27;t see much of a future for the field, precisely because it was ignoring the (to me) obvious issues of written language bias, ignorance of multi-modality and situatedness etc. that are brought up in this post.<p>All of these results are very interesting, but I&#x27;m not really feeling like we&#x27;ve been proved wrong yet. There is a big question of scalability here, at least as far as the goal of AGI goes, which the author also admits:<p>&gt; Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.<p>This woolly relation between language and reality is well-known. It has been studied in various ways in linguistics and the philosophy of language, for instance by Frege and not least Foucault and everything after. I also think many modern linguistic schools take a very different view of &quot;uncertainty and vagueness&quot; than I sense in the author here, but they are obviously writing for non-specialist audience and trying not to dwell on this subject here.<p>My point is, when making and evaluating these NLP methods and the tools they are used to construct, it is extremely important to understand that language models social realities rather than any single physical one. It seems to me all too easy, coming from formal grammar or pure stats or computer science, to rush into these things with naive assumptions about what words are or how they mean things to people.

NLP systems keep getting better and better at beating benchmarks and yet we still don&#x27;t have artificial agents that can hold an intelligent conversation, even in a restricted context.<p>Or rather, we had such programs since the late 1960&#x27;s, with no one else&#x27;s than Terry Winograd&#x27;s own doctoral thesis system, SHRDLU [1], but it seems that in the race to build powerful classifiers, we forgot how to build systems that can interact intelligently with a human.<p>Here&#x27;s a small excerpt from SHRDLU (taken from the wikipedia page on SHRDLU, originally in an appendix in Terry Winograd&#x27;s thesis):<p><pre><code>    Person: Is there a large block behind a pyramid?\n    Computer: YES, THREE OF THEM: A LARGE RED ONE, A LARGE GREEN CUBE, AND THE BLUE ONE.\n    Person: Put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid.\n    Computer: OK.\n    Person: Put the littlest pyramid on top of it.\n    Computer: OK.\n    Person: Does the shortest thing the tallest pyramid&#x27;s support supports support anything green?\n    Computer: YES, THE GREEN PYRAMID.\n    Person: What color is it?\n    Computer: BY &quot;IT&quot;, I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SHORTEST THING THE TALLEST PYRAMID&#x27;S SUPPORT SUPPORTS.\n    Computer: RED\n<\/code><\/pre>\nNote that this is not just mindless text generation. The conversation is held in the context of a &quot;blocks world&quot; where a robot with a single hand and eye (&quot;Computer&quot; in the excerpt above) moves blocks of various shapes and colours around, as directed by a human user in free-form natural language. When the Computer says &quot;OK&quot; after it&#x27;s directed to &quot;put the littlest pyramid on top of it&quot; it&#x27;s because it really has grabbed the smallest pyramid in the blocks world and placed it on top of the small block in an earlier sentence, as the Person asked. The program has a memory module to keep track of what ellipses like &quot;it&quot;, &quot;one&quot; etc refer to throughout the conversation.<p>SHRDLU was a traditional program hand-crafted by a single PhD student- no machine learning, no statistical techniques. It included, among other things, a context-free grammar (!) of natural English and a planner (to control the robot&#x27;s hand) all written in Lisp and PLANNER.

The difference is bit 1, the direction bit, supported by many instructions.<p>Internally, the 8086 has 5-bit registers that specify the source and destination, typically a register. [1] The source and destination register get their value either from the register specification in the instruction (bits 5-3 or bits 0-2), or values in the microcode.<p>The clever part is the outputs of the source and destination registers go through multiplexers that can swap them. If the instruction has a direction bit, and the direction bit is set, then accesses to the source and destination registers are swapped.<p>The point of this is that the microcode doesn&#x27;t know anything about direction swapping, so it is implemented &quot;for free&quot; as far as microcode size (but with the addition of the swapping circuit).<p>The 8086 has a &quot;Group PLA&quot; that categorizes instructions into groups; one of these groups is &quot;instructions that have a direction bit&quot;. This prevents direction swapping from happening for instructions where it is not supported.<p>I hope this explanation makes sense; it should probably be a blog post :-)<p>[1] You might wonder why source and destination are specified with 5 bits when the instructions use 3 bits to specify the register. The first reason is that many registers can be accessed as half-registers, so you need another bit. (This bit comes from the byte&#x2F;word specification bit in instructions.) Second, this mechanism is used to access the other 8086 registers, not just the general-purpose registers. Third, there are also invisible temporary registers that also need accessing. Thus, the internal register specifications are 5 bits."],"time":["2020-08-16 20:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BeeOnRope"],"id":[24181436],"kids":[24181491,24181650],"parent":[24178188],"text":["It might be worth noting that <i>strictly speaking<\/i> this isn&#x27;t safe to apply to an arbitrary binary.

But in reality, you are probably limited to languages with thin runtimes, e.g. Rust or C. Otherwise you will end up with a huge wasm blob. Imagine, there are 2 Java extensions, a C# one and something in Python, all running simultaneously. It means 3 different runtimes with a footprint by far exceeding that of the application logic in an extension.<p>Another burden is the bridging between the host and an extension. Unlike lua or js you can’t pass and inspect objects, the only option is to marshal data as a byte blob.

Ruby&#x27;s syntactic sugar inspired the &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; of tooling, primarily Bundler and Rspec. Tooling, for what felt like the first time, became a first class citizen. Ruby&#x27;s tooling made Heroku possible: ie, reproducible builds across; dev, testing, staging and production environments. Heroku&#x27;s success was based on the primitives of the Twelve-Factor App[1]. The 12 factors (and therefore Heroku) were fundamentally designed around the already-old lightweight virtualisation technology of LXC. The success of Heroku paved the way for Docker. The success of Docker created the world in which Kubernetes makes sense.<p>To be blunt: if you don&#x27;t understand the relevance of Kubernetes, or whether it&#x27;s relevant to you, you don&#x27;t understand the benefits of the 12 factors in their broadest sense.

Isolated processes and supervision trees can give you a lot of mileage, but the model is not a silver bullet.

I recently debugged a production issue by opening a console connected to a running system, and calling the functions I suspected to be failing to see what they were returning directly. Not sure if any other language has that facility.<p>Then there&#x27;s all the stuff built into Elixir, like the test suite, the build tool, and even an official linter &#x2F; code formatter.<p>Erlang interoperability is also a brilliant design decision.

Send regulators data the old way? While I do CAPEX the new way? C&#x27;mon.<p>- The data has to be represented somehow. Since BC brings nothing to that party ... BC will wrap Swift, FIX, Omego, or by exchange or by regulator reporting format ... so BC is a crap load of work to fix nothing about the domain. And even that is a simplification. There&#x27;s lots of little gotach&#x27;s in data reporting between all the counter parties.<p>- throughput is an issue on BC<p>- just the idea that any joe can add a box to the network and start looking at financial data ... it&#x27;s a non-starter ... although we can argue you can get some visibility from exchange data ... but traders might use BC to help settle and that may require a heck of a lot more detail that what NASDAQ provides<p>- BC isn&#x27;t a currency.

By avoiding the lunar night, one can avoid the approximately -150C surface temperature (depending on location). But you can still have a temperature varying from -80C to 100C or more for a mission lasting 10 days. That&#x27;s skipping the first and last 2 days of one lunar daytime, which is of course about 14 earth-days long, and is typical for a mission proposal. A short mission duration lets you arguably get away from using rad-hard components and a lot of redundancy.

Successfully figuring it out was way harder than it should have been.<p>I tried XAMPP recently after a long, long time (this is on Mac). After the initial steps of creating a database (not a problem for me), the database users and modifying wp-config.php, I faced all the errors the author writes about and more, and had to search online for solutions. Updating WordPress core fails due to permission issues. Cannot install plugins or themes from the dashboard because of permission issues. Heck, even uploading media files, like photos for example, for a WordPress post requires permissions to be handled. Even the location where the site is stored has to be mounted first if you’d like to explore, modify files, etc. Don’t even get me started on the black box that is ProFTPD to configure FTP access to the site (neither the ProFTPD site nor the StackExchange Q&amp;A sites were very helpful)!<p>All this would be forgivable if the documentation was adequate. But I found the XAMPP site’s documentation to be really thin and sparse. One would think that the most popular blogging engine (WordPress) would be included in the documentation. But no, they just wash their hands of by pointing to Bitnami for installing apps, and that didn’t work for me either.<p>I can understand the XAMPP team focusing only on the basics, but the project has been around for a very long time and should cater to what most users may be using it for.<p>I recall that XAMPP (and the Bitnami stack) used to be easier to work with. Or maybe my memory of it isn’t good enough.<p>I also tried MAMP and gave up within minutes (forget about the free trial of MAMP Pro and upgrading to it).<p>All in all, XAMPP was a total disappointment and a very frustrating experience.

People have assumed for some time now that writing a browser engine from scratch is intractable because of how large and complex web standards have become.<p>But what if you didn&#x27;t have to implement all of them?<p>Now, some people would suggest we jettison JavaScript and&#x2F;or CSS entirely. Or at least all of the additions made to them over the past decade. I think the idea that a browser like this would gain <i>any<\/i> traction outside of hardcore enthusiast circles is pure delusion.<p>Instead, what if features were prioritized based on how much of the web uses them? I&#x27;d bet that 90% of the web only uses 50% of the web standards out there. Some things like Flexbox are used on practically every new site that gets built these days. But there are dozens of obscure CSS properties that most web developers probably don&#x27;t even <i>know<\/i> about, much less use. And JavaScript APIs? There&#x27;s a host of bespoke progressive-web-app APIs (USB access, anyone?) that hardly anybody uses.<p>Also, a huge part of the web&#x27;s baggage is maintaining backwards-compatibility with the entire history of content. This is well and good, but not an ideal that an indie browser could afford to uphold. Frames, image area tags, etc. There&#x27;s probably a long tail of features - many of them deprecated - that could be jettisoned without having much impact on the average user&#x27;s experience. Even things like &quot;float&quot;, which aren&#x27;t deprecated, may have been instrumental at one point but are no longer very important.<p>Prioritizing the standards that matter and de-prioritizing the ones that don&#x27;t could dramatically cut down on the effort necessary for an MVP.<p>Taking this further: how do we know which features to prioritize? Most front-end devs probably have a rough idea, but what if we got empirical with it? What if we automatically tested the top 10,000 websites or something and made note of which CSS properties they used, which JavaScript APIs they called out to, and ranked them by frequency (and by popularity of the site?). We could chart a clear, direct path toward &quot;what does it take for a browser to be useful in 2020?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s possible this browser could even include existing JavaScript polyfills (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Glossary&#x2F;Polyfill\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Glossary&#x2F;Polyfill<\/a>) to help bridge the gap for things that it hasn&#x27;t yet implemented.

But I have always found the complexity of modern web not just unsustainable or risky but frustratingly wasteful.<p>Browsers are a universal medium both for content and UI for app and that&#x27;s great. But they are kind of the most wasteful creation ever. The most obscene apps of yesteryears would do a lot more with a lot less. An example of that is gmail taking 600MB memory (according to chrome) far more than a desktop client that didn&#x27;t depend of the server doing all the heavy lifting would have taken. It would have all my mails locally, would actually be much faster changing pages (if done correctly).<p>But I digress. I think the complexity comes from (apart from over engineering syndrome) trying to deny that there&#x27;s two very distinct use cases of web. One is nicely formatted semi static content and fairy dynamic stateful applications. I think designing a set of features (even modes in browsers that a page needs to declare for) can simplify things a lot.<p>The second thought I had was a brand new layout model&#x2F;engine that does away with all the crafts and define some powerful primitive that works in a more well defined way that doesn&#x27;t take a Google to properly implemented. Now I was thinking of two options of how to get that accepted.<p>1. A page can declare itself using the new primitives (now there can be two primitives for doc&#x2F;app or this simpler one might handle both?) and the engine is small enough that it&#x27;s worth having two in the browser. And the saving from some pages specially as it grows over time specially for well maintained&#x2F;popular pages use the faster version the overall browser efficiency increases even if you can&#x27;t remove the old engine.<p>2. Can there be a translation layer that can take a old layout page and rewrite the css&#x2F;layout into the new primitive. It&#x27;s perhaps slower than the current engine and perhaps on changes to content&#x2F;viewport&#x2F;scroll retranslate a lot but perhaps allow one to drop the old layout engine a lot faster.<p>Complete bonkers?

I remember that Android Market was still a few people in MTV, with no payment possibilities outside of the US, when Apple already had significant revenue from apps. And that shows everywhere.

Those two required rewrites of significant portions of any app that tried to bridge the transition using only supported APIs.  And every new point release (say, 5.1 to 5.2) brings a enough more minor deprecations to make an upgrade not a task, but a project.  That&#x27;s forcing a lot of significant rework, and every one of those gives people a chance to just take their project elsewhere.<p>(There&#x27;s actually a third alternative.  The release after these two major components were removed from core Rails, they were still semi-supported as add-on libraries.  In both cases, core support for those was ultimately cut off -- but people with old apps could try to keep at least portions of them working to minimize the damage.  I&#x27;ve done that to help avoid rewrites in components of an older Rails app.  I didn&#x27;t support all of either old API -- for example, rewriting uses of deprecated options to `belongs_to` was easier than keeping them on life support.

But Python is more popular than ever![2] Yes, some people (including us, at least for our website code) left Python, but lots and lots of people have moved to Python 3.<p>I&#x27;ve seen lots of people say &quot;oh, the move from 2 to 3 wasn&#x27;t that bad because of the tooling.&quot; That&#x27;s probably true, and we probably wouldn&#x27;t be moving to Go were it not for the fact that we had API changes _and_ Python&#x27;s changes to deal with (and Go gives us other benefits).<p>And then there&#x27;s Apple. Apple has a long history of maintaining compatibility for a time, and then getting rid of the bits that are holding them back. There are tradeoffs.<p>Maybe Android doesn&#x27;t break things for developers, but Apple makes it so that iPhone users can keep updating their phones to the latest OS (and apps) for much longer than the typical Android phone. Because of deprecations and a general desire to make apps that fit the platform, developers of popular apps on iOS put the time into updating them, and these apps are really nice to use as a result.<p>I think fit and finish on non-first-party native Mac apps tends to be better than those on average on Windows, though that&#x27;s just my opinion.<p>Carrying backwards compatibility comes with tradeoffs, and it&#x27;s possible to be successful by making different tradeoffs than maximizing backward compatibility.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.khanacademy.org&#x2F;go-services-one-goliath-project&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.khanacademy.org&#x2F;go-services-one-goliath-project...<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redmonk.com&#x2F;sogrady&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;27&#x2F;language-rankings-6-20&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redmonk.com&#x2F;sogrady&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;27&#x2F;language-rankings-6-2...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-16 15:45:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["discordance"],"id":[24167781],"kids":{},"parent":[24165445],"text":["One thing that I don&#x27;t understand about all this deprecation talk, as pointed out here:<p>&gt; So when it comes to shouldering the burden of compatibility, you need to pay for it. Not us.<p>Surely if there are shoppers&#x2F;customers affected by a deprecated service on GCP (or any cloud provider), then that would indicate a paying customer behind it. That payment should at least cover costs of running that service (infra, development, software and maintenance).

If maintaining compatibility is the goal then I can&#x27;t see how removing a function in a new API version will ever work. Maybe it&#x27;s because companies are expecting people to be dumb and call support when they use this deprecated API that was specifically designated as unsupported. &quot;But I can use it,&quot; they&#x27;d say, and still complain that it breaks or something. Maybe that workload is what they&#x27;re trying to avoid. But maybe they&#x27;d silently move away instead if continuing to use the platform meant rewriting everything.<p>Second: Why don&#x27;t people usually have automated API refactoring tools? When I was trying to port a Minecraft mod to a later version I found a bunch of things had changed in the engine. Okay, go to MCP and look at what changed. Guess what? It&#x27;s all a bunch of Markdown. They painstakingly went through the process of labeling every single API change and method renaming and so on, and they put it all in <i>Markdown.<\/i><p>There was so much missed potential there. Imagine if you had a policy encouraging your developers to put down every API change you make in your program in a machine-readable, schematized format that could be printed to a webpage or Markdown or something else, but could <i>also<\/i> be combined with a static analysis tool to at least print out the parts that need changing, if not refactor them, just like Google&#x27;s internal tooling? If developers don&#x27;t notate those changes by hand then that information is going to be permanently confined to unparseable changelogs and obscure IRC conversations. That&#x27;s the kind of thing that a semver increment can never capture the nuance of. Why guess what broke or manually parse changelogs based on a major version increment when you can have a computer do all the work for you?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because a changelog is &quot;information to throw away,&quot; that you&#x27;d have the painful time trying to read through the moment things break and then can forget about a couple of days later when the refactoring is done. But the changelogs and migration steps are essentially a bridge closing a chasm, with your entire userbase on one end trying to get to the other, and if it&#x27;s not made easy enough for them to cross they will either give up and leave or stay on the other side forever."],"time":["2020-08-15 15:31:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24167650],"kids":{},"parent":[24165445],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-15 12:09:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["bickeringyokel"],"id":[24166781],"kids":[24167021,24167043],"parent":[24165445],"text":["&gt; One fun bit of trivia about Bigtable is that they had these internal control-plane entities (as part of the implementation) called tablet servers, which had large indexes, and at some point they became a scaling bottleneck.<p>Anyone understand the technical jargon here?
