Uncompressed &#x2F; array stores are quite good.<p>The quantity and complexity of SQL necessary for a non-trivial OLAP view is daunting: time-series views (mix YTD and current-period calcs for transactional and balance accounts, get the ratio measures calculated, and handle the joins necessary for calculating and aggregating from the many (easily dozens) of fact tables that have different dimensionality and granularity and need to be joined at their finest detail. The user will want to see a set of metrics for a pair of orgsnizational units, and also as a percentage difference between the two org units. SQL does not have inter-row calculations, so quite a bit of work goes into re-shaping the SQL cursor’s results to something the user wants to see.<p>All that query generation and result transformation is part of the value-add of the “cube” server.<p>So the OLAP cube as a logical construct is definitely not fallen.

I can&#x27;t even imagine the political hurdles that were crossed to get to this point.<p>So today the difference is small.  I biked down Market street this morning and I had an extra lane to work with when buses were not around.  But other than that, not a huge difference.<p>But the change in a year or two will be huge.  I imagine they&#x27;ll re-time the lights for bikes&#x2F;buses instead of private cars.  Wider sidewalks and bike lanes.  More pedestrian traffic for businesses.  A quieter, cleaner, and safer street.  More room to plant trees, have outdoor public seating, etc.<p>Let&#x27;s give this one a chance.

It&#x27;s always seemed fine to me. Compare this to say Oxford Street in London (where I lived at the time congestion pricing was first introduced), which was clearly an issue. But sure, I&#x27;m on board.<p>Although I&#x27;m not sure why taxis need an exemption. I guess it&#x27;s another way to prop up a dying industry. Having caught cabs in SF before, I never will again, even if they can drive down Market Street.<p>The article also mentions 14th Street in NYC, which I live near and am very familiar with. This has been a contentious issue. Originally the L was planned to shutdown for 15-18 months and there was a plan to make 14th street sort of car free. I say sort of because cars were allowed to turn onto 14th Street but had to make the next right turn. This plan is now moot.<p>But a big concern was that it would just push car traffic to 13th and 15th streets, which are &quot;residential&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure why 14th Street needs a dedicated busway as it does have the L. Compare this to say 23rd and 34th street that have no cross Subway (42nd does).<p>But the elephant in the room here is that you can still park on 14th street. If you&#x27;re serious about increasing the traffic flow (of buses or otherwise) the obvious thing to do is free up 2 lanes by getting rid of the parking. But weirdly free street parking is sacrosanct in NYC politics.

We have tons of &quot;bus-only&quot; lanes, or bike lanes, and the rules are broken every other car with no penalties.  Apparently, just like in tech, we think that some rules, paint stripes, and people&#x27;s intentions won&#x27;t require any significant human administrative monitoring or intervention.<p>Compare it to NYC where you commonly see beat cops walking the street and patrolling every other block.  And more importantly, giving out tickets with an apparent belief that people should get penalized for committing minor offenses.   SF Police is just not present or interested in doing this, or resourced to do so.  They can&#x27;t even stop people from breaking into cars, and you think they&#x27;re going to be ticketing people for driving in a partial pedestrian zone?<p>I chalk it up to incompetent city government (which frankly right now, is actually hostile to proper policing -- with a DA who has openly said such, and a public who mistakenly thinks this is good to assuage their guilt), a lack of strong police culture, and the incredible cost of hiring people in California, that keep us from having the right amount of police.

The site supports https it will do an http 301 redirect to the https version of the site.<p>3) An attacker needs to intercept just one such redirect to have an opportunity for credential theft or content injection (downloads,exploits,etc...)<p>3) your browser does indeed remember these redirects going forward,which is great.<p>4) Except if you configured your browser to forget all history. Or if you happen to remember a site you visited a while ago (perhaps on a different device) and just typed it in to navigate. Or if you typed in something to search but your browser navigates to it,or many other opportunities for pwnage!<p>5) you don&#x27;t care about that? Well attackers are happy to setup a malicious captive portal(captive portal checks are plain http for all browsers I know of)  and use that directly or to social engineer installation of an app you &quot;need&quot; to connect (oh,mitmproxy has a nifty captive portal like page you can customize to install a CA cert on the device for TLS interception)<p>I won&#x27;t even begin to talk about at least half a dozen additional classes of MITM attacks that can be used, even with wpa3 and client isolation! What you have to understand is that vulns that would normally be low severity are amplified in this sort of a network, due to the sheer magnitude of threat exposure.<p>I can&#x27;t complain about most people being ignorant to good infosec practices(we have to understand+educate) but man this stings!

Although info on the service is now sparse, since at least 1995 PageSat was delivering a constant feed of Usenet updates via satellite broadcast as a means for smaller ISPs and BBS operators to avoid the (at the time) substantial bandwidth required to receive NNTP - I once worked in a rural university IT operation that no longer used the service but still had the hardware lying around. This sparked an interest in the broader ways that content has been delivered by satellite, predating the practicality of two-way VSATs. A prime example is the use of IP-over-MPEG to deliver the downlink side of a consumer internet connection via satellite television broadcast, while the uplink uses dial-up or ADSL. This arrangement is unusual in the US today but still in use occasionally.<p>On the other hand, there are still organizations trying to use the same &quot;broadcast internet&quot; model. Cidera nèe SkyCache flopped on using satellite broadcast to deliver content to edge CDN nodes in the early 2000s, and Outernet is currently flopping (minor opinion inserted there) on delivering educational content using a similar model.<p>This is viable in certain niches. The broadcast industry, for example, makes use of similar systems with the Public Radio Satellite System (affiliated with NPR) using one-way UDP broadcast to deliver live events and recorded syndicated programs to member stations. This has the upside of lower and latency and much lower jitter compared to the internet but the margin of superiority over conventional internet delivery is getting narrower by the day.<p>On a slightly related tangent, the general nature of the design of satellite data relay (with spot antennas covering relatively broad areas of the planet) means that the downlink channel of any satellite internet customer can generally be received over a wide area, even if they are using a modern two-way VSAT. With reasonable encryption this doesn&#x27;t pose much of a problem, but some satellite ISPs, particularly in the developing world, continue to make use of unencrypted IP-over-MPEG for their downlink. This allows a malicious eavesdropper anywhere in the region to receive the traffic one direction, which has the extremely important implication that it allows them to hijack TCP sessions by intercepting sequence numbers - this enables IP spoofing over TCP, something that is generally regarded as impossible. This is sufficiently reliable that it has been used as part of the C2 infrastructure in botnets.

The quote they provide is:<p>“By immediately lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, this bill will stimulate investment, job creation and economic growth in the United States,” AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson said at the time. “Research tells us that every $1 billion in capital invested in telecom creates about 7,000 good jobs for the middle class,” the CEO proclaimed.<p>Nowhere in this quote it says AT&amp;T specifically promises anything if they get a tax cut, or that they perform any actions at all. It&#x27;s a generic opinion about a nationwide economic policy, not a specific promise of an action of specific company. To call this &quot;lied&quot; is insane, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;d say &quot;lowering taxes is good for middle class&quot; and the tax cut happens but then I get in financial trouble and some journalist writes an article claiming I am a liar because I am middle class, and taxes were cut but I am actually doing worse off! It should be crystal clear that no nationwide economic policy can guarantee every single company would post profits every single year and would never have workforce cuts.<p>If somebody is lying here, it is the author of the article. He obviously have read AT&amp;T statements, as he is quoting them, he should be smart enough to understand what is being said in them, and still he claims AT&amp;T promised what it clearly never did. This is textbook definition of lying.<p>Now, its legitimate to argue that maybe tax cuts were not as good as their proponents promised, and maybe their real effects were different. But one can not do it on the example of one single company! AT&amp;T is indeed in big trouble, as somebody who recently cut off all ties with the company after being a client for more than a decade, I can confirm their service have gone way downhill, while their prices continue the steady march upwards. This company is in trouble, no question about that.

As vehicle safety systems and emissions controls increased we built safer and cleaner vehicles. They are harder to work on at first because you have to learn the concepts of more systems. Brake systems evolved to ABS controllers then further on to Traction&#x2F;Stability Controllers. Understanding one system makes it easier to understand the others.<p>I guess I am saying improvement does make things more complex. The most basic engine is loud, pollutes but works just fine. That does not mean it better- it was fun to toy with but a tuned well engineered machine is just as much fun if you can learn to tinker with it and play.<p>There will always be someone who will tell you your fuel injected, closed loop, oxygen and maf sensor controlled combustion cycle is less fun than an ol&#x27; fashion v8 with a carb.<p>I actually enjoy the paranoid world where we are building inherent security into every layer of computing.

This means the airline&#x27;s IT department is typically intentionally excluded from the talks between the airline&#x27;s marketing team and the agency doing the work. Making maintenance of whatever gets delivered a lot harder.<p>The Airline&#x27;s marketing team will say things like, &quot;Our IT guys are slow, if we ask them for an estimate they&#x27;d say 3 years... we want this done in 6 months.&quot; Even if the agency staff wants to flag a tech or security issue... the dev doing the work is more often than not just on a contract, and would have to fight his manager (who would then have to fight the account manager) to get any sort of time to fix the defect. The airline&#x27;s marketing team will lean on the agency to cut corners to hit the date.<p>Just an aside, often times the airline&#x27;s IT staff is so under-funded, their only option is to lock down every bit of equipment. So the airline&#x27;s marketing team ends up using OLD laptops with Windows 7, and can&#x27;t even install things like Slack. So all communication between the airline&#x27;s IT marketing team and the agency vendor happens on personal text messages, or via Whatsapp. Files are sent via whatever temp large storage host the marketing guys know how to use... I remember asking for a schema and getting back large chunks of customer data, over 100k rows, all sent via whatever &quot;free large file upload&quot; tool was popular at the time. I had to watch an ad video to download, seemed a lot more secure than a password...<p>When the project is finally launched, the agency won&#x27;t have put together any sort of documentation around it if that documentation wasn&#x27;t part of the requirements in the bid. And more often than not there&#x27;s no security review. True story... we shut down an internal testing server, and had a client call us panicked. When we gave them code, they couldn&#x27;t get their IT guys to load it onto their servers... so they just changed the DNS over to their test servers. This website was gathering customer details, and serving as the source of truth for the marketing CRM for years... we weren&#x27;t told us the test server was now customer-live, but doubtful anyone would have cared since all we did was mark up the cloud hosting bill and pass it on to the airline.<p>Also you can replace &quot;airline&quot; with just about any company type here that uses agencies, but certainly true for airlines."],"time":["2020-01-30 14:27:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["polskibus"],"id":[22191225],"kids":[22191876],"parent":[22184521],"text":["I wish new projects that have huge reuse potential like this one, did not start as single cloud provider-oriented."],"time":["2020-01-30 14:47:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andrewstuart"],"id":[22191910],"kids":[22261005,22196958,22192507],"parent":[22184521],"text":["Airbnb has build a needlessly complex solution that uses more technologies and layers than needed.

If someone hangs one up at their house that points to the street, they will pay fines and have to remove it; they drive around and check.<p>Law enforcement is not as strictly held to the privacy laws but they also cannot do what they want; they need permission, the equipment is costly as it needs to be stored in ways that protects the public and accessing it is very restricted to actual crimes in the location.<p>The people ‘in the bars’ are against all of this; they want cctv cams everywhere (with facial recognition if they know what it is) they can be put to catch burglars and robbers. So it will happen eventually.

This probably wouldn&#x27;t work for most scrapers&#x27; businesses, but it seems reasonable from the origin web site&#x27;s POV.<p>Another possibility would be to require web sites that accept and then publicize user submissions to give users a choice about whether they want to make their information public.  If they do, the hosting site has to include the information in a publicly-accessible feed, like a daily compressed download.  This seems reasonable to me, because the hosting site is getting all kinds of information for free from users.  It&#x27;s not like it would take a lot of effort to do a streaming JSON dump of the stuff that changed every day, and if necessary, they could throttle the download rate, but not so low that the data for a day couldn&#x27;t be downloaded in a day.

Of course, the competitor would have to publish a feed too, allowing other people to lunch off of them just like they are lunching off other sites.<p>With LinkedIn, all of the information they obtain and publish is submitted by users, so for LI to say they &quot;own&quot; this information makes no sense.

CFAA only explicitly applies once you (the service provider) enters into an explicit relationship of use with someone else.<p>I.e. If LinkedIn made an account necessary to even browse the currently &quot;public&quot; data, and set limits as a condition of being a user that would be fine, and may give them a leg to stand on for future claims of misuse of their systems since the behavior is already covered by a default terms of use in creating an account.<p>In terms of making currently public data more difficult to access in response to scraping, I foresee business evolving even more in the direction through which everything gets locked behind an initial contract step to ensure that people can reserve the right to refuse access.<p>I&#x27;m very wary of the whole malicious interference with a contract reasoning that hiQ employed. Just because you&#x27;re relying on a public data source to be accessible in a convenient way to you to deliver a service to an unrelated third-party should not obligate the party of the public data source to deliver data in a convenient way to you. That type of thing would lead to ridiculousness like being able to sue the makers of the Yellow&#x2F;White Pages for instance for changing things up.<p>Further, I still see grounds for remedy to LinkedIn in that they do still have a right to refuse service to anyone, regardless of outstanding contacts entered into by that person. The only leg to stand on that I can see for hiQ is if the court limited the precedent being set in the event that LinkedIn identified them, notified them and requested them to cease and desist, hiQ refused (or hiQ offered to enter into an alternate business arrangement and LinkedIn refused to accomodate), and then LinkedIn implemented the interfering measure. In that circumstance, I can see a malicious interference maybe being upheld, but I still have very little sympathy for hiQ because whether the pages are public or not, they are imposing a significant cost on LinkedIn to serve that data if his is systematically enumerating the entire public LinkedIn dataset.<p>To me, hiQ is a guy OCR&#x27;ing the White Pages&#x2F;recording a storefront 24&#x2F;7. The details of how the Internet operates changes that a bit, but nevertheless, it is there.<p>It is a fundamental continuation of a trend I&#x27;ve noticed in Tech in that it is a field where practitioners&#x2F;the businesses practitioners write code for for whatever reason assume that the platform running&#x2F;servicing code they write fundamentally &quot;belongs&quot; to them.

It certainly <i>affects<\/i> you if you are in other circuits. There&#x27;s no question that this precedent will be brought up in other courts, even if they aren&#x27;t bound to uphold the decision.<p>IANAL, but a bit of a supreme court hobbyist. For those unfamiliar, a short lesson on how the federal court system works that I think would be useful for HN readers:<p>Generally speaking, a case first goes to District Court. There are 94 districts in the country and they tend to consist of small regions. For example, Northern California (note these are for <i>federal<\/i> courts... each state has it&#x27;s own state system, which operates differently in each state). So you first go to one of these courts when you bring a lawsuit.<p>Now, the lawsuit is decided and one side is unhappy with the verdict. In a lot of cases, they might say, &quot;ok, I&#x27;m unhappy, but I&#x27;m also spending a lot of money on lawyers, so i&#x27;ll accept the decision and move on&quot;. Or they have the right to appeal the decision. If they choose to do the latter, then the next layer of the court system, the Circuit Courts come into play.<p>The Circuit Courts consist of 11 &quot;circuits&quot; plus the DC [0] and Federal Circuits [1]. When you appeal a case to one of the circuit courts, they <i>have<\/i> to hear your case. It&#x27;s your <i>right<\/i> to appeal. However, if they think the case doesn&#x27;t have merit, they can issue what&#x27;s called a &quot;summary judgement&quot; where they issue an opinion without a full trial. In other words, if they think the lower court issued the correct decision and they think it would be a waste of time to go through a trial to appeal it, they can look over the facts of the case and make a decision without a trial.<p>At the next level up, you have the Supreme Court [2]. Unlike at the circuit court level, you have no right to appeal to the supreme court. Generally speaking, they get to decide which cases they want to take, so if you think that the appeals court screwed up and the supreme court decides to not take your case, there&#x27;s nothing you can do. Unlike appeals courts, they aren&#x27;t even obligated to look over the facts of the case at all if they don&#x27;t want to.<p>Instead, what happens is that you <i>petition<\/i> the Supreme Court to hear your case. So you lose your case at appeals court and you basically file paperwork with the SC saying &quot;please please hear my case, here&#x27;s why i think you should&quot;.<p>The SC turns down a lot more cases than it hears. So what makes them take a case on? One is if the case is super super important. Something like a case against Obamacare or something else of very high national significance. But typically, the SC takes a lot of boring cases too, and for the most part, this has to do with circuit splits. A circuit split is when two of the regional circuit courts issue conflicting rulings. So for example, if every circuit more or less rules the same way on a given issue, there&#x27;s nothing for the supreme court to decide on. The system is working as intended. But if two circuits disagree, then the SC&#x27;s job is to resolve the issue so that federal law is applied uniformly.<p>So in this case, the ruling was issued in the Ninth Circuit (which covers California and much of the West). Technically speaking, I can sue someone over scraping my site in Wisconsin (in the 7th Circuit) and the judge can rule in my favor (that scraping is illegal) since she isn&#x27;t bound to follow 9th Circuit appeals rulings, whereas a district judge in Colorado or Montana (both in 9th Circuit) are bound by the appeals court precedent. And then they appeal the case in Chicago and the appeals court <i>also<\/i> isn&#x27;t bound by the Ninth Circuit ruling. But you can be damn sure that the lawyers for the defense are going to bring up that Ninth Circuit case as precedent. And generally speaking, the precedent does matter (circuits don&#x27;t <i>want<\/i> to create circuit splits).<p>Coming back to this case, does this mean that you have carte blanche to scrape websites anywhere in the country? No, case law is going to need to evolve more to get to the point where you can safely think that way. But, this is definitely an important step in that direction.<p>[0] Washington DC has its own circuit, even though it&#x27;s just a city, not a region. This seems odd at first glance, but in fact, a lot of lawsuits against the federal government come through this circuit, which is why DC gets it&#x27;s own circuit, while for example, NYC does not.<p>[1] The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is a special case. Most of these circuit courts have to do with regions. So if I commit a federal crime in Florida, it gets tried in a Florida District court and then it gets appealed in the seat of the 11th circuit, which is in Atlanta. However, certain cases, based on subject material, don&#x27;t get appealed in Atlanta, but go instead to the Federal Circuit. These tend to be things with national ramifications. Patents are a prime example, where you really really don&#x27;t want a patent being enforced in Iowa, but not in Alabama. So for these special cases, we set up a different appeals system.<p>[2] There are a few times when cases go straight to the supreme court. For example, in disputes between two states or cases involving ambassadors and other public ministers, a case might go straight to the SC and skip the lower courts. But this is the exception, not the rule."],"time":["2020-01-29 17:21:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Grimm1"],"id":[22183092],"kids":{},"parent":[22180559],"text":["I&#x27;d been following this for sometime, happy that the appeals court upheld common sense reasoning.

It&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve always dreamed existed in the UI world. The development experience is great and designers seem to love it as well.

How did it find itself on Facebook?<p>The app wasn&#x27;t given any permissions and I did not enter any personal information.

Bit me a few times.<p>- You cannot inspect the scene in the editor visually while debugging. This is what I miss the most coming from unity. Some things are really hard to debug this way, for example if you use procedural generation.<p>- 2D coords starting at the top left corner of the screen and increasing right&#x2F;down is really confusing.

It sounds like they want to attract young developers to lock them into those awkward frameworks, because they advertise it as being full-featured engines, but small developers might not really need to focus on bleeding edge rendering, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>I know there are engines like Ogre3D, but I would rather spend time learning an actual universal graphics API that works on all hardware, which has more value on a resume, and I can just use what I need. All other things like audio, animation, inputs, physics, etc are available as C++ libraries.<p>Those frameworks are saying &quot;see? you can make your own game with those tools!&quot;, but when you actually learn how a computer works, and know how to write code, you realize you want to avoid those frameworks because they conceal too much from the programmer, and usually you don&#x27;t want a developer to not understand what the framework is doing.

A solver for the unstructured Euler equations.  ...I was intending to volunteer time for an local university project investigating parallels between Holographic light with orbital angular momentum and hydrodynamics (in this case the Euler&#x2F;Madelung equations).  Not sure what happened as... volunteers get lost in the shuffle?  Anyway, the solver is fun.<p>2.)  Porting my Python code for nonlinear gradient driven optimization of parametric surfaces to C++.  Includes a constraint (propagation) solver based on Minikanren extended with interval arithmetic for continuous data (interval branch and contract).  This piece is a pre-processor, narrowing the design space to only feasible hyper-boxes before feeding design parameter sets (points in design space) to the (real valued) solver.  Also it does automatic differentiation of  control points (i.e. B-spline control points) so I can write an energy functional for a smooth surface, with Lagrange multipliers for constraints (B-spline properties).  Then I get the gradient and Hessian without extra programming.  This makes for plug and play shape control.  I am looking to extend this to subdivision surfaces and&#x2F;or to work it towards mesh deformation with discrete differential geometry so I&#x27;ve been baking with those things in separate mini-projects.<p>3.)  Starting the Coursera discrete optimization course.  This should help with, e.g. knapsack problems on Leetcode, some structural optimization things at work, and also it seems the job market for optimization is focused on discrete&#x2F;integer&#x2F;combinatorial stuff presently so this may help in ways I do not foresee.<p>4.)
