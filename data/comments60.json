He passed away due to  mesothelioma, but her father who grew up there has not been affected, which is quite amazing given the circumstances. I have seen footage from Wittenoom of children playing in mounds of asbestos.<p>Today there are two general types of legacy asbestos products, friable and non-friable. Generally non-friable products such as asbestos-cement sheeting are considered safe to leave in place and are only dangerous when cut, broken or otherwise damaged. Friable products such as pipe lagging are very dangerous as they easily break down into fibers that can be inhaled.<p>It can be found in many old homes in odd places. I was removing some old putty around a window and a friend of mine who was an asbestos hygienist suggested that it could contain asbestos and took a sample for testing (all clear thankfully).<p>In another instance I worked on a demolition of a 1960&#x27;s era multistory apartment complex. During construction of the concrete core walls the builder had used asbestos in the formwork, leaving some embedded in the wall at regular intervals. This meant that all of demolition waste was considered contaminated and was going to a special dump at a huge cost.<p>Finally, there was an infamous case in Canberra, Australia where a company called Mr Fluffy [1] installed loose friable asbestos as insulation in homes. A cleanup program in the 90&#x27;s did not adequately fix the problem and so in 2014 the government finally purchased affected properties and demolished the houses.<p>Asbestos is bad stuff, but exposure causing mesothelioma seems to be a bit like Russian roulette. You might get it, you might not. But if you do, you will die.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mr_Fluffy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mr_Fluffy<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 01:45:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aresant"],"id":[24298513],"kids":[24298602,24298605,24298659,24299149,24299929],"parent":[24298104],"text":["Build on this even in 1942, just prior to the discovery of the link to Mesothelioma, we were busily figuring out every use case we could for asbestos - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tC8L8ooBSgQ&amp;t=1m8s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tC8L8ooBSgQ&amp;t=1m8s<\/a><p>Despite the recognition of Mesothelioma in the early 1900s it took almost 40 years to associate the disease with Asbestos.<p>My understanding is that this was due to the 10 - 40 year average post exposure timeline for Mesothelioma to show up.<p>If Asbestos was discovered today would our contemporary understanding of materials science &amp; safety prevent us from spinning up factories and use cases like this?<p>(1) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;asbestosis&#x2F;symptoms-causes&#x2F;syc-20354637\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;asbestosis&#x2F;sy...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-27 22:51:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liability"],"id":[24298420],"kids":[24298487,24299922,24299448],"parent":[24298104],"text":["I&#x27;ve heard this Charlemagne legend before but I&#x27;d love to see somebody put it to the test.

I’ve been on Hacker News 13 years but this is my first Show HN. You might know me from YC08 and as Heroku cofounder and author of 12factor.net.<p>Today my team and I are launching Muse, a thinking tool.<p>Engineers sometimes talk about “typing problems” and “thinking problems”;  Muse is for the latter. For example: designing a distributed system, doing a deep read of an algorithms paper, or creating a product roadmap.<p>My colleagues and I spent a few years doing research at a lab called Ink &amp; Switch. You can read HN discussions of our publications on software performance [1], the creative process [2], and local-first software [3].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18506170\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18506170<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20255457\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20255457<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21581444\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21581444<\/a><p>One research question for us was whether touchscreens could ever be as powerful as desktop tools like vim or emacs. That resulted a prototype we named Muse. We saw commercial potential and spun it out of the lab last year.<p>A founding insight for Muse is that deep thinking happens away from the computer. e.g. in a sketchbook, on a whiteboard, or just in your head. There are some up-and-coming tools for thought like Notion and Roam but they’re tied to the desktop&#x2F;laptop form factor and primarily focused on text. We saw an opportunity for a thinking tool that blends together visual media, text, and offers spatial navigation on a tablet.<p>Since this is a technical crowd, you might be interested in some of the challenges building this thing, like maintaining 120fps at all times. There is no concept of opening a file or a loading screen—you just navigate to a document and it’s already there. Ink rendering is another ongoing engineering challenge, from point simplification to curve fitting to stroke masking for the eraser. Happy to talk about any of this in the comments.<p>We’re charging $100&#x2F;year, comparable to other prosumer tools like Dropbox, Evernote, Roam, etc. There’s a generous free tier and you can export your data as a flat files (PNG, PDF, TXT).<p>We’re building in public on Twitter: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MuseAppHQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MuseAppHQ<\/a> and Mark and I talk shop on our podcast: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;museapp.com&#x2F;podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;museapp.com&#x2F;podcast<\/a><p>HN is known for sharp critique, so bring it on.

It reminded me of my impression of Scheme when I first learned it over twenty years ago. You can learn the language in a day, but it takes a while to realize how exceptionally powerful it is. But it&#x27;s not just its radical design that&#x27;s interesting from an academic perspective; I also think that its practical goals align with mine. My primary programming language these days is C++, and Zig is the first low-level language that attempts to address all of the three main problems I see with it: language complexity, compilation speed, and safety.<p>In particular, it has two truly remarkable features that no other well-known low-level language -- C, C++, Ada, and Rust -- have or can ever have: lack of macros and lack of generics (and the associated concepts&#x2F;typeclasses) [1]. These are very important features because they have a big impact on language complexity. Despite these features, Zig can do virtually everything those languages do with macros [2] and&#x2F;or generics (including concepts&#x2F;typeclasses), and with the same level of compile-time type safety and performance: their uses become natural applications of Zig&#x27;s &quot;superfeature&quot; -- comptime.<p>Other languages -- like Nim, D, C++ and Rust also have a feature similar to Zig&#x27;s comptime or are gradually getting there -- but what Zig noticed was that this <i>simple<\/i> feature makes several other complex and&#x2F;or potentially harmful features redundant. Antoine de Saint-Exupery said that &quot;perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot; I think that Zig, like Scheme -- and yes, there are others -- is close to that minimalist vision of perfection.<p>What a truly inspiring language. Rather than asking how we could make C++&#x27;s general philosophy work better as another increasingly famous language does, IMO, it asks how we could reshape low-level programming in a way that&#x27;s a more radical break with the past. I think it&#x27;s a better question to ask. Now all there&#x27;s left to hope for is that Zig gets to 1.0 and gains some traction. I, for one, would love to find a suitable alternative to C++, and I believe Zig is the first language that could achieve that in a way that suits my particular taste.<p>[1]: I guess C has the second feature, but it loses both expressivity and performance because of it.<p>[2]: Without the less desirable things people can do with macros."],"time":["2020-08-27 13:57:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tobz1000"],"id":[24293284],"kids":[24293329,24294235],"parent":[24292437],"text":["Some of Zig&#x27;s ideas fascinate me, both the great low-level concepts (e.g. arbitrary-sized ints), but much more than that, the high level concepts.<p>Particularly great is Zig&#x27;s handling of both macros and generic types, the answer to both of which seems to be: just evaluate them at compile-time with regular functions, no special DSL or extra syntax. Andrew mentions in the video a big drawback of this system - implications for IDE complexity and performance. I imagine the performance side of this could be (maybe is?) mitigated by limiting recursion depth&#x2F;loop counts for compile-time work.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly interested in taking on a language with manual memory management and the responsibilities it entails, but I would love to have access to Zig&#x27;s compile-time capabilities, if it were available with some more memory safety."],"time":["2020-08-27 15:08:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HourglassFR"],"id":[24294015],"kids":[24295081,24294053,24294562,24298209,24300406],"parent":[24292437],"text":["I&#x27;ve stumbled upon the Zig language a while back and have been checking in regularly to follow its progress.

They do this without thinking about it at all:<p>3a. As stated, flats volume has collapsed, so there is still a <i>lot<\/i> of excess capacity.<p>3b. Even if every single voter were to vote by mail only, this would mean at most two additional flat pieces per voter (one ballot to the voter, and one ballot sent back). Think about how much mail (not packages, mail) you already receive daily on average. Do you really think two additional pieces would collapse the system? Of course not, any more than the USPS collapses every January when the IRS and every single employer, bank, and other financial institution sends out tax-related documents. (The USPS hires seasonal help in December for packages, not for Christmas cards.)<p>3c. If this really were a sinister Trump administration voter-suppression scheme, it&#x27;s a pretty weak one that can be defeated by dropping ballots off in person, and&#x2F;or voting in person.<p>4. An actual serious issue is states and counties that aren&#x27;t like Oregon (which has been 100% vote by mail for two decades) trying to convert to vote by mail without preparation. Think of how much mail your home receives for the previous tenant (and the one before that, and the one before that). Think of this all having to be done by early October, to give voters about a month to receive and return ballots. This is what the administration has been pointing out, something rarely heard amidst the nonsense about mail-vote suppression.<p>[1] Congress mandating the USPS to prepay pensions is a <i>good<\/i> thing. The postal service is an industry that is, by definition, in secular decline (barring unusual events like COVID19) because of the Internet. Congress recognized this in 2006 and thus required USPS to prepare over 10 years to get its pensions ready, because there&#x27;s no reason to believe that future revenue (and future employee-count growth) is going to sustain pensions for retirees otherwise."],"time":["2020-08-27 08:17:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["9nGQluzmnq3M"],"id":[24290389],"kids":[24291861,24290619,24290734,24291837,24290996,24294008],"parent":[24289976],"text":["TL;DR: DeJoy&#x27;s changes appear to have made USPS slightly slower (0.1-0.5 days) in some places, but much less than the delta caused by a holiday like July 4th (see note buried at the very end)."],"time":["2020-08-27 07:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tlack"],"id":[24262518],"kids":[24291287,24290721,24290271,24296493,24290632],"parent":[24262448],"text":["Code sample:<p>Actor model with explicit synchronicity and access scoping:<p><pre><code>  actor Counter {\n    var value = 0;\n    public func inc() : async Nat {\n      value += 1;\n      return value;\n    };\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nTypes and specificity:<p><pre><code>  type Tree&lt;T&gt; = {\n    #leaf : T;\n    #branch : {left : Tree&lt;T&gt;; right : Tree&lt;T&gt;};\n  };\n\n  func iterTree&lt;T&gt;(tree : Tree&lt;T&gt;, f : T -&gt; ()) {\n    switch (tree) {\n      case (#leaf(x)) { f(x) };\n      case (#branch{left; right}) {\n        iterTree&lt;T&gt;(left, f);\n        iterTree&lt;T&gt;(right, f);\n      };\n    }\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSource: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdk.dfinity.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-guide&#x2F;motoko.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdk.dfinity.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-guide&#x2F;motoko.html<\/a><p>Not to my taste personally."],"time":["2020-08-24 18:50:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tines"],"id":[24294518],"kids":[24296189],"parent":[24262448],"text":["Looks cool.

When a value is accessed, it is promoted to the front of the list. So the last item in the list is least-recently accessed.<p>In a LFU cache, you might try the same idea, except each node also has a counter. When an item is accessed, increment its counter, and then swap with previously-higher-counter items to keep the list sorted. In this way an infrequently accessed item does not get promoted.<p>However this has a problem for certain access patterns. If every item has the same counter value, then accessing the last item in the list will force it to migrate up the whole list - O(N). You could use a heap instead, and get log time, but that&#x27;s still not the constant time that LRU provides.<p>What&#x27;s proposed here is to bucket items by counter. Each bucket has a linked list of entries, and each entry knows its bucket. The buckets themselves are arranged in a linked list. When an item in the N bucket is accessed, it conceptually unhooks itself from the N bucket and adds itself to the N+1 bucket, creating it if necessary.<p>Incidentally, a tip for writing this sort of cache: make your list circular, starting with a sentinel node (I call it the &quot;mouth&quot; since it eats its tail).

This is the largest cloneable Webflow project ever released featuring 12,400 elements, 1800 styles, 1200 assets, and 400 interactions. The interface can easily be hooked up to a backend to incorporate functionality. This is not a playable game but a demonstration of how far we can push nocode.

This was an industrial scale data management and logistics problem that IBM was uniquely qualified to facilitate. The fact that they did so is not contested although it is not spoken of often and surely does not condemn today&#x27;s IBM. We should however take it as an object lesson in the double edged sword of technology and the warning that we must restrain firms that would have us think they won&#x27;t be evil.<p>&quot;...in the 2012 reissue Black presents a letter dated 1941 from IBM that directed a Dutch subsidiary to work with Dehomag — years after business with Germany was supposed to have ceased. Furthermore, according to Black’s 2012 evidence, Watson took a one percent commission on all profits made in business with the Nazis, and had to personally approve all expenditures on said business, such as bomb-fortifying Dehomag installations.&quot;[2]<p>&quot;What Hitler has done to us through his economic warfare, one of our own American corporations has also done . . .

Most of them will not be trustworthy nor we can expect all of them to maintain good security standards for saving payment info.<p>The biggest culprit of all this drama is Apple does not allow secondary payment inside apps AND also, if you have secondary payment outside of app, they do not allow that price to be lower. There is no competition, thus Apple can get away with whatever it chooses to. Thus the monopoly.<p>4. SOLUTION:<p>a) charge a flat fee for reviewing&#x2F;serving apps. If necessary, linearly increase it based on daily active users if they need more resource to support that app.<p>b) allow whitelisted secondary payment providers. Only whitelisting few payment methods which are trustable eg applepay, googlepay, paypal, stripe, etc will maintain security of payment data.<p>c) allow secondary payment price to be lower than Apple.<p>With this solution, there will be competition between payment providers which will drive the price down."],"time":["2020-08-27 02:18:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aaronbrethorst"],"id":[24288876],"kids":{},"parent":[24288315],"text":["<i>We are committed to securing lasting freedoms for all.

For a long while now, iOS has been the mobile accessibility leader, and unless you as a blind person have some specific reason to use Android, you&#x27;re encouraged to use iOS.<p>Back in 2009 when Android accessibility was a joke, by which I mean as a developer I found major API issues within a few hours of development, I wrote one of the first and most popular Android screen readers. I think it was at least the first to be publicised even before TalkBack, where by &quot;publicised&quot; I mean TalkBack wasn&#x27;t in Android&#x27;s release notes, but I at least had an APK installable via tinyurl and posted to a mailing list. I quite literally had nothing else to do with my time at that point in my life, and Android 1.6 had an accessibility API, so on a lark I started writing a screen reader. The project has since died out, but for a long while, Spiel was a thin on Android.<p>iOS won&#x27;t let me do anything like that. Further, iOS won&#x27;t even let me code for it unless I use MacOS, and while MacOS has some decent accessibility features, it&#x27;s been a royal pain in my ass to code on. I could elaborate, but to keep this comment brief, take it as a given from a subject area expert that developing on MacOS as a blind person is worse than any other platform I&#x27;ve used to date. And that&#x27;s saying something, since Linux is my primary platform, and there are a number of blind developers who won&#x27;t touch it with a 10-foot pole. I don&#x27;t want to claim that coding on MacOS under VoiceOver isn&#x27;t possible, but it&#x27;s more difficult than it needs to be.<p>Yes, these are two huge corporations slugging it out, and it&#x27;s hard to muster much sympathy for Epic. But I wouldn&#x27;t be the developer I am today if it weren&#x27;t for Android&#x27;s openness letting me build a screen reader, and its further openness letting me build an accessible GPS navigation app which I&#x27;ve hacked on in some form for around a decade now, and which I&#x27;ve come to rely upon. It bugs me to no end that the more accessible mobile platform is so locked down such that a budding blind software engineer handed an iPhone can&#x27;t code for it using JAWS or NVDA. So Apple is handing blind people internet-connected mobile computers with all sorts of sensors, and telling them the only way they can develop for these devices is by using a sub-par development environment that&#x27;s going to fight them every step of the way and, likely, turn them off of software development more broadly. Then maybe we wonder why we don&#x27;t see more blind software engineers?<p>So, go Epic. If they start being asses later then of course I&#x27;ll oppose that, but if they have a big enough saber to start breaking up Apple&#x27;s stranglehold on the most accessible mobile platform, they&#x27;ve got my support 100%. Hell yeah, the web wouldn&#x27;t have been possible under Apple&#x27;s rule. And while I respect those of you who want more secure devices and a curated experience, don&#x27;t under-estimate the harm caused by locking blind developers out of one of the most accessible computing environments they&#x27;re ever likely to get. No, jumping through certificate hoops to install something that will expire after a week isn&#x27;t anything near what I&#x27;m asking for.<p>And to those of you who say &quot;Just tell your blind friends to use a Pinephone,&quot; I wish I could, but Linux accessibility infrastructure has no support for touchscreens and touch events. Any of you millionaires reading this interested in funding that development? ;) Serious question, I&#x27;ll work to put you in touch with the right folks."],"time":["2020-08-27 03:03:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Andrew_nenakhov"],"id":[24288957],"kids":{},"parent":[24288315],"text":["If Epic pulls this off and Apple will be forced to allow app sideloading and third party appstores, I pledge myself to install Epic Store on some of my desktop computers."],"time":["2020-08-27 02:37:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["happytoexplain"],"id":[24288885],"kids":[24288912,24288919,24288929],"parent":[24288315],"text":["This is one immoral company fighting another for money and simply hoping people will see the other as more immoral.<p>There&#x27;s something disgusting about their technique of preparing a propaganda film portraying themselves (a massive corporation) as the courageous underdog representing the people, then purposefully breaking ToS for the purposes of provoking the obvious reaction which they could then &quot;react&quot; to by releasing the film.<p>Of course all of this is independent of Apple&#x27;s actual sin, which is indeed an overbearing ToS."],"time":["2020-08-27 02:25:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TedDoesntTalk"],"id":[24288808],"kids":[24289040,24288854],"parent":[24288315],"text":["&gt; Apple’s policies would have even blocked the World Wide Web if it had been invented after the iPhone, because Apple policies disallow running code not reviewed by Apple, accepting payments directly from customers, and accessing content not reviewed by Apple — all fundamental features of the web<p>YES!"],"time":["2020-08-27 02:14:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bassman9000"],"id":[24288814],"kids":{},"parent":[24288315],"text":["This argument will be useful next time a brick and mortar store tells me they only take cash."],"time":["2020-08-27 02:15:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["samename"],"id":[24290085],"kids":[24293743],"parent":[24289299],"text":["Key highlight:<p>&gt; On October 1, 2020, if you haven&#x27;t changed the default branch for new repositories for your user, organization, or enterprise, it will automatically change from master to main.

The solution to this is to start with &#x27;why&#x27; - having a core purpose that will drive all other aspects of your product&#x2F;service and delivery.<p>The author of this article asserts that this leaves out a &#x27;who&#x27; - the customers that you are selling to. He says that one needs to begin by choosing your target market and aiming all efforts tailoring the experience to them.<p>I think this is a bit backwards - especially when he is trying to suggest that Sinek is &quot;fundamentally wrong&quot;. To me, it would seem that if you start off with a higher level purpose, then the &#x27;who&#x27; will fall out of that. I want to manufacture and sell a completely open source mobile phone because I believe that all humans should have access to commodity communications devices that aren&#x27;t tied to a proprietary OEM or service carrier. The &#x27;who&#x27; from this will come out as either &#x27;people who have an interest in open source and freedom&#x27; or &#x27;people who want a cheap commodity device&#x27;. How do I pick between these groups to focus? I go back to my &#x27;why&#x27; and elaborate it. I don&#x27;t pick one arbitrarily (i.e. start with &#x27;who&#x27;) and then pick a raison d&#x27;etre based on that choice.<p>I think it&#x27;s also fair to point out that Sinek seems to have a weird fascination with trying to back up his points with Bullshit science (the TED talk mentioned in the article tries to assert that his methods are correct &#x27;because of biology&#x27; which is tenuous at best.
