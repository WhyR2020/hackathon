Maker has a really good core idea, several great elements to it:<p>1. The stablecoin is backed by collateral, typically a significant amount more collateral than the amount of stablecoin that has been issued.<p>2. People locking up collateral get greater exposure to Eth&#x27;s volatility. So there&#x27;s genuinely a reason to lock up collateral to issue stablecoins if you are bullish on Eth.<p>But, this breaks down a bit. There&#x27;s no way to instantly convert the stablecoin back into the collateral asset, you have to find someone with a CDP who is willing to buy the stablecoin from you.<p>Similarly, there&#x27;s no way to unlock your collateralized asset, you have to find someone who is willing to sell you the stablecoin in order to open up your vault and get your eth out.<p>So on both sides of the equation, you have this liquidity risk that doesn&#x27;t really need to exist.<p>I could go on for a bit more, there are a bunch of other design decisions that are backwards and don&#x27;t work well.

DAI is one of them.<p>For those who don&#x27;t have time to get into the weeds, DAI is a &quot;digital native&quot; stable coin. It wants to create a 1-1 peg to USD using an underlying volatile asset, Ethereum. If you want to use USD, it&#x27;s probably most efficient to go get USD. :) But for some ideological reasons (decentralization), DAI wants to be USD but also digital native. So they &quot;lock&quot; the underlying asset, Ethereum, and issue DAI coins. The premise is with intelligent computer algorithms, we can maintain 1-1 peg between a digital asset (Ethereum) and a real-world asset (USD).<p>Digital assets are digital. Humans are the arbitrageurs. Humans are emotional. DAI is trying to create stability on top of Ethereum volatility. It&#x27;s kinda like building a stable house on a shaky foundation. Your building will either collapse or you spend so much money patching the flaws of your shaky foundation. This is a laughable idea for those who live in reality. But I guess some computer programmers&#x2F;investors live in alternative realities too long. They forget about reality.<p>Whatever your algorithms are, you need to arbitrage risks. So you will always need to lock up more USD-ETH to account for risks. To be safe, maybe, you need 1.5 USD-ETH for a DAI USD. However, with digital scarce and volatile assets like Ethereum, there&#x27;s a chance that 1.5 USD-ETH will drop to 0.9 USD-ETH. At that point, you will be underwater. Yesterday, it did. If you need to lock up 1.5 USD for 1 USD, you may as well go get 1 USD. It&#x27;s a dumb idea to use 1.5 USD to get 1 USD.<p>DAI has a lot of jargon and technology (more layers on top of the shaky foundation). These things make it look sophisticated and fool people.

So I find the idea of using blockchain to implement debt to be ridiculous.\nWhy do you need debt if any group of people can create a cryptocurrency and raise money that way?<p>Debt is an outdated concept and a dirty hack on the financial system, it allows one person to lend money to another person to run their business without owning any part of the business. In today&#x27;s reality, there are two scenarios:<p>- The business succeeds and the borrower can afford to repay their debt. The lender only gets back their principal plus interest even if the business no matter how successful the business was. If the lender had invested in the business instead, would have gotten more out of it.<p>- The business fails and the borrower declares bankruptcy. The lender may lose all their principal; they may have gotten some interest payments if the business was running for some time but it typically doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to offsetting the loss of principal. Liquidating remaining assets likely won&#x27;t cover it either. If the lender had invested in the business instead - In the event of business failure, they may still have been able to get similar returns because they could get a share of the value of remaining assets from liquidation. The only thing they would miss out on is preferential treatment in the event of liquidation... Which is the financial equivalent of travelling first class on the Titanic.<p>So debt as a concept doesn&#x27;t make sense from the lender&#x27;s perspective. As a lender, if you win, your upside is limited. If you lose, your downside is not limited (not any more than it would have been if you had owned the shares outright and could benefit from asset liquidation in case the business had to shut down).\nNot only that, but forcing the business to constantly make debt repayments only makes it more likely that they will fail. The lender is setting themselves up for failure from the beginning.<p>That&#x27;s why only banks loan nowadays. It doesn&#x27;t make sense.

Clipboards often contain people&#x27;s names, contact info, passwords, and personal writing. Carte blanche access is something that reveals these and personally I&#x27;m not comfortable with it.<p>There&#x27;s obviously a balance to be struck with:<p>a) not introducing unnecessary permissions prompts, causing prompt fatigue in users (thus lowering security)<p>b) improved UX by saving a step for apps that may use clipboards for legitimate purposes (e.g. shipment tracking numbers, photos, emails, etc)<p>Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d solve the problem through improved App Store review:<p>1. Carte blanche access to pasteboard is removed, replaced with system data detectors, which delineate common data types like shipment tracking numbers, photos, emails&#x2F;contacts, plaintext, etc.<p>2. During app submission, any request to access a specific pasteboard data type has to be met with a UX justification, specifically that it has to significantly improve the core user experience in a meaningful way, and developers must promise to not scrape or store the data remotely.<p>3. If justification is not approved, app may still be published. Routines that call for access to data detector pasteboard must be able to gracefully fall back to non-pasteboard access (since they are used solely for simplifying a UX step).<p>4. If it is discovered a developer breaks their promise, their app may be pulled from the app store.<p>(optional) 5. When users get to the particular part of the app that uses pasteboard data AND the current pasteboard data is of the data type that the app has been approved to use, user is presented with a permission prompt to allow it. The permission prompt should not just be boilerplate, it should show the current contents of the pasteboard the app is trying to access.<p>The last step is a judgment call based on balance of permission prompt fatigue and user trust. If its believed the app store submission process is believed to be a good enough filtering process, then don&#x27;t present prompts. One way to approach is add the above 4 and see how developers respond, and if it seems insufficient then add #5 in the next iOS release."],"time":["2020-03-14 03:37:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["greenice"],"id":[22572147],"kids":[22572167],"parent":[22569662],"text":["What are the security implications for password managers here - not copy&#x2F;pasting any passwords?"],"time":["2020-03-14 01:51:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lazyjones"],"id":[22571365],"kids":[22573082,22574013,22572066],"parent":[22569662],"text":["Is there a MacOS utility that clears the pasteboard N minutes after its last content change?"],"time":["2020-03-13 23:18:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FreakyT"],"id":[22571652],"kids":[22573768,22572517],"parent":[22569662],"text":["There are probably other legitimate uses of this, but one is dictionary&#x2F;translator apps.

That is because small startups shouldn&#x27;t be running anything on VMs (or bare metal). There are so many fully managed solutions out there. There is no reason to be running on VM, SSHing to servers, etc. App Engine, Heroku, GKE, Cloud Run, whatever.<p>Once you get to the point where you need to run VMs (or bare metal), there are many options. A lot of systems are going to a more image + container based solution. Think something like Container-Optimized OS[1] or Bottlerocket[2], where most of the file system is read-only, it is updated by swapping images (no package updates), and everything runs in containers.<p>If you are actually interested in config management, I&#x27;ll give my opinions, and a bit of history. I&#x27;ve used all four of the current major config management systems (Puppet, Chef, Salt, and Ansible).<p>Puppet was the first of the bunch, it had its issues, but it was better than previous config managements systems. Twitter was one of the first big tech companies to use Puppet, and AFAIK they still do.<p>Chef was next, it was created by people to did Puppet consulting for a living. It follows a very similar model to Puppet, and solves most of the problems with Puppet, while introducing some problems of its own (mainly complexity in getting started). In my opinion Chef is a clear win over Puppet, and I don&#x27;t think there is a good reason to pick Puppet anymore. One of the biggest advantages is that the config language is an actual programming language (Ruby). All the other systems started with language that was missing things like loops, and they have slowly grafted on programming language features. It is so much nicer to use an actual programming language. Facebook is a huge Chef user.<p>Salt was next. It was created by someone who wanted to run commands on a bunch of servers. It grew into a configuration management system. The underlying architecture of Salt is very nice, it is basically a bunch of nodes communicating over a message bus. Salt has different &quot;renderers&quot;[3], which are the language you write the config in, including ones that use a real programming language (Python). I&#x27;ll back to Salt in a minute.<p>Ansible... it is very popular. This is going to sound harsh, but I&#x27;m just going to say it. I think is it popular with people who don&#x27;t know how to use configuration management systems. You know how the Flask framework started as an April Fool&#x27;s joke[4], where the author created something with what he thought were obviously bad ideas, but people liked some of them. Ansible is so obviously bad, at its core, that I actually went and read the first dozen Git commits to see if there were any signs that is was an April Fool&#x27;s joke.<p>There was a time a few years ago when Ansible&#x27;s website said things like &quot;agentless&quot;, &quot;masterless&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;secure&quot;, &quot;just YAML&quot;. They are all a joke.<p>Ansible isn&#x27;t agentless. It has a network agent that you have to install and configure (SSH). Yes, to do it correctly you have to actually configure SSH, a user, keys, etc. It also has a runtime agent that you have to install (Python). You have to install Python, and all the Python dependencies your Ansible code needs. Then it has the actual code of the agent, which it copies to the machine each time it runs, which is stupidly inefficient. It is actually easier to install and configure the agents of all the other config management systems than it is to properly install, configure, and secure Ansible&#x27;s agent(s).<p>Masterless isn&#x27;t a good thing, and a proper Ansible setup wouldn&#x27;t be masterless. The way Ansible is designed is that developers run the Ansible code from their laptops. That means anyone making code changes needs to be able to be able to SSH to every single server in production, with root permissions. And it also risks them running code that hasn&#x27;t been committed to Git or approved. Any reasonable Ansible setup will have a server from which it runs, Tower, a CI system, etc.<p>Fast. Ha! I benchmarked it against Salt, wrote the same code in both, that managed the exact some things. Using local execution so Ansible wouldn&#x27;t have an SSH disadvantage. Ansible was 9 times slower for a run with no changes (which is important because 99.9% of runs have no or few changes). It is even slower in real life. Why is it so slow? Well, SSH is part of it. SSH is wonderful, but it isn&#x27;t a high performance RPC system. But an even bigger part of the slowness is the insane code execution. You&#x27;d think that when you use the `package` or `apt` modules to ensure a package is installed, that it would internally call some `package.installed` function&#x2F;method. And that the arguments you pass are passed to the function. That is what all the other configuration management systems do. But not Ansible. No, it execs a script, passing the arguments as args to the script. That means every time you want to ensure a package is still installed (it is, you just want to make sure it is), Ansible execs a whole new Python VM to run the &quot;function&quot;. It is incredibly inefficient.<p>Secure. Having a network that allows anyone to SSH to any machine in production and get root isn&#x27;t the first step I&#x27;d take in making servers secure.<p>It isn&#x27;t just YAML. It is a programming language that happens to sort of look like YAML. It has its own loop and variable syntax, <i>in YAML<\/i>. Then it has Jinja templating on top of that. &quot;Just YAML&quot; isn&#x27;t a feature. To do config management correctly you need actual programming language features, so use an actual programming language.<p>If I had to pick one again, I&#x27;d pick Salt. Specifically I&#x27;d use Salt with PyObjects[5] and PillarStack[6].<p>But I&#x27;ll reiterate, you shouldn&#x27;t start with a config management system. Start with something fully managed. Once you need a config management system, take the time to do it correctly. Like it should be a six week project, not a thing you do in an hour. Chef and Salt will take more time to get started, but if setup correctly they will be much better than any Ansible setup.

Distribution is still adequate for the amount of production and distribution, so it&#x27;s not directly the problem, either.<p>The problem is buffering. Normally, buffering happens within the supply chain -- the back rooms of stores, loaded in trucks, warehouses, distribution centers, and the factories themselves. Now, we are telling everyone &quot;buffer at home so you don&#x27;t need to go out so much&quot;. But the problem is, buffering is much less efficient at the end of the chain, so you need to buffer a lot more. That&#x27;s causing a short-term strain on production and distribution.<p>Blaming selfishness or gouging probably doesn&#x27;t do much to help this problem. My guess is that the biggest problem is the discrepancy between how much stuff would be needed to buffer within the supply chain versus how much stuff is needed to buffer at the end of the supply chain (i.e. at home).<p>Worse, because it&#x27;s a temporary buffering problem and there&#x27;s no real increase in consumption, there&#x27;s little incentive for production to increase now to alleviate it. Any increased production&#x2F;distribution now just means less demand later when people start to work through their caches at home (and stop buying for a while).<p>So the only way to alleviate this is to allow the prices (that manufacturers charge) to rise, which will give manufacturers a cushion against the inevitable slump in the future. That&#x27;s not very popular and not worth the brand damage, so it won&#x27;t happen.<p>The good news is that I don&#x27;t think this will last more than another few weeks. Gougers will stop buying at some point because they don&#x27;t want to get stuck with a huge supply of toilet paper and no channels to sell it.

Opinions are my own.<p>In the Go world, the relationship between computer and human has turned into one of analysis. Every pro in Asia has a powerful GPU-equipped system with LeelaZero or KataGo or Minigo installed, and they use it to study openings and analyze their matches. LZ&#x2F;MG are similar in that they&#x27;re from the AlphaGoZero generation of bots, and thus are hardcoded to 7.5 komi and don&#x27;t play well with handicap stones. KataGo is the open-source project with the newest ideas, using (among other things) territory ownership prediction, allowing it to handle arbitrary komi and handicap. Many pros are switching to it for this reason. All TV broadcast channels use AI for both winrate prediction and variation analysis. They&#x27;ll report the predicted winrates by all major bots.<p>There are definitely AI-inspired opening sequences, but I would say that by and large, pro play has stabilized to just be better. A few years ago, pros would just mimic AlphaGo just to see what would happen, but there&#x27;s becoming a better appreciation for the many different opening styles that are becoming possible, now that we have AI to analyze them. The strongest pros are the ones who spend the most time on their computers.<p>Despite a few extra years of research, all available AI systems still fail at ladders regularly. Some may have had ladder routines hardcoded in, but these routines still fail at loose ladders and the many wonderful ladder variants out there.<p>In the online Go world, cheating has become rampant. Top echelon of games&#x2F;accounts are essentially just people competing on how beefy their GPUs are, and human professionals complain that they can&#x27;t actually get a game against another person nowadays.<p>Professional tournaments &#x2F; pro qualifying exams have had isolated incidents of cheating which are usually fairly obvious, as human playstyle is still recognizably different from computer playstyle."],"time":["2020-03-14 13:19:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["joeblau"],"id":[22576207],"kids":[22581732],"parent":[22569007],"text":["[SPOILERS] To me there are five super interesting points in this video.<p>1.

When magma intrudes the crust it cools, crystallizes, and releases gases that had been dissolved in the melt. Gas escape lowers pressure in the magma, causing the surface to subside. That&#x27;s probably what was going on at Norris from 2005 to mid-2013. But rising gases can become trapped under an impermeable layer of rock, causing the kind of rapid uplift seen at Norris from late 2013 until the M 4.9 earthquake in March 2014. It seems likely the quake created microfractures that allowed gases to escape upward again, resulting in subsidence that ended in 2015. The third uplift episode from 2016 to 2018 suggests rising gases became trapped again, this time at a slightly shallower depth. Modeling indicates the source depth for the 2013–2014 uplift was about 3.2 km (2.0 miles) deep, compared to about 1.8 km (1.1 miles) for the 2016–2018 episode.\nShould you worry? In a word, no. Activity like this is probably common at Norris and, at other times, under the caldera, too. What&#x27;s different is that we now have the tools to detect and model Yellowstone&#x27;s ups and downs better than ever before. For the first time, we&#x27;ve been able to track an entire episode of magma intrusion, degassing, and gas ascent to the near surface.

We have this expectation that people will learn how to use things by osmosis or will be taught by the thing itself, perhaps because some kinds of software are extremely good at this (primarily games) and some types are easy enough to get started and have a motivation (eg. social) that they can &quot;pull&quot; users through their difficulties (or they can ask friends). People jump to conclusions - &quot;if the kids can do that, they can do everything&quot; - which is clearly not the case. My knowledge of Excel won&#x27;t help me with Snapchat which won&#x27;t help me with Blender - and the difficulty difference between commonly used consumer apps and work apps can be significant.<p>The issue is that outside of the easy spaces, learning about computers is boring, difficult, doesn&#x27;t have obvious usefulness, provides largely useless feedback, is often wildly unintuitive compared to how things work in the real world, and tends to require a baseline of knowledge most people won&#x27;t have the interest to develop. This isn&#x27;t surprising - the same applies to many subjects we learn in school. Most people will have no more interest learning common computer abstractions and mechanisms than memorizing their times tables or writing essays with an opening, body, and conclusion or looking up words they don&#x27;t know in a dictionary.<p>In short, computing is something that should be actively taught in schools. Typing is a basic skill that should probably be taught in elementary, when children are learning to write (or shortly after). UI abstractions like files, folders, windows, searching should probably follow. Word processing should be covered before middle school, other productivity software during, along with more complex abstractions (clipboard, storage, paths, permissions, networks, accounts&#x2F;passwords&#x2F;security, scams, where to get help). Introductory programming should be taught as well.<p>None of this is to say that the average student should be a capable programmer after completing K-12. But I think that almost everyone should know enough to draw reasonable conclusions about systems and problems they encounter without outside help, if for no other reason than to avoid being exploited by scams, ransomware, ads, and whatever new attack vectors show up in the coming years."],"time":["2020-03-15 01:14:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Ghjklov"],"id":[22578092],"kids":{},"parent":[22573861],"text":["<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coding2learn.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;kids-cant-use-computers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coding2learn.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;kids-cant-use-co...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6186730\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6186730<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13506283\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13506283<\/a><p>Just posting because I was reminded of this"],"time":["2020-03-14 20:43:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["buboard"],"id":[22582241],"kids":{},"parent":[22573861],"text":["the tech community (i.e. us) celebrated the mobile &quot;revolution&quot; and simple (i.e. dumbed down) UIs for more than a decade.

This is no testament to the success of the mobile and dumb-down revolution either: people use their phones more, but the only action they know is scroll and like, so it s not like the UX empowered people, it just steered all their energy to consuming. There is less and less features everywhere, and we are now celebrating new emojis.  We are essentially creating a new inequality with the &quot;dumbit down&quot; revolution which pushes people to walled gardens and single-function apps to avoid the pain of learning elementary configuration.<p>In more concrete terms, Apple is probably the first preacher of hiding complexity behind a mask, and then almost everyone followed, even those that shouldnt (e.g. linux, windows). Gone are the logical, consistent , hierarchical UIs like windows 95, now windows doesnt even have a start menu and you need a search bar to navigate the control panel.

The experiment ran in 2015 and saw no events. Then the accelerator and detector made some configuration changes (hoping that they would be improvements) and got 1.5x as much data. They see 4 events, one of which they say is certainly background. They also say that the known backgrounds sum to 0,05. So just looking at background, they see 20x as much as they expect.

The only potentially good news is that the epidemic in Korea may ultimately show a lower CFR than the epidemic in China.<\/i><p>...<p><i>&quot;On balance, it is reasonable to guess that COVID-19 will infect as many Americans over the next year as influenza does in a typical winter -- somewhere between 25 million and 115 million. Maybe a bit more if the virus turns out to be more contagious than we thought. Maybe a bit less if we put restrictions in place that minimize our travel and our social and professional contacts.<\/i><p><i>&quot;The bad news is, of course, that these infection numbers translate to 350,000 to 660,000 people dying in the U.S., with an uncertainty range that goes from 50,000 deaths to 5 million deaths. The good news is that this is not a weather forecast. The size of the epidemic, i.e., the total number of infections, is something we can reduce if we decrease our contact patterns and improve our hygiene. If the total number of infections decreases, the total number of deaths will also decrease.&quot;<\/i><p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;why-this-epidemiologist-is-more-worried-about-coronavirus-than-he-was-a-month-ago-2020-03-09\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;why-this-epidemiologist-is...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-14 22:17:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["travisporter"],"id":[22578655],"kids":[22579249],"parent":[22577846],"text":["This guy did some back of the envelope calcs I found interesting&#x2F;scary<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tomaspueyo&#x2F;coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tomaspueyo&#x2F;coronavirus-act-today-or-peop...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-14 22:01:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwaway_pdp09"],"id":[22578868],"kids":[22579060,22578971],"parent":[22577846],"text":["A general question to all.

The visual fit was remarkably good.<p>The italian data very obviously did not fit so well.

Which is why their case count gapped up one day.<p>The CFR after all cases have concluded is an upper bound on the IFR. There seems to be no true consensus on the percentage of asymptomatic or very mild cases which would not seek treatment or even testing. This number (which is basically unknowable during an outbreak) is a multiplier on the case count, and acts to reduce the true IFR.<p>Lastly, as we’ve seen quite clearly... How bad it is depends almost entirely upon the person, or at a higher level, the demographics of the people who are infected.<p>Italy as of March 11;<p>&gt; <i>Of the patients who died, 42·2% were aged 80–89 years, 32·4% were aged 70–79 years, 8·4% were aged 60–69 years, and 2·8% were aged 50–59 years (those aged &gt;90 years made up 14·1%). The male to female ratio is 80% to 20% with an older median age for women (83·4 years for women vs 79·9 years for men).<\/i><p>Likewise, the outbreak in a WA nursing home was devastating to an elderly population where they would see 5-10 patients die in an <i>average<\/i> month.<p>IMO the path forward is either successful containment—which seems extremely unlikely given the transmission characteristics, but apparently China was able to do it? But where you constantly have to be watching for pockets of reemergence and clamp them down.<p>Or, if we can keep the virus away from high-risk populations while it spreads “like a flu” through the majority of the population, then you will see herd immunity kick in which ultimately works like a vaccinated population to prevent further outbreak and protect the at-risk population from ever becoming infected.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)30627-9&#x2F;fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-14 21:00:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["booleandilemma"],"id":[22578296],"kids":[22578865,22578460,22578403,22578370,22578361],"parent":[22577846],"text":["At this point I’m more worried about food, water, and toilet paper shortages due to people hoarding 20 times more than what they need.

In this case, all they&#x27;d need to say is that Mr Corvin is interested in moving products in areas with low demand, such as rural Tennessee and Kentucky, to people in desperate need in areas with high demand like the big coastal cities or for example those with certain immune disorders. That&#x27;s all they should say.<p>Second, let&#x27;s try to separate feelings for the person (Corvin) from the activity (price gouging). When there&#x27;s a shortage between quantity demanded and the quantity supplied, there has to be some form of quantity restriction, whether that involves price increases, queueing, quotas or even lotteries. The alternatives are not a person buying sanitizer for $10&#x2F;bottle on Amazon versus $1&#x2F;bottle at Safeway, but between $10&#x2F;bottle on Amazon versus either not getting it, waiting in a long queue at a store (which is counterproductive to social distancing), having some sort of quantity restriction (which is really lousy for people buying for more than just themselves). It&#x27;s not clear to me at first glance which is worse.<p>Ultimately, the shortage problem can only be mitigated by additional production or a return to pre-crisis demand. There are probably quite a few producers who could temporarily retool in order to produce sanitizer or other supplies that are in high demand, but this would be costly and risky and disrupt their supply chains and distribution. They could only justify the move with significantly higher prices than the pre-crisis market price. Any such firms would be crazy to do this, given the legal proscription and moral outrage incumbent with price increases during a crisis. There might be a few firms that try to enter as a PR move, and maybe in some places, the government will subsidize production of demanded goods at a low price, but these are not sustainable options. By having a very absolutist stance against price gouging, we are preventing the potentially ameliorating effects of additional production albeit at a higher price.<p>Third, I am a little disgusted with the NYT for publishing this story. While they can&#x27;t be blamed for Corvin&#x27;s diarrhea of the mouth, they did find the person to profile who is maximally unsympathetic person to the NYT&#x27;s audience: ex-military, lives in the South (and judging by his yard, a hillbilly), not well-educated and has a job (Amazon reseller) that is low status. It may be newsworthy that someone in rural Tennessee has 17k bottles of sanitizer, but I can easily imagine the sort of entrapping questions that the reporter used with this guy, and it makes me, well, irritated. (Anyone who has had experience with a hostile reporter and went in unprepared knows what I&#x27;m talking about.) The NYT is taking advantage of this crisis to drive outrage clicks, just as much as this guy is taking advantage to profiteer. In the process, they&#x27;re making this guy the public face of &quot;price gouging&quot; during COVID-19, despite him being very much a private person unprepared for the scorn about to be unleashed on him and his family.<p>I think the best way out of this is for someone with charitable intent and the monetary means to buy up his supply close to at-cost (I&#x27;d guess $40-50k), and then distribute them to particularly vulnerable people at low prices or even gratis. Corvin himself could maybe do that. If he did have a change of heart, I somehow doubt the NYT would cover it so prominently, if at all. For the sake of all parties, I hope I&#x27;m wrong."],"time":["2020-03-14 15:36:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["frenchman99"],"id":[22574753],"kids":[22574981,22574857],"parent":[22574688],"text":["Paywall."],"time":["2020-03-14 13:25:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saystupidthings"],"id":[22574793],"kids":{},"parent":[22574688],"text":["This guy is a complete piece of shit.

I spoke to the managers at my local supermarket today and asked them if they can place a threshold on certain essential items (for example if you buy more than 3 packets of toilet papers in one go, you have to pay a premium for the 4th packet) - that way people will really think about whether they truly need everything they are buying and possibly think twice before unnecessarily panic buying. It is important to think about how our actions will impact others as well I think."],"time":["2020-03-14 16:53:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["troughway"],"id":[22575782],"kids":[22576981,22575805],"parent":[22575387],"text":["&gt;What would the sane way to go about it?<p>Plan for at least a week, if not two ahead.

Here&#x27;s the text of the article.<p>Microsoft said this week that it will support Visual Basic on .NET 5.0 but will no longer add new features or evolve the language.<p>“Starting with .NET 5, Visual Basic will support Class Library, Console, Windows Forms, WPF, Worker Service, [and] ASP.NET Core Web API … to provide a good path forward for the existing VB customer who want [sic] to migrate their applications to .NET Core,” the .NET team wrote in a post to the Microsoft DevBlogs. “Going forward, we do not plan to evolve Visual Basic as a language … The future of Visual Basic … will focus on stability, the application types listed above, and compatibility between the .NET Core and .NET Framework versions of Visual Basic.”<p>When Microsoft released the .NET version of Visual Basic, originally called Visual Basic .NET, alongside C# at the beginning of the .NET era, the two languages were evolved together and had roughly identical feature sets. But this changed over time, with professional developers adopting C# and many fans of classic VB simply giving up on the more complex but powerful .NET versions of the environment. Today, virtually all of Microsoft’s relevant developer documentation is in C# only, with VB source code examples ever harder to find.<p>Worse, Microsoft in 2017 announced that its original C#&#x2F;VB co-development strategy was over. Only C# would get all of the new features, while VB would focus on the simpler and more approachable scenarios that it once dominated. But that never really happened, and Microsoft effectively abandoned VB. This week’s announcement just makes it official.<p>What this means to VB developers is that they might be able to bring their existing codebases forward to .NET Core or, soon, to .NET 5.0, which will replace both the traditional .NET and the open-source and cross-platform .NET Core when it’s released in late 2020. The issue is that not all legacy technologies will be supported going forward, so developers using WebForms, Workflow, or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) will need to stick with classic .NET. Those applications will continue to work and be supported until the underlying Windows versions are retired; classic .NET support life cycles are tied to the Windows versions on which they were initially deployed.<p>Microsoft also notes that VB developers will occasionally benefit from improvements to Visual Studio.<p>“Visual Studio regularly adds new features to improve the experience for developers, including those using Visual Basic and either .NET Core or .NET Framework,” the .NET team adds. “An example is the recent addition of IntelliCode for Visual Basic.”<p>This is a sad day, and one that hits me personally.

And then as needed optimise any bottlenecks on the 68000 using assembly.<p>The idea was to keep the GPU&#x2F;blitter as busy as possible filling pixels from simple texture-line commands, with minimal logic to fetch and setup each new blit (i.e. no higher level geometry calculations during which the texturing would be idle), while the 68000 ran in parallel generating those commands and doing the higher level geometry, which was quite complex in our game.<p>I got everything running just right on the 68000 for a nice demo, with the graphics and maps we had ready by then.  It was visually perfect, and play speed was just about usable but not <i>smooth<\/i> like we were aiming for.<p>Unfortunately perhaps, that&#x27;s when Atari called my boss in to do a milestone demo, so that version was shown.<p>When my boss returned, I was told whichever Tramiel was head of Atari at the time was &quot;angry&quot; as the game looked &quot;too slow&quot;, and the project was cancelled. :-(<p>Just as I was getting the GPU&#x2F;blitter accelerated mode working, which was projected to be 2 weeks work (since everything up to that point had been aimed at this).<p>I never did get to complete or show off the fast version.

(At the time different C++ compilers accepted different dialects.)<p>But all the effort around optimising the engine around pushing pixels as fast as possible out of the Jaguar&#x27;s hardware subsystems had to be abandoned.<p>Fortunately the pipeline architecture translated quite well to x86 texturing, first using awesome integer register tricks (very few registers on x86, but because you could address individual bytes and words inside dword registers you could &quot;vectorise&quot; some of the texturing and address arithmetic); later the FPU became faster.<p>This was in the days of Doom, Quake and Descent, when extremely hand-optimised assembly software rendering was normal on PCs, and consoles had very strange &quot;not quite right for 3D&quot; blitters.

Those with a &quot;fixed mindset&quot; believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities, while those with a &quot;growth mindset&quot; believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study. In particular, an individual&#x27;s mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges, such as the transition into junior high school from elementary school or losing your job.[11] According to Dweck, individuals with a &quot;growth&quot; theory are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks.<p>I have some poison I&#x27;d like to administer: You think this is great, but I find it sinister. It&#x27;s a wonderful way to blame failure on the person, for if they were growers they&#x27;d win no matter what they had to work from. Are some people worse, or simply worse-off? &quot;Use the growth mindset!&quot; the growers can scoff! &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t achieve in the end!&quot; and if you don&#x27;t, well, they can just condescend. It&#x27;s impossible to win against such philosophy; it allows them to ignore serious issues, and just fail to see a jammed-up or scammy underlying system, in which you can&#x27;t rise and must always get pissed on.<p>But enough of my cynical snarling.

I&#x27;ve been on MAT for years, during which I&#x27;ve gone to grad school, worked, and otherwise lived a normal and productive life. A couple of points&#x2F;observations.<p>1) I think an online advertising growth strategy will be hard, or really any strategy that strictly involves spending X in advertising for the recruitment of Y in revenue spend. However, people that use drugs talk to each other about where to get drugs and treatment (surprising, I know), and I would build your marketing strategy around word of mouth and patient to patient referrals. Initially reaching these communities are hard, but I would really think about how well the product can be optimized for patient -&gt; uninitiated patient referrals, similar to &quot;growth loops&quot;<p>That said, I&#x27;ve worked in a start up with a similar premise, hire domain experts to give advice to customers during a life transition, and watched it fall down as the operations shook apart and the acquisition cost was very high. It&#x27;s hard to get both the operations to stay great during the scale out, and keep the the marketing channels diverse enough so when you tap one out, another 5 are in different stages of life.<p>2) When assessing this product for my own use, the thoughts I had where:\n2.1 Is this available in my area? How far would I have to travel initially?\n2.2 Do they drug test me like my current place?\n2.3 How frequently do I met the doc&#x2F;what&#x27;s the script duration?\n2.4 What is expected of me to stay in MAT?<p>Basically, I have a provider, but with more up front information, might be willing to switch.

Medication is great and important for breaking the physical addiction. But it does nothing to resolve the mental health issues that led to the dependence in the first place.<p>Buprenorphine helped me get into a state where I could deal with my mental health issues with a professional. But until I began to deal with the mental stuff, I was still very unwell. Addiction is transitive, it pops up in new and unexpected ways.<p>Discontinuation of use is only a small aspect of recovery. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think what you are doing is great. Access to medication is definitely an issue in the USA. But in Canada, we have easy access to addiction doctors in urban areas, and we haven&#x27;t ended addiction yet.<p>A big part of the problem is general ignorance. Most people still think addiction is a moral issue. Shame and guilt are fuel for addiction. So hiding away and getting help in secret compounds the problem both for the individual and society at large. When people start to see that it affects many people close to them, that is when the stigma is destroyed.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t say you are too busy to get treatment for any other life-threatening condition.<p>All treatment centers are not alike. Some are downright harmful. There is a heady mix of science, mysticism, greed and benevolence. There can be benefits: removal from environmental stressors, reduces shame by showing you are not alone, learning about the neuroscience of addiction, bonding with people over a common struggle, a chance to feel good about yourself.<p>The human mind loves to simplify things. Oversimplify and your model does not reflect reality.<p>Recovery from addiction and underlying mental health issues is not a simple process. It requires a multifaceted approach, strong personal support and constant honest self-evaluation. It requires letting go of shame and guilt. It also requires, of course, discontinuation of use and withdrawal management.<p>I could go on and on about my experiences and what they have taught me. One day I might write it down. I want nothing more than to make the road a bit easier for others. I have spent thousands of hours trying to distill what I have learned into some sort of essential truths. I haven&#x27;t got there yet.<p>I&#x27;m going to have to stop myself there. To anyone out there interested, my email is in my profile. To anybody struggling out there right now: Be kind to yourself. Find your own path and make your own honest definition of success. I found keeping track of days of abstinence to be actively harmful. It resulted in more severe and longer relapses. So I stopped counting. Some said this was bad, but they were wrong because it worked for me. I identified that the shame and guilt of &quot;losing&quot; all those days was more harmful than motivating. It&#x27;s been a long journey, I couldn&#x27;t have done it without the support of family. I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing though because I finally like myself.<p>Addiction is a symptom.

Quantum field theory resolves basically all of the typically interpretation of quantum mechanics questions in a rather sophisticated way. Unfortunately and I guess this is why these &quot;Interpretation of QM&quot; are still popular most things become harder to calculate with QFT instead of plain old quantum mechanics. Still I think that the perspective of taking quantum fields and the path integral as fundamental clarifies a bunch of things even about measurements. In the path integral formulation you can view a measurement as an additional term in the Lagrangian (for example a non-zero external magnetic field for Zeeman-Splitting). You then have to expand around the classical solutions summed over all initial conditions, so if you have for example a spin-1&#x2F;2-based dependence as it is the case for the Zeeman-Effect, you would have to expand around these two different classical solutions.

Of course, in their frustration and desire to distance themselves rotating 180 degrees as they traveled in the complete opposite direction, they too would also fall into a similar trap of generalization and overly simplistic definitions. Because both utopia and dystopia are extremes that will never truly be able to describe reality as it is.<p>As we know today, technological growth especially in the last fifty years or so, has immensely benefited and impacted our world. Literacy, basic education, democracy, and vaccination rates have all steadily increased as child mortality, extreme poverty, and inequality correspondingly have decreased. Life on average has quite literally never been better than it is now. Yet at the same time, it&#x27;s undeniable that a great deal of deeply rooted and structural issues exist today that technology in and of itself has not been able to solve. Yes, the world is getting better, but humanity still faces an innumerable number of existential challenges that we likely will continue to face in part for, well frankly, probably as long as humanity continues to exist.<p>Post-Cyberpunk, or Solarpunk, is an acknowledgement of this, accepting that our reality is one defined by nuance and complexity, showcasing a significant literary maturation, and in my eyes, a reflection of a corresponding development and growth in society that has been undertaken in parallel as well.
