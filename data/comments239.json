This can certainly be true, but this particular example is not a great way to show it, because the same optimization can be done in an obvious way in assembly, (just allocate enough space with brk or mmap2, write your strings and send the right memory address to ). This would of course be harder to do in assembly than in Go, but it is still quite straightforward to see what is the optimal way to do it. Furthermore, this would probably still outperform the optimized Go version by a wide margin.<p>A better example could be where a compiler picks an obscure but faster parallelization operation, or unrolled a loop appropriately in a way that is both faster and unlikely to be written by a competent human, or a complex memory management scenario etc etc.<p>I think this is not the point of the original article though.

If I could manage to be okay with having many smaller sessions of crying, at the right times, then these outbursts of crying wouldn&#x27;t be there. As it is I hold them back enough that they&#x27;ll eventually come out in a more dramatic scream sobbing fit that lasts several minutes and usually leaves me without a voice for a week.<p>Weeping isn&#x27;t manly.

All the time. Perhaps monthly or even weekly at times.<p>20s? Less so, but more intensely. Perhaps every six months on average.<p>30s? Only twice in two years, and I&#x27;m a 32-year-old male now.<p>Those times were basically weeping, and I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d hit rock bottom in a mental health&#x2F;depression context. Maybe I had, but life got much, much worse after that. The interesting thing however, is that somewhere along the line I lost the ability to cry. I&#x27;d want to cry, but I couldn&#x27;t anymore.<p>Haven&#x27;t been able to for over a year now. It&#x27;s like when you hit what you think is the bottom, you drop through to the basement. I hesitate to say it&#x27;s an unfeeling basement—if anything it&#x27;s more extreme feelings of despair—but it&#x27;s certainly one where for whatever reason, crying no longer exists.<p>When things were really bad recently, I&#x27;d look in a mirror and just see this tearless dry laugh or heave of despair. Wanted to cry, but it&#x27;s like the emotional pain or stress or anxiety was too high to allow it.<p>My best friend and I saw Joker during the midst of all this, and then we went home to make dinner after. It disturbed him a little when I nailed emulating the laugh without even trying, the first time. Usually I&#x27;m the one that can&#x27;t do voices to save my life, and he&#x27;s the one who can do anything. He couldn&#x27;t do the Joker laugh no matter how much he tried.<p>My theory is I had already experienced the aforementioned feeling in the mirror. I unwittingly had practice. You have to be either a really good actor, or seriously hurting to emulate that laugh correctly. It&#x27;s a laugh because the tears are dry for some reason.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure despair can go far deeper still, and I really hope to never experience that.<p>-<p>It could be that crying is like a muscle. Perhaps it&#x27;s a developed emotional mechanism that—when used appropriately—is beneficial to emotional well-being. However, like any muscle it can atrophy if it isn&#x27;t used frequently enough, or lacks in sufficient nutrition.<p>Maybe crying can only happen when conditions are right. If things get too bad, or you&#x27;re too worn down, you lose the ability to do so.<p>Perhaps crying doesn&#x27;t happen because depression in combination with stress or anxiety are the primary reason for the despair. I&#x27;d probably cry immediately for the death of a loved one, for example.<p>Whatever the case, that&#x27;s my take on it. Everyone&#x27;s different and likely has their own reasons why they cry or don&#x27;t cry. As the article points out, societal factors of course play an outsized role as well.<p>-<p>Disclaimer: Wrote this simply for the exercise of it, to explore the topic. Not a plea for help or anything, I&#x27;m fine. Joker was a flawed yet excellent film that explored some serious mental health topics, and I dislike the notion that it somehow had a violent or anarchic message.

I recall a time in my life those ideas seemed so laughable that they were completely pointless. I blame Joe Rogan and his podcasts with Graham Hancock for forcing me to consider ideas of ancient civilizations seriously. Not that I consider Graham Hancock&#x27;s specific ideas to be serious. But it did force me to challenge my own preconceptions of what is possible.<p>I do recall, on hacker news I believe, an article posted based on a study by NASA scientists that tried to calculate the likelihood of finding evidence for civilizations 10 thousand years, 100 thousand years or older. What is shocking is how quickly any remnants of an advanced civilization could deteriorate. IIRC, the conclusion of the study was that the chance of us finding any evidence of civilizations that old were extremely small.<p>The idea that there was an ancient civilization over 10 thousand years ago is entirely plausible to me. Massive geological events (or even astrological ones like asteroid impacts) could have altered entire continents. Who knows what evidence is at the bottom of the Pacific ocean that we cannot access. Or what evidence has been forced under tectonic plates through subduction.<p>Of course, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and so far none of the presented evidence is extraordinary (IMO). But our fixed notion that civilization sprang up nearly fully formed 10 thousand years ago doesn&#x27;t seem as clear to me as it once did."],"time":["2020-01-07 21:46:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lykr0n"],"id":[21974894],"kids":{},"parent":[21974180],"text":["AMD is on a tear, now only if they could translate this to their GPUs."],"time":["2020-01-07 00:46:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[21975450],"kids":{},"parent":[21974180],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21974514\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21974514<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-07 01:49:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rambojazz"],"id":[21977449],"kids":{},"parent":[21974180],"text":["What&#x27;s the point of sharing a link to a &quot;Private video&quot; that no one can watch?"],"time":["2020-01-07 07:21:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["munificent"],"id":[21975938],"kids":[21976328,21976088,21982843,21976031],"parent":[21975340],"text":["Commitment in online dating is much more incremental than in job hiring.

For context, here is what he said:<p>&gt; Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, &amp; badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently....<p>&gt; ....hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have.....<p>&gt; ....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp;  the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!<p>The first audience for this is obviously Trump himself. If I ask myself what he&#x27;s trying to accomplish here, and I believe that he&#x27;s trying to intimidate Iran into backing off, at least for the moment. He&#x27;s telegraphing that there is a strike plan already prepared and that it&#x27;s something that Iran <i>really<\/i> doesn&#x27;t want to happen. In my opinion, Trump is very nuanced - almost machiavellian, in fact - in his overall strategies but is very straightforward in his communication. If he&#x27;d wanted Iran to believe that he would order the destruction of cultural sites, he was have said it plainly. The mention of &quot;culture&quot; is the last in a series of descriptors, not the central point.<p>Also consider that Iran is a theocracy. As a result, presumably any attack on the Iranian government would target religious sites implicitly: there is no clear dividing line between &quot;the government of Iran&quot; and &quot;Islam in Iran&quot;. Given that the government of Iran is the second audience, it seems that what he&#x27;s saying is that his threat applies to government leadership instead of solely military targets.<p>Trump&#x27;s domestic opponents are another audience, and have different biases. They seem to expect Trump to act aggressively and in a way ignorant of both the status quo and international law. I get why they are interpreting &quot;important to [...] the Iranian culture&quot; as &quot;Iranian cultural sites&quot;, but that strikes me as a particularly uncharitable reading. This creep in what was actually said versus what has been interpreted as having been meant continues; the article linked is from an art-centric site. It uses &quot;heritage sites&quot; in the headline, and &quot;heritage sites&quot; aren&#x27;t mentioned at all in Trump&#x27;s tweets. Further, the article quotes art directors, and then explicitly calls out Persepolis as have been &quot;in all likelihood&quot; &quot;spared thanks to the backlash against Trump&#x27;s threat.&quot; <i>Persepolis<\/i>. In fact, none of the heritage sites listed seem like they would have ever been on a strike list in the first place.<p>I acknowledge that I don&#x27;t share the biases of the article&#x27;s author, but it doesn&#x27;t seem at all reasonable to assume that ancient ruins are what were referenced in Trump&#x27;s tweets. On the other hand, if my reading of Trump&#x27;s intentions are accurate it would be unwise for Iranian leadership to be holding their press conferences in the Masjed-e Jame’ in Isfahan or using the Shushtar hydraulic system as a convenient place to store centrifuges. It&#x27;s unlawful (and immoral) to target a heritage site because it&#x27;s a heritage site, but if the enemy attempts to use the site as a shield that&#x27;s another story entirely."],"time":["2020-01-07 21:35:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["weberc2"],"id":[21981518],"kids":[21984191],"parent":[21981166],"text":["What are the Tweets in question. artnet.com keeps paraphrasing and quoting other tweets, but I can&#x27;t find the actual Tweets that threaten to bomb art&#x2F;cultural sites.

They are the ones buying the brand new John Deere $700k combine harvesters will all the bells and whistles.  The problem is, those bells and whistles add a lot of extra complexity to the machine, making it harder and more expensive to fix.  Deere doesn&#x27;t make it easier since they don&#x27;t provide details needed for 3rd party repair people (e.g. schematics, software tools for managing embedded controllers, etc).  The people buying new equipment don&#x27;t care about that.  Their equipment is covered by warranty and Deere fixes it for them (or replaces it).  They sell the machine after it is a year or two.  So, they never deal with the crap repair-ability of new equipment.  The 2nd stage used market cares a little but not so much either.  They can still get Deere to fix it for them, maybe not under warranty.<p>By the time the equipment gets to the 3rd tier used market, it is already heavily deprecated.  The loss in value due to poor repair-ability is not getting fed back up the chain in any significant way which would make the primary buyers change their decision making.  They want the bells and whistles and they will pay a little extra in deprecation to get them.  The problem for society is that you have a $700k machine that is basically a paperweight after a decade or two.  You might was well drive it in the junk pile because no one is going to be able to make it run.  At least, not without tearing out heaps of electronics that are no longer working.  New machines are utterly dependent on onboard electronic control systems (e.g. ECMs).  They won&#x27;t run without them.<p>New machines are disposable and that is what the buyers are deciding to choose.  You can&#x27;t put all the blame on companies like Deere.  The contrast to old farm equipment is dramatic though.  We have an old Ferguson tractor, might be from the 1950s.  Everything on that tractor can be fixed.  If we wanted, we could make it run like it just came out of the factory.  For jobs on the farm that don&#x27;t need a big tractor, it does them just fine.

You can put 15,000 hours on it and if something breaks you can just replace it. It&#x27;s not even just the price difference - the newer machines, any time something breaks, you’ve got to have a computer to fix it.”&#x27;<p>The article then goes on to mention they&#x27;re SOL, with the tractor stuck in the field for potentially days while they wait for a technician to come and charge $150&#x2F;hr to fix it.<p>First off, farmers are not, for the most part, computer or software technicians. While there are certainly exceptions (I was only a farmer for 4-5 years of my life, total, I don&#x27;t think I count), I&#x27;ve spent years on and off living on farms, and a lot of farmers in the rural US and Canada are lucky to even just have access to Satellite internet. I imagine doing a case study of farmers who would have an identical tractor with and without the software, and seeing how many would actually even use or miss it. I&#x27;m guessing not a lot.<p>The idea of relying on software technology is profoundly alien - and high-risk - to even just the culture of most farmers.

And if one part breaks, you&#x27;re screwed and stuck travelling to an Apple store, if you&#x27;re fortunate enough to have one in your area.<p>Right to Repair is one of the most critical things we as tech users need to be defending in the upcoming years. I&#x27;ve been buying Apple computers exclusively for 15+ years, and I will be buying a Lenovo next, as Apple has taken away my right to repair and upgrade the device myself, while simultaneously removing features, and raising the price.<p>If I was still a farmer, you wouldn&#x27;t catch me dead buying a new John Deere - I could never bring myself to support such obvious greed and stranglehold control.<p>At least with a Tesla, you&#x27;d get the benefit of it being an EV.

You can &quot;friend&quot; more than 25 people but you can only see the activity of 25 of your friends and the others are relegated to essentially being contacts.<p>I remember about two years ago Facebook was getting into a lot of trouble due to the amount of negative mental impact it had&#x2F;has on its users and they did a study which found social media can have a negative impact on its users unless the user only follows a small circle of real-life friends and interacts with those people online. I don&#x27;t have a source to this; I&#x27;m willing to accept there isn&#x27;t real _evidence_ behind this claim.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m surprised social media has been around this long, has been the subject of such controversy and there haven&#x27;t been any or many real, impactful changes to the nature of it. Facebook and Instagram are, in my opinion, trying to be too much. They want to combine personal and public spaces. This, of course, works from a business perspective. But what are the long-term consequences of these products on our mental health and society?<p>We need a new social media focused on personal, tight-knit groups of people and interests.

Suddenly, airlines are looking at this and saying, ‘Oh my God, we can’t pass on the cost by continuously raising ticket prices.’ That put pressure back on Boeing, and on Airbus eventually, to become cost-conscious.”<p>I think the ultimate root cause that led to the 737 MAX crisis was de-regulation and the airlines race to the bottom on price.

I believe that the 737 Max disaster was directly caused by the idea that management is a valuable skill on its own, that <i>management<\/i> is somehow separable from the domain-specific knowledge required in order to make an honest buck.<p>There are plenty of examples of engineers that make terrible managers, to be sure. But there are also plenty of examples of managers with business backgrounds that have absolutely <i>no<\/i> idea about the consequences of their decisions. An optimal result requires skill in <i>both<\/i> domains.<p>By this point, you might be thinking, &quot;Hey wait, isn&#x27;t it true that cost-cutting also had a role in the crisis? Wasn&#x27;t there at least one engineer that sounded the alarm in a memo?&quot; And my answer to that is a resounding <i>yes<\/i>. But the question remains, where the hell did that idea come from? At no point did anyone think, &quot;I&#x27;d love to spike my profits this quarter here and have huge disaster that will tank us in the next quarter.&quot; Therefore the problem isn&#x27;t one of simple pursuit of the profit motive, because it is quite clear that Boeing <i>hasn&#x27;t<\/i> profited from this situation long-term.

I could be wrong about him, but the fact that they have selected a person who majored in <i>accounting<\/i> to be their new CEO does not bode well for them.

Seems to be an almost daily ritual on HN these days.<p>Yes Boeing has issues; especially in their senior management. That&#x27;s why they are struggling to keep up with competitors in the cheaper&#x2F;faster&#x2F;more efficient&#x2F;less noisy category (aka. the market). But also, the 737 is still one of the safest and most successful planes ever and last year was one of the safest years in aviation history with many thousands of them flying around every day. Once patched up, the max will be part of that fleet for decades to come and is unlikely to bend the excellent safety record in any statistically meaningful way regardless of the current sentiments or the recent accidents.<p>IMHO, Boeing has some corporate culture issues to sort out and it definitely does not help that they operate as a state protected monopoly that mostly acts to shovel defense money around and enrich contractors, share holders, politicians, lobbyists, etc. involved with cutting up that pie.  But lets be real, every other big aviation manufacturer works exactly the same way and it seems to work fine in terms of safety.<p>Fundamentally there are no good technical reasons for the hundreds of 737 maxes to be permanently retired over real, perceived or imagined risks. Yes, there are some technical issues that are addressable, are being addressed, and require lengthy inspections &amp; certification to verify that they have indeed been addressed. That&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s happening because they are fixable issues. There are no known un-fixable issues here, no known show stopping design flaws that can&#x27;t be worked around, no known unacceptable (i.e. uncertifiable) hacks, etc. Some of the fixes may indeed lead to some retraining effort, which I&#x27;m sure is annoying but not fatal for Boeing. And yes, there&#x27;s brand damage and Boeing is probably going to have to do some pro-forma rebranding (737 maxi-cosi, anyone?) and symbolic modifications.<p>When their choice is to go out of business or attempt to fix entirely fixable technical issues they&#x27;d be complete idiots to get sucked down the first hole. Permanently retiring many hundreds of planes that once fixed are perfectly good for decades to come is just not going to be a thing. Boeing going bankrupt over this under the current political climate is also not a thing. To big to fail means rules can be bended, changed, abused, or otherwise ignored. That&#x27;s how this happened to begin with. One way or another the FAA will ultimately rubber stamp whatever needs rubber stamping.<p>Some time this year, the thing will resume flying and Boeing goes back to licking its wounds and planning the next iteration of its products.

Nope, this is pretty much accurate.<p>- These aren&#x27;t real. Yes, yes they are.<p>- Self-reporters are lying. Maybe some do but these numbers are pretty accurate. If anything, I question Lyft and Airbnb as such outliers. I wonder if this factored in Lyft&#x27;s post-IPO stock performance and makes unrealistic valuations of Airbnb&#x27;s RSUs&#x2F;options. But for any listed company, these numbers are accurate.<p>- You have to work incredibly hard for this compensation. no, you don&#x27;t. In fact you&#x27;ll typically find significantly better work-life balance at a FAANG than a startup.<p>- These numbers are inflated by years of stock growth that is unlikely to continue in the future. This there is some truth to but not as much as people claim. Amazon, of all these companies, builds in expected stock growth into their initial grant valuation (which I think is total BS; if any Amazon recruiters are reading this, please stop). But I know what offers new hires can get pretty accurately so at current stock prices as a new hire these numbers pare pretty accurate.<p>- Newer offers are likely to be less. False. If anything, initial offers continue just climbing such that anyone who is interested in maximizing their compensation should probably move companies every 3-4 years, especially 4 if you don&#x27;t get an additional grant after your initial grant has fully vested.<p>There are some things to be aware of though and these can make it nontrivial to compare competing offers. Some examples:<p>- Most FAANGs have a 25&#x2F;25&#x2F;25&#x2F;25 vesting schedule. Amazon does not. It&#x27;s vesting schedule is 5&#x2F;15&#x2F;40&#x2F;40 with a vesting signing bonus in the first 2 years to (partially) compensate for this.<p>- Amazon, as noted earlier, assumes stock price growth in their offer.<p>- Amazon (noticing a trend?) has vesting on 401k matches that can take 2-3 years. Most FAANGs do not.<p>- Anything less than a 50% 401k match is below market.<p>- Some FAANGs have caps on 401k matches. Some don&#x27;t.<p>- I think the most generous 401k match I&#x27;ve seen is Google&#x27;s at 50% of your contribution with no cap or vesting period or 100% of the first $3,000 at year&#x27;s end, whichever is higher. The really nice thing is because there&#x27;s no cap you get it immediately. It&#x27;s fairly common to get your bonus in January, put it all in your 401k, get your 50% match and you&#x27;re done for the year.<p>- Some offer the ability to make contributions into after tax 401k (Google &quot;mega backdoor Roth&quot; if you&#x27;re interested in this). This is potentially huge beneficial. You can use it to invest money you can withdraw at any time at no penalty but the investment returns are tax free. If you withdraw the returns (not the initial investment) prior to being aged 59.5 you pay taxes plus a 10% penalty, however.<p>- Vacation days vary but 4 weeks (20 days) should be considered the norm for the US (30 for Europe&#x2F;Australia).<p>- Some companies (eg Google) start you on less vacation days but you get more with length of service.<p>- Unlimited time off is bullshit. Think of this as no time off.<p>- Health insurance can differ but I imagine pretty much all FAANGs at this point have good health insurance. The gold standard is probably Kaiser for CA residents.<p>- Some FAANGs have a 1 year cliff. Some do not (eg Google, FB).<p>- Vesting schedules can vary. Some are monthly, some every 3 months, some annually. Try to avoid anything less frequent than once every 3 months. It can create bad incentives for the company to get rid of you before a big vest date.<p>- FAANGs will give you performance-based RSU grants annually. The time of year can vary. The eligibility can vary. For example, Google gives you a refresh grant at, after Q2-Q3 calibration (based on your previous two halves). And I believe in recent years it changed that if you joined that calendar year you aren&#x27;t eligible.<p>- Because of refresh grants and your initial grant running in tandem, years 2-4 can often be your most lucrative. If you don&#x27;t get promoted or an additional grant you can get significantly less compensation in year 5. Why these companies let people leave because they won&#x27;t give them additional equity rather than competing for a new hire is beyond me. But they do.<p>- Because of the inflation in initial offers, a new hire  can often have a significantly better offer than someone who joined 3 years prior. The veteran may only have higher total compensation because of refresh grants and&#x2F;or stock growth.<p>- FAANGs tightly control salary within bands for a given level. Going beyond this is unlikely to happen however there is FAR more movement on RSUs in an initial offer and&#x2F;or signing bonus.<p>So this is all another reason of why from a financial POV working for a startup is--how should I put this?--suboptimal. Your equity is probably worth nothing (even if you get acquihired, liquidation preferences probably mean all non-founder stock is worth $0). The hours are worse. The benefits are worse. There may be reasons to do this that aren&#x27;t financial (as a non-founder) but personally I&#x27;d suggest people use their most productive years to ensure their financial independence and then chase whatever moonshot tickles your fancy without the pressure of having to pay for food."],"time":["2020-01-06 08:23:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["opportune"],"id":[21966743],"kids":[21967426,21970370,21971158],"parent":[21966465],"text":["It makes me feel bad how many people see these figures and immediately start trying to find ways to rationalize why they must be overstated.

Levels.fyi is extremely bad at clarifying whether you should be reporting your equity value at signing vs how its changed since. Signing is the only apples to apples comparison.<p>2. These level descriptions are weird. They make it sound like “senior” engineers with 5+ years exp don’t write much code, are just 30% of the company, etc. I suppose it depends on the company, but key teams at FAANGs are able to hire more seniors and just invest in better engineers writing code every day. Good engineers like writing code and working with other good engineers. Netflix for example is known to hire mostly seniors. They’re not just writing design docs.<p>3. Speaking of Netflix they are an interesting outlier in that they don’t do equity, they do cash TC that is competitive with cash+equity FAANGs. So their offers are great data points that clear up some of the ambiguity around equity value. They are out there every day negotiating for talent.

The “cosmological constant problem”, that is the problem explaining the cosmological acceleration (if it exists), is arguably the most important and hardest question in high energy theoretical physics. Many theoreticians have spent significant effort studying this question, working under the assumption that the empirical evidence is solid. If this is not the case, it changes the landscape of cutting edge physics research.<p>There are several reasons why explaining the observed acceleration is so hard. The cosmological constant (the measure of how much dark energy there is) is a tiny positive number which seems to require a lot of “fine tuning” to explain theoretically. We can easily include it in general relativity, but our best understanding of quantum physics says that if it is there then it should be much larger. This means there probably is something we don’t understand about its microscopic origins. If we try to build a microscopic model that has this small constant using string theory (our best guest at a complete theory), we find that such models are hard to create. In fact, it is not clear that any model that includes dark energy is even valid in string theory! Any way we look at it, it seems more difficult to explain this number if it is tiny and positive than if it is strictly zero (no acceleration).<p>Finally, theoreticians don’t have much to go on when explaining this phenomenon besides this one single number — there aren’t closely related experiments we can combine to come up with a coherent picture of what’s happening. Combine this with particle physics, where accelerators provide us with an abundance of data.

Here&#x27;s the system as I imagine it, and it&#x27;s not fully thought out at this point, please chime in with criticisms if you have them.<p>The jist: Every user has their own list of ratings for books in the system, and a list of people they &quot;trust&quot;. The rated list of books you see the average rating of the people you trust, recursing out through the web of trust. The ratings are calculated live, on demand. With the only thing held in constant being each individuals personal ratings.<p>I&#x27;m leaving a lot undefined right now, but an example of how I imagine such a system to work:<p>Lets say you know Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the perfect book. You go to the books page and review the ratings. Your rate is obviously 5. You see lots of other people in your list who have rated it 5 (naturally). But you also see that there are some 3&#x27;s in there. You can click on the 3&#x27;s and see how they reached you through the web of trust. It turns out a bunch of 3&#x27;s are coming from your someone named Bob, Bob trusts Alice, and Alice has trusted a bunch of people from some kind of Harry Potter hating cabal of philistines. You could blacklist the cabal, but there&#x27;s too many of them, so instead you blacklist Alice. All the 3&#x27;s are gone, and so are all the other reviews from the cabal. Your list of reviews now more accurately reflects views that you would trust.<p>In this way, your effort to moderate away the opinions of people you don&#x27;t trust has done double duty, it has cleared views you disagree with and do not trust, and it has also done so for the people who trust you as well.<p>It is decentralized moderation.<p>There&#x27;s some challenges here, for example, how to bootstrap the system for new users? What is the best way to calculate the average reviews in a timely manner? How much weight should be applied to a friend of a friend of a friend? What kind of feedback could we give to users to incentivize them against trusting people like the philistine cabal? etc.<p>I have some thoughts on this, I&#x27;ll spare you.<p>Like any decentralized system, it&#x27;s more work, it&#x27;s more complex, and it has some surprising and ugly edge cases. I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m some genius for coming up for this, it&#x27;s just an application of Web of Trust. But I have not seen a system such as this in practice.
