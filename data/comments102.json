You can see it in the media, which was often simply a dramatized perversion of generational self-reflection to sell media.<p>The Gen X generation seems to be characterized as generally depressed with a bored attitude of *its ok, i&#x27;ll get over it&quot;.  The primary theme there is some form of muted (apathetic) emotional resiliency, where mute suggests a primary characterization that is unintentionally not primarily communicated.  These sort of characterizations suggest something that is not fragile, but not something that is socially exciting.<p>Millennial generation on the other hand appears to be characterized by maximum inclusion and interconnectedness, which are great... until people are cut off, which is characterized for its stark fragility.<p>Those are stereotypes and are prone to being wildly inaccurate with respect to any particular group or subculture, but still its interesting to compare those two demographics by solely looking at the representative media.  During Gen X grunge, gangster rap, and country music were wildly popular.  The really big deal in my area was Nine Inch Nails which was horribly depressing. Shows like Roseanne, Married with Children, and Beavis and Butthead were all the rage which mostly featured primary characters sitting on a couch complaining and getting over it.  Also remember the Simpsons were far more depressing in their first few seasons during that period of time.<p>Media also reflects the stereotypes for the Millennial generation as well.  The popular shows of the late 90s and early 2000s were things like Friends, Seinfeld, Sex and the City, Grey&#x27;s Anatomy, and 30 Rock.  These were all friends spending time with each other being happy, and aside from 30 Rock, none of those people ever seemed to go to work. Work is boring and depressing.  The biggest things in music during the early years of the Millennial generation were most pop bands that graduated from boy bands or young attractive female pop singers.  The theme was be beautiful, happy, and connected, but the moment you weren&#x27;t connected the rest of it seemed to fall apart.<p>Comparing the two generations it seems Gen Xers are living an emotional coma enjoying all that numbs them to, while Millennials are living with bipolar disorder.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Generation_X\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Generation_X<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Millennials\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Millennials<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 20:09:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["valuearb"],"id":[22803732],"kids":{},"parent":[22800433],"text":["Another example of the myth of the omnipotence of marketing messages.<p>Marketing only works when the product works.

I think the money that went into this makes most sense framed as a type of generational panic combined with technological transformation. The early Gen Xers were entering the workforce with a set of behaviors &#x2F; values that felt unfamiliar &amp; perhaps threatening to Boomers. Boomers began to feel uncool, out of touch and no longer culturally adept in the way they always had previously. This is nothing new, but I think it might be particularly wrenching when it finally happens to a demographically large and dominant cohort. Millennials, let me know how it works out.<p>More importantly rapid changes in technology caused corporations to lose control of media distribution for the first time. Widespread availability of personal computers &#x2F; microchips caused media creation and distribution costs plummet in publishing, music, and film production&#x2F;distribution. New insurgents like Fantagraphics, hip hop, college radio, indie rock, The Onion, The Stranger, Might, indie record labels and indie movies could route around large corporations to find an audience and build a business. Capital was still needed, but was orders of magnitude less than it had been for prior generations.<p>The resulting panic was deepest in the industries connected to entertainment, including those that depended on it for marketing. It seems absurd, but consumer brands convinced themselves that not only would Xers reject traditional media &amp; advertising - they’d reject the previous generations products as well. There was sincere worry that millions of kids would stop drinking Coke &amp; Miller Lite. Ad agencies helped fuel this panic as it brought with it an opportunity to pry large accounts away from incumbents.<p>This period didn’t last long, but it did birth a number of experiments like OK Cola, most of which were conceived as experiments and strategic contingency plans. For a brief and shining moment, there was some decent money and cultural cachet showered upon a bunch of smirking early 20s Xers whose only qualifications were helming a late night college radio program. It was wonderful to see Daniel Clowes, Charles Burns and other generation-defining artists get some well-earned money if not recognition."],"time":["2020-04-07 18:05:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thre2ewr4234"],"id":[22803274],"kids":[22804565],"parent":[22800433],"text":["For a moment there I wondered if George from Seinfeld had created a virtual assistant :D"],"time":["2020-04-07 16:03:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mark-r"],"id":[22803528],"kids":{},"parent":[22800433],"text":["Despite being in one of the test market areas, I don&#x27;t remember this at all."],"time":["2020-04-07 16:32:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["beams_of_light"],"id":[22805203],"kids":{},"parent":[22800433],"text":["I remember being so proud of my OK Soda hat that I won in a can at school.<p>Good memories."],"time":["2020-04-07 19:12:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["krzyk"],"id":[22803912],"kids":{},"parent":[22800433],"text":["Design of OK Soda looks quite similar to Fallout Nuka Cola"],"time":["2020-04-07 17:10:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andai"],"id":[22801276],"kids":[22801369],"parent":[22800433],"text":["&gt; OK Soda&#x27;s concept was that the youth market was already aware that they were being manipulated by mass-media marketing, so this advertising campaign would just be more transparent about it."],"time":["2020-04-07 10:05:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22801306],"kids":{},"parent":[22800433],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-07 10:09:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["MivLives"],"id":[22802946],"kids":{},"parent":[22800433],"text":["I have a hobby of trying odd sodas.

I suggest following me on twitter, itch.io, youtube or github to check it out.<p>As I told, I&#x27;m not working right now so if you liked QUBES and want to support me and the developing of other games, I suggest you make a donation you itch.io, paypal or consider becoming a patreon.<p>Here I go by atum47, but on all other platforms I&#x27;m usually victorqribeiro.

Adding projects to your resume is sine-qua-non functionality on a job hunting site; pretending that you&#x27;re not job hunting is more or less required by office decorum. Does AngelList provide a way of listing projects you&#x27;ve done at your current company without notifying your boss that you&#x27;re looking to leave? It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t show candidates on AngelList to employers who are already employing them, but without the ability to update your resume you don&#x27;t have much.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11326557\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11326557<\/a><p>DonHopkins on Mar 21, 2016 | parent | favorite | on: Tell HN: AngelList told my employer that I&#x27;d updat...<p>I had big problems with the &quot;Angel List&quot; web site, because it was extremely flakey and appeared to be a typical piece of garbage that some dime-a-dozen huckster with very little experience had just thrown together after watching the Ruby on Rails Make Your Own Trendy Dot Com Crud Web Site in 10 Minutes screencast.<p>Major features were totally broken. Many things about the design were devoid of thought and just haphazardly thrown together, as if I was using a mock-up that was nowhere near ready for prime time. Obviously whoever implemented it and runs it had no intention of using it themselves, and puts no time into maintaining the site or supporting the &quot;customers&quot; (who are actually the product). The only &quot;design&quot; apparent was in the most shallow surface details and of the least meaningful kind.<p>Their support is absolutely non-existent. I heard nothing back from them whatsoever, after sending several emails. Lights are on but nobody&#x27;s home. It has the feel of yet another ghost town scam web site run by a sociopathic all-talk-no-chops frat boy &quot;idea man&quot; who long ago went on to something else after pissing off and driving away all their developers who worked for free on the promise of equity, and is now letting it run on autopilot. Too many self described &quot;Serial Hacktrepeneurs&quot;, not enough programmers.<p>Because I encountered so many problems that I have no control over but should, it&#x27;s an embarrassment to be listed with so many glitches that I am unable to work around, which cause investors to see my profile in such a haphazard state. Their carelessness makes it look like I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s careless.<p>I hope Silicon Valley does an episode parodying AngelList, or at least somebody writes some fanfic about it.

If your attention has wandered on to other things, and you no longer have any interest in maintaining your web site or responding to your users for over a year, then you really should shut it down gracefully, and save everyone from wasting their time and having their privacy unexpectedly violated. Old unmaintained web sites running on auto-pilot that collect sensitive private information from their users (and automatically forge first-person email pretending to be from their users in order to virally promote themselves) are a dangerous security threat, which should be shut down for the safety of the internet.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yd0fBXwDBmo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yd0fBXwDBmo<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11350697\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11350697<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 03:49:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["demadog"],"id":[22799415],"kids":[22800550,22799509,22799491,22799429,22799591,22799487],"parent":[22799263],"text":["Really hard for me to comprehend this when Naval is an omniscient oracle on Twitter."],"time":["2020-04-07 02:57:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nayuki"],"id":[22813631],"kids":{},"parent":[22799411],"text":["This project is called DiscDAG, and the description says you can reply to multiple threads all at once.

This information was intended to allow Naborly to better support landlords and tenants and promote a mutual understanding of the severe impact the economic shutdown is having on the rental industry. Upon reflection, I recognize that the email was poorly worded and did not provide sufficient context. I am deeply sorry if it suggested that Naborly or myself were trying to do anything other than help.<p>Our goal at Naborly is to provide a tenant screening tool that is free from bias, and we are firm believers that housing is a human right.  For tenants, we aim to remove traditional barriers to housing such as level of income, student or immigration status, or prior evictions. For landlords, we provide a screening tool that captures a tenant’s entire ability to pay rent, beyond factors such as credit history.<p>As part of that goal, we have always had a reporting tool that allows landlords to provide feedback, both positive and negative, on their tenants. In light of the COVID-19 crisis, this information is more important than ever. We serve over 800,000 rental units and their owners and are in a unique position to compile information on the hardships facing tenants and landlords alike. Having accurate information allows us to adapt our screening tools to ensure tenants are not unfairly viewed as intentionally delinquent on their rent obligations. Last week, we were grateful to have received survey responses from more than 5000 tenants and 700 landlords on the difficulties the COVID-19 pandemic has created for them, and were able to use that information to promote a constructive dialogue between tenants and landlords. You can read the results of our survey here.<p>Naborly is and will always be committed to unbiased accuracy, fairness, and equality in our risk assessment. The notion that we are trying to hurt tenants in this time of crisis is against everything we believe in as a team. I am deeply sorry that the way I expressed myself did not reflect who we are as a company and what we are trying to accomplish. It was not my intention.<p>Our support lines are open to all landlords and tenants to assist in navigating the government programs available to them and to answer any other questions they may have.<p>Sincerely,<p>Dylan Lenz<p>Founder &amp; CEO \nNaborly Inc."],"time":["2020-04-07 22:17:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pfortuny"],"id":[22806326],"kids":{},"parent":[22805574],"text":["So... is data good or is it not?

On my fiber connection, it takes nearly two seconds to render anything beyond a loading animation (generally a bad sign) and several more seconds to fully stream in content for various sections of the page. Why so slow? A quick trip to the Network tab in the browser console reveals that more than 4.6 megabytes of JavaScript are needed just for the list of emails to first render. After that point, 8 more megabytes of JavaScript stream in and various elements on the page render asynchronously. All this while, a further 3.5 megabytes of XHR data are transferred across more than 60 separate API calls.<p>What this reads as, to me, is &quot;Gmail, a highly-stateful tool, is downloaded locally and then it requests a large portion of the user&#x27;s inbox and other data for usage.&quot;<p>I highly doubt the JavaScript is re-downloaded every time the author visits Gmail.

In 1994, about 5 years later after Steve Deering published RFC1112, IP multicast got implemented in our Dutch spanned amateur packet radio network [1]. There were about 20-30 network nodes acting as Local Access Points for access to users, and interconnected via interlinks. The nodes implemented the AX25 packet radio protocol with rates of 1200-9600 baud, on top of that you could transport IP datagrams hence these nodes were part of the 44.0.0.0 AMPR.ORG Internet network. There were nodes that had an Internet gateway through a local origanisation or university, but these gateways were mainly used to support linking the subnet of the 44.0.0.0 network and connecting the AX25 networks (via AXIP and wormholes).<p>The nodes here in the Netherlands used the multicast to distribute link information and IP autorouting. It was very well possible to join a multicast group somehwere in the network by multiple parties, and then stream UDP frames accross the network.<p>A very fun experiment at the time was to send CELP-compressed (1-2kb&#x2F;s) audio packets through the multicast network, and hence it was possible to have conversation with multiple people spanning a distance larger then the radio horizon. The latency and packet loss were disrupting good operation, but it more or less worked.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jj1wtk.jp&#x2F;nos&#x2F;history.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jj1wtk.jp&#x2F;nos&#x2F;history.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 19:00:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gumby"],"id":[22804124],"kids":{},"parent":[22799316],"text":["I have been disappointed that multicast isn&#x27;t used by the mass video chat apps (e.g. Zoom), but after talking to some of the folks &quot;in the know&quot; it looks like you can&#x27;t even count on it being supported in all the devices you need to reach your endpoint.<p>It seems like it would be good for that and great for &quot;cord cutting&quot; live apps like sport broadcast.

I haven&#x27;t heard any from colleagues in the US or China, even from people who do medical AI work.<p>One major role for AI that I see here is in prognostication. Are there features within radiographs or CT scans that could predict disease severity? Maybe ones that radiologists &amp; clinicians can&#x27;t discern yet? This would help triage care in capacity-constrained settings. But as the article says, that&#x27;s &quot;in the future&quot;. I haven&#x27;t seen any robust research in this area yet, and a useful prognostic model would probably incorporate more than just imaging -- symptomology, vital signs, etc.<p>For screening, on the other hand, there are some opportunities but also challenges. When PCR tests&#x2F;materials&#x2F;reagents are limited and caseload is high, CT scanning can be a powerful tool to screen and differentiate &quot;sick&quot; from &quot;probably not sick&quot;, as was done in Wuhan and Northern Italy. But the AI doesn&#x27;t offer a whole lot -- the findings are not particularly subtle. Amusingly, from the article: &quot;Teams in China and the United States found that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 symptoms had certain visual hallmarks, such as ground-glass opacities... and areas of increased lung density called consolidation.&quot; This is repeated in every AI article on COVID imaging. Like, this is literally Radiology 101 -- any radiologist and many non-radiologist physicians would have been able to say this before COVID existed. Viral pneumonias (SARS, influenza, COVID) and other things (edema, atypical pneumonias, drug reactions) all cause ground-glass opacities. Consolidations happen when the lung gets socked in or super-infected (i.e. with bacteria).<p>Another issue is that early lung infection does not appear on CT, which is common for almost all pneumonias. So CT misses early and especially early mild infections, which is not ideal for screening.<p>And finally, interpretation capacity (what AI could help with) is not a bottleneck. There are TONS of radiologists who are underutilized right now as elective imaging and procedures are way down (e.g. not many screening mammograms or sports injury MRIs being done these days) and on top of that it would not take a radiologist very long to say &quot;this is probably not COVID&quot; or &quot;this could be COVID&quot; or &quot;this is really bad lung disease&quot;. Even with lung scans being fast and if we used every CT scanner on them, AI wouldn&#x27;t really help increase our throughput interpretation-wise.<p>Of course, I write from the perspective of a highly-resourced health system. In the developing world, radiology access, like medical care in general, has always been an issue. I think Kenya as a country has like 100-200 radiologists for what, 40 million people? While a single mid-size hospital in the U.S. could have 200 radiologists. And Kenya&#x27;s on the better side. So there AI could play an huge role in providing care (and certainly not just in this pandemic!)."],"time":["2020-04-07 18:42:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["captaincole"],"id":[22803960],"kids":[22804142,22804780,22811670],"parent":[22802960],"text":["While zoom has faced many privacy concerns in the last few weeks, it is incredible how reliable the service has been given the massive spike in demand.<p>Most services would have buckled (examples abound like robinhoods recent outage) and part of their stack would have not been able to handle the load.<p>On top of that they are in new customer segments that I bet they didn’t see as their user base.

Some interesting excerpts:<p>&gt; In the U.S., 27 attorney general’s offices have raised questions about privacy issues, Zoom said, adding it is cooperating with authorities.<p>&gt; Security researchers also have scrutinized Zoom’s links to China. Researchers at the Citizen Lab, a security research group affiliated with the University of Toronto, on Friday said Zoom used an encryption technology that is considered substandard, and that in certain circumstances the company stored encryption keys—long strings of numbers and characters that can be used to access encoded communications—on servers based in China.<p>&gt; Brendan Ittelson, head of technical support at Zoom, said because of the distributed nature of the company’s infrastructure, meeting data can be routed through different data centers around the world. Zoom’s system first tries to send this data locally, but if the connections fail, the backup route might send it elsewhere.<p>&gt; Zoom had created a system to prevent this data from being sent through China when calls originate in the U.S. But when traffic surged starting in February, some data was mistakenly routed that way, the company said, adding that it has remedied the problem. Critics also have questioned whether Zoom’s heavy reliance on China-based engineering could pose a security risk.<p>Source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;zoom-ceo-i-really-messed-up-on-security-as-coronavirus-drove-video-tools-appeal-11586031129\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;zoom-ceo-i-really-messed-up-on-...<\/a><p>Personal opinion: I think we should all boycott Zoom until there is a guarantee of where the data is stored with independent audits.

Perhaps not in the immediate future, but may be in year 2027 - suppressing voices, threats and border control, detentions of people who spoke against the CCP during the pandemic or after caught using the facial AI technologies from the data collected today.

I believe these studies strongly influence our public servants so it’s unfortunate that such important points have not being raised sooner by academics.<p>Higher worker costs, along with other reasons, means the Australian manufacturing industry could not compete in the international market. With import tariffs being steadily reduced since the 70s (from roughly 35% in 1970 to below 5% in 2016), the local industry could not compete against international competitors in the local markets either.

I would not be so certain for a Chinese rise-up after covid19. If you had asked this question three months ago, no one would have doubted that China was on track to be the dominant world power, given that the Trump presidency trades American dominance for little to no gain (e.g. leaving Paris Accords, retreating out of Iraq&#x2F;Afghanistan&#x2F;Kurdistan, while at the same time cozying up with dictators and autocrats like North Korea or Saudi-Arabia), while at the same time China exploits the reduction of Western help in both Africa (where China now provides investment aid &#x2F; work without the strings that are usually attached to Western aid, like rules of democracy) and Europe itself (where Italy, Greece, Spain and other countries, e.g. Croatia or Serbia, turn to China for financial &#x2F; logistical assistance as the EU is unwilling to help out thanks to Germany&#x2F;Austria&#x2F;Netherlands opposing). Also, China abuses that influence regularly to tune down criticism of e.g. the Muslim Gulags or the Tibet situation, because a trade blockade or stop to supply money is an effective threat that China can make as many countries depend on cheap Chinese labor or money by now.<p>Now with Covid19 however? Many people and many corporations are effectively forced to diversify their supply chains (Apple most famously) or to re-nationalize critical production like ventilators or even mass goods such as masks, gloves and overalls for medical staff; at the same time consumers in most if not all nations will face a <i>massive<\/i> lack of spending power on goods that are not essential to their survival. Both of this will drastically reduce the dependence of Western (and other) nations on China, and if Corona FINALLY forces Germany and the Netherlands to drop their blockade of Eurobonds then also China won&#x27;t be needed as financer for poor-er EU countries.<p>On the other side, I would also not bet on the US to rise to fill the void they themselves have left and China will leave, especially if Trump gets reelected (his approval ratings are on record highs for whatever reason).

The implicit suggestion that everyone else is <i>always<\/i> using branches does seem a bit strange, if that’s the implication.

Mathematical intuition is almost another sense in its own right: you gain the ability to perceive abstractions and relationships in ways that are just not well-described by sight or touch. I both enjoy this sense and find it valuable, so of course I&#x27;m going to continue honing it :)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2bgZmBAnhdg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2bgZmBAnhdg<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-06 01:16:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yoshyosh"],"id":[22792647],"kids":[22793184,22793148,22792816,22811042,22792894],"parent":[22786287],"text":["I&#x27;m learning how to make tacos starting with the tortilla. I&#x27;m originally from San Diego and have always missed Mexican food whenever I moved abroad. On a recent trip back to San Diego, I went to over a dozen Mexican shops to find particular flours to create tortillas from. I also went to Mexico twice just to find a specific brand of soft wheat flour. In total I think I experimented with atleast 5-6 different flours thus far. Since then I&#x27;ve made over 150 tortillas, learning things like the importance of the ratio of fat&#x2F;water&#x2F;flour, the proper heat, feel, and cook time. Rolling it with flour and without, hand patting vs mechanical tortilla presses. Simple mistakes are like the difference between making a cracker and a tortilla. There&#x27;s also things like the elasticity of the dough the longer it sits so things like heated tortilla presses become important to help it keep its shape, since the heat slightly cooks the tortilla as it&#x27;s being pressed into shape. Compared to pure mechanical ones where the tortilla will retract back due to no heat forcing it to sit in place. I&#x27;m still hoping to invest in a heated press once I return to the States since I can&#x27;t find them in Amsterdam.<p>Overall I&#x27;m enjoying the craft of it all and will be soon moving towards learning the details that go into making sauces and carne asada."],"time":["2020-04-06 13:11:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simonsarris"],"id":[22787516],"kids":[22788853,22794880,22792351,22788462,22789261,22796743],"parent":[22786287],"text":["I&#x27;ve been clearing land all day and bought 50lbs of buckwheat.

It was created with the intention to be easy to learn. The entire alphabet is 24 characters, whereas Japanese has over 500 and Mandarin has a few thousand.<p>Each of the 24 characters follow very logical rules and build onto each other to build &quot;blocks&quot; of syllables. Each block must start with a consonant in the top-left, always followed by a vowel, and sometimes ends with a consonant. So the block always reads left-right, top-bottom and must always contain at least one consonant and vowel.<p>In addition, each syllable block has a phonetic sound. This means that it&#x27;s really easy to read and pronounce, since there are no silent letters, with the one exception of single vowel syllable blocks. Which must start with a silent <U+3147>(ng), for example the character <U+3163>(i). So following the rule of a syllable block needing to start with a consonant you can&#x27;t have a single <U+3163> since it&#x27;s a vowel, so you need to use <U+3147> as a placeholder, thus creating <U+3147><U+3163>(i).<p>Now if you want to create a word, like &quot;child&quot;. You can put together the character <U+314F>(a) and <U+3163>(i). Since you can&#x27;t have two vowels in the same block, we must use two blocks to create the word. This gives us <U+3147><U+314F><U+3147><U+3163> (a-i).<p>The vowels consist entirely of horizontal and vertical lines, with a dash or double dash off to the left, right, top, or bottom. It&#x27;s a very simple alphabet and an extremely interesting language. If anyone want&#x27;s to learn more, feel free to checkout the Wiki page on Hangul for the full set of vowels, consonants, and double consonants. It&#x27;s often said you can learn the Hangul alphabet in 90 minutes.
