Mainly because I couldn&#x27;t think of an easy way to detect the perimeter of the lawn without an edge wire!<p>I guess it&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve.<p>I had considered a bunch of options, a few of the ideas I had were:<p>1. Some kind of camera or color sensor, looking downward, to detect &quot;green&quot; vs &quot;non-green&quot; - assuming the grass was green and non-grass would be some other color. That would work ok for most of my yard, but my lawn in front doesn&#x27;t have an &quot;edge&quot; with the neighbor&#x27;s lawn - so it would mow their lawn, too - not what I want.<p>2. A passive perimeter, consisting of a bunch of spaced (maybe 6&quot; between?) magnets - I thought maybe plastic golf tees with a rare-earth magnet glued on top would be ok; then use hall-effect sensors on the robot&#x27;s perimeter to determine if it had crossed over the line of magnets.<p>3. This one was more to detect cut vs uncut grass - but use some kind of humidity sensor; assuming cut grass has higher humidity than uncut grass, &quot;sniff&quot; the ground and avoid uncut (drier) areas. The problem with this concept, mainly, was in not being able to find high-speed humidity sensors&#x2F;detectors.<p>At any rate, I never followed through with any of this, but maybe someday I might return to it? I am curious on the cost of this iRobot lawn mower, though. I&#x27;m guessing 4 figures, given what I know about the price of their vacuums (which my wife loves; every time one dies, she buys a new one, and the old one I save for my future Roomba army to take over the world with).<p>If my guess is accurate, then I&#x27;ll just have to put off buying one, as it will still be cheaper to continue to pay my landscaper to cut my lawn (and this robot won&#x27;t trim trees or bushes yet, so...)"],"time":["2020-01-09 20:44:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crmrc114"],"id":[22004474],"kids":[22004564,22004536],"parent":[21998453],"text":["I fail to understand how a combination of GPS and Machine vision could not overcome the need for a dedicated telemetry system.<p>I mean yeah if you don&#x27;t want to build a machine vision system to handle this I guess....

It&#x27;s highly unlikely that your antecedents set out to make a shit product. It&#x27;s likely that when they were starting out, they wanted to create something efficient and streamlined, but then years of paying customer feedback took things to where they are today. The folks at 37signals always used to remind us that it&#x27;s much easier to add a feature than it is to remove one.<p>I wonder how much of the shopkeepers reactions were fighting change vs just not trusting someone who didn&#x27;t come from where they came from. There&#x27;s real class anxiety around the blue collars vs the 20-something software millionaire set (which is likely how they saw you, as the other, even if you&#x27;re actually their neighbour). I wonder what would happened differently if it was the owner of the first shop leading the pitch. I often advise founders that they shouldn&#x27;t get into any business where one of the founders doesn&#x27;t have deep industry experience and connections. If nobody on your team has ever managed a hotel, it&#x27;s highly likely that you will fail to disrupt hotel management. Anyhow, it&#x27;s unclear from your writing but seems like your first customer guy was just that - a customer. In other words, he found someone to spend a month doing free fan service for an idea that if he was truly that excited about it, he would have hired you or at least proposed a partnership and been much more aggressively involved in doing the initial customer development conversations with you.<p>I&#x27;m intrigued by the notion that they have no problem installing their own servers. This pretty much lines up with a certain segment of blue collar and [what I&#x27;d describe as Meyers-Briggs &#x27;S&#x27;-type professions]... heck, I&#x27;ve seen those computers. They are always covered in a slick of oil and dust particulate. I wonder if they would have been comfortable with an on-site solution that is <i>also<\/i> connected to a central service, like Github Enterprise. In this way, they have working infrastructure even if you decide to ditch software for comedy, and you can both push new updates and offer remote backup (which is good for risk mitigation) as a paid extra service.<p>Do sheet metal shops have a trade magazine? Is there an annual sheet metal trade show in Vegas? You might still find it interesting to attend.<p>Note that <i>of course<\/i> you&#x27;re not passionate about sheet metal. The entire premise is ridiculous because even the sheet metal people see it as a job. The whole point of doing something unsexy is that in some ways it&#x27;s hard because not everyone is willing to do it. I would change and do some things differently, like getting that first customer to put a lot more time and money on the line to explore the concept in a partnership capacity, but if you want to follow the FreshBooks trajectory you have to start with a fractional subset of functionality targeting a micro-demographic and THEN grow into the Intuit competitor over the next decade or so. There was never going to be an overnight success and you&#x27;ll probably need someone to put in some adventure capital so that you don&#x27;t burn out after a single month of customer development.<p>While it&#x27;s true that you failed to come to the table with a solution to a hair-on-fire problem the other sheet metal shops were having, try to remember that they have good reason for conservative skepticism about something that could turn their business upside down. A lot of this stuff is just an expression of the lowest levels of Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy. Everyone wants to be the hero of their tribe, but nobody wants to be humiliated in front of their tribe. The only way to sell into those shops would be for your first customer to make the leap, and then have someone else that already agrees with that customer make the leap and show everyone else that it&#x27;s safe.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V74AxCqOTvg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V74AxCqOTvg<\/a><p>It&#x27;s not the first customer that is the most important.

Deep down, people are scared of the future and they make a lot of irrational decisions based on things they&#x27;ve already done but also on things that they imagine they will do in a perfect future. People will double down on purchases that they&#x27;ve already made so they don&#x27;t have to confront the quality of their first decision. And people will buy books on Amazon that they don&#x27;t have time to read because in an imaginary aspirational future, they have an opportunity to real all of the books, and that person will be so smart and awesome compared to themselves today. A huge amount of purchasing in North America is aspirational. Kitchen appliances much?<p>Onto the comedy app! Bandsintown&#x2F;Songkick for Comedy is a really great concept. I agree that scraping is a fools errand. However, it&#x27;s also really important that you replace scraping not with your time but with someone you hire from the internet. Not only is your time way too valuable, it&#x27;s not a realistic test of what will be necessary to scale it even a little bit. I definitely think that you should find some comics willing to pay even a token amount to use your service to host a reasonably nice homepage for them.

It wasn&#x27;t hard to setup and had it running in about a day together with Minio as an S3 backend. To this day it&#x27;s running without a problem, apart from an alarm every now and then that the Store or Compactor couldn&#x27;t get something done. But I didn&#x27;t look too much into it since everything graphing-wise seems to work. Upgrades are also easy and I love the global querier option. I sometimes see people having OOMs on a rather &quot;large&quot; servers on Slack, but Thanos team is suppose to be working on optimizing memory usage and it&#x27;s getting better and better.<p>After the last PromCon, I also configured VictoriaMetrics. Installation was as simple as it can be, way simpler than Thanos, but I&#x27;m using a single node version. It works really good for the last 3 months. Resource usage is a lot lower than on Thanos.<p>Both solutions have their own Slack channels with developers and users there, so it is easy to get help and resolve issues.<p>In the end, I think I&#x27;ll go with VM in my case, since it has less moving parts, doesn&#x27;t need S3 backend (we are on-prem and don&#x27;t have a production S3 storage) and lower resource usage.

And it was amazing. \nThan 14k&#x2F;s and 20k&#x2F;s \nPreviously i have the volume for Prometheus data and it was about 30 gigs on smallest install to 70 gigs on largest\nMoving from storing 30days in Prometheus to 90 days in vm was the huge benefit. \nOn every of three instances with 7, 14 and 20k metrics per second i can extend retention from 3 to 5x on the same volume. With same dashboards. With same alerts. Just added remote read and remote write.<p>Than i decide to take it on a real life web scale production. \nSo i started from 11 servers f2-micro on gcp.\n* 3 storage\n* 2 insert nodes\n* 2 select nodes\n* 2 promxy\n* 1 grafana\n* 1 selfmon prometheus<p>Got lots of expected ooms on 60k per second. Than i move to n1-standart-1 for storage and insert. \nIt can handle at about 650k per second insert load for several weeks without ooms or any unaxpected behaviors. \nThat was real life data from prometheus-operator from one of our rc clusters. node-exporters, application metrics and kubemetrics.<p>Tuning it to n1-highmem-2 for storage nodes so get enough room for background merges and so on.<p>Also i copy my Prometheus rules from prod to promxy (at about 200 in sum). \nThat makes some noise for read. So i got at about 70 reads per second and pretty 90% cpu utilization on promxy servers. \nBut almost no additional cpu load on vm servers.

There&#x27;s so much confusion (and willful disinformation) in the world when it comes to science, and so many journalists don&#x27;t understand that a single article published in a journal does not mean that there is now a scientific consensus around this - that usually comes years later when a meta-study comes along. In most fields, as an outsider, you basically have to get lucky that one of these meta-studies has cropped up recently and you happen to talk to an expert that can point you at it. In medicine there is the Cochrane organization that does a pretty good job of communicating these findings in a clear way. But why isn&#x27;t there something like this for all fields of science, constantly updated, so journalists, policy-makers and curious amateurs like myself have a single point of entry when we want to understand the state of the art in a given scientific field? A trustworthy source where I could check what&#x27;s certain and what&#x27;s still up in the air when it comes to CRISPR, which variants of string theory have we managed to disprove using colliders, which are still being considered, what do the currently best climate models look like and how certain are we of their accuracy?<p>It&#x27;d be a huge undertaking - continuously interviewing researchers, quantifying and communicating their answers in a way that non-experts can understand. But on the other hand, all the science we&#x27;re already doing is a huge undertaking, and it&#x27;s crazy that we let all the knowledge that these experts accumulate just languish in obscure journals targeted only at other experts, and letting the &#x27;state of the art&#x27; just be this implicit thing in the heads of dozens of experts, instead of being stated explicitly somewhere accessible."],"time":["2020-01-09 15:00:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["smolder"],"id":[22001600],"kids":[22001725],"parent":[22000126],"text":["Society failing some potentially super effective people is observable.

However, at the end of the day, I felt that keeping the license of the solution (or core solution) as MIT was the best option irrespective, and my thoughts came from the following areas in which monetisation can be substantiated.<p>- Labor costs for staff, which include developers, network administrators, and support officers.<p>- Costs incurred for resources, server infrastructure, office resources and so fourth.<p>- And of course marketing and sales of the solution.<p>The key is to communicate this substation, therefore asking customers for donations, i feel, becomes irrelevant if you can do that effectively. So really the gist is &quot;it&#x27;s great that the software is free but someone has to run it and even more so someone has to keep supporting it&quot;.<p>Ideally, my opinion on monetisating comes from the business model which encapsulates the solution, therefore licensing the end product can just be focused around the tangibles that inherently make up the business side of a SaaS company.<p>I think the most murky part of this dilemma comes from professional services and enterprise grade solutions because this is where custom and closed treatment maybe needed for the client. Plus other issues come more from a security standpoint and trade secret standpoint than anywhere else. For instance customisation on top of a SaaS platform via APIs or integration work may require the asset (or code) to be closed source from the perspective to satisfy the clients&#x27; needs, but this has always been an issue and is not a SaaS centric problem as the argument only comes during the purchase cycle of a company and the IT manager asks the question &quot;can our business trust open source?&quot;."],"time":["2020-01-09 17:06:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ahnick"],"id":[22002325],"kids":[22002469],"parent":[22000853],"text":["The model we are planning to use for the products at Plyint(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plyint.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plyint.com<\/a>) is basically the &quot;Free Software Product&quot; model in a SaaS format.

But it’s interesting that the free market exists only on one side of the equation.

Owners may pay Nixon-era property tax rates, while renting out those spaces at rates that have exploded in the last 40 years. They, too, can afford to let buildings sit empty.<p>Tax policies play a big role in setting up market distortions like those happening in San Francisco. It&#x27;s not just the rate, but the basis. Strong Towns has a discussion of the idea that taxing land, not improvements leads to better outcomes:<p>&gt; A parking lot in a bustling downtown is the classic example of a property where nearly all of the value is in the land itself, not the asphalt on top of it. In a rising market, you can hold onto the land and watch its value go steadily up (thanks to all the things your neighbors are doing to make the place more productive and successful). You can collect enough in parking fees to cover the taxes, and cash out when you&#x27;re ready to cash out. Your property tax bill will be relatively low, because it&#x27;s based on the sum of land value and improvements. The land may be in a central, prized location, but the &quot;improvements&quot; on the property (that&#x27;s tax-assessor speak for any sort of structure built on the land) are worth next to zero.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;3&#x2F;5&#x2F;whats-with-that-empty-lot-in-the-heart-of-the-city\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;3&#x2F;5&#x2F;whats-with-that...<\/a><p>This line of thinking may also apply to empty shops in SF.

Americans care about other things a lot more than they care about infrastructure, and us rail fans, urbanists, etc., just need to get over it. The current state of infrastructure development in the U.S. is the product of bi-partisan factors and nobody (not literally nobody,b ut not enough people) want to change the status quo.<p>NEPA, was signed into law by Richard Nixon, with the full support of Democrats. It is the perfect, bi-partisan, vehicle for ensuring that nothing gets built anywhere, ever. The average NEPA review for a transit project is now 6.6 years. A non-trivial number take a decade or more. For Democrats, it satisfies anti-development (historical preservationists, environmentalists, etc.) constituencies. For Republicans, it ensures that government will never have to spend real money on big transit projects. No need to seem like the bad guy and kill rail projects when various constituencies will use the NEPA process and litigate the projects to death anyway.<p>At the end of the day, most people are okay with the result. Or at least, they care about other things much more than building infrastructure. Republicans don&#x27;t really mind spending a few million a year keeping projects on environmental review life support so long as that means indefinitely deferring having to actually build anything. Democrats, meanwhile, even if they like transit in principle, won&#x27;t prioritize streamlining development and bringing down costs over satisfying other key constituencies: environmentalists, labor unions, etc. The New York City subway is literally melting down. It costs as much money to build a mile of subway in  New York as it costs to build entire new fully automated subway lines in Spain. But addressing the underlying cost disease (which would mean taking on labor and public unions) is not even on anyone&#x27;s radar. (And it makes sense--Democrats can&#x27;t afford to lose those votes when it comes to higher-priority issues.) Here in D.C. the subway system, including nearly all the underground parts, was mostly built within a 10-year period. But it has taken more than 20 years to extend a single line through exurban Virginia, mostly along a highway median that was expressly reserved for that purpose decades ago. Metro&#x27;s current 2040 plan proposes a single new line, which will almost certainly never be built.<p>They say that if you spend too much time working on your weaknesses, you&#x27;ll spend all your time focusing on what you&#x27;re bad at instead of what you&#x27;re good at. As an urbanist, and a &quot;city person,&quot; I have given up pining for Japanese or European style public infrastructure. It&#x27;s just never going to happen. America isn&#x27;t built that way and doesn&#x27;t want to be. The American political system enables the things Americans care about: road construction. Road construction is, for the most part, excluded from NEPA. I was shocked how cheaply and quickly the State of Maryland managed to repave my local segment of Route 50 near Annapolis. America probably has the best exurbs and strip malls in the world. I have learned to enjoy them.

They seem structurally simple at first, but they also have some unexpected failure modes.  There are two that I&#x27;m aware of, and there are almost certainly more.<p>1) Nonuniform work sizes.  Optimally scheduling the work when the sizes are nonuniform is Hard.  An almost-optimal algorithm is to dispatch larger items before smaller items.  This implementation dispatches work in FIFO order.  While this is Not Wrong (TM), its far from optimal when the work sizes are nonuniform.<p>2) Small work sizes.  As the size of each work item gets smaller and smaller, the proportion of the runtime cost which is spent to dispatch the work becomes larger and larger.  I&#x27;m working on a system which has dozens of work items to execute, but each one is only 50-100 microseconds long.  It turns out that this is an awfully inconvenient work size, and contention on a common FIFO was limiting available parallelism.  I found I got nearly 50% speedup by giving each worker thread its own workqueue and round-robin dispatching among them.<p>3) (edited to add) They don&#x27;t model fork&#x2F;join parallelism well on a common pool.  If work items also wait for work to complete, then the OP&#x27;s implementation may deadlock them.  To avoid deadlock, the join operator must be capable of executing a work item.  The C++11 future API isn&#x27;t rich enough to do this in user code.  See also WG21 paper N3557 for more on this topic.<p>From the perspective of a standards body, threadpools are similar to associative data structures.  There is a community of users who would like to have a one-size-fits-all implementation.  But it turns out that actual workloads have wildly differing requirements.  In practice, a standard library must provide several different models of a threadpool to satisfy them, or users will be forever complaining and&#x2F;or rolling their own."],"time":["2020-01-09 17:10:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Koshkin"],"id":[22002848],"kids":{},"parent":[22001711],"text":["On a somewhat tangential note, for C++ threading, Intel TBB is the best thing after sliced bread.

So long as you have a strong ROI use case, you can navigate those discussions with your customers. E.g., &quot;You were getting a 50x return, but listen, we&#x27;re running a business over here, and a 45x return is still pretty darn good.&quot;<p>The challenge in Postman&#x27;s case appears to be that they ALSO reduced the bundle components. So you compound the perception from &quot;paying more&quot; to &quot;paying more but getting less&quot;. That&#x27;s worse optics.<p>What I&#x27;d offer you think about is this may be a perfectly rational and even optimal customer solution. It&#x27;s unifying two different pricing actions: price increase and product bundling. The logic being that many customers weren&#x27;t using all the users, API calls, documentation views, custom domains, and integrations that were previously included in, say, the Pro bundle.<p>So as opposed to increasing price by—I&#x27;m making up numbers here—12% and leaving bundle elements the same, they increased price by 10% and cut features by 2%.

I just got done designing 3 wireless testing cages for the company I work for so I&#x27;ve been looking a lot into what makes good testing methodology for wireless. Very nice to see them dive into airtime right away and they actually cover it pretty well. I wouldn&#x27;t extrapolate their conclusions on mesh and why it&#x27;s fine to anything beyond low density home environments but that&#x27;s what 95% of the readers fit into so perfectly reasonable.<p>One grave conflation they make is they keep referring to web streaming as actually performing like a stream of data. In reality web streaming (outside of WebRTC) is actually very bursty chunks being sent usually in the range of every 1-5 seconds. In the Wi-Fi world the two types of streams can behave very differently. Not that their test is bad but it isn&#x27;t necessarily testing what they say it represents.<p>The HTTP workload is pretty representitive of what it says it&#x27;s testing. The rise of HTTP&#x2F;2 changes the way 16 connections to a single site would work but in reality loading a single site often connects to multiple servers anyways.<p>I was very happy to see them point out the large swings in jitter&#x2F;latency under load as well!<p>Unless you&#x27;re in a rural area and don&#x27;t have too many legacy wireless devices I&#x27;d really caution putting anything in 2.4 that doesn&#x27;t need to be there. It does penetrate farther but it&#x27;s also only 20 MHz of air space that almost always has to operate with legacy compatibility (damn you Nintendo devices and cheap IoT wireless N chips). If possible try to keep everything new on 5 GHz only and if you have a lot of devices or use a mesh utilize 2 40 or 80 MHz  5GHz channels depending on your wireless environment.<p>Overall very good and much better testing than I expected. If there were anything I&#x27;d add to such an article it&#x27;d be a section in any wireless testing article pointing out &quot;you&#x27;ll almost always be able to get better improvements by replacing your clients instead of comparing wireless routers of the same generation&quot;. Obviously more harder to do&#x2F;more expensive but I think a lot of the time home users think the access point is the be all end all of how good your wireless will be, forgetting it&#x27;s only 1 device out of a dozen in the house and just knowing this can set more realistic expectations and a better understanding of what you&#x27;re actually trying to improve."],"time":["2020-01-09 19:55:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zwieback"],"id":[22007219],"kids":{},"parent":[22001411],"text":["Another interesting thing to test is compliance with WiFi standards.

Let me give an example.<p>Say my wife and I go out for dinner and movies. Previously, my expenses would look like:<p>Transportation - $20<p>Cinema - $40<p>Restaurant - $60<p>The categories are directly tied to what was purchased.

The next thing to improve is support for banks that only allow users to download an N month window of transactions. Probably I will save each download to a timestamped file then merge them in-memory before the next stage in the pipeline. The source code for all of this is here: github.com&#x2F;tmerr&#x2F;bank_wrangler. I don&#x27;t expect it to be useful for anyone else verbatim but it might give you some ideas or something to fork from.

It&#x27;s written so cleanly that I learned a thing or two about 2d gamedev just from scrolling through the code.<p>I love the little pragmatisms in the language, eg:<p><pre><code>    for (let entity in gGameApp.mEntities)\n    {\n        if (let enemy = entity as Enemy)\n        {\n             &#x2F;&#x2F; .. do something with each enemy\n        }\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThat if&#x2F;let&#x2F;as combo there is something I&#x27;d have loved to have in many languages.<p>Also hats off for switch&#x2F;case without break.

You really only have the opportunity to get them right at the very beginning.<p>I think the docs are a little sparse still (but that can be expected, of course). Eg:<p>- I found it hard to parse this:<p><pre><code>    public Random mRand = new Random() ~ delete _;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThere&#x27;s docs about it here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beeflang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-guide&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;initialization&#x2F;#destruction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beeflang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-guide&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;initi...<\/a>, but the &quot;delete _&quot; part isn&#x27;t really explained.

I can infer that it probably means &quot;this value&quot;, but I can&#x27;t find it back.<p>I love that you made it easy to destruct fields like that, right there in the initializer expression, btw. Will probably kill the need for 90% of destructor methods out there.<p>- Apparently this converts floats to ints:<p><pre><code>    (.)(mX - entity.mX)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nOr at least it does in HeroBullet.bf:15.

It&#x27;s old (1990) and out of print, but you can get the PDF for free from Holub&#x27;s site [1].<p>Over the course of the book, a C compiler is developed. To handle lexical analysis and parsing, tools similar to lex and yacc are developed.<p>Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the preface to give an idea of the approach:<p>&gt; This book presents the subject of Compiler Design in a way that&#x27;s understandable to a programmer, rather than a mathematician. My basic premise is that the best way to learn how to write a compiler is to look at one in depth; the best way to understand the theory is to build tools that use that theory for practical ends. So, this book is built around working code that provides immediate practical examples of how given theories are applied. I have deliberately avoided mathematical notation, foreign to many programmers, in favor of English descriptions of the theory and using the code itself to explain a process. If a theoretical discussion isn&#x27;t clear, you can look at the code that implements the theory. I make no claims that the code presented here is the only (or the best) implementation of the concepts presented. I&#x27;ve found, however, that looking at an implementation-at any implementation--can be a very useful adjunct to understanding the theory, and the reader is well able to adapt the concepts presented here to alternate implementations.<p>&gt; The disadvantage of my approach is that there is, by necessity, a tremendous amount of low-level detail in this book. It is my belief, however, that this detail is both critically important to understanding how to actually build a real compiler, and is missing from virtually every other book on the subject. Similarly, a lot of the low-level details are more related to program implementation in general than to compilers in particular. One of the secondary reasons for learning how to build a compiler, however, is to learn how to put together a large and complex program, and presenting complete programs, rather than just the directly compiler-related portions of those programs, furthers this end. I&#x27;ve resolved the too-many-details problem, to some extent, by isolating the theoretical materials into their own sections, all marked with asterisks in the table of contents and in the header on the top of the page. If you aren&#x27;t interested in the nuts and bolts, you can just skip over the sections that discuss code.<p>...<p>&gt; In a sense, this book is really an in-depth presentation of several, very well documented programs: the complete sources for three compiler-generation tools are presented, as is a complete C compiler. (A lexical-analyzer generator modeled after the UNIX lex utility is presented along with two yacc-like compiler compilers.) As such, it is more of a compiler-engineering book than are most texts-a strong emphasis is placed on teaching you how to write a real compiler. On the other hand, a lot of theory is covered on the way to understanding the practice, and this theory is central to the discussion. Though I&#x27;ve presented complete implementations of the programs as an aid to understanding, the implementation details aren&#x27;t nearly as important as the processes that are used by those programs to do what they do. It&#x27;s important that you be able to apply these processes to your own programs.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;holub.com&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;holub.com&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-08 17:34:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BossingAround"],"id":[21990629],"kids":[21990711],"parent":[21968420],"text":["I misread and thought someone created a C-compiler <i>in<\/i> Scratch.

When I looked at using React I was confused that it seemingly didn&#x27;t want me to actually write HTML. Maybe I misread something, but it seemed like it wanted me to return HTML from JavaScript...this made little sense to me. I ended up using VueJS because it was far easier to learn. It did the job.<p>Webpack certainly is confusing too. I did a side project with some webpack and es6 stuff. It was kinda fun, but man, front-end development has sucked forever.

PHP for instance certainly is more complex with some of the frameworks you can use now and of course composer. But those are WAY simpler than the shit I had to deal with when coding the front. I just don&#x27;t understand how things have gotten more complex on the front-end, brutal.<p>It got me thinking about playing around with WebAssembly for building front-end applications. Maybe that doesn&#x27;t fit all use-cases and maybe the grass is always greener, but I wonder if programming in sane ecosystem would be the sane thing to do...?<p>Put me in the camp that if there isn&#x27;t a use-case slapping me in the face, choking me, and yelling at me to do a SPA then I&#x27;ll avoid the shit like a plague. I&#x27;ll just go with server-side render pages and sprinkle in some very basic jQuery as needed. I actually did that for a CRM two years ago and the thing is so damn simple to program in, because JavaScript is only used if it ACTUALLY provides a benefit to the user. There is a site-wide script that is maybe 100 lines of code. Then some page-specific things that load in stuff using RequireJS, but the most complex JS out of those is maybe 300 lines.
