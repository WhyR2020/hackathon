Corrected by 21.71% since then. Total gains till today: 35.85%.<p>3- CAC 40 has gained 20% in the last 5 years till the peak. Corrected by 22.12% in this sell-off. Total returns are -6%.<p>My thoughts:<p>- Tech used to go up more and down more. Now it went up more and down less. This is likely to encourage and push traditional investors to invest more in tech. They were afraid from tech because of the bloody downturns. Now tech holds better in a downturn, so that argument is no longer there.<p>- Europe is likely to be hit harder from this crisis since they rely a lot on Tourism. That means a harder recession. Europe tech sector is weak and unlikely to match its American counterpart growth in a EU slowdown.<p>- China might be the biggest loser in this. The world might realize we are depending too much on China. The US government might force company to build locally or outsource to friendlier countries they want to boost. China is not going to the dark ages but might face a slow down; though a social revolution is definitely not out of the question.<p>- The oil crisis, if prolonged, is going to change some countries. Look at Venezuela. Russia, Middle East, Algeria, Canada, etc... These countries might face budget challenges they have never been through before if oil goes below $20 for an extended time.<p>- The US tech sector being the only good-yield field and becoming a safe haven for investment in a world of worry and chaos will boom into a bubble of untold proportions.<p>Disclaimer: Not a professional advice.

I am mostly familiar with APL, but I think the things I appreciate and dislike are about the same in K.<p>One interesting philosophical difference, at least among some APL programmers, is that building abstractions should be avoided.  TFA has a hint of that philosophy, in its suggestion that perhaps <i>naming<\/i> (the root of abstraction) hinders clarity.  I think this is definitely worth considering, and it doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with the (supposedly) cryptic syntax.<p>One reason I <i>don&#x27;t<\/i> like K&#x2F;APL-ish vector programming is performance.  I once spent some time working with others on a GPU-targeting APL compiler, and I found that some common programming patterns are quite antithetical to good performance.  In particular, the use of &quot;nested arrays&quot; (not the same as multidimensional arrays) induces pointer structures that are difficult to do anything with.  Such nested arrays are typically necessary when you want to do the equivalent of a &quot;map&quot; operation that does not apply to each of the scalars at the bottom, but perhaps merely the rows of a matrix. Thus, control flow and data are conflated.  This is fine conceptually, but makes it difficult to generate high-performance code.<p>Another concern is that encoding control flow as data requires a lot of memory traffic (unless you have a Sufficiently Smart Compiler; much smarter than I have ever seen).  Consider computing the Mandelbrot set, which is essentially a &#x27;while&#x27; for each of a bunch of points.  An idiomatic APL implementation will often put the while loop on the <i>outside<\/i> of the loop over the point array, which means it will be written to memory for every iteration.  In other languages, it would be more idiomatic to apply the &#x27;while&#x27; loop to each point individually, which will then be able to run entirely in registers.  You can also do that in APL, but it is normally not idiomatic (and sometimes awkward) to apply complex scalar functions to array elements.<p>Just look at this Mandelbrot implementation from Dyalog; they do it in exactly the way I described: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dyalog.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;isolated-mandelbrot-set-explorer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dyalog.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;isolated-mandelbrot-set-...<\/a><p>Specifically, the conceptual &#x27;while&#x27; loop has been turned into an outer &#x27;for&#x27; loop (this is OK because the &#x27;while&#x27; loop is always bounded anyway):<p><pre><code>       :For cnt :In 1<U+2193><U+2373>256                      <U+235D> loop up to 255 times (the size of our color palette)\n           escaped<U+2190>4&lt;coord×+coord               <U+235D> mark those that have escaped the Mandelbrot set\n           r[escaped&#x2F;inds]<U+2190>cnt                  <U+235D> set their index in the color palette\n           (inds coord)<U+2190>(~escaped)°&#x2F;¨inds coord <U+235D> keep those that have not yet escaped\n           :If 0<U+220A><U+2374>inds <U+22C4> :Leave <U+22C4> :EndIf        <U+235D> anything left to do?\n           coord<U+2190>set[inds]+×<U+2368>coord              <U+235D> the core Mandelbrot computation... z<U+2190>(z*2)+c\n       :EndFor<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-03-09 09:23:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sullyj3"],"id":[22523250],"kids":[22523285],"parent":[22504106],"text":["This looks cool, seems like it&#x27;s proprietary and expensive though.

I have seen these tradeoffs often ignored or argued past when discussing various solutions that take advantage of it.<p>The cons to defunctionalization that I have experienced are things like:<p>You now not only need to test your application, but also the runtime that turns this data representation into actual work. Bugs can now occur in the runtime, in the reification of the app logic, or in the integration between the two.<p>If your application is particularly concurrent or lazy, then ensuring that your DSL works well with your main language&#x27;s concurrency and laziness machinery can get pretty hairy when you start executing your side effects.<p>It becomes harder to leverage your languages developer tools; breakpoints and debugging often end up in your DSL runtime&#x27;s code, not your application code, often requiring special-purpose tools to be built to debug your defunctionalized DSL.<p>Performance can also be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you can do some very clever things; use tricks like memoization, all the way up to writing a JIT compiler for your defunctionalized DSL to improve performance. However, you&#x27;re taking on that work due to the fact that your main language&#x27;s runtime can no longer do that work for you. Often these data DSLs end up allocating a lot of data structures that end up being parsed and thrown away later, and those allocations increase work in cleanup and the parsing itself.<p>I also heavily question the efficacy of testing these data DSLs. It is objectively easier to test pure functions, but on the other hand, how do you validate that they are correct? Often we don&#x27;t care about the actual data representation, we care that it does the work it describes; properly testing then essentially becomes a re-implementation of the DSL runtime with mocks &#x2F; etc.<p>For a concrete example of all of these tradeoffs, take a look at React in the webdev world. React is unequivocally a good idea, but it has required a massive investment from the React team and the ecosystem to make it correct, make it fast enough, to create developer tools for it, and to figure out how to effectively test applications that use it."],"time":["2020-03-09 19:30:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["quantified"],"id":[22526306],"kids":[22552769,22527114],"parent":[22525038],"text":["This one might be a bit more approachable: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.sigplan.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;30&#x2F;defunctionalization-everybody-does-it-nobody-talks-about-it&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.sigplan.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;30&#x2F;defunctionalization-ever...<\/a> as originally shared by <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21916774\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21916774<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-09 16:44:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Smaug123"],"id":[22525125],"kids":[22526505,22525232,22527496,22525268],"parent":[22525038],"text":["Author here: I&#x27;m happy to elaborate on any of this, except where I&#x27;ve signed NDAs about specific projects.<p>Also an obligatory &quot;we are hiring&quot; on behalf of G-Research; feel free to get in touch at patrick.stevens@gresearch.co.uk or patrick+hn@patrickstevens.co.uk if you&#x27;re interested in quant finance research&#x2F;development in central London."],"time":["2020-03-09 14:24:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dgb23"],"id":[22526428],"kids":{},"parent":[22525038],"text":["Fantastic article.

I think that&#x27;s even called out explicitly in the articles. But I&#x27;m left thinking &quot;what is the serialized structure of an AST?&quot; It&#x27;s source code. So we&#x27;ve implemented a language that then we have to use from within our code that is not as ergonomic as the host language.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s kind of like type-safe eval(), with the limited nature of the purpose-specific implementation creating a sandbox of types around the eval, i.e. the impl isn&#x27;t complete enough to give us turing completeness, File IO, or other things that would let the data turn into executable code that could escape the sandbox. So I&#x27;m curious to see if some wrappers around Roslyn[0] could get us less verbosity than Roslyn itself, a more complete impl that doesn&#x27;t have to be written for every application, and the sandboxing necessary to prevent it from being handing the user a fully-automatic submachine gun pointed at our database.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s something like a white-list for Roslyn structures. You could take a C# file, parse it with Roslyn, filter through the white-list, and either error-out if the user is doing something nefarious, or compile the structure and continue as normal. And then the code that we pass around as data could just be C# code, rather than having to have our own AST structures that we serialize on our own.<p>Maybe you could even allow limited forms of looping by injecting infinite-loop-breaking code that does some simple pre-&#x2F;post-condition checking.

I used to use regular RGB values (like #f2cdaa), but it&#x27;s hard to make features on the map &quot;a bit less blue&quot; without accidentally changing other properties. For example, changing #f2cdaa to #f2cd88 makes it less blue, but also darker.<p>So a few years ago I switched to using HSL in our stylesheets (and using the HSL tab in the Inkscape colour picker) which makes it easier to reason about the colour changes. But there&#x27;s still some problems with HSL, as the article describes. For example when choosing road colours, I often want to keep the saturation and lightness the same, but when I make minor roads yellow the change in hue really changes the perceived brightness in HSL.<p>So HSLuv is great for what I do, since I know that if I get the brightness and saturation of the roads the way I want, I can mess around with the hue without any side effects. Or if I like the colour of the forests but want them slightly less saturated, again no side effects when I make changes.<p>The big drawback is that there aren&#x27;t many colour pickers available in HSLuv, mainly just the one on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsluv.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsluv.org&#x2F;<\/a> .

Some unrelated code was storing these colors in the cloud using hex format, and clients would sync these colors back and forth with the cloud.<p>Usually, everything worked great. I had no problems, however a couple of users started emailing to complain that their colors had ‘disappeared’! As in - the stored colors had become transparent. I spent at least a few hours auditing syncing code, but found nothing.<p>A few weeks later I stumbled on the issue by chance: if you select dark green (this specific color configuration only), the color would eventually become transparent.<p>The thing is - some platforms (e.g. iOS) support wide color, which use RGB values outside the 0 to 1 range. Green would go through the CIELAB brightness conversion, and come out with a negative number for one of the RGB values. This is OK, until you convert it to hex and send it to the cloud for syncing... naive color -&gt; hex conversion will freak out with negative numbers. This got sent to the cloud, and later on, the cloud would send this back to the client, which would use it as a source of truth (and so dark green colors would disappear).<p>The fix was to write a less naive hex converter.

They&#x27;re not doing this for the community, for web standards, or the greater good. They&#x27;re making this format simply to save some bandwidth for themselves, in a way that won&#x27;t translate to the general community. The second picture in the linked blog article is literally a diagram of this garden. (Titled: <i>&quot;Compressed image assets destined for various client devices...&quot;<\/i>)<p>I had a similar comment about the JPEG XL format (mostly developed by Google) and the CSS &quot;Display P3&quot; colour space extension (Apple), both recently featured on YCombinator. These mega-corporations are building an ecosystem where in 2020, <i>the future<\/i>, it&#x27;s impossible to send a wide-gamut, 10-bit, or HDR still image to anyone via any of the following: web standards, chat, email, or document exchange formats. The best you can do is send an 8-bit SDR sRGB image and hope for the best. PC monitors, tablets, and most phones have no <i>consistent<\/i> support for colour management, 10-bit, or HDR. Televisions are leaving the entire PC <i>and<\/i> Mobile ecosystem in the dust. The closest approximation we PC peasants have is to upload a HDR YouTube video, send a link to it, and hope the viewer uses an newish iPhone. That&#x27;s just sad, isn&#x27;t it?<p>The stewardship of web standards by Microsoft (#2 biggest company), Apple (#3), and Alphabet Group (#4) have led to this. Now Netflix (#50) wants to throw their unnecessary format into the fray, almost completely ignoring the presence of JPEG XL and HEIC. They mention these alternatives in passing, and then notably don&#x27;t compare image quality, features, or the compression ratio of those to their own format. You see, JXL is a <i>Google&#x27;s thing<\/i>, HEIC is an <i>Apple thing<\/i>, and AVIF is a <i>Netflix thing<\/i>. So we&#x27;re going to end up with as many image formats as there are walled gardens.

He was trying to convince everyone that they could move from MS Windows to GNU&#x2F;Linux and that the available desktop software was pretty decent.<p>The only catch is that he used KDE2 and all the &quot;cool&quot; desktop apps he was showing were built on QT, like a good pupil I always tried to pair up an equivalent GTK option to every QT app my teacher showed to the class.<p>That worked well for everything: Music Players, Photo Viewers, etc.<p>One day he showed Yakuake (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kde.org&#x2F;applications&#x2F;system&#x2F;org.kde.yakuake\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kde.org&#x2F;applications&#x2F;system&#x2F;org.kde.yakuake<\/a>) to the class and everyone went bananas, this was such an amazing tool.<p>But then I did not have a good alternative for GTK if I wanted to press F12 to get a drop-down terminal I&#x27;d have to install libqt on my Debian?\nNo way!<p>I set out to write an equivalent of Yakuake for GTK+ (hence the name Guake, with &quot;G&quot; for GTK), at the time I did not know exactly how D-Bus worked and had no idea of how to write Python extensions in C.<p>The very first working version of Guake was a Gnome Applet that used GTK bindings to libvte to make a terminal always available.\nWas still not good enough for me.<p>The next step was to write a regular GTK Window application and try to make it disappear, but I was having a lot of trouble binding F12 globally, it only worked well on Metacity which was the default window manager for GNOME2 at the time.<p>Guake&#x27;s user experience was not great, it only worked well on Metacity but was good enough for me to show to my teacher, I was so excited I was able to create my very first GPL software and publish on source forge. I was ahead of everyone in my class at the time, I was learning on my own the things that would be taught only in the next semester and many things that we would never learn in class (such as  Python programming).<p>Some months go by and Guake-Gnome-VTE (the original name) gets some visibility, and this guy Lincoln de Sousa reaches out to me, he told me he had fixed the global keybinding problem by writing a Python extension in C, also he refactored the whole code and even applied GNOME Human Interface Guidelines to it.<p>It sounded great to me, I was so excited that someone else was interested in Guake, and made improvements to it, I was in awe with open source.<p>Except for one thing: Lincoln rewrote a lot of things that were working, just for the sake of cleaning up the Python code the aesthetics of it (actually he was applying PEP8 which I had no idea what was before this)<p>I had these mixed feelings: in one Guake had become what I wanted it to be, the global keybinding worked anywhere, the UI looked even better and the code was a lot easier to understand.<p>On the other a lot of the code I had written was deleted, I was not a skilled python developer when I wrote the first version of Guake, so I had spent several hours reading, coding and trying things out.<p>Anyways, the whole thing was a win-win, yay open source, now Guake had 2 maintainers putting a lot of time and love into it.<p>After some time Lincoln proposed that we moved the code off of Sourceforge to a git repository, self-hosted (we had a very &quot;purist&quot; mentality regarding FOSS and were terrified of having our code hosted by a proprietary software such as Github), he had way more experience than me on pretty much everything and he took reins: the code was hosted in one of his servers and all I did was pay for the domain.<p>In retrospect, I wish I had just pushed the code to Github at the time, so no the commit history would be lost.\nThe irony in having a purist FOSS mentality: the code was hosted on a server that I eventually lost access to.<p>Also, instead of importing all the commit history from Sourceforge we just pushed the code to git.<p>You can look at the first commits on github:<p>commit 4f4ab35d5cb2363dd464e6b252d1c798bd01c2fb\nAuthor: Lincoln de Sousa &lt;lincoln@minaslivre.org&gt;\nDate:   Sat Oct 6 13:56:50 2007 -0300<p><pre><code>    patch came from svn\n<\/code><\/pre>\ncommit 8973af85108c889f7dc16af2d8443d0f8ff3ec05\nAuthor: guake_root &lt;guake_root&gt;\nDate:   Wed Aug 1 02:35:20 2007 +0000<p>The &quot;guake_root&quot; commit swallowed all the history of the original code I had done.<p>In 2008 I moved out of my city to work for a big corporation in Rio de Janeiro, there my FOSS purism slowly evolved into tolerance for proprietary software, eventually, I even got an iPhone and a MacBook.<p>That&#x27;s when I stopped contributing to Guake: I had moved to MacOSX and the project had been taken over by other maintainers.\nBut even the icon is still the one I design on Inkscape, Guake was my first open-source software, I put a lot of time and love into it.<p>Today 14 years later I seldom use Guake because I seldom use a Linux Desktop, but I must confess that seeing my original authorship vanish from the project is very sad."],"time":["2020-03-09 12:32:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bigiain"],"id":[22524381],"kids":[22524998,22524468,22527150,22524996,22530788],"parent":[22523814],"text":["Interestingly (to me at least), I was just reading he memcached website (from another HN submission), and even though it&#x27;s been completely rewritten in a different language, they still credit Brad Fitzpatrick as the original author.<p>No reason not to.

That&#x27;s for a pretty obvious reason which is that it is very hard to secretly charge people money and very easy to secretly open an account for them which then goes unused.<p>Essentially, WF did not really profit from this, it was the employees and officers who were fleecing the company and fraudulently opening accounts to do so.<p>Branch employees were incentivised to sell products like accounts and cards to customers on the theory that WF profited from such sales. Compensation for the employees was set based on an assumed &#x2F; historical profit per cross-sold product. Senior management had incentive packages that were also based on that assumed link. But of course that was calibrated based on real accounts. Shadow accounts that are setup but not used by the customer (because they don&#x27;t know they exist) do not and cannot produce profit for the bank. What the bank would have seen over time was number of products sold going up but profit per product going down. Since the former is a leading and the latter a lagging indicator, it can be a long time before that becomes apparent.<p>From the point of view of WF, this was the dumbest possible fraud because it didn&#x27;t make them money.

I built my whole company around this idea [0], so I&#x27;m definitely biased.<p>I know that many might disagree with me on this, but shattering copyright is not going to do us, the society, any favors. If you, as I, believe that automation is going exceedingly take over more of our responsibilities, IP (intellectual property) [read creativity] is the only thing left to us as humans. While many believe copyright is about extortion of money, I believe it&#x27;s about proper attribution. This is the founding principle behind Creative Commons which believes that credits needs to be given to the creators. If they choose to make money of their creation, that&#x27;s their right and should be followed.<p>I do believe that with transparent rules and removed ambiguity the UGC market will thrive beyond what we seen so far. You can see glimpses of what&#x27;s possible through platforms like TikTok or Triller that do acquire licenses and are in process of paying creators portion of the revenue. This was one of the most important innovations of YouTube that spurred a whole new market and paved the way for many new platforms.<p>Imagine that you, as a creator, could know instantly which content of other people can you use under what conditions. If you disagree with them, you just don&#x27;t use it and choose something else. Especially in music, this gives you a freedom of selection. There is 80M songs. There will be always enough to choose from, even if the major righpshodlers would withhold their catalogues.<p>I believe that if the rules are know, are stable and unambiguous, then the market will be much stronger and healthier for everyone.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pex.com&#x2F;attribution-engine&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pex.com&#x2F;attribution-engine&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-04 20:19:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["IronWolve"],"id":[24377164],"kids":{},"parent":[24371349],"text":["My favorite is when reporters are out in the field reporting and someone drives by with their car radio on, and the entire clip gets taken down due to copyright.<p>Streamers listening to music is a common thing while talking, gaming, etc.  Something needs to change."],"time":["2020-09-04 19:44:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cronix"],"id":[24375388],"kids":{},"parent":[24371349],"text":["This will be a huge problem for people on the ground reporting on news events like protests&#x2F;riots.

Whenever I see a new company&#x27;s&#x2F;project&#x27;s runtime, I have come to expect a massively overcomplicated system that is &quot;built to scale&quot;. But ends up costing a lot and taking way too much time from product-development. A real issue with this is that when looking at the project&#x27;s feasibility to actually do scale, the runtime-cost will be estimated to a multiple of the current runtime cost which will appear larger than if the systems were built to handle the current load.<p>2. To me, this seems like a failure of cloud computing, which has a very compelling promise of letting you start with small servers, then easily switch up to bigger servers when needed. This was, in fact, hard before cloud.<p>3. The biggest issue I have with overspeced and overly complex deployments, is that to me it appears like (novice) developers is led to believe that they have to do the job in a complicated way. Look at a typical tutorial from the big and trend-setting players  how something should be deployed. The first hit on my favourite search engine for a &quot;Hashicorp Vault deployment&quot; [1] recommends using nine hosts. I know from experience that it runs fine on ONE host of the smallest kind I could find for our non-trivial use-case.

Having to write specifications in test crates rather than next to the function definitions is probably going to be a big obstacle to multi-crate verification.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viperproject&#x2F;prusti-dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viperproject&#x2F;prusti-dev&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-04 12:47:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kybernetikos"],"id":[24373928],"kids":[24374313],"parent":[24372760],"text":["This article makes me think that we should consider tests as a monte-carlo integration over the space that verification tries to cover."],"time":["2020-09-04 13:19:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sn9"],"id":[24377165],"kids":[24378158,24377690],"parent":[24372760],"text":["This looks super cool!<p>I was under the impression that burntsushi&#x27;s implementation of quickcheck [0] was the most popular property-based testing library for Rust.

All 12 pitches of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music without emphasis on any specific note.

Just sharing some bits about my experience, this is just my experience and doesn&#x27;t reflect official Policy.)<p>Prior to working at Amazon, I had mostly worked for start-ups. The thing I found at startup is that people are trying to figure out processes, and it&#x27;s kind of hard. Most people putting in a process (whether that&#x27;s HR or the founding team) are trying to do their best, but start-ups aren&#x27;t at a large enough scale where they really need to have scalable processes, and for individual contributors all the distinctions are pretty informal anyway, so there&#x27;s usually no individual contributor promotion path.<p>At Amazon, I was fortunate to work under someone who had been my boss previously, and we had a good working relationship. He was not afraid to give me blunt, useful feedback about either my work or how my work was perceived.<p>At some of the start-ups I worked with, part of the year-end evaluation involved filling out a form with a lot of evaluation criteria - the employee would fill out a self-eval form, and the manager would fill out a form, and then they would compare during the evaluation meeting. There&#x27;s no such equivalent at Amazon.<p>One thing that overall I like about Amazon&#x27;s performance management in terms of promotions is how it&#x27;s centered around a document that you and your manager write together. There are some tedious aspects to the process, but if nothing else when you go up for promotion you know what your manager is officially telling other people are your strengths and weaknesses. The flip side of the process is that decisions about your promotion are being made based sometimes on the quality of your promo doc. I&#x27;m not sure about all the company, but at least in the team I was on some of the senior folks set aside time for reviewing promo docs that they were working on with other members of the team to iron out any &quot;doc writing&quot; issues.<p>We don&#x27;t really have an official OKR system, but as a more senior engineer my personal goal has generally been to enable whatever my team&#x27;s goal is for the quarter or year (launch this product; get this architecture document done; research how to solve this problem).<p>Besides the official process, I&#x27;ve also found it useful to ask trusted peers how I&#x27;m doing, whether I&#x27;m giving them everything they need and expect of me.

With every round try and understand signal vs noise. That&#x27;s how you build trust.<p>Consistency is key. A few learnings regardless of the system that I learnt the hard way:<p>* Communication. You need to communicate before, during and after the process. You need to make it relatable for all levels of employees. Give them specific templates with specific examples. You need to remove the narrative of you-vs-them, doing-this-to-justify-an-increase, and bring focus on reflection.<p>* Frequency&#x2F;Cycle. &quot;if it hurts, do it more often&quot; is the quote that applies to this. Never let it slide. Minimum every six months, ideally every quarter.<p>* Review of KPIs. You need to review the KPIs every week without fail. It forces you to focus on metrics that you can move on a week-on-week basis. Anything that changes in step function over a month&#x2F;quarter&#x2F;year can be broken into a smaller metric.<p>*  Rewards and Recognitions. We were always late on this. Always rolling out the red carpet when someone threatened to quit. It always felt like extortion as the manager. Don&#x27;t wait for the cycle to call out extreme performance (great and terrible). Give negative feedback in private as quickly as possible. Do a non-monetary (Amazon Gift Coupons etc) for great performance. Wait for promotions and compensation.<p>* Pay performance linked pay well. I think this was what I got wrong the most. I did not plan the company finances well enough to pay out immediately. I would say &quot;Hey great performance! We will pay you $$ but in 2-3 months when our situation improves&quot;. That erodes trust in a moment.<p>* Getting and acting on feedback.

I&#x27;ll explain my philosophy behind performance levels and goals.  I&#x27;d love any feedback.  I&#x27;m specifically trying to make this an actionable process.<p>First, the levels, because I perhaps have a different interpretation of these than I&#x27;m used to seeing.  There are essentially three levels that correspond to performance compared to expectations.  So underperforming, performing, and overperforming.  Only underperforming carries a negative connotation [0], because it means that you are not meeting the expectations for your level.  In contrast, overperforming means that you are reaching beyond your current level.<p>So, hopefully we have zero people underperforming.  Also, hopefully we have the vast majority of people performing.  Because overperforming basically means we need to be finding an expanded role for that person, which we may or may not have.  If too many people are overperforming, then we can maybe expect turf wars as people start trying to expand their role without guidance, which is terrible for morale.  Hopefully we can balance overperformers with growth, so we are moving people to expanded roles and then filling in below with new hires.<p>So, given this leveling, there are two types of goals:  baseline and growth.  Baseline goals apply to the entire team and define those baseline expectations for that team.  Meeting these goals will keep the team out of underperforming territory [1].  Growth goals are tailored to a specific individual, and detail specific targets to work on.  The idea is to provide meaningful growth to the person and their capabilities, with an eye towards expanding their role.  Over time, having and meeting these growth goals will result in overperforming as the individual fills that expanded role more and more.<p>[0] Caveat:  I would expect a junior-level to be growing.  So juniors who are not overperforming are worrisome.<p>[1] There&#x27;s a bit of issue here in team vs individuals.  Generally, as long as the team is successful, I tend to err on the side of overrating individuals.  After all, part of the reason we make teams is to allow them to shore up weaknesses and play to strengths.  However, I leave in an out by having a baseline goal centered on teamwork and team success.  So if someone is not contributing as expected to the team, there&#x27;s something to call them out on."],"time":["2020-09-04 18:33:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["underwater"],"id":[24381301],"kids":{},"parent":[24374347],"text":["I&#x27;m surprised at the references to OKRs as a part of performance reviews.
