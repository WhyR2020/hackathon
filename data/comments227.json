This can seem impossible: many people will feel like they can&#x27;t even get to parallel, let alone ass to ground. My favored solution to this is adding elevation to the heels. A plank or two can add an inch or more to heel height. This gives your foot the support it needs in a squat and helps form good habits. When you rise from the squat, most of the force should be being applied through the heel. Over time you will decrease the heel elevation.<p>2) Body weight distribution can add to the difficulty of it if you&#x27;re &quot;back heavy.&quot; For my body fat distribution, losing weight enabled me to balance over my heels, while before I would fall backwards.<p>3) Practice every day, even if it&#x27;s just a set or two of squats.<p>4) Hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion are the key components to a squat. I find the former easier to improve than the latter. The supplementary exercises I&#x27;ve found most useful are Cossack squats, horse stance, and training my pancake split. For the pancake, you want all the folding to come from the hips and not from the lower or upper back.

The end lasted a month and largely consisted in its last days of a slow withering of conscious reasoning and awareness. How exactly would something like that square with the notion of consciousness suddenly jumping to the QI state in which it simply &quot;persists&quot;? An argument around this was already made by Max Tegmark, who suggested that the flaw in that reasoning is that dying is not a binary event. Instead it is very often a progressive degeneration, with a continuum of states of steadily decreasing consciousness. In other words, in most real causes of death (and this squares with my experience), one experiences such a gradual loss of self-awareness that an observer defies all odds only within the confines of a very abstract scenario.<p>Furthermore, the obvious: QI does not at all save us from the loss of loved ones who do die in our quantum branch. Even if it were true, and each individual continues to perceive consciousness in a sort of immortal state of constantly branching awareness, we objectively know that we see these people die forever in our perception, with no allowance that I know of for a reunion in the future. Thus, its ultimate outcome if you follow this logic is deeply tragic: We keep living, seeing those we love die to our perception, while these same loved ones go through the same process, even if in some other branch other versions of both get to see said loved ones continue to live for a certain time longer."],"time":["2020-01-15 05:16:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marcofiset"],"id":[22048455],"kids":[22048486],"parent":[22048086],"text":["I&#x27;ve been obsessed with QI ever since I first heard about it.

Lots of small consumers drive consumption towards a heck of a big number. Coal is the obvious answer as far as the Chinese are concerned because it provides a cost efficient way of scaling energy production to cater to 18.1% of the World&#x27;s population.<p>Moreover, China isn&#x27;t a particular rich country if you simplify things and use GDP per capita as a metric. Most of the people are relatively poor by Western standards, so their footprint in terms of how they live and consume isn&#x27;t anywhere near what it is in Europe or North America.<p>You&#x27;d see the exact same dynamic at play in India.<p>As far as China and India are concerned, they will keep preferring coal unless clean solutions that could cater to the same vast demands become equally or more cost effective and scalable such that they can easily replace coal.<p>Then there&#x27;s the U.S. with only 4.24% of the world&#x27;s population, it manages to end up in the top-3 of most polluting countries, right after China and before India. Moreover, an American seems to have emitted twice the amount of CO2 as a Chinese person did in 2017. And finally, Americans are part of the top 10 richest individuals in the world if you look at GDP per capita.<p>Here you&#x27;re looking at a different problem: individual consumption rather then total population. Whereas China and India can&#x27;t readily reduce energy consumption because of their large population, the U.S. can easily reduce it&#x27;s huge dependency on energy if individual consumption can be radically reduced.<p>The big hurdle here is that the biggest consumers of energy are those that fear they will have the most to lose: quality of life through existing conveniences and affordances that they feel will go away because they aren&#x27;t sustainable. At this point, the whole debate often turns emotional and ends up in yak shaving or bike shedding.<p>The only other pathway for the U.S is similar to China and India: find a cost effective clean source of energy that can easily replace fossil fuels such as coal.<p>I would put this moral conundrum in front of you: If drastically cutting back emissions through a better management of personal consumption is clearly within your power and can be achieved today; then why refrain from doing so and passing on the responsibility to energy producers?<p>This doesn&#x27;t just apply to the U.S. but to any country with significant CO2 emissions per capita, but it needs to be pointed out that countries with a small fraction of the global population with a high CO2 emission number per capita are those that can and will have the biggest impact on the problem, which contrasts seriously with countries in the opposite situation.<p>Of course, I understand that my whole expose ignores many, many other complexities that affect the balances such as global emission trade, global transportation and global trade (import&#x2F;export).<p>My main point was to demonstrate why seemingly irrational decisions elsewhere in the world - such as investing in even more coal-based power plants - are driven by very different regional economics; and that battle cries such as &quot;reduce carbon dependency&quot; are blanket statements you can&#x27;t impose everywhere in the world without adjusting it&#x27;s meaning to the local or regional context."],"time":["2020-01-15 16:47:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["azernik"],"id":[22054789],"kids":[22054802,22054923,22055090,22054998,22054929,22055320],"parent":[22054417],"text":["The headline is based off of a big assumption: that the Tesla cannot be charged off of home power, but instead has to always be charged at a supercharger at about double the average residential electricity rate.<p>&gt; First of all, this article deals with the large group of people who don’t have any ability to charge at home.

Here&#x27;s how:<p>To start with, you need to understand a little bit about how curve cryptography works. A curve point is simply the solution to an equation like<p><pre><code>    y^2 = x^3 + ax + b mod p\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe &quot;curve&quot; itself consists of the parameters a, b, and p; for instance, in P-256, a is -3, b is (ee35 3fca 5428 a930 0d4a ba75 4a44 c00f dfec 0c9a e4b1 a180 3075 ed96 7b7b b73f), and p is 2^256 - 2^224 + 2^192 + 2^96 - 1.<p>To use that curve for cryptography, we standardize a base point G, which generates all the points we&#x27;ll use. A private key in ECC is simply a scalar number k mod p; the public key corresponding to that private key is kG (the curve scalar multiplication of the point G times our secret k). Everybody using P-256 uses the same base point; it&#x27;s part of the standard.<p>Assume that we have a signature validator in CryptoAPI that allows us to specify our own nonstandard base point. We&#x27;re ready to specify the attack; it&#x27;s just algebra:<p>Let&#x27;s call Q the public key corresponding to the signature; for instance, Q could be the ECC public key corresponding to an intermediate CA.<p>Q is a point on a named curve (like P-256). Q = xG for some private key x; we don&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t ever, know x. G is the standard generator point for (say) P-256.<p>What we&#x27;ll do is define a &quot;new curve&quot;, which is exactly P-256, but with a new generator point. We&#x27;ll generate our own random private key --- call it x&#x27; --- and then from that random private key compute a malicious generator G&#x27; = (1&#x2F;x&#x27;)*Q.<p>On our &quot;new curve&quot;, Q remains a valid point (in fact, our evil curve is the same curve as P-256, just with a different generator), but now Q&#x27; = x&#x27;G&#x27;, and we know x&#x27;.<p>Now we sign a fake EE certificate with our evil private key x&#x27;. Presumably, Windows is just looking at the public key value and, reading between the lines of the DoD advisory, the curve equation, but not the base point. By swapping base points, we&#x27;ve tricked Windows into believing the private key corresponding to Q is x&#x27;, a key we know, and not x, the key we don&#x27;t know.<p>I&#x27;m paraphrasing a shorter writeup Pornin provided, and the basic curve explanation is mine and not his, so if I&#x27;ve worded any of this poorly, blame me and not Thomas Pornin. The actual exploit-development details of the attack will involve figuring out in what circumstances attackers can swap in their own base point; you&#x27;d hope that the actual details of the attack are subtle and clever, and not as simple as &quot;anyone could have specified their own base point straightforwardly at any time&quot;.<p>See also this related exercise in Sean Devlin&#x27;s Cryptopals Set 8:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toadstyle.org&#x2F;cryptopals&#x2F;61.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toadstyle.org&#x2F;cryptopals&#x2F;61.txt<\/a><p>This attack --- related but not identical to what we suspect today&#x27;s announcement is --- broke an earlier version of ACME (the LetsEncrypt protocol)."],"time":["2020-01-14 20:56:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Uptrenda"],"id":[22048137],"kids":[22048164,22048508,22048928,22048549,22048266,22048465,22050171,22049469,22050743],"parent":[22047573],"text":["None of these links describe how the exploit works.<p>I found this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Jan&#x2F;14&#x2F;2002234275&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;CSA-WINDOWS-10-CRYPT-LIB-20190114.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Jan&#x2F;14&#x2F;2002234275&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;CSA...<\/a><p>So based on my limited understanding:<p>1.

The traits of a good engineer would roughly be the same across companies and would be ranked according to knowledge, work experience and quality of code etc. And since a software engineer reports to an engineering manager, expectations are also based on the views of one person.<p>Upper management in different companies would have different expectations from what an engineering manager should be. Some would want them to code, some wouldn&#x27;t. Some would want them to utilize developers as much as possible while some would want them to keep work life balance of developers in mind. \nSame with teams. A much younger team would have vastly different views on what a good manager is compared to a team which is filled up of more senior people. A younger team might want the EM to be more hands-on while a senior team would want more autonomy. \nThen you also have HR and feedback from various teams to deal with. Company culture and popular managers would also drive some of the traits of an engineering manager.<p>Having been an EM for multiple teams I&#x27;ve had to change my management style multiple times to better suit change in higher management and different teams.

SQL hasn&#x27;t changed, so that&#x27;s the bit he&#x27;s drawn to when he feels like he needs to roll up his sleeves and contribute.<p>2.)He has some form of attention deficit, demonstrated by the fact that he can&#x27;t hold down a conversation really well.  Especially if it gets technical.<p>3.)He really overplays the busy body persona.  Always checking phone, always late for a meeting.<p>4.)He&#x27;s really insecure in his position within the company, always fearful that he&#x27;s going to be cut loose.  This is extremely amplified when he gets a new manager himself.<p>5.)He has very little influence over direction.  He&#x27;s really just a proxy mouthpiece for higher level management. And he loves to have status update meetings where he informs the team of all the important updates he received in the big important meeting he attended with other big important people.<p>6.)Instead of being someone who is respected by the team, he becomes more of someone you have sympathy for.<p>7.)You wonder why he never asks the real questions, like &quot;are you happy with your role?&quot;.  And you realize it&#x27;s because he doesn&#x27;t really want to hear the answer.  He couldn&#x27;t really do anything about it anyway.  See point #5.<p>8.) He&#x27;s way too preoccupied worrying about his own safety to nurture the team.<p>9.) As a developer, you have the safety net of knowing that in the worst case scenario (terminated) you could find another job fairly quickly with pay parody.  As a manager, you don&#x27;t have that comfort blanket.  So you cling on to your current job no matter how badly you are abused.  And people lose more respect for you because you look pathetic without a backbone.<p>10.) As a cynical developer in his 40&#x27;s, you realize that you don&#x27;t observe many 50+ developers in the wild, and you bemoan the idea that you&#x27;re going to have to suck it up and play manager eventually.<p>Anxiety and existential crisis is built into the tech career trajectory, and I feel like the only winning strategy is to be ok with moving backward income wise at various points in your timeline."],"time":["2020-01-14 17:06:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jonaldomo"],"id":[22045848],"kids":{},"parent":[22033129],"text":["Hey I made an app to help me be a better engineering manager, I’d love your opinion on it if you had some time.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;team-lead&#x2F;id1466421445?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;team-lead&#x2F;id1466421445?mt=8<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=co.jmoses.manus.play\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=co.jmoses.manu...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-14 16:48:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cr0sh"],"id":[22046902],"kids":[22048422],"parent":[22033129],"text":["&gt; If anyone&#x27;s at all interested in learning about what it&#x27;s like to pitch a publisher with their own book idea, then I guess I&#x27;ve been successful at that now, so I&#x27;m more than happy to give you any advice.<p>Maybe this needs to be a new book?<p>Seriously, all of this sounds wonderful - and thank you (but I would love to hear some tips on getting a book published from zero - I certainly write enough that I could probably fill a book, whether anyone would read it though...???)."],"time":["2020-01-14 18:19:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["artsyca"],"id":[22043931],"kids":[22043935],"parent":[22033129],"text":["Make sure to buy two copies so you can read it twice as fast"],"time":["2020-01-14 12:53:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mnsc"],"id":[22044921],"kids":[22045269,22045099],"parent":[22033129],"text":["This looks interesting.

Those who create value and those who capture value.\nMost people are on a spectrum but will lean more towards one group or the other but there are people who are more on the extreme ends of the spectrum.<p>- People who are fully focused on capturing value have a tendency to take everything very seriously; they are often pessimistic and will find problems in the smallest things (even trivial aspects of their daily lives) and blow them out of proportion. They don&#x27;t tolerate external criticism well. They are more likely to have fits of anger. They may have narcisistic tendencies and may lack empathy and are prone to hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance. They tend to focus exclusively on social politics for self-enrichment and don&#x27;t spend any time thinking about the well-being of society. They believe that personal interest is the only force which drives value creation in society. They see value creators as sheep who need a shepherd to guide them to the right path. They are unable to distinguish value capturing from value creation; to them, they are the same concept.<p>- People who are fully focused on creating value have a tendency to not take anything too seriously; they tend to be optimistic and may shrug off problems altogether, they rarely get angry and they appreciate criticism. They are calm, altruistic and highly self-aware. They believe that altruism is the main force driving value creation in society. They may see value capturers as parasites on the system which exploit value creators to force them towards arbitrary directions which allow value capturers to claim credit and amass profits for themselves. Value creators see a very big difference between value creation and value capturing and their ability to see the difference means less cognitive dissonance, less hypocrisy and more emotional stability.<p>The other thing I learned is that our fiat monetary system benefits value capturers at the expense of value producers. Since fiat was introduced, through natural selection, humans have been getting worse at creating value and better at capturing it. Value capturers are better at figuring out where to place themselves in order to capture all the new fiat money that is constantly entering the system. This is why there are so many monopolies now.<p>We used to have a system which benefited balanced individuals, but the current system benefits extremist value capturers."],"time":["2020-01-14 14:24:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brohee"],"id":[22043746],"kids":{},"parent":[22018946],"text":["Our infrastructures are incredibly fragile, and the world is only holding because no one competent is trying to shut it down."],"time":["2020-01-14 12:18:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bonestamp2"],"id":[22049680],"kids":{},"parent":[22018946],"text":["The best coworker I ever had taught me this.

It&#x27;s almost besides the point, which is why junior associates and analysts get the most face time and source a lot of deals.<p>2. Venture Capital isn&#x27;t a meritocracy, it&#x27;s not fair, and it sure as hell isn&#x27;t a competition.

While angel investors are well advised to try picking potential unicorns or decacorns, VC funds most often don&#x27;t. The reason the internet thinks this is that the biggest funds spend the most money on PR, because they have the biggest budgets, because management fees scale with fund size. These big funds invest later and need the biggest valuations to make money. There are many models a fund can operate on, and in fact most institutional limited partners will allocate capital to a number of funds with different models and strategies. To be a successful VC, you don&#x27;t need to pick the next Uber,  you need to pick a model, strategy, market focus, or technological thesis that fits within the broader strategy of your LPs and isn&#x27;t a duplicate of their existing LP allocations.<p>4. If you invest in a founder, the total percentage of your interactions with them that include startup pitching will trend towards zero. Most experienced VCs will give your formal pitch less weight than the sum of their other interactions with you. The reason formal pitches are so important is because the investment committee (which tends to vote on and discuss investments at length) is mostly made up of people who haven&#x27;t had much interaction with you.

So the more cutting edge you are, then the more you feel out of place and suffer if you&#x27;re not profiting from your knowledge.

So again, even if you know a better way to do something, most likely you will get reprimanded for it where you work.<p>- As you acquire more programming knowledge, you eventually reach a point where new hires can&#x27;t read what you are writing. This comes down to the simple vs easy dichotomy. Again, being an outlier won&#x27;t help you in a corporate environment, and even if you find a smaller agency that&#x27;s willing to take a risk on you, their generosity will eventually come to an end and you&#x27;ll be on your own again.<p>And the biggest one of all:<p>- Programming careers usually end by 40. There may come a point where even though the money is good, you don&#x27;t believe in what you&#x27;re doing anymore. If you don&#x27;t make the jump to management, be prepared to start over in another field.<p>The root causes of all of this are wealth inequality and the underemployment which causes it.

You&#x27;ve been told they are important, but you may not realize how true that was.  People like to make a decision about a person and it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to change it once that happens, especially when that impression&#x2F;decision was also shares among others.  If you start a new job and do really well at the onset and everyone thinks highly of you, it&#x27;s insanely hard to get rid of that even if you were to completely botch something.  You could come up with some reason and everyone is likely to assume that reason is true and needs to be addressed rather than the problem having been you.  Similarly, digging yourself out of a hole from a bad impression is perhaps even harder.<p>The value of hard work is also understated.  Most people do what they need to do and that&#x27;s it.  They also don&#x27;t really internalize the challenges the company faces.  If you take that one, you are far more likely to succeed in your job.  It&#x27;s not just about &quot;hard work&quot; but an entire mind set that most people simply don&#x27;t have.  If you have it, it seriously pays off.<p>Related to the previous point - working a bit longer also really pays off.  This is different but related to the previous point.  There is definitely a non-linear increase in earnings once your surpass the standard work hours.  Spend an extra 5-10 hours a week on your job or side project&#x2F;business pays off much more.<p>You can either work &quot;smart&quot; or work hard.  Technically, you can do both but hardly anyone does.  The few that do, however, are absolute rock stars.<p>No one checks anything.  Everyone just assumes everyone else is doing their job and doing it properly.  Even if checking things is part of someone else&#x27;s job, it&#x27;s usually done half-assed.  Actually verifying the important stuff (and sometimes the less-important stuff) opens up a world of potential where your business discovers all kinds of missed opportunities, incorrect work, etc.<p>Most people are bad at math.  And most people are also financially illiterate.  Which by extension makes a huge majority of people really, really terrible at personal finance and financial planning (for themselves or their business).  This also applies to a lot of smart and successful people.<p>Every organizational structure that human beings create yields towards tyranny&#x2F;abuse over time.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what you are talking about - government, business, anything.  Over time nearly everything somehow seems to become these oligopolistic style structures where there are a few hugely powerful entities and then everyone else.<p>Related to the previous point, far more things follow the pareto distribution than I could have imagined.  In fact it seems to apply to anything that either has any creative aspect to it at all or to non-creative endeavors if they have any sort of scalability to them.  There&#x27;s a small group of people that are so insanely efficient and productive that it&#x27;s almost impossible to comprehend.  For example, I used to work with a guy who was working full time with me and started his own side business which was an online SaaS that he paid someone to create for him after he wrote up all the requirements and he did all the testing.  While this was going on he also spent every free second trading cryptocurrencies and made a small fortune doing that.  When the product was ready he launched it and <i>manually<\/i> sought out retail (end consumer) clients one by one via things like Discord chat rooms where he would pump his software that was tailored to individuals.  He spoke to literally thousands and thousands of people and convinced them to sign up.  Then he had a recurring monthly revenue which dwarfed his (already high) salary so he quit to pursue it.  He continued to get clients and now has north of 15,000, most manually acquired.  He&#x27;s working on launching a sister product now.  It baffles me how he can even do like half of what he does.<p>In business, managers are very hesitant to grant permission but much more likely to grant forgiveness for not following procedure.  So in many cases it is usually better to just do whatever it is you think is best for the business and try to improves things however you can if the rules are (or will) prevent you.  The personal boost here is also that your manager also thinks your plate is fully loaded with whatever it is they&#x27;ve already assigned to you.  Then you shock them with this big thing you&#x27;ve also been working on and they&#x27;re shocked you were able to take that on.  Win&#x2F;win.<p>There was more that I had, but I forgot it while writing the rest above.

Zero added round trips.<p>Otherwise, it might be better if the server were able to indicate to clients what its matching rules were.

A good chance that you&#x27;re finding it comfortable but not stimulating.<p>&gt; <i>How do most people work out what’s the right path for them to take?<\/i><p>Most people don&#x27;t, and don&#x27;t believe the ones that say they knew in advance what the right decisions were. None of us can see clearly into our possible futures; we can&#x27;t see in advance the successes we&#x27;ll have or the mistakes we&#x27;ll make. The best we can do is to understand our motivations when we do make a decision, and then at least be at peace with that decision no matter how it turns out.<p>&gt; <i>Does it have to be either or can you do both things together—have a full-time job and do your own thing?<\/i><p>If you want to live a balanced life -- i.e., without all of your waking hours behind computer screens -- you should choose either&#x2F;or. Working full-time and trying to put real energy into a side project doesn&#x27;t leave much time for anything else, and it will cause both your full-time work and your side project to suffer.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that people never manage to pull this off. Some people make it work out. They are the exceptions that prove the rule.<p>&gt; <i>Looking back to the twenty-year-old me and the person I’ve now become, I see almost no similarities, interests, or passion. I was a completely different person back then and the only thing that has stuck with me after all these years is my love of soccer. How do people predict the future? Clearly, I’m no good at it.<\/i><p>Congratulations, you&#x27;re a normal, healthy person that&#x27;s still growing and maturing. Keep doing that.<p>&gt; <i>I wonder whether, as we grow older, the rate of change in our interests slows down too?<\/i><p>It hasn&#x27;t, for me, and I think I&#x27;m at least 10 years ahead of you.

Being a dilletante is a lot of fun while in your 20s and 30s. Some manage to have fun continuing to dabble in a bit of everything for many more years, even into very old age. Other folks start to feel like they might be missing out on something by just grazing the surface of their interests, and start to consider whether their time might be better spent focusing more intently on just a few.<p>&gt; <i>I imagine working on your own thing full time and on the side are definitely not the same; it’s scary, to be frank. If my side-project became my full-time work, might my passion for my project dwindle and become yet another job? How would it differ from my current job?<\/i><p>Your project <i>should<\/i> become your full time job. You should maintain the discipline you have in your current job and resist the urge to fritter time away here and there.<p>But it will be different, because you&#x27;ll be investing in your interest, and despite it becoming your job, you&#x27;ll still feel an ongoing sense of satisfaction at being solely responsible for your success or your failure. If you wake up one morning and have a great idea for your project, you won&#x27;t have to convince middle or upper management, or enlist a sales team, or wait until the next company all-hands. You&#x27;ll just do it.<p>And that can be really rewarding, and it can also be a great big trap you fall into, without anybody else holding you accountable or challenging whether your next idea is a good one or not."],"time":["2020-01-14 22:56:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j45"],"id":[22050269],"kids":{},"parent":[22048655],"text":["Doing your own thing often means working for clients which means working for someone ."],"time":["2020-01-15 00:24:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trumbitta2"],"id":[22052623],"kids":[22055996],"parent":[22048655],"text":["Being alone is easily fixed by a coworking space"],"time":["2020-01-15 09:38:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hownottowrite"],"id":[22049708],"kids":{},"parent":[22048655],"text":["Cached Version: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;vgHTv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;vgHTv<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-14 23:03:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cryptica"],"id":[22053041],"kids":{},"parent":[22048655],"text":["These days, you either work for a company as an employee, or you work for cartel as an entrepreneur."],"time":["2020-01-15 11:04:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cfontes"],"id":[22053293],"kids":{},"parent":[22048655],"text":["Why not both?"],"time":["2020-01-15 12:13:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["r34"],"id":[22052604],"kids":{},"parent":[22048655],"text":["I never use term &quot;working for someone&quot;.
