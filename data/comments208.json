The Polynesians developed some really clever nautical wayfinding techniques without instruments, or with rudimentary, imprecise, non-machined ones, that enabled them to reliably traverse the islands of the South Pacific, even to remote ones like Tahiti.  Lots of articles on &quot;Polynesian wayfinding&quot; across the web, and a great exhibition on it at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu in case you happen to be in the vicinity.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bishopmuseum.org&#x2F;?s=wayfind\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bishopmuseum.org&#x2F;?s=wayfind<\/a><p>Probably the best observation in the article, is the way theories can potentially become distorted the further away in time they are from their subject of study:<p><i>&gt;GAZETTE:  The book deals also with the flip side of that wondrousness, the Western skepticism that an “unsophisticated,” “primitive” people could manage this feat. What underlies Western skepticism? Was it also wonder at the distances involved? Or was it rooted in racism, in ignorance? Why not just take folks at their word when they say they did it?<p>THOMPSON:  There was a lot of skepticism, and I think that was basically rooted in a sense of Western superiority and classic colonialism and that set of attitudes. But one of the things that I think is misunderstood is that this was not a uniform view. There are periods, at the end of the 18th century and in the 19th century, when Europeans who were interested in this subject were actually not that skeptical at all of Polynesian voyaging capacity.<p>Some of the 19th-century figures I write about took for granted — completely — that Polynesians had been the greatest navigators ever. They were convinced that they had sailed these distances and they had gone back and forth repeatedly.<p>What I saw that sort of surprised me, because it ran contrary to the conventional wisdom, was a rise in skepticism in the 20th century. My interpretation is that this is because we’re actually moving away from understanding the people. We’re moving away in time from real contact with the islanders and a real understanding of what they were doing.<p>The earlier theorists of the 19th century had many bad ideas, but they did believe in Polynesian voyaging. And they were quite close to the people. They spoke the languages. They often married into these cultures. They were intimate with them. And they lived in a period before there was so much lost knowledge.

Before currency exchange was done via favors. Instead of countable coins, you contributed to your community and built up a reserve of &quot;honor&quot; or &quot;cred&quot; that you could use to call in favors when you needed any kind of help or support. It&#x27;s usually referred to as a &quot;gift economy,&quot; but people get thrown off by the term &quot;gift.&quot; It&#x27;s less about the stuff you give or do and more about the obligations you have as a member or friend of any given community.<p>The main thing to remember is that people just had a very different way of thinking about the exchange of goods and services back then. It wasn&#x27;t about financial transactions or maximizing economic returns, it was much more about building up cred and standing within a community.<p>Where financial transactions really come in is being able to facilitate exchange between two communities where that underlying foundation of trust and persistent social connection doesn&#x27;t exist. This is why marriages between &quot;clans&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot; or whatever would often be marked by exchange of things that hold value like livestock, heirlooms and handicrafts, or parcels of land. These aren&#x27;t really &quot;barter&quot; exchanges though, they&#x27;re more like collateral or shows of good will between two groups or people who don&#x27;t necessarily have a strong basis for trusting each other.<p>This is why coinage really starts to come around when you have large kingdoms or empires. Those rulers mint the coins because they control larger swathes of territory than could be governed by the sort-of-feudal interractions of familial obligation.

We estimate it to be between 3.6 and 4.0, indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing.<p>&gt; <U+25CF>    We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8–5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, indicating a large number of infections in the community, and also reflecting the difficulty in detecting cases of this new disease. Surveillance for this novel pathogen has been launched very quickly by public health authorities in China, allowing for rapid assessment of the speed of increase of cases in Wuhan and other areas.<p>&gt; <U+25CF>    If no change in control or transmission happens, then we expect further outbreaks to occur in other Chinese cities, and that infections will continue to be exported to international destinations at an increasing rate. In 14 days’ time (4 February 2020), our model predicts the number of infected people in Wuhan to be greater than 190 thousand (prediction interval, 132,751 to 273,649). We predict the cities with the largest outbreaks elsewhere in China to be Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu. We also predict that by 4 Feb 2020, the countries or special administrative regions at greatest risk of importing infections through air travel are Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea.<p>&gt; <U+25CF>    Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February.<p>&gt; <U+25CF>    There are important caveats to the reliability of our model predictions, based on the assumptions underpinning the model as well as the data used to fit the model. These should be considered when interpreting our findings.<p>Source:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;char_durand&#x2F;status&#x2F;1221997021663387649\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;char_durand&#x2F;status&#x2F;1221997021663387649<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-28 14:08:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrononaut"],"id":[22168692],"kids":[22168896,22168943,22168730],"parent":[22168451],"text":["One minor note is that the &quot;real time&quot; nature of this map is a bit deceiving at the moment, at least to me.

Sometimes, it’s just been mild and giggling at colors and nature. Pleasant, but just kind of a fun drug.<p>With a moderate dose, you tend to be introspective and consider your own life and relationships in different ways. There’s usually a lesson at the end.<p>With higher doses, it’s sometimes been just extremely confusing and not at all fun, to the extent that I’d forget my own name or what I’ve taken and basically just all memories. It’s very frustrating to be in that state, constantly trying not to fly away but not able to ground yourself. It’s a little disturbing, but not horrific. I think the reason for this is that I am afraid to lose my ego&#x2F;die and I would actually benefit from a slightly higher dose to blast it away...<p>With really high doses though, it’s been a truly beautiful, enlightening experience. I still think of it sometimes. It’s very difficult to really explain in words, but it feels like kind of extreme empathy with all life. Buddhists would call it going egoless. I just felt very at peace: we all live, we all die, and it’s all okay. I’m not particularly religious or spiritual at all but that experience really changed me. It feels like life is in all these different forms, and you just happen to be one variation of it, but you could easily be any other living thing, so you just feel love and empathy for all life. And you know it’s finite and you’re not afraid of death. I would still attempt to avoid death, but I was just at peace with it if it was inevitable. Also, when you come back to reality you’re utterly, utterly convinced that you’ve experienced something profound, possibly, despite all your rationality, there’s a message form god inside this mushroom. It’s almost like the mushroom is laughing at you: “good luck going back to your normal life now.”  You’re left with “wow? That was that?!”  It’s annoying honestly, because I’m not religious at all and I know it sounds crazy to even say that out loud. Of course, that feeling does slowly fade away like a distance dream or memory.<p>A great story it reminds me of is “The Egg” by Andy Weir:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.galactanet.com&#x2F;oneoff&#x2F;theegg_mod.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.galactanet.com&#x2F;oneoff&#x2F;theegg_mod.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-28 17:33:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["the-alchemist"],"id":[22174678],"kids":[22176488],"parent":[22170087],"text":["Some important details from the source:<p>- &quot;Eighty percent of the patients reported that their symptoms faded, and the effects lasted six months, the 2016 study found.

Follow up with outcome measures at week 24.<p>Crossovers are used to amplify your sample size IFF the effect of the drug is expected to be significantly shorter than the time period between administrations.<p>In this case, that’s not true: NO previous research suggests that the mood effects of shrooms last significantly &lt;4 weeks.

The starting point was noting that people who get a GED (on average) score just as well on IQ tests as those getting an ordinary HS diploma. However, their life outcomes tend to be much worse than those who got a HS diploma the ordinary way. Why?<p>The economist said that 150 years ago schools taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, but spent as much time on &quot;character building&quot; lessons: diligence, persistence, working well with others, etc, but that mostly was removed by the mid 20th century for a couple of reasons. One was that the character building exercises were cast in terms of Protestantism, and as the US became more diverse, there was a push against it. Second, psychology was in the thrall of things that could be machine scored like IQ tests and looked down on squishy character traits.<p>Anyway, although the GED students did as well on IQ tests, they did substantially worse than normal HS graduates when scored on those other personality skills (not traits, the economist said, since those things can be taught to a large degree).<p>In the mid 60s a controlled experiment was run where a preschool for impoverished kids were split into the treatment group and the control group. The treatment group&#x27;s teachers did non-standard stuff, eg, simply exposing the kids to the larger world by taking them on field trips to parts of the city they would never otherwise experience. They were read stories with those character building traits about fairness, persistence, etc. The teachers built relationships with the parents and emphasized how important the parent-child relationship was and not to expect that learning is simply the teacher&#x27;s job. They provided child care for single&#x2F;working mothers. This intervention lasted two years of preschool, so basically ages 3-5.<p>The kids were tested at age 10 and everyone was disappointed that there was no difference.  But the economist (and others) revisited the test subjects decades later and found there was a profound difference in outcomes. The treatment group attained higher levels of education, had better incomes, better health, and lower crime involvement. The children of the treatment group were substantially better off in those regards than those of the control group."],"time":["2020-01-28 23:33:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["clawedjird"],"id":[22180908],"kids":{},"parent":[22173254],"text":["In the US, conversations about poverty frequently appear to depict poverty as a <i>choice<\/i>, i.e. people bear moral responsibility for their poverty because their decisions ostensibly produced it.

I found it hard in the beginning because I&#x27;m still wearing my pajamas and my Xbox is right over there. Getting dressed and having a dedicated work space really helped get me into the mindset. If you don&#x27;t have space for a fully separate office, a separate desk or even separate tools can provide that little bit of mental differentiation. I have a work laptop and a personal laptop, and my work laptop has a keyboard and mouse that are only used for my work laptop.

This is where VoltDB pays a significant performance penalty for write operations when compared with Raft&#x2F;Paxos-powered distributed SQL databases. Distributed consensus protocols like Raft and Paxos require writes to be sent to all replicas but commit as soon as a majority of replicas have acknowledged the request. Waiting for all replicas to respond is not necessary since the consensus can be established with a majority. Additionally, VoltDB does not detect network partitions by default and requires a special network-fault-protection mode to be configured. When a node of the cluster gets partitioned, the network-fault-protection mode comes into play. It negatively impacts cluster performance by increasing cluster recovery time for not only accepting writes on the shards whose replica was lost in the node partition but also for repopulating the data on the partitioned node when it joins back the cluster.<p>Wow.

There are unhealthy plant based diets, and there are quite healthy omni diets. And --thanks BBC for pointing it out once again-- us plant eaters should be careful of some nutrients we may lack (as should omnis) AND some forms food we may over consume (as should omnis). Pretty much the only one that plant based eaters are more lacking in than omnis is B12. Otherwise plant eaters usually score overall BETTER than omnis, but sadly the BBC leaves this information out of this article (meat industry promo piece), gladly they published this kind of info in a separate article 5 DAYS EARLIER.[2]<p>There are a whole lot of diets within the plant based diet. A particularly healthy one, according to research, is the Whole Food Plant Based diet. And most MDs (which are quite a few) recommending this diet do underline the need for B12 supplementation (both in plant eaters and in omnis).<p>While this article come with a study of 555 Kenyan kids being given omni food scoring better than the group given plant food. Ok.<p>Let me show you this study:<p>&gt; In a large representative population study of more than 8000 British men and women, intelligence in childhood was associated with a vegetarian diet in mid-adulthood, and this was independent of educational attainment and social class.[3]<p>It&#x27;s bigger (n=8000), it in a developed nation (UK), it controls for all kinds of factors and concludes a correlation between intelligence and vegetarianism. No causation though. But I recon the 555 Kenya school children study also did not prove causation.<p>So? Why would the BBC publish such a piece? In clear contradiction to something they published 5 days earlier? An article that cherry picks to the point it&#x27;s sneakily suggestive? Every one may judge for themselves but I think it is paid&#x2F;compensated journalism, at a govt owned outlet.

In any such case when you need to write some logic such as &quot;retry to open the sockect connection&quot; or &quot;tell the user that the resource was not foudn&quot; or try to resolve DNS query again later the best method is to use some kind of error enum&#x2F;number&#x2F;code kind of system.

In my observations, it&#x27;s input capture, information organization, and subsequent retrieval:<p>Information Capture:<p>Input Capture - You’re going to have all-encompassing tracking and recording of all activity, but want configurable privacy on the extent to which you want your daily conversations and observations of external things you encounter and are exposed to. Capturing input needs to be holistic and incorporate all properties of encounters and new information.<p>Potential sources of input:<p>Vision — point of view recording, see snapchat spectacles, etc as primitive examples.\nAudio (voice notes and multi-party conversations) - voice calls, video, etc. and other forms of audio transmission where there is more than a single party in the interaction.\nDigital interactions\nYou will need to keep track of web pages you visit at what times\nConversations you see on Twitter, etc.<p>Properties and cues must be extrapolated from the information that is captured on input, in the case of audio, transcriptions are sufficient for transcription and retrieval purposes, however since video is a visual medium, it includes significantly more properties that need to be accounted for.<p>The aim here is to identify sufficient data points (cues) that are subsequently represented in such a way that they are easy to search across things you have encountered but only seem to recall a certain property or cue from. This is because of the fact that human beings tend to remember things in fragments, for instance, you might remember a certain color on a page that you visited within the last 6 months and nothing else.<p>So long as you are capturing sufficient input and actions then you should be able to go back to any given point in time. How and where are you going to store this information? Storing everything is going to be a large amount of data. The essence of the information and context must be preserved. If you want to wind back to an arbitrary position in time with the original context intact, you want to retain as much as you can in the most efficient manner possible, so determining which data points to retain is essential. (Once the content structure has been figured out, this will be viable).<p>Examples of Primary Cues:<p>Time - humans generally keep track of things in a linear time-based fashion.\nColor - invokes emotion and is memorable.\nPhysical Location -  the efficiency of information retrieval is highly influenced by the location at which it is originally synthesized, encountered, and stored.\nKeywords - the default conventional mode. Can and should be extracted from video&#x2F;imagery and audio.\nImagery -  search for images based on their contents and ambience.<p>Potential Secondary Cue — Music - see historical associated input and actions while certain music was played.\n(What else?)<p>Meta Cues — Subjects - Automated tagging of keywords&#x2F;encountered content.<p>Any combination of these queries is possible, but ultimately the killer feature is the ability to backtrack through time to find a certain piece of information that is made available thanks to the always-on recorded nature of your interactions with the physical and digital worlds combined.<p>Knowing what to store, and how, + displaying it needs to be worked on further."],"time":["2020-01-27 20:39:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["maurits"],"id":[22163260],"kids":{},"parent":[22160572],"text":["I&#x27;ve been pondering on building something like this for a while.<p>For now, I&#x27;ve settled on sphinx because it can be easily exported to dash, and tied in to an alfred workflow for search."],"time":["2020-01-27 21:06:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hvasilev"],"id":[22167994],"kids":{},"parent":[22160572],"text":["I use a vim plugin called vimwiki and I export my todos and notes into HTML.

(I guess you can spend $70 if you want the privilege of being able to plug in a conference room HDMI adapter, but not much else.)<p>I am also completely confused on how many of these multiport adapters work. One I purchased in the past required that I install drivers on my Mac. Others seem to not require that. Can I plug USB-C adapters into USB-C adapters, if say, I wanted to plug a USB-C to Ethernet adapter into my main USB-C multiport adapter? Does it depend on the adapters? Does any USB-C multiport adapter that has a female USB-C port allow me to charge the device the adapter is plugged into? I seem to have had mixed results with that in the past."],"time":["2020-01-27 03:45:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["6841iam"],"id":[22157231],"kids":[22157253],"parent":[22152736],"text":["Very nice project!
