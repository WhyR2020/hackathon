I hope my comment can help software engineers to understand the basic background.<p>To begin with, take a look at the logic level of different families of simple logic chips. Take a look of this picture, it illustrates the logic threshold voltages of different digital buses.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interfacebus.com&#x2F;voltage_LV_threshold.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interfacebus.com&#x2F;voltage_LV_threshold.html<\/a><p>It&#x27;s easier to explain with examples.<p>1. <i>A logic gate.<\/i> Nothing can be simpler than a 7404 inverter - it inverts a Boolean value, if the input is a &quot;logic 1&quot;, the output is &quot;logic 0&quot;, vice versa. If you are using a 74LS04 chip, it uses the standard 5 V TTL logic level: anything between 2.0 V - 5.0 V is seen as &quot;logic 1&quot;, anything lower than 0.8 V is seen as &quot;logic 0&quot;. It has a rise time of 30 nanoseconds or so, and the chip cannot go faster than 30 MHz. You can easily make the chip to do its job by hooking a bunch of random wires, without any impedance control or power supply decoupling.<p>On the other hand, we have a 74AVC04 chip, which does the same, invert the signal. But it uses a 1.8 V power supply voltage, with thresholds of 1.35 V and 0.63 V respectively. Also, this chip has a rise time of 0.5 nanoseconds, and operates above 200 MHz.<p>Now:<p>* All the noise it can tolerate is around 100 milivolts, before the chip starts to go crazy and switch randomly.<p>* Although it&#x27;s a digital circuit, you <i>must<\/i> treat your signals as an analog radio signal (the fifth harmonic of a 100 MHz square wave is 1 GHz) and consider all the physical effects that can distort the signal. It&#x27;s no longer 0s and 1s, but waves bouncing around. For example, if you don&#x27;t add input termination to match the impedance, the output signal from the last circuit will hit the receiver and bounce back to the transmitter. Even the location of the interconnecting traces, the dielectric material of the circuit board started to matter.<p>* You must design an elaborate power supply network on your circuit board to eliminate the switching noises and supply adequate electric power, because the chip can turn on faster than what your power supply can deliver.<p>Finally we have CPUs that operates at Vcore voltage well below 1.0 V, at a few gigahertz, it makes the problem above more serious. Take a look of a modern CPU, it has a hundred of capacitors underneath, because the circuits inside switch on and off so fast that the power supply cannot even have sufficient time to deliver the current it needs.<p>2. <i>A DAC&#x2F;ADC example.<\/i> There are those 24-bit audio DAC everywhere nowadays, and it&#x27;s easy to be fooled by them and think that 24-bit is trivial.<p>But let&#x27;s examine the cheapest ADC you can buy today, often for free because it comes with your microcontroller. Many people think it&#x27;s bad and has low precision. So, you have a 0 to 5-volt input signal. When you have a 8-bit ADC, it means it can recognize 256 (2^8) different voltages, it means the smallest delta-V is can recognize is 0.019 V, 19 milivolts, or 1.9% of 5 V! Nowadays, a more expensive data acquisition system is often 10-bit. It&#x27;s 0.0049 V, 4.9 milivolts! It&#x27;s often used by the most expensive oscilloscopes. An even more expensive setup is 12-bit, it&#x27;s 0.001 V.<p>Just think about it, a 12-bit data acquisition system will be destroyed by any noise higher than 1 milivolt. And this noise can come from everywhere. Bad power integrity due to inadequate decoupling, crosstalks between traces, electromagnetic interference, and if your board design is bad enough, it can even come from the digital portion of the same chip itself.<p>To put it straight and simple: Even designing a 8-bit circuit that can fully utilize the performance of the 8-bit ADC is challenging, you can&#x27;t do this without a solid background in electronics. When people are talking about quantization noise of digital circuit, remember that a precision of 8-bit is not easily achievable even in analog circuit. (But that depends on what you are working on, DC is easiest, audio is easier, 100 MHz is not!)<p>It&#x27;s why we have 24-bit audio ADC, but we only have 10-bit oscilloscopes and 12-bit software-defined radio, because it doesn&#x27;t even make sense after that. Does it even make sense to recognize a signal to the precision 24-bit (0.0001 milivolts)?! The only thing that is capable of doing that is a sensitive analog frontend circuit of a radio receiver can do this (yes, it may include your AM radio), and the purpose of it is to process the signal to a more usable form.<p>Conclusion: The development of higher data rates digital systems and more sensitive analog chips, requires a lower noise floor. The chip in 1979 runs at 1 MHz and 15 volts, today it runs at less than 1 volts Vcore and 1 GHz. Yet, the technology of delivering power into these systems remains the same. The power from a DC power plug in a board today has the same amount of noise, just like it was in 1979.<p>Thus, the task of designing a power supply network on a board or a chip is becoming more and more challenging, as the article said,<p>&gt; You have to perform multi-physics, multi-domain simulation with the ability to co-simulate the behavior of the power grid together with timing."],"time":["2019-12-30 08:27:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["monster_group"],"id":[21913469],"kids":[21913589,21913494],"parent":[21908559],"text":["As are potato chips.

The characters look amazing in isolation, but thrown into that horribly flat homogeneous board with the ugly interface components in clashing colors with harsh edges and it all just looks completely off. And if they truly were not aiming at retro what’s up with the horrible 80ies gradient font that clashes as well? And yes I’d describe it as pixelated, because it doesn’t look like this is intentional on the interface, it looks like a bad compression of a thrown in overlay by someone who recently started playing around with photoshop.<p>With so much effort spent individually on the characters it’s confusing why the end product looks that bad. My first instinct is that it feels like a case of having an amazing artist on the characters and a new inexperienced artist in the interface and board, with no intercommunication and an inexperienced manager overseeing both just going “the interface with nothing in it looks ok” “The characters on a blank background look ok” “let’s ship”.<p>It’s not enough that individual parts look good when you focus on them. You need the sum-product to look great and that means the visual styles and elements need to fit together. That just does not seem to be the case for Auro.

Indeed I have been to galleries and exhibitions filled with what appears to be genuinely low-effort cash-ins and been chided for disliking it because it appeared to lack quality. It is very difficult to differentiate between the Pollocks&#x2F;Warhols and said low-effort cash-ins, and articulating what separates them from the rest is something I struggle with. All I can really say to that effect is that the <i>je ne sais quoi<\/i> has something to do with the feeling of zen that only comes from a mature and developed sense of composition -- in that Pollock <i>chose<\/i> his &quot;sloppy&quot; aesthetic when he could have chosen to follow the precient style -- that many amateurs and pretenders simply lack."],"time":["2019-12-30 02:52:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cmroanirgo"],"id":[21910312],"kids":{},"parent":[21903207],"text":["&gt; Paradoxically, good artists also embrace limitations.

I also outsourced two apps and successfully got it done in react native.<p><i><\/i>My Advice:<i><\/i><p>1. Do it yourself if you want to really learn mobile development.\nI recommend to explore Flutter(cross-platform and similar to Java), try to build a sample app in a day or two. Whether you succeed or not, ask yourself, how do you feel now, would you want to learn and code yourself? Remember, it is going to take a lot more time than you estimate now(when I learnt Android first, I estimated a week to learn and years after, I&#x27;m still learning, I shipped my first decent app after 4 months, while working on backend parallely)<p>2. If the answer is No to all above questions<p>Outsource the work. How?<p>A. Do you know any friend who&#x27;d want to do this?<p>B. Hire a developer on hourly basis to work with you closely and ofcourse remotely. Where?

I started doing more &quot;real&quot; software development midway into college and was lucky (or maybe unlucky) enough to be able to develop my skills with a pretty full-stack spectrum (now doing things with Dart, React, to Python, Java, Docker, ES, Reddis, Helm, Jenkins, K8, AWS&#x2F;GCP, etc, etc...).<p>I love Java (literally the best). Django is easy. Go is alright. jQuery &amp; Bootstrap are great. Moving into heavy UI i.e, React&#x2F;Redux, the entire JS ecosystem, mobile fragmentation, absurd, pointless policy changes in the UI world are absolutely 10x more annoying, difficult, arbitrary, meaningless, buggy, and horrible than anything back-end. TensorFlow, Unstructured-Data, NoSQL, CI&#x2F;CD? No problem. You have an API, documentation that works, Linux systems that are consistent, predictable, repeatable. UI&#x2F;UX? Changes every day. Docs from 2 years ago often don&#x27;t work. Lower barrier to entry, lower quality ecosystem. Security &amp; supply-chain nightmare. Fragmentation for no reason other than large corporations focusing on bottom lines and leaking core-rot. It&#x27;s a insult to time investment.<p>I can build a full-stack, horizontally scalable, complex, awesome system with whatever tools you want I can guarantee you that no matter what you throw at me, I&#x27;ll spend prob 75% screwing around with JS bugs, mobile garbage, awful ecosystems, and pointless garbage that at the end of the day comes down to nitpicking about pixel performance and arbitrary platforms.<p>I know I&#x27;m not the only who&#x27;s wasted countless hours of my own time, clients money, companies time, and real-end-user money and value on things that were shiny and interesting to a PM or UX team and ended up sinking over half the cost of project on effectively nothing. The people that make the decisions don&#x27;t understand it, because UI&#x2F;UX is literally all they can &quot;see&quot;. It&#x27;s insanity. If I ever start a company, I&#x27;d love to model it off a concept like Stripe; such a beautiful concept of a beautiful idea run by some of the smartest guys out there, all based entirely off an API. No play-store policies, shifting trends, corporate politics, useless garbage, pure JS developers maintaining random repo&#x27;s for tools that don&#x27;t need to be built.<p>If you&#x27;re smart, be like Amazon, Google, Facebook and every other huge idea: Make an unresponsive, useful front-end and just say no to fancy UI. Amazons website is an glorious defiance to the quite frankly disgusting culture of what robs real engineers time and resources away from something like curing disease, balancing equality, providing security, and focusing on things that could actually make the world a better place. Look at this site right here. Look what happened to Reddit.<p>If it&#x27;s more than Bootstrap and you&#x27;re not funded, just say no to UI&#x2F;UX. JUST SAY NO.<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s probably some good takeaways from the book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. Do yourself and the world a favor by not feeding this economy of engineered over-complexity and willful-ignorance, especially in this day in age. Our species might be about to go extinct.

For example, consider the word “Sachzwang” which translates to “intrinsic necessity” - i.e. something that must be a certain way to satisfy the naturally given constraints. This can for example be used in the wonderful expression: sachzwangreduzierte Ehrlichkeit. (Reduced honesty due to inherent constraints.)<p>Often, English has very elegant and short ways to express something similar, in that case it could simply be “spin”, as in giving an article a political spin. However, while “spin” is something done intentionally by someone (the spin doctor, another nice expression), the German variant is passive and implies that “die Sache” (roughly “the mission”) dictate the doctoring with the truth.

I’m certain there are expressions that don’t exist in every language, and even if you translated them, they might not translate well due to cultural or linguistic issues (try translating Monty Python to Chinese while keeping British wit and hoping your average Chinese viewer understands the context of the humor).<p>This might sound overgeneralized but I think every language has its own qualities. Most languages have evolved out of cultural needs (consider words like “Internet,” “email,” and “texting”).<p>For example, Chinese has a word distinguishing language (e.g <U+82F1><U+6587>, literally English culture) and the language itself (<U+82F1><U+8A9E>, literally English language). Most people in normal parlance would say <U+82F1><U+6587> over <U+82F1><U+8A9E> for English, because the culture is inseparable from the language. That’s why Chinese speakers use -<U+6587> for languages over -<U+8A9E>, such as <U+4E2D><U+6587><U+3001><U+82F1><U+6587><U+3001><U+65E5><U+6587><U+3001><U+897F><U+73ED><U+7259><U+6587>.<p>For the example of Entschuldigen or “apologize,” Chinese uses several expressions such as <U+5C0D><U+4E0D><U+8D77><U+3001><U+62B1><U+6B49>.

A popular example is when a German newspaper did one of those stupid surveys for the &quot;most beautiful German word&quot;, and the winner was &quot;Habseligkeiten&quot;. The cited reason was because it combines &quot;Haben&quot; (to have) with &quot;Selig&quot; (&quot;blessed&quot;), the profane with the heavenly, but the real etymology is actually different.<p>As is already mentioned here, the &quot;-mut&quot; in Wehmut does not mean &quot;courage&quot; but is actually identical to the English &quot;mood&quot;. I would also highly doubt his interpretation of &quot;Einsam&quot;. The suffix &quot;-sam&quot; usually means simply to having something. &quot;Liebenswürdig&quot; is difficult, because &quot;Liebe&quot; means many things (from simply &quot;friendly&quot; to modern romantic &quot;love&quot;), and &quot;-würdig&quot; is more in terms of being adequate or appropriate. When you say &quot;Er ist sehr liebenswürdig&quot;, this does not mean that HE is worthy of love, but simply that he is a friendly person, meaning he knows how to treat people properly. As was also already mentioned here, &quot;Entwicklung&quot; and &quot;development&quot; are literally the same, and the same goes for &quot;Ursprung&quot; and &quot;origin&quot;.<p>There is also the simple fact that German allows for building compositions, so what would be considered an expression in English can be one word in German (like &quot;Sinneswandel&quot; for &quot;change of mind&quot;). But this does not mean that it &quot;does not exist&quot;.<p>As a German, the word I&#x27;m <i>really<\/i> missing when speaking English is the simple word &quot;doch&quot;, which more or less means &quot;No, but yeah&quot;.

I think there was actually an article here some time ago that English used to have this with &quot;Yay&quot; and &quot;Nay&quot; in addition to &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;, but that this got lost.

The fact that they won&#x27;t admit it, and will argue vociferously against it, is part of their dishonesty. And how could it be otherwise, when the entire so-called &#x27;leadership&#x27; of this nation is fundamentally crooked and dishonest itself, and has been for over a hundred years, since long before the great grandparents of anyone commenting here were even born?<p>This article is dead accurate, and its observations apply even and especially here, on this site of learned intellectuals. You see it particularly on Slashdot though, where there are certain loud mouthed regulars there, who despite perhaps knowing quite a bit about their individual niche, sometimes expose themselves as total fools in larger discussions about politics and such, getting sucked into the same R vs D, red vs blue, or whatever other &#x27;bread and circuses&#x27; B.S. the rest of the serfs are so mesmerized by.<p>Really, &#x27;mesmerized&#x27; is the key word. All of this stuff is the work of pro propagandists. The book &quot;Propaganda&quot;, published in the 1930s, is the seminal work on this subject, and quite enlightening to read, in light of <i>everything<\/i> in the U.S. media today especially, which is all lies.<p>Attempts to bring victims of this system of lies to real, hard-won, life-saving knowledge are of course met with all the same rationalizations, equivocations, extreme skepticism, dodge tactics, etc as would be encountered in the typical &#x27;trailer park&#x27; setting (to name an easy target), only at a much more higher and refined level.

They would just get into scroll making or rock carving or invent IP over smoke signal&#x2F;carrier pidgeon&#x2F;giraffe or something, and be perfectly happy.<p>It reminds me actually of some people who live in jails.

It boiled down to a few people at the company that didn&#x27;t like that we pointed out a lot of security issues on things which were not our direct work but was theirs.  Basically we found a few major holes in a couple of their systems we had to do some integration work with and we documented the holes and gave it to the company as part of our deliverable.  Well like after 6 months post our exit they had a breach through one of those systems.  One of the PM&#x27;s and a couple of devs accused my team of the breach because someone had used one of the open doors we identified.  Literally they had an open port through the firewall to a database system that was unprotected (no password even) and had client data in it, yea Mongo&#x27;s stupid default no user&#x2F;password back then.<p>Essentially I did the same thing you did, reached out to the CEO, he denied they blamed me or my team and said there was nothing he could do about a few &quot;bad apples&quot; running their mouths.  I disagreed and pointed out that what they say in a professional capacity about myself or my team as a result of our time there was something he can and should concern himself with.  In the end, I did what everyone here is telling you, get a lawyer.  It cost me ~$500 to protect our name and put an end to it, essentially we sent a cease and desist letter and a some wording on potential damages given our work and what was being said.  That letter only got one response which was they had addressed the employees and agreed my team had nothing to do with their breach.  That was all I wanted, and it is what you should get because if it ever comes up you can show that to whoever asks. Took less than a week to resolve and we did work for that company again like 2 years later, guess who no longer worked there, the &quot;bad apples&quot; were all gone, but most of the rest of the team was still around including the CEO who brought us back.  So it didn&#x27;t cause us any damage long term with anyone other than we probably pissed off a few people that were already running their mouths a bit.<p>One last point.  I have had people bad mouth me for a number of things over my career.  Not once did it ever really hurt me professionally, mainly because I had a track record showing none of what they said was true.  As a consultant I had lots of people pissed saying we were there to displace them, replace them etc etc (even old developers saying that cause they had ancient skillsets).  I had articles in a few papers how we were destroying jobs through automation of services of a long term employer in a small town.  None of it hurt us, it hurt our pride&#x2F;feelings a little cause we knew what they were saying was false, but in the end none of it ever affected us professionally.  In some cases it actually helped us get other work partially because people saw we didn&#x27;t react and get defensive or go off the deep end.

Like when you got extras on the set in Hollywood making it all more, and sometimes too, glamorous and basically establishing a wiggle room for their lower requirements and then after that for their LOWERED requirements as they are that and need to remit the work and hold themselves as the whole section there (CLERK). Like that but for the White House. Started after Citizen Four, almost certain it was the voice over girl. Then it&#x27;s also about the discussions that happen between what those are set to do and what happens to those using whatever means they have for discussing what the infrastrcture of such a large scale mechanism might be, so that they can sell the protection in it and offer a security force made up of their side hoes to the local province and require that province to keep those girls paid by the means they have outlined within that fairer class, which they must reach by infrastructure. Almost 100 percent side hoe crush cam whore girl, and they are the dom in that little redress and cycle. That report is why Trump made that anti-hate&#x2F;no bigotry law, so they can&#x27;t just pile up things taking their access to infrastructure, and that way they can just be asked not to work then or they risk the man that hired them losing their job, and he drops his crush and she&#x27;s left a leak and we can supply the infrastructure fake women that we don&#x27;t tell them never existed, and that let&#x27;s trump focus on the office and not their &quot;extras&quot; (my side handles the extras).\nIt also had bits about how there is a way to move through the court system in case the next administration catches on but then it like muffles out and requires them to just know. As if through the infrastructure, or least by failing and turning in all the women, instead of having them work and then remove themselves from work, to actually detail how to arrest these women and make it all legal and none of it a war. \nIt&#x27;s a pretty vicarious effort, whoever wrote it (stolen from Korean warfare documents) is actually probably dead by now or in prison for the rest of their lives.<p>The scene reminds of that Twister book from American Pie. Like they were being suicide agents out of a korean marriage, but to their work, because she &quot;married&quot; her job instead of being married to a man and all that. Crazy stuff.<p>So if you hear 5g whining you read something, side hoe cam whore from a retail job near you, and she is the only one willing to work this long, and they say shit under their breath to mean they are working, like a psy op, to introduce the length of the process they have in mind (like the timing of the thing... timing in here... ..NOT), all out, all in, receding, mother, etc to hide that they are not doing a real job. Just boinking the local swingers (like how Hollywood is not LA and the burbs and valley are not LA either, but those two are also not Hollywood), humping the owner (who is otherwise just a goober with a fat wife), humping anyone that pays for their mocha two times and up front, and making sure they can keep the resounding effect of anything good (or anyone they&#x27;re asked to watch because it threatens the small choice of pond they have as the owners, or they want to get to try and bone someone&#x27;s girl and they&#x27;ll gang stalk until she changes her mind) from being able to actually take root in town for the class of &quot;fair&quot; people to be what roots in and then what the government as the white house, usually just cops and what is left of old parks and recs dudes doing security guard jobs, and security guards too (like the security guard&#x27;s out of time threat in out of time, where denzel was chief of police) doing their part in it to &quot;root&quot; for anyone willing to use that infrastructure to clarify their side in the battle between what are the gangs in town.\nThat last part is how I knew it was Korean. She had to be in prison for us to see, or jail, but there were people in LA, out of Culver City helping them redress the new administration with an old effort that was basically them being read their crimes back at them, which we are now commited to redressing to civil outcry with a lot of consequences tied to the persons using this infrastructure without the training required to actually learn and use it. And all of it, because there was a new phone put out, that was me and my people and our work, doing the work of preparing to learn how they do things, instead of making a transparent gif, you make sure they don&#x27;t actually have one to do real work with them, then if they do they&#x27;re on one of those GUBMENT LISTS.\nKinda like that.<p>Mueller Report."],"time":["2019-12-31 08:19:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["throw123452343"],"id":[21915929],"kids":{},"parent":[21913718],"text":["Not a &#x27;declassification&#x27;, but an insane investigative documentary.<p>Cold Case Hammarskjöld\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt9352780&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt9352780&#x2F;<\/a><p>It talks about how CIA&#x2F;MI5 killed UN Secretary General in the 60s, but uncovers&#x2F;interviews people involved with &#x27;SAIMR&#x27; a secretive institution rumored to be under the UK, which was using HIV as a means for achieving white-supremacy in apartheid South Africa by maliciously infecting the black population.<p>The reviews often dismiss this as &#x27;satirical fiction&#x27;, but quite frankly I don&#x27;t buy that.

It&#x27;s the epitome of cargo-cult corporate Kool-aid†. If this article doesn&#x27;t convince you that one-on-ones are nonsense, I don&#x27;t know what will. Let&#x27;s see what the author, a proponent of 1:1s, uses them on:<p>1) Personal habits and self-improvements<p><i>Personal habits<\/i> and <i>self-improvement<\/i> are (at best) tangentially related to your professional life. Are you seriously saying I should be talking to my manager about my struggles trying to go to the gym more often? About my passion for painting? Or that side-project I&#x27;m trying to get off the ground? More often than not, this seems like professional suicide. Your manager is not your friend.<p>2) Project management<p>Unfortunately, this is basically status quo. Yes, most one-on-ones will devolve into PM discussions -- what&#x27;s getting done, when&#x27;s it getting done, what&#x27;s the progress of X or Y, etc. Why one-on-ones aren&#x27;t really the place to talk about these things is because I already have <i>weekly status meetings<\/i> with my team, <i>daily stand-ups<\/i>, and <i>monthly roadmap check-ins<\/i>, also with my team. So if you talk about project management in a 1:1, it&#x27;s a complete waste of time.<p>3) Communication<p>Author writes: &quot;In addition to improving the form of my communication, I also learned a lot about how to improve my communication habits...&quot;<p>Most people learn this by high school. I mean, if you&#x27;re a functioning adult at a grown-up job, some decorum, emotional intelligence, and context come with the territory. But then again, point taken: most of us <i>do<\/i> work in tech. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t need a weekly 30-minute lesson in communication. My parents already did a pretty good job: I&#x27;m polite, responsive, and professional.<p>4) Alignment<p>I&#x27;m not sure how conflict resolution does anyone any good unless all conflicting parties are present. If I&#x27;ve got a disagreement with X, it seems we should probably hash it out in a meeting with X (sure, maybe with a manager present), but what do I know. And wait.. you need a <i>regular<\/i> one-on-one meeting on the books for this? How often <i>do<\/i> you get in conflicts at work?<p>5) Uncertainties<p>Author writes: &quot;for instance, occasionally I’d get worried about some strategically important project elsewhere in the company because they’d forgotten to announce progress reports on it...&quot;<p><i>Why?<\/i> <i>Why<\/i> are you worried about things you can&#x27;t control in a company you don&#x27;t own? Besides, I&#x27;m not sure how your manager -- who also might have no idea -- could ease your worries. Either way, this also seems like a waste of time for one-on-ones (and, to be frank, a non-issue altogether).<p>†The fact that the author believes corporate-style one-on-ones are part of the key to a healthy relationship is, in my opinion, doubly offensive. A relationship is about empathy, love, care, and longevity. Besides, a one-on-one is <i>defined<\/i> by being run by your supervisor.

This is the sort of thing which sometimes happens to academics -- in a position of absolute power over their students, divorced from any sort of checks-and-balances by tenure -- they become mean people. Over time, that leads to mean cultures, with increasingly abusive advisor-advisee relationships across entire fields.<p>This is most common in fields where a Ph.D is required to do meaningful work (e.g. biology, philosophy, etc.). It is especially common in the humanities, where many (most?) suffer from imposter syndrome (in many cases, rightfully) so this gets tied up in ego issues too.<p>On the receiving end of recommendation letters, I can say two things:<p>1) They&#x27;re almost meaningless. Most are glowing. \n2) They reflect more on the writer than on the student.<p>That&#x27;s something students don&#x27;t (and based on information they have, can&#x27;t) realize. If they pick the wrong professor to impress -- someone like Agnes here who applies a philosophy of &quot;hyper-rationalism&quot; to recommendation letters -- their career is shot.<p>For the most part:<p>* If you&#x27;re applying somewhere, I recommend talking to many recommenders. Ask whether they can and will write a strong recommendation. If so, engage with them.

But there&#x27;s a lot that I dislike too. A lot. In general, I find the language to be far too trendy and fussy. I get the impression the design was guided by the goal of streamlining snippets of code meant to highlight cool features, gaining undesirable complexity as a result. One example: Do we really need $n function parameters? In just about every other language, a function has parameters, period. Those names are used inside the function. Depending on the language they may be used outside the function too. Swift separates those inside and outside views, permitting different names for both. And then allows for no names at all! I don&#x27;t care. $n parameters seem to come from primitive languages like sh, and should have stayed there.<p>get&#x2F;set&#x2F;didSet introduces ridiculous complications just so we can pretend that a large number of function invocations look like assignment statements. This was a cool idea in C++, briefly, and then we discovered that having arbitrary code hide behind what looks like an ordinary assignment statement was a bad idea.<p>Extensions also remind me of C++ excesses. It is difficult to look at a piece of code involving a variable some type and be sure that I understand how that type works. The problem is that the code implementing the type is not in one place. There is the type definition, but then there are extensions. Possibly many of them. Defined all over the place.<p>I really dislike the irregularity surrounding let. In one context in unwraps an Optional. In another context it does not. Why?<p>I got off the Swift train at the release in which associated types were introduced. I&#x27;m sure it solves some actual problem, but it sure wasn&#x27;t clear at the time. (The project ended -- it&#x27;s not that I decided to go back to Objective C.)<p>Reference counting is far too intrusive, and it is easy to get it wrong in subtle ways. I find Java&#x27;s (!) memory model relatively simple, and that&#x27;s saying something. I understand why reference counting was chosen over GC. I don&#x27;t have a good answer, but reference counting is just ugly.

E.g., once he got a ticket to clean up some code throwing lots of warnings, and solved it by making the code <i>not work at all<\/i>.

He didn’t know what a database index was, for example, among other issues.<p>He was also not great at communicating. When talking about his work, he’d use technical jargon incorrectly. His emails to outside vendors were meandering and difficult to parse. I coached him on these points extensively.<p>In the end, after 6 months or so of trying to help him, I asked our CEO to fire him. We gave him a month’s severance.<p>A couple months later, his lawyer got in touch with his, alleging racial discrimination. The allegation was that we fired him because of his accent.

I currently run off an Intel NUC, which works perfectly fine, but I have a Thinkpad now on the way. I figured I&#x27;d do a writeup because I&#x27;m a designer and that makes me a little bit of a freak.<p>First, I was already a vim user for 8 years, so I was used to config files and the terminal. I moved primarily after watching some videos about I3 &#x2F; awesome WM and browsing the &#x2F;r&#x2F;unixporn subreddit. Primarily I liked the idea of designing my own OS from scratch, and the idea of being able to change ANYTHING was really intriguing to me.<p>I guess it&#x27;s important to note that as a designer this wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without tools like Figma and Framer being web based. Put bluntly, Linux native design tooling isn&#x27;t up to par with what I had on a mac, and without Figma I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to move over full-time. It&#x27;s also important to mention that while I classify myself as a designer, I design 90% of the time in code, writing React + CSS. I realize I&#x27;m a little different and this likely sways some of my feelings towards linux.<p>In short, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the switch. The window management alone has been reason enough. Being able to navigate my windows with key commands, and generally lay things out the way I see fit between polybar + i3 has been fantastic. Don&#x27;t like a certain shadow? Change it with picom. Don&#x27;t like seeing title bars on your windows? Change a config. I&#x27;m also a designer that believes in heavy focus (think tab focus in a browser) so every window gets a thick focus border. Everything is matched to a color-scheme that I like, and I mean everything. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using Linux so much as I&#x27;ve used Linux to build Dave OS.<p>I was able to migrate nearly $500 of annual tooling to home-made scripts and services that I run through GCP. For example. I used to use cloud app for screenshot &#x2F; movie snippets. Any designer will tell you something like that is their bread and butter... &quot;hey what do you think of this?&quot;. I moved it to Peek &#x2F; Flameshot + a 40-line bash script that watches a folder and uploads it to a gcp bucket. It took me a half day of learning. At the end of it I had a funny realization... why have I been paying for these simple services for years and complaining about features they didn&#x27;t have? Now I just add the features.<p>Performance is hit and miss. Everything I used to do in the terminal (which is where I spend most of my time) feels faster. In general, I had to drop apps and move command line. This was fun! I moved to buku for bookmarks, taskwarrior for todo lists...etc. What I loved about this was it forced me to engage more in the OSS community. I already do mostly OSS stuff for work, but I was in my bubble. Linux forced me out, and I found myself talking a bit more on Github, asking questions and the like. This was the thing that I&#x27;ve ended up loving. In general I&#x27;ve been amazed at the amount of support I&#x27;ve gotten from maintainers by just saying &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m a designer, I&#x27;m not so knowledgeable about the guts of this code, can you help me out&quot;?<p>Slack and zoom are slow. They are pretty resource intensive apps and weren&#x27;t exactly speed kings on my mac, but they do feel noticibly worse on Linux. I&#x27;m hoping this is due to my hardware, but I suspect the apps just aren&#x27;t as considered in Linux. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed AUR &#x2F; pacman for package management and it feels like brew, but for everything. The one thing I think Linux is missing is a good calendar application that syncs with gcal. The terminal based ones are a little overweight and underdesigned, and I can&#x27;t find a GUI one I like.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ll probably do a formal blog writeup at some point, and more importantly make some videos of my setup, since it&#x27;s probably interesting for folks to see how a designer uses Linux, but I thought it&#x27;d be worth a quick post to let others know its possible.<p>Hardware wise I had no trouble with my mac, mostly because I already had my own custom keyboards and the like, but I&#x27;m excited about the new Thinkpad on the way more for it&#x27;s power-to-price."],"time":["2020-08-28 16:15:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["puranjay"],"id":[24307866],"kids":{},"parent":[24303938],"text":["I moved to a Thinkpad from Macbook.

The pain of emailing documents is real, but the comfort level with how Word works is also real. Over the years, most organizations have developed internal workflows to share and send documents around that bypass the pains, and while they may not be perfect, they work.<p>The funny thing is that the document authors like these ways of working. It is the tech people who don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Git for Word&quot; proposed many times a year for a while now. And all of the ideas are interesting, but none of them appeal to my audience because they don&#x27;t care about git&#x27;s feature set. Nobody wants to branch and merge. Nobody wants a straight version history. (&quot;Nobody&quot; meaning nobody in my market, not nobody in the world.)<p>They want a storytelling experience. They want to know the why, not the what. And the workflow tends to be unidirectional, not with collaborative changes coming back together, but with expanding changes as each person adds their ideas and makes change for a specific instance of using a document. The experience we build for them bring in pieces of version history, pieces of comments, pieces of telling the story of why something was done, so people down the line can have more context to decide whether to accept or reject the changes.<p>It isn&#x27;t that &quot;Git for Word&quot; is a bad idea - on the contrary, it would be great if someone pulls it off. My point is that building something that improves on Word isn&#x27;t actually about the software, it is about the document workflows. If you find groups who work like software devs do, where documents receive small updates from a team, and bring all changes together for a final product, there is probably a market. But when evaluating such ideas, there has to be a reality check of whether the actual use of the documents truly matches the use case for git."],"time":["2020-08-28 12:57:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tomashubelbauer"],"id":[24303611],"kids":[24306848,24305092,24307027],"parent":[24302896],"text":["I&#x27;ve mentioned this in a similar thread a few months back, but it looks like it could be relevant here, too:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TomasHubelbauer&#x2F;modern-office-git-diff\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TomasHubelbauer&#x2F;modern-office-git-diff<\/a><p>I&#x27;ve made this script which automatically extracts the Office file format (which is a ZIP archive of XML documents) and versions the XML documents and their extracted text contents alongside the binary Office file.

If you&#x27;re writing a book or article, then the graphic designers and typesetters are going to make the design decisions, not the author, so why bother messing around with fonts and colours and the infuriating placement of images and tables.<p>I authored a kid&#x27;s book on coding, and the process was a nightmare. I authored in markdown, used pandoc to convert and then further edited in libreoffice, to be able to send stuff through in docx format. Then revisions were sent back in docx and I had to reverse the whole process, so I could maintain my plain-text version of the book. Then the proofs were sent through as PDFs, which I then had to markup for corrections. Many of the mistakes were due to the crappy way Word places images. In the end I just bought a copy of Word, and submitted to the way my publisher wanted me to work, which disrupted the authorial process.<p>It&#x27;s time we ditched Word, in the same way we ditched VHS and DVD. It&#x27;s an outdated technology that remains dominant just because everyone uses it at school, and then refuses to move on. If schools insisted that all homework was submitted in something like markdown, we&#x27;d see a dramatic change in a very short period of time.

We managed to change some money on the street.\n- a room at a normal hotel costs more than 80 USD, we found something similar to a hostel for 15 USD and still went to the Grand Turkmen, acted like we stayed there and stole some Internet\n- a SIM card with 1 GiB of Internet was around 40 USD, we passed\n- the Internet goes through an IPS that blocks everything we use in the western world: FB, Gmail, Whatsapp, VPNs etc. I had to tunnel through an SSH server listening on port 443 just to be able to send an email.
