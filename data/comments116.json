In your case, this could be anything that ties your online activity to your real life identity.<p>2. Identify your threat. This can be simple or complex depending on your needs. Are you concerned about hiding from pissed off gamers, hacktivists, or a nation state? Knowing the enemy you face will help you better understand their potential capabilities to find out information about you and how they could use this information.<p>3. Assess your vulnerabilities. Look at yourself from the viewpoint of the attacker. What information would you use to dox yourself?<p>4. Assess your risk. This can also be pretty involved depending on your vulnerabilities and threats. What could someone do with this information? How bad could you be hurt?<p>5. Apply countermeasures. Figure out how you can mitigate the risk you found above. This may include closing old accounts, creating new accounts, creating alternate personas, disinformation, heading off potential impact from a dox, etc.<p>Hope my ramblings helped."],"time":["2020-09-06 05:00:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dcow"],"id":[24389220],"kids":[24389351,24389959],"parent":[24388442],"text":["Find the courage to post under your real identity.

Some argue that “they’re not taxpayers, make them buy tickets”, but it seems more efficient to just account for that in hotel taxes.

This is an impressively researched, well-written article that presents a very earnest attempt to help people work through difficult times through the medium of theater. The theater group is founded by someone with extensive knowledge of classics and antiquity, and it seems like it tries to draw a direct parallel between the very human experiences in Greek tragedy to those experienced by people today. This seems no more unreasonable to me than learning about the human condition from Shakespeare.<p>Art is and has always been one of the most well-used means for us to connect with and contemplate our own humanity. The approach outlined in the article is a really interesting take on the active use of art to drive psychological catharsis. I for one really enjoyed it, and I’m inspired to see that these actors, directors, and playwrights are trying to use what they know to help others."],"time":["2020-09-06 20:43:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["spirobel"],"id":[24393089],"kids":[24393298,24393283],"parent":[24380616],"text":["you know deep down that the only thing that can get us through this Pandemic is this: wake up and realize its not worse than the flu.

Just look at a map... why arent there like a billion people in the US? This makes sense to a child because it&#x27;s so simple. But reality is more complicated.<p>2&#x2F;3rds of the US lives east of the Mississippi river. So if we had that level of density across the US, we would have 650m people. So east of the Mississippi is pretty close to being populated at that level.<p>The central plains is rapidly draining the water table. So it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;ll be able to continue farming it at the rate we have been (unless technology improves to reduce water usage), much less increase output. To illustate this, I love this image in [0] figure 2 on the first page. Water in an aquifer is stored in small cavities in the rock&#x2F;soil&#x2F;etc, and when you drain it enough, the ground literally collapses.. meaning you can never refill it. Our farmers now have to drill deeper than every before, and some farmers are just put out of business entirely... and that&#x27;s today.<p>And the west is arguably already overpopulated. We literally drain the Colorado river. We already need more desalination plants as it is.<p>If we put a billion people in the US, it would look very much like China. China has a similar geography problem. So when you imagine the US with a billion people, just imagine them all packed in on the east coast with some of the same problems as China (food supply, pollution, etc).<p>0. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;water.usgs.gov&#x2F;ogw&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;fs00165&#x2F;SubsidenceFS.v7.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;water.usgs.gov&#x2F;ogw&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;fs00165&#x2F;SubsidenceFS.v7.PDF<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-06 03:25:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["in3d"],"id":[24388263],"kids":[24388279],"parent":[24387899],"text":["&quot;21.1 percent of American children are living in poverty, compared with 11.3 percent of German children and just 9.3 percent of Swedish children, even though the U.S. is richer on average than either Germany or Sweden.&quot;<p>Dishonest.

The guy only had a BA too. I was horrified when I read this, but significant enough results were achieved and the field is just about devoid of anything with predictive power currently sadly. Also the underling statistics were done in the early 1980&#x27;s and forms of media change, so I&#x27;m not sure if the technique would even yield usable results today.<p>Other things that are interesting about earthquakes:<p>1. The moon plays some role. The gravitational pull of the moon is enough to influence the tension on the crust. Scientists have struggled to yield anything predictive from this, but the math suggests the forces must have some effect<p>2. Plate tectonics plays less of a role than previously thought. The classic example is China. No major plate boundaries where new crust is being formed (like off the coast of Japan) or of volcanic hotspots (Hawaii), yet an absolutely devastating history of earthquakes that are well recorded going back 3,000 years or so.<p>3. The influence of large weighted bodies on earthquakes.

Without this, you will either slouch in the chair, or hold your elbows in the air, neither of which are ideal.<p>Lastly, a word about sturdiness and durability.  Some chairs start to misbehave as they age, e.g. I once had a cheap office chair which started to &quot;list&quot; slightly.  I didn&#x27;t pay much attention until I noticed frequent cramps on one side of my back, and realised it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m sitting at a few degrees angle to the right.<p>Overall my advice would be: get the right chair (for you), sit correctly in it, and do plenty of exercise.

A coworker of mine had gotten a kneeling chair for his back issues at the same office, but that didn&#x27;t work for him, so he let me borrow it. I noticed a positive difference immediately. The chair is a Varier Wing Balans and I have been using it at work for several years now.<p>When we switched to WFH due to the virus, we were unable to take office equipment home aside from necessary hardware which was securely shipped to us. Because of this and because the switch was too sudden for anyone to really be able to prepare their home environments, we got an allowance to buy some home office equipment and many people opted for chairs. The Wing Balans was a bit expensive for me to justify, so instead I got the Varier Variable Balans. Also a kneeling chair, but no adjustable height. Aside from being much cheaper, one thing I love is that it sits on two rocking rails instead of a wheeled base. I am a fidgeter and it lets me rock back and forth as I work. It lets me have just as much flexibility in my sitting position as the Wing Balans at the same time.<p>The one negative is that it can be quite fiddly to place properly - the Wing Balans single swivel foot does not get in the way of certain table legs as much as these two rails. I also learned that to take full advantage of this chair a height adjustable desk is recommended (which we have at work, but which I do not have at home). For example, if I want to sit on it by putting one or both feet up on the shin rests, my knees hit the underside of my normal-height desk.

Why? Turns out, having thousands of microservices is something to flex about, and make good conference talks. But the cons start to weigh after a while - and when addressing those cons, you take a step back towards fewer, and bigger services. I predict Monzo will see the same cons in a year or two, and move to a more pragmatic, fewer, better-sized services approach that I&#x27;ve seen at Uber.<p>In 2020, Uber probably has fewer microservices than in 2015. Microservices are fantastic for autonomy. However, that autonomy also comes with the drawbacks. Integration testing becomes hard. The root cause of most outages become parallel deployments of two services, that cause issues. Ownership becomes problematic, when a person leaves who owned a microservice that was on the critical path. And that no one else knew about. Oncall load becomes tough: you literally have people own 4-5 microservices that they launched. Small ones, sure, but when they go down, they still cause issues.<p>To make many services work at scale, you need to solve all of these problems. You need to introduce tiering: ensuring the most ciritical (micro)services have the right amount of monitoring, alerting, proper oncall and strong ownership. Integration testing needs to be solved for critical services - often meaning merging multiple smaller services that relate to each other. Services need to have oncall owners: and a healthy oncall usually needs at least 5-6 engineers in a rotation, making the case for larger services as well.<p>Microservices are a great way to give more autonomy for teams. Just beware of the autonomy turning into something that&#x27;s hard to manage, or something that burns people out. Uber figured this out - other companies are bound to follow.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;lessons-learned-from-scaling-uber-to-2000-engineers-1000-ser.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;lessons-learned-f...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-30 11:06:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["franze"],"id":[22726351],"kids":{},"parent":[22725989],"text":["From the same newspaper 6 months ago. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.co.uk&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;monzo_pins_reset&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.co.uk&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;monzo_pins_reset&#x2F;<\/a><p>&quot;[480k] ... of its [Monzo] customers to pick a new PIN – after it discovered it was storing their codes effectively as plain-text in log files.&quot;"],"time":["2020-03-30 11:12:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zoltrain"],"id":[22726562],"kids":{},"parent":[22725989],"text":["I&#x27;m not even entirely sure the microservice part is the bit that&#x27;s ridiculous.

The original model for corporations was that companies make a profit, pay taxes on that and then either retain those profits, return them to the shareholders in the form of dividends or both.<p>This model has disadvantages. Not every shareholder wants to receive a dividend they then have to pay taxes on. The company also drops in value by the amount of money disbursed, which has its own issues (eg triggering wash sale rules).<p>Share buybacks are an alternative to returning money to investors. You use that same pool of money to buy shares on the open market. The company has lost that same asset (the disbursed cash) to those investors who want to receive that money (ie by choosing to sell) and the stock price remains unchanged.<p>So this is (IMHO) concentrating on the wrong problem. The real problem is that companies can borrow money to return to shareholders through dividends or buybacks rather than repatriating foreign profits, which would otherwise make those profits subject to US taxes. So this is a near-indefinite deferral of US taxes.<p>In my opinion, we need to treat any form of borrowing as effective repatriation of retained foreign profits that then get taxed accordingly.<p>As for bailout funds, I&#x27;m totally fine with all of these restrictions until the loan has been repaid:<p>1.

Very solipsistic and hedonistic, which is a great way to explore that decade. Each of the books in the series is a novel length prose poem.

The protagonist finds himself drafted into the war and does his best to survive while the brave people around him die like idiots, it escalates from there. The most beautiful line I&#x27;ve ever read is from a part of the book where the protagonist is hanging out at a brothel: &quot;Toward one of the beautiful girls there I soon developed an uncommon feeling of trust, which in frightened people takes the place of love.&quot; there are jaw-droppers like that on every other page<p>* Crime and Punishment — a cautionary tale about exactly the kind of solipsism and misanthropy that can take us over in our 30s. Fast paced and beautifully written, it reads like a modern crime thriller.<p>For fun conceptual stuff<p>* Ficciones by Borges — short stories that will twist your mind up, each are more puzzle than narrative, but tremendously engaging nonetheless. Ted Chiang is the modern writer that I would identify as the most similar in spirit to Borges.<p>As a note—I&#x27;m a speculative fiction author.

And english was Nabokov&#x27;s second language.  Don&#x27;t miss this just because of the creepy subject matter or because you saw one of the movies.   This is an incredible read and one of the English languages greatest books.<p>Cormac McCarthy, All the Pretty Horses -- I initially put off reading this by McCarthy&#x27;s singular use of punctuation and his long, spare sentences.  But I picked up the audiobook from Books on Tape (pre Audible) and fell into it.  When read by a talented narrator its like poetry (and I mean that in a good way).  When I finished it I immediatly rewound the tapes and listened to it again.<p>Rudy Rucker, White Light -- I read this 38 years ago and still think of it often.  Think Alice in Wonderland written by  William Burroughs and Kurt Godel. Giant cockroaches, absolute infinite, the devil harvesting souls, Albert Einstein, the Banach–Tarski paradox: its a wild ride.
