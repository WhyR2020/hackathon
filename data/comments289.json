I know in Florida Satellite they charge a higher tax rate compared to cable but that&#x27;s state wide from my understanding, since they don&#x27;t have the local equipment and as many employees to maintain the infrastructure. Well both cable and satellite has installers, etc but they could very well be contractors but still putting people to work locally.<p>Then I know some areas try to require a permit for satellite TV and the FCC sued cities over that because of the Over-the-Air Reception Devices (“OTARD”) rule or limit the number of satellites to 1. I have Dish at home and for some reason they installed 2 satellite dishes pointing at a slight different angle than the other one. I guess some cities and HOAs think satellites are ugly too.

Then again in some states same sex marriage is still illegal on the books too like Ohio and Tennessee, but you know they can&#x27;t enforce that anymore either because of the supreme court.

First the main theme is just wrong. It is quite a stretch to say that ruling minimal flat fee schedules illegal led to the billable hour. Flat fees are still legal and many lawyers use them. It is only illegal to have the bar association set minimums.<p>The article is also not quite correct to imply that the billable hour causes more misery than flat fees. If you have flat fees the partner will make the most money by forcing an associate to the largest number of flat fee assignments possible and that would still result in overwork. There are other worse problems with flat fee arrangements. In a flat fee situation you get paid the same regardless of how much work you put in, so there is incentive to finish the task with minimum amount of work. But if you are a perfectionist and&#x2F;or a lawyer that takes pride in his work, you will spend extra time to do the job right when it requires it. And that will make your life extra miserable because the partner expects you to finish a certain number of tasks regardless.<p>So the problem is not billable hours or flat fees, the problem is that the partner makes money from associates labor and wants to squeeze out as much labor as possible. This is an issue in many careers of course, but it is somehow worse in law.<p>And yes, I have worked in top law firms (if you haven&#x27;t noticed by the bitterness) and have worked both for billable hour and for some flat fee arrangements.

I caught it back in March here in WA state. I’m not sure when I got it. But I’m pretty sure it was the week before the lockdown (March 23rd). I was already self-isolating, but I just got careless one day. I went grocery shopping, wore a mask, brought my groceries home, put them away, and then ate something and scratched my nose. It was right then that I realized I hadn’t washed my hands after I got home and put away the groceries. About 3 or 4 days later, it kicked in.<p>My doctor was basically the same as the one in the article - couldn’t do anything for me. Kept telling me my case is considered minor because I can still breath and my temperature wasn’t spiking. I never hallucinated though. Feel like I missed out on that :)<p>My fever hit 103 and stayed there for over a week. A couple of days it hit 104. I told myself if it went higher I’d figure out how to get to the hospital. Luckily it didn’t go up. I was able to just stay home.<p>The chills were terrible. I was so cold and shivering so much that I couldn’t sleep. Eventually exhaustion caught up with me and I just passed out. I have no idea how I kept my dog fed and a minimum of accidents in the house. I really don’t remember anything from those 2 weeks. It’s just a haze.<p>But the one thing I do remember is the cough. I’ve had the flu, bronchitis, walking pneumonia, and even real, ICU pneumonia (to be fair over 2 decades ago so I don’t recall how bad it was), and the COVID cough was so much worse. I would curl up in the fetal position because I had coughed so much that I couldn’t straighten up. I walked hunched over because my abs hurt so bad. There were several times I’d start crying because I felt a coughing fit about to start. I don’t know if cough medicine helped at all, but I was drinking it every time I was lucid enough to remember to. I ran out one day and started panicking. I got really lucky and found a couple of bottles at a local Bartells. But I couldn’t go get it. I have great neighbors though. And one of them went and picked it up for me. They put themselves at risk to help me. They dropped it off at the end of my driveway and didn’t come within 40 feet of my front door. I waited till they were back in the house before I went and picked it up.<p>So yeah. It’s a “fever and a cough”. I really hope that none of you ever have to experience that “fever and a cough”<p>Edit: Some bio facts about me. I was 43 when I caught it. At the time I was training with power lifting, CrossFit, and a lot of rucking. If I really pushed myself, I could hit a 7 minute mile (not competitively fast, but fast for me).

Not being rude to individual artists, who were at times very talented, a lot of this music is musically rather simplistic and doesn&#x27;t require any preparation, but a cultural context. Granted your film-literature preferences, a good territory to start explorations from would be watch a few music movies, like the history of the Doors etc. that could give you the context needed and you are all set for many months of listening. But is all largely about youthful energy, about love, a man vs society, about dance and drugs. So - if you are not too young anymore - it can be a bit boring ;)<p>One exception would be jazz, that is a bit more complex to grasp, but again - you have a good series from Ken Burns to start with. That being said, to enjoy jazz truly in it&#x27;s more complex genres, I would argue at least certain musical background is beneficial, maybe some youtube talks etc.<p>Classical music... well this is a true ocean. Just Beethoven piano sonatas could be a passion for a year or two. You&#x27;re talking about XX century, and there&#x27;s been great classical music published in that period! But probably - if you go that route - you really want to start with renaissance and baroque. Here a lot of great introductory courses are available. If you don&#x27;t have musical background, Robert Greenberg series on Great Courses is really an entertaining and valuable intro.<p>And then there is world music, ranging from African roots bands playing drums to Indian classical music.<p>Now - having all that said - my personal perspective is that to enjoy music, you want to enjoy music. What I mean by that, is that you might want to dance, sing, play! Even a simple baroque dance, played by your self, could be way more gratifying that latest dull pop hit.

I have a few thousand CDs, some of them fairly rare, and I am the person my friends turn to when they need to track down a song or rare release.  By those standards ...<p>1) Find your passion.  I generally despise this as advise for careers and the like but when it comes to matters of personal preference, <i>de gustibus non est disputandum<\/i>.  What do you like?<p>2) Hit Discogs for your bands.  Don&#x27;t just look at main albums, look at appearances and rarities, songs covered by the band, appearances on soundtracks (which can often be one-offs) and the like.  For certain bands, I literally own everything they performed in because I like all of it.  This is <i>depth<\/i>.  After that, follow each member of a band to hear if they did anything before or after you enjoy.  Even try session musicians.  You may find a talented collaborator that way, too.  This is <i>breadth<\/i>.<p>3) Find a radio program adjacent to your tastes and examine the weekly playlist.  What did you like?  Here you are riding in the slipstream of a great big truck, as the DJ is doing a lot of the work for you.<p>4) Ignore most recommendation algorithms but Pandora, which are based on what other people play rather than what is actually related.<p>5) Don&#x27;t be afraid to reach out.  I have written musicians letters (snail mail, self-addressed stamped envelope enclosed) and said, &quot;I really like X, Y, and Z&quot; or &quot;Your performance on this track moved me&quot; then asked what inspired them, influenced them, or if they have influenced others.  I usually hear back.<p>6) Attend concerts and listen to the opening acts, buy their (typically cheap) CDs.  The openers appreciate it and you can find some great somewhat related music that way.<p>7) Back in the days when record stores existed, I would hit the &quot;M&quot; section or whatever letter, any band that didn&#x27;t have a tab of their own, and just flip through it, looking for anything to catch my eye, then listen that way.  Many duds, but some real wins.<p>8) Now that you have a sense of what you enjoy, you probably have some names associated with them, various microgenres.  List &#x27;em.  For example, &quot;grave wave.&quot;<p>9) Look up those microgenres on Bandcamp and the like, listen through that way.<p>10) Hit &quot;Every Noise at Once&quot; and surf your microgenre that way, too.

I still probably get through 10 or so new releases a week, a fair amount of older stuff I&#x27;ve never heard, and a lot of &#x27;comfort&#x27; records. The problem with top XYZ lists is you have to be &#x27;open&#x27; to listening to them, and for some records it definitely helps to have some reference points in the form of &#x27;stuff you know&#x27; to frame why they&#x27;re significant. It took me years to see the genius in some records that later become favourites.<p>Whilst I became much open to exploring genres as I got older, and whilst my tastes are now far more varied, primarily I still listen to a lot of alternative&#x2F;punk and hip-hop. I&#x27;ll occasionally listen to more electronic music, but with the rare exception anything too house&#x2F;techno&#x2F;etc. just doesn&#x27;t work for me as much. I also find when exploring back catalogues it helps to hear the song over the production - a punk rock record from 1985 probably sounds like shit - but when you learn to hear the song you see how amazing it was. Definitely something a younger me struggled with (in a world of over produced music!).<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is <i>personally<\/i> I feel music is a lot like anything else. The more you surround yourself with it, the more you &#x27;get&#x27; it, the more genres bleed into one another. And the more you hear, the better frame of reference you have as to why some of the &#x27;best&#x27; records are what they are and sounds like they do.<p>TL;DR: Listen to lots and lots, keep exploring. Spotify is an incredible tool. Pick a genre, listen to what Spotify recommends. See what grabs you. If nothing does, try another genre. Keep trying until something grabs you. Then delve into the genre - you&#x27;ll find pretty soon that genres start to crossover.

My Google-fu isn&#x27;t up to the task today. But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve seen proposed before, eg with something like Bitcoin as the timestamp provider.<p>My OpenTimestamps project is a curious example where I actually made an effort to <i>avoid<\/i> implementing this by accident.<p>tl;dr: It&#x27;s a service that does Bitcoin timestamping. In the process, centralized servers generate &quot;calendars&quot; - the database of digests they&#x27;ve timestamped. Now, for disaster recovery the calendar servers have a HMAC with secret key to authenticate digests they&#x27;ve promised to timestamp. The idea being that the HMAC lets us get timestamps back from the community to re-add to the calendar in case the data somehow gets lost.<p>For technical reasons, that HMAC &quot;signs&quot; the current time, and the output of that HMAC gets timestamped securely with Bitcoin. But since OTS servers are <i>not<\/i> supposed to be trusted, that HMAC digest is deliberately truncated to 64 bits to make it feasible to brute force with significant effort, thus making them not useful as an actual timestamp: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opentimestamps&#x2F;opentimestamps-server&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1b191439f66d603d3d5d32a60b691ce8c92746ad&#x2F;otsserver&#x2F;calendar.py#L30\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opentimestamps&#x2F;opentimestamps-server&#x2F;blob...<\/a><p>This is ok for their intended purpose, because if you&#x27;re willing to brute force 64-bits, I&#x27;m ok letting you add some junk to the OTS calendars in the event of a disaster.<p>I&#x27;m actually considering using that scheme as a <i>trusted<\/i> timestamping mechanism for OTS, by simply revealing the HMAC keys after they&#x27;ve been timestamped by Bitcoin. They&#x27;re already derived with a merkle tree from a single seed - each second gets a different HMAC key. To turn that into a verifiable signature you just need to derive all the keys in advance, construct a tweaked version of that merkle tree, and then publish the root. A full signature is then the HMAC output, and a path up the tree to the public root.<p>The advantage for OTS is the amortized size of the signatures would be smaller than a ECC signature, plus being hash based it&#x27;s a quantum resistant scheme."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:15:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BooneJS"],"id":[24216532],"kids":[24217779],"parent":[24211045],"text":["This article is from 2017.

It&#x27;s not peer reviewed yet because it&#x27;s brand new- peer review takes a minimum of three months. He shows open table and google maps data in support of people not being much more careful in Florida or AZ. He also explains the interplay between mask wearing etc and RT. Hopefully you will find this to add extra rigor to what I have been saying. It is pretty dry- but that is the nature of this sort of talk. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ew2MEF4XX8w\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ew2MEF4XX8w<\/a>."],"time":["2020-08-21 07:24:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["phenkdo"],"id":[24216581],"kids":{},"parent":[24215572],"text":["Sorry for hijacking this thread, but it&#x27;d be great if some serious science&#x2F;politics show hosts an extended debate from both POVs and have a serious scientific conversation about what&#x27;s next in covid? herd immunity or not?"],"time":["2020-08-19 23:13:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["josephby"],"id":[24228700],"kids":{},"parent":[24215572],"text":["&gt; Why would Floridas numbers start to decrease if not for herd immunity?

The obvious ones are companies like Amazon, Netflix and Zoom, but for instance Target and Walmart have benefited from being allowed to stay open because they sell essentials while also selling everything else so they were often the only option other than Amazon.<p>4. When people talk about the S&amp;P 500 recovering unbelievably fast, they often mean vs. the lows in March. Those lows were not reflective of the reality of what was happening (definitionally: nobody knew the reality of what was happening, lack of testing, etc.), but there was some concern that the actual apocalypse might have occurred... and everyday as merely bad news poured in that actually restored confidence because the news was not apocalyptic. So, the prices rose.<p>5. There really are a bunch of bored people buying stocks on their phone because they can&#x27;t bet on sports anymore [1]. It&#x27;s not clear how big an effect this is, but there really does seem to be extra retail demand for stocks.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;audio&#x2F;2020-07-09&#x2F;inside-the-mind-of-a-young-retail-day-trader-podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;audio&#x2F;2020-07-09&#x2F;inside-the-m...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 16:15:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["coldcode"],"id":[24210270],"kids":{},"parent":[24209923],"text":["Fed invents money.

The stock market is forward-looking: Investors are betting on what the world and the economy look like in 12 to 18 months from now, not what they look like today, tomorrow or this fall.<p>2. The big get bigger: Much of the stock market’s success has been the result of a run-up in value for a few big technology companies — including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft — that make up a large share of the index. And retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are growing in part because small businesses have closed, allowing the bigger companies to take even more market share.<p>3. Betting on a vaccine: Given the daily headlines about the potential for a vaccine, investors want to be invested in the market when the news comes that there is a genuine vaccine, on the assumption that it will send stocks even higher.<p>4. The only game in town: With the Federal Reserve planning to print money for the foreseeable future, investors don’t want to be in cash or bonds, which are steadily losing value. So where else can they put their money? The stock market has become a default.<p>5. Help from Washington: As dysfunctional as Congress has proved to be, investors are betting that Republicans and Democrats will find a way to keep plying the economy with stimulus. (Anecdotal stories suggest some Americans have even taken their $600 unemployment checks and invested them in the stock market.)<p>Of course, all of these rationalizations don’t take into account the possibility of a terrible second or third coronavirus wave, a delay in the discovery of a vaccine, a constitutional crisis come the election in November, runaway inflation, the prospect of higher taxes to pay for the stimulus, a more significant trade war with China, or the dozens of other risks that seem to be bubbling just below — and in some cases on — the surface.<p>In the meantime, happy trading!&quot;<p><i><\/i><i><\/i><i><\/i>*<p>#4 I hadn’t thought of, and is a VERY troubling sign I think.

Government fiscal and monetary keeps the economy on life support until that happens.  If you value a business bottom up and you think 2021&#x2F;2022 sort of revert back to 2019 then by now in 2020 you are basing your valuations on those numbers and decreasing the equity value where necessary for businesses that took on debt to get through 2020.  The Fed has said it will keep rates low for longer and overshoot 2% which is an average target not a ceiling.

It&#x27;s almost worse than PG&#x27;s one, which didn&#x27;t really pretend to be an in-depth analysis. Some starting points:<p>- Taxes are guaranteed, but growth isn&#x27;t. It also doesn&#x27;t come for free, it takes work. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;hey S&amp;P returned 10% last year, I&#x27;ll assume that for a given&quot;. Also wealth is often non-diversifiable - Elon Musk&#x27;s or Jeff Bezos&#x27; wealth are tied to their companies. They could feasibly take a 50% tumble in a year (can&#x27;t see how but it&#x27;s totally possible). Of course these two will still be very rich even then, but what about &#x27;minor&#x27; millionaires?<p>- People with these levels of wealth already pay, or should pay, high taxes on other things: CGT, VAT, income tax, corporation tax, land &#x2F; real estate taxes. If they don&#x27;t, then this is the real problem, you shouldn&#x27;t fix it by just adding another patch on top of a stack of leaky patches. Already, in all developed economies I know of, a huge chunk of income tax comes from the top earners.<p>- And further to that, taxation isn&#x27;t simply about maximal resource extraction from a productive population. Tax is a societal commitment to fund things we all care about. It is generally widely understood and accepted that wealthier people pay more, because the poor can&#x27;t. But when the rhetoric becomes &quot;let&#x27;s extract as much as we can from the rich, look here&#x27;s a notebook that shows we can&quot;, I&#x27;m not surprised people start looking at tax avoidance. As the rich person, you become dissociated from the society - they are only there to shear you, so why should you make an effort to give back?<p>- And it&#x27;s not inherently wrong to be rich, also. Sure, some people are rich and abuse other people, possibly with some strong ties between one and the other. But the solution isn&#x27;t a punitive tax. In a way, that makes it worse - makes it feel like you paid your dues and now you&#x27;re really above the law.<p>- The point of wealth is that it should be productive. So the business of being rich is to have money, have it return an interest higher than inflation (on which you already pay CGT usually), and consuming the excess. It&#x27;s not enough for the tax to be below average growth rates.<p>Perhaps I should explain, that I write this from (a) outside US where there doesn&#x27;t seem to be such a toxic inequality in the society (and not simply because of wealth taxes...), and (b) I&#x27;m not rich, but hey, I&#x27;m working hard to maybe be there one day.

Twingate is deployed as a network overlay on top of your existing network so you can enable remote access to any protected host or destination without having to re-architect your network. Just deploy our connectors inside any number of existing networks, define access policies by destination address, and install our client apps on your device for access. No firewall changes, routing rules, proxy configurations, etc. Access your private resources using the local IP or private DNS you’ve always used and we handle all the routing and local DNS resolution automatically.<p>We’ve designed Twingate with developers in mind and built a number of features to make remote access easy for development teams. Twingate provides a single interface for developers to access multiple environments, supports any protocol and app out of the box, and intelligently segregates and routes traffic via the most direct path to minimize latency.<p>You can try it out for free and we’d love to hear your feedback!<p>We also have a extensive documentation on how Twingate works here if you’d like to take a peek under the hood: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.twingate.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;how-twingate-works\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.twingate.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;how-twingate-works<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 19:07:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["benmccann"],"id":[24215121],"kids":[24216154,24217049],"parent":[24212784],"text":["How does this compare to Tailscale?

Scoop (for package management on Windows) and Rosewell (which now supports Windows) made this super easy and pleasant.  But ... why would you spend your time writing Free software to benefit such an ecosystem?

For what it is worth, here is my two cents on a topic - a wealth tax - that may seem on the surface to be benign but that is in fact just the opposite.<p>Silicon Valley was founded in a spirit of freedom and flexibility but that spirit is clearly and dangerously on the wane insofar as the political environment surrounding the Valley is concerned.<p>By the 1970s, American enterprise was in decline, a victim of the &quot;big government&#x2F;big business&#x2F;big labor&quot; trends glamorized by establishment types of that day. What this did was take away choice and flexibility.<p>Tech changed all that and it did so from the heart of Silicon Valley. Tech arose from a spirit of freedom and flexibility. Founders would get an idea and would have countless ways of experimenting with what they could do with it with the aim of building a venture. Many of the most wildly successful ventures came out of nowhere. No central committee could have planned for them. No overlords of big business could have had the imagination or risk-taking fortitude to push them at the expense of their established cash cows of that day. No union could comfortably impose rigid work rules onto such amorphous ventures (the first thing Intel workers did even after the company succeeded was to reject unionization). No minimum wage or overtime rules applied. Benefits packages of the type widely deployed in the analog-based large businesses of that day were unheard of.<p>Regulators and taxers of that era continually tried to realize their vision of locking people into situations by which they would have guaranteed security, ossifying the mature businesses over which they had control, but tech simply outran them through innovation. And, in time, upended them by disrupting their industries through innovation and risk-taking.<p>Today, the spirit of Silicon Valley has changed and is yielding to a belief system by which the overlords of politics believe they can dictate outcomes that will give people locked-in security forever. Want to do something as an independent to earn a livelihood? Sorry, AB5 forbids that and will penalize the hell out of any venture that seeks to use fleelancing and flexibility as a foundation for innovation and growth. Your choice to act an an independent is frozen out by dictates that, if you act at all to make a living, you must do it within rigid systems that guarantee minimum compensation, regulate overtime, prescribe minimum guaranteed benefits, and the like. If this kills opportunities, no problem: there will be other rules that guarantee basic income, limit the rent you have to pay, and otherwise regulate society such that people are guaranteed a risk-free existence courtesy of decrees enacted by political proclamation.<p>This new mindset is precisely the one of the 1970s-era leaders who managed to choke off innovation and growth in old-line businesses and gave a massive opening to tech innovators, particularly those in Silicon Valley.<p>pg&#x27;s modeling of the effects of a wealth tax is spot on. And it confirms that such a tax is an innovation-killing idea that would destroy the spirit of Silicon Valley. Of course, tech innovation will not cease. It will just move elsewhere to escape the tax. Europe in the 1990s had a couple of dozen or more countries that imposed wealth taxes. Today it has three, if I recall. There is a reason for that. It is a highly pernicious tax that kills enterprise and that veers from a capitalist (even progressive) philosophy into one that is directly of a Marxist&#x2F;communist variety that has left so many nations in rubble once fully implemented. Smart, innovative people are not going to stick around for the con game. They will leave.<p>I have watched Silicon Valley grow and flourish for decades now and have been directly involved in working with thousands of entrepreneurs who have been a part of it. There have been a lot of political changes over those decades but one thing remained constant: the foundational thinking in California always assumed a capitalistic structure. Once that is abandoned, Silicon Valley will be no more.<p>I know that the vast majority of HN&#x27;ers are progressive in their thinking and we all can have our own ideas about what makes for a good and just society. I am not commenting on that here.<p>There is a line that cannot be crossed, however, without killing the Valley itself and all that it stands for. The wealth tax clearly crosses that line and, if things are allowed to go that way, the consequences may not be what you expect them to be. It doesn&#x27;t take much to switch from a tax of .4% on assets over $30M (bad as that is in itself) to a tax of a much higher rate on a much lower threshold of assets. Once that monster is unleased, who knows where it will go. It will be fundamental transformation of the Valley, and not a good one.<p>As I said, just my two cents."],"time":["2020-08-18 18:52:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["paulhart"],"id":[24198327],"kids":[24198429,24205194,24198356,24198695,24198591,24198477,24199107,24198489,24198398,24199531,24204513,24198545,24204386],"parent":[24198172],"text":["Someone forgot to model growth in the value of the asset, and&#x2F;or putting the wealth to use.

It is clearly beneficial to everyone to live in a society where people are well cared for and have healthcare, public education, welfare, etc. There&#x27;s a reason failed states and unstable&#x2F;developing countries generally aren&#x27;t where people are looking to startup the next big tech company.<p>Third, any smart founder isn&#x27;t going to just sell 1% of their stock every year and pay the wealth tax with that. They&#x27;ll take dividends, or take out a loan against the value of the stock, or use some cash from other investments, or whatever, and maintain control of their company.

One way to think about is you want your tax system to walk as softly as possible while getting from point A to point B. Don’t distort intertemporal decisions if you don’t have to. Don’t tax elastic things when you could tax inelastic things - impose taxes on things where the optimal allocations don’t change much with the new disincentive. A wealth tax takes this result and compounds it. I should really consume my wealth instead of saving it. So you’re rewarding the spendthrift and hurting the saver (the investor). Investment and growth (and overall welfare) suffer. The caveat to all this is that a wealth tax that’s a one-time unexpected confiscation of wealth shouldn’t distort incentives, which is kind of approximated by the estate tax (poorly approximated since its still expected). But the wealth tax is really not about optimal tax theory. It’s about saying the quiet part out loud - taking from the wealthy because there’s a belief that it improves democracy.

If you have $100m and the floor is $50m, the wealth tax can only take half.<p>Third... there is money going in and out besides the wealth tax. Interest is the big one.<p>The table is correct either way, but the implication of a 2% wealth tax over 60 years, assuming a 6% average rate of return is that your $100m will become $1bn instead of $3.3bn. That&#x27;s the 70%.<p>Maybe 6% is unfair. For the currently very wealthy (Zuck, Bezos, Buffet) they earned more in recent decades. Maybe 4% would be fairer. Maybe 8%. IDK.<p>Also, consumption is relevant... at least below a certain level of wealth. Consumption rounds to zero for Gates&#x2F;Buffet&#x2F;Bezos levels of wealth.<p>A point to note (for proponents) is that a wealth tax will not produce very much tax. It is much smaller than a VAT, income tax or such. Whether you are for it or against it, think of it more like tariffs. It&#x27;s an economic policy. The tax itself is a side effect.<p>I do think it&#x27;s over-the-top to represent these only as 60-year effects. The conclusion that a 0.5% tax represents 25% of your stock is... that seems wrong. Over 10 years that is just 4.5% and the founder will be paying taxes out of interest&#x2F;revenue.<p>If it affects founders&#x27; country&#x2F;regime selection, it would make sense to move after you make the money.  Most of the tax is in the future."],"time":["2020-08-18 16:52:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mattsoldo"],"id":[24200322],"kids":{},"parent":[24198172],"text":["This isn&#x27;t the correct way to model wealth tax&#x27;s effect on founder equity.

Founders would re-consider sky-high valuations during funding rounds because of the effect on their tax rate. Startups may consider generating real cash-flow earlier on in order to issue dividends to their shareholders to cover the wealth tax instead of selling shares.

The income gap between capital and labor that has been growing since the 1970s (as observed by, e.g. Piketty) is largely due to housing [1]\n2. Economic growth and opportunity is increasingly concentrated in the the urban areas (and even within cities, a handful of them are responsible for most of the growth), however, zoning laws makes it very difficult to build new housing there and thus for rural labor to join the economic party. Thus, as we concentrate economic activity we explicitly exclude huge swaths of the population from participating in it.\n3. With finite land, concentrated opportunities (i.e. no viable alternatives [2]), and overt house building restrictions, workers who do have the opportunity to work in urban areas are &quot;willing&quot; to pay the absurdly high rents that landowners ask. You can clearly see this in the Bay Area where, prior to COVID-19, the rents would just track the income level of tech employees. The current landowners are the main winners of the success of the urban areas.\n4. On top of that (and specific to the USA), if a landowner decides to sell a property, the sale will be taxed as a capital gain which has a lower tax rate than the labor rate. We are literally incentivizing rent-seeking.<p>A Land Value Tax (LVT) taxes the value of the land (rather than that of the property). This has the following benefits:\n1. It incentivizes more efficient usage of the land (a single family house and a high-rise pay the same tax if the have the same footprint and are next to each other). \n2. Land is finite, so it can&#x27;t &quot;disincentivize&quot; land production.\n3. When land appreciates, it is rarely if ever because the owner invested in it, rather because the economy around it makes it more valuable. This tax captures that value and returns it to the community (rather than privatizing it and giving it to the landowner). \n4. It is a progressive tax.<p>Instead of arguing whether and how to implement a wealth tax, we should pursue a national LVT.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;bpea-articles&#x2F;deciphering-the-fall-and-rise-in-the-net-capital-share&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;bpea-articles&#x2F;deciphering-the-fall...<\/a>\n[2] Technically, you can choose from a set of successful cities, but they all follow similar patterns."],"time":["2020-08-18 18:04:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gok"],"id":[24199870],"kids":{},"parent":[24198172],"text":["The real problem with wealth taxes is that they really can&#x27;t raise very much revenue.

In essence: &quot;The farmer keeps a hoard of seeds in his silo! The seeds collect dust year round until he decides to plant.  There is great want and famine in the world! If we go and take the seeds, we can end hunger, the laborer can eat better!&quot;  Which is to ignore that once you consume capital, it&#x27;s gone -- in our example, no more food gets produced because all the seeds were eaten.  This is precisely why political systems that institutionalize theft appear to be prospering temporarily, their consumption is being subsidized by capital consumption before their unavoidable demise.  Often people get confused or abuse the methods of how economies account for these factors (capital, allocation, prices) but the brass-tacks reality is unavoidable.<p>&quot;Ah ha!&quot; says the taxation wonk, &quot;We will be smart about how much we take.  We will only take just enough so that the farmer will have <i>just enough<\/i> seeds to keep farming.  We will call it &#x27;normal profits&#x27; or &#x27;reasonable profits&#x27;&quot;  And what happens when the farmer has a few bad harvests (or say a global pandemic disrupts the taxation-wonk&#x27;s plan)? The farmer (and country) stop producing food because &#x27;normal profits&#x27; or &#x27;reasonable prices&#x27; don&#x27;t exist in the real world.  Mandating charity (welfare taxation), savings rates (interest rate manipulation), or service allocation (defense spending, roads etc) always blow up.<p>The opponents of wealth taxes argue that 100% of their purchasing power is due to their own work&#x2F;negotiation which ignores that much of asset-price inflation is due to government-monies being perpetually diluted to appease in-groups.  You choosing to pay to go to a Beyonce concert and increasing her 1&#x2F;2 billion net worth isn&#x27;t the action causing the musician down the street to starve (it&#x27;s the fact that no one is willing to trade his music services for what he wants).  Some amount of Jeff Bezos&#x27;s wealth is warrantied.  If someone wants to trade a money for a certificate of stock, no one has been robbed.  But if individuals are forced into buying certificate of stock to escape the dilution of purchasing power by money dilution, that is an undue benefit to Bezos&#x27;s portfolio.  It&#x27;s also an undue benefit to allow the money issuers to control who gets access to lending&#x2F;credit -- rather than the worker who decides to lend out their past labor in money form (creditor) and debt holder.<p>The reason why people are starving isn&#x27;t because the farmer refrains from consuming or planting seeds -- it&#x27;s because the price of labor rendered in the past is stolen from workers by the money they&#x27;ve been paid being diluted by money printing.[1]  By taking from the farmer who consumes the least seeds and produces the most food (the most profitable) to give to the farmer who consumes the most seeds and produces the least food (less profitable) is a method of subsidizing consumption.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that economic collaboration&#x2F;unions&#x2F;co-ops cannot be profitable nor that they will be profitable.  If the union renders certain offerings and charges listed prices, individuals can choose to join that union (say &quot;sign up for a box of farm produce for X price) if it&#x27;s profitable for them to do so -- Which is an economic calculation only an individual can make not a central planner decided if a group should join such a union, as profits are local.<p>But to bastardize collaboration&#x2F;co-operation and insist that everyone will be better off if they are force through compulsion (often through violence, sometimes social isolation) to pay into the union and take out of the union and force the union the accept members which are unprofitable for it to serve, is to ensure that those who take the most and contribute the least to the union will eventually subsume the membership from those who take the least and contribute the most.<p>Read more about the Cantillon effect here:\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austriancenter.com&#x2F;cantillon-effect-populism&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austriancenter.com&#x2F;cantillon-effect-populism&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 01:30:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bengotow"],"id":[24198334],"kids":[24198605,24198399,24198428],"parent":[24198172],"text":["Wow, this ignores both the &quot;floor&quot; below which you would not be subject to the wealth tax (in the US, most recently by Elizabeth Warren, this has been discussed as $50M+), and ALSO fails to take into account that you would be growing your principal at ~3-8% a year through investment, etc.<p>Sure, I guess with no floor on the tax and with your money just literally sitting in a pile, the government would eventually take a lot of it."],"time":["2020-08-18 15:35:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sanj"],"id":[24199113],"kids":{},"parent":[24198172],"text":["tl;dr: compound interest works both ways<p>This is a shallow analysis.

Let&#x27;s try modeling the effects of zero wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a wealthy individual and for a startup founder.<p>Suppose you inherit a large amount of money or found a startup in your twenties and then live for another 60 years. What will be the impact of a small or zero wealth tax on your holdings?<p>Suppose the wealth tax is 1%, the long-term capital gains tax rate for large incomes is 20%, and the annual growth of stock value is 8.25%[1]. That means that each year the wealthy individual experiences an 8.25% growth split into 1.65% growth paid in taxes and 6.6% gain, of which 1% goes to pay wealth taxes, for an annual gain of 5.6%. Which means after 60 years the net worth of the wealthy individual will have grown by 1.056^60 or over 26x growth. By comparison, a 0% tax rate would result in a net worth growth of 46x.<p>It may at first seem surprising that lowering wealth taxes to 1% or even 0% would produce such dramatic effects. The reason lack of wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that the growth is applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year&#x27;s income -- having a higher after-tax income can make someone rich, but more in proportion to their income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, the growth in value of that asset will compound 60 times. Ownership of assets compounds.<p>It is also worth considering that the startup founder who never diversified their holdings, never accepted funding or joined y-combinator, and also never spent their salary buying additional stock, but simply retained ownership of the company other than paying wealth taxes, the percent ownership of the company would drop from 100% to 0.55% at a 1% wealth tax or remain flat at 100% with a 0% wealth tax.<p>Of course, with modern financial tools no startup founder need experience this: they can simply create different classes of stock, including some founders stock that has enormously overweighed voting power and then sell off only their regular shares to pay for the wealth tax. We already see this with major world companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook that remain entirely under the control of their founders.<p>Surely a tax rate as low as 1% (or even, shockingly, 0%) would lead to rampant wealth inequality and an out-of-control Gini coefficient.<p>[1] The assumption of a return that is consistent across different stocks or even consistent from year to year is highly inaccurate. But if we remove this assumption then all calculations become irrelevant and the only conclusion we can draw is &quot;some people get lucky, others don&#x27;t&quot;. That isn&#x27;t useful, so we&#x27;ll assume it is consistent.
