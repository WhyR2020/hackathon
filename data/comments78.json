I spent some time exploring the analysis of chords using answer set programming. On the surface ASP programs look very similar to Prolog but the semantics differ; you query Prolog to answer a question or series of questions related to your program, whereas ASP produces complete &quot;stable models&quot; of your program (it answers &quot;all questions&quot;).<p>The first version of my analysis program would most likely have been a valid Prolog program, and furthermore the program was completely positive (contained no negation). After several weeks of rewrites, I ended up with a much smaller program that also took advantage of ASP &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;optimization&quot; rules. Much of the complexity was reduced by one fundamental improvement in the representation of internal facts and adjusting the rules to accommodate. In hindsight, the original version used a rather foolish approach, but like many things it took some effort to realize why and how to do better.<p>This process of rewriting and incremental improvement (and initially struggling in a less-familiar programming paradigm) gave me a great appreciation for logic systems, and also a desire to use them more often. There is something very beautiful in reducing a problem into logical relationships, and instead of focusing on algorithms just focusing on the problem space and how different pieces interrelate. It does take practice and experimentation to produce an elegant solution to a problem, but with experience it gets easier. I have no doubt the author of this article could make it feasible to discover chords and tunings as he describes in the Future Work section. Though I would recommend starting over with this goal in mind; even a naive but viable solution might reveal some property of the system that would transfer over to the original program and increase its versatility."],"time":["2020-04-22 05:01:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["valdiorn"],"id":[22943613],"kids":{},"parent":[22940211],"text":["Tangentially related; I wrote some python code to come up with every possible pentatonic scale (including some restrictions for musicality) - If nothing else, I learnt a lot about scales and how they relate to one another<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ValdemarOrn&#x2F;PentatonicScales\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ValdemarOrn&#x2F;PentatonicScales<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-22 11:11:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hpoe"],"id":[22941183],"kids":[22941874,22941273,22942808,22942884,22943039,22941654,22941958],"parent":[22940211],"text":["So I&#x27;ve been interested in learning prolog ever since I found out it was a language used for AI.

The single most basic debt to society that a government owes in return for paying taxes and agreeing to its rule is a monopoly on violence that&#x27;s fair and sufficient enough to prevent rampant criminality, yet Mexico suffers from the latter so severely that large swathes of the country are firmly outside the government&#x27;s supposed rule of law, and make small towns and regions have no choice but to take measures like these.<p>Who knows how sustainable this is, or its long term ramifications. What it definitely does do is further weaken that same government&#x27;s capacity for reestablishing its main responsibility.<p>The government of Mexico of course knows this, and so do the state governments that supposedly have authority over places like Cheran. For this reason (and for reasons of extreme corruption) they not only resent vigilante efforts like these or any attempts by private citizen groups to defend themselves with weapons or by other means, but also often actively, violently try to impede them &quot;legally&quot; despite not being able to replace these localized security measures with a useful reformation of their own.<p>This is done under the pretext that non-state armed security groupings are dangerous to public safety, but curiously, the same efforts at curbing heavily armed groups outside the law seem to evaporate when it comes to curbing the power and rampant impunity of cartels that also control whole regions much more viciously.<p>One of the reasons why? Unlike the people of Cheran or many private citizen defense groups, these cartels are typically colluding with the same politicians that claim armed vigilante activity as dangerous.

Perhaps in hindsight these managers will find that concentrating all of that cheap labor in pretty much just one geography (China) isn&#x27;t exactly the definition of redundancy, so supply chains in the long term will need to be redefined.<p>Slowly, geographies like Vietnam, Mexico, India and even the U.S. should benefit from this desire to diversify away from China.

Bell Labs and Xerox PARC invented a lot of the technologies that we rely on today, and there is still an untapped reservoir of research that has yet to be fully applied (I still believe that Smalltalk80 is quite futuristic in many ways despite its being 40 years old).  DARPA and its predecessor ARPA was key for funding a lot of fundamental computer science work.  Back in the 1960s ARPA had a funding model that emphasized &quot;funding people, not projects.&quot;  Alan Kay discusses this more at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;2017-12-30-alan&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;2017-12-30-alan&#x2F;<\/a>.<p>Unfortunately, since the 1990s (and possibly before then), both industry and government have shifted to the model of &quot;funding projects, not people,&quot; and there&#x27;s a greater emphasis on delivering short-term results instead of funding medium- and long-term research efforts.  There is also the PhD production problem, where more PhDs are being produced than there are research jobs available for them, whether they are in academia, government, or industry.  This results in plenty of computer science PhDs working as software engineers in non-research environments.  For a few years I&#x27;ve been considering becoming a professor at a teaching-oriented university; computer science professors have been in high demand at teaching universities for the past few years, and there are fewer &quot;publish-or-perish&quot; and funding pressures for teaching-oriented professors than for professors at research universities.  But now with the COVID-19 pandemic and the sudden shift to online education, I am concerned that this shift to online education, as well as the economic fallout of COVID-19, may dry up opportunities at teaching universities.<p>Because I still want to pursue a career in research even if traditional opportunities dry up, I am interested in alternative funding models that will ensure that researchers could still make a living in a world that demands instant results."],"time":["2020-04-22 11:44:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mootzville"],"id":[22943991],"kids":[22945316],"parent":[22941884],"text":["Funding is always limited, so if you are going to allocate funds with limited resources you might base it on a model nature provides: Diversity.<p>While there is no guaranteed way of choosing the right research to fund, an allocation of those funds among a set of common projects with similarities and dissimilarities would yield the most progress -- or at least, the highest probability of achieving progress.

There are already portable chest X-ray machines in the ICU. However, if a patient develops fluid around their lung (pleural effusion), lung POCUS can be used to guide a needle into the fluid pocket and drain it (thoracentesis).

Google&#x27;s processor would be more niche than Qualcomm&#x27;s (since manufacturers would need a Qualcomm modem to go with it rather than just grabbing an integrated Snapdragon modem&#x2F;CPU) and it would be smaller than Apple&#x27;s in sales since high-end Android phones aren&#x27;t the main part of that market.  This seems like one of those instances where people believe that Google can do better in any market.  Google is a great, smart company, but we&#x27;ve seen them fail a lot too.  Android Wear didn&#x27;t take off with Tizen becoming Samsung&#x27;s wearable OS and Google eventually buying Fitbit.  We saw Google buy Motorola just to sell them off as a failed experiment.  We&#x27;ve seen Google Fiber stall out as Google couldn&#x27;t make it work.  The Nexus&#x2F;Pixel line has been ok, but it hasn&#x27;t changed the industry.  Chromebooks seem to be fading.<p>Why should Google be able to enter the mobile CPU game and do better?<p>Not only that, but would manufacturers even want something better?  Manufacturers want customers to keep buying new phones as often as possible.  If Google comes out with a CPU that&#x27;s 70% better and could last a customer for 4-5 years, would they want to buy it?  Apple is really unique in that they&#x27;re the only company really giving you a good experience for an extended period of time.  But part of that is that Apple knows that a good device from them creates loyalty because there&#x27;s no iOS alternative.  If you&#x27;re an Android manufacturer, you know that a customer&#x27;s choice for their next device could be any number of different brands offering nearly identical Android experiences.<p>Does this even matter for Google?  What part of Google&#x27;s bottom line would this help?  More people using Android devices certainly helps, but would a better processor convince iPhone users to move to Android?<p>I guess I&#x27;m failing to see how a better processor helps Google enough to justify spending all the R&amp;D on it and why Google would be better at building this processor than the companies already creating mobile processors.  For Apple, it gives them a differentiator and the ability to control their platform and their destiny - and likely control their laptop platform in the near future.  They can specifically target the CPU and build what makes sense.  For Android, this CPU might be 10% of Android devices, but it wouldn&#x27;t become an assumption.  It wouldn&#x27;t create loyalty for a manufacturer since the same CPU&#x2F;OS combo could be had via other options.  We&#x27;re just talking about increasing the price and complexity of a device they don&#x27;t want to continue supporting anyway.<p>And I still haven&#x27;t seen why Google would be able to beat Qualcomm, Samsung, HiSilicon, etc."],"time":["2020-04-23 00:38:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baq"],"id":[22950600],"kids":[22950651,22952779,22952533,22950726],"parent":[22950174],"text":["i don&#x27;t care.<p>what i care about is that the cheapest iPhone has a longer support period than the most expensive Android. it&#x27;s actually insane and infuriating because I don&#x27;t even like Apple but there literally is no other choice if you don&#x27;t want to switch your phone every two years."],"time":["2020-04-22 23:55:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SECProto"],"id":[22950658],"kids":[22950849,22950813],"parent":[22950174],"text":["And yet, my cheap android phone has two things that are infinitely more important to me: an aux port and an SD card slot.

Slogging through the words, here&#x27;s the money shot:<p>&gt; A potential protective effect of smoking and of nicotine on SARS-CoV-2 infection has been noted. Until recently [39], no firm conclusions could be drawn from studies evaluating the rates of current smokers in Covid-19. All these studies [40-48], although reporting low rates of current smokers, ranging from 1.4% to 12.5%, did not take into account the main potential confounders of smoking including age and sex. In the study that two of us are reporting [1],  the rates of current smoking remain below 5 % even when main confounders for tobacco consumption, i.e. age and sex, in- or outpatient status, were considered. Compared to the French general population, the Covid-19 population exhibited a significantly weaker current daily smoker rate by 80.3 % for outpatients and by 75.4 % for inpatients. Thus, current smoking status appears to be a protective factor against the infection by SARS-CoV-2. Although the chemistry of tobacco smoke is complex, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that its protective role takes place through direct action on various types of nAChRs expressed in neurons, immune cells (including macrophages), cardiac tissue, lungs, and blood vessels.<p>Notice how this mess of a paragraph starts with a passive voice claim. Reference 39 is a meta-analysis that concludes that &quot;active smoking does not apparently seem to be signicantly [sic] associated with enhanced risk of progressing towards severe disease in COVID-19.&quot; That&#x27;s not a &quot;firm&quot; conclusion.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m going to stop wasting my time.

It was a collection of some 1-2 dozen papers regarding smoking and risk of infection for COVID19 as well as SARS and MERS.<p>What was clear from multiple papers  was that smokers were significantly less likely than the general population to test positive for these viruses, though their infections may be more severe. There is published evidence that nicotine may downregulate ACE2 receptors - which means fewer binding sites for potential infection.<p>I have a related pet theory that vaping may be doubly protective, considering that some 60 years ago,  propylene glycol was used as a surface disinfectant. Since vape juice is some 30-70% PG, and because the virus infects lung cells at the interface between air and blood, I&#x27;d bet good money that PG may have an effect in reducing viral load, at least prophylactically.

Find a study group for 2 hours per week! Don&#x27;t like your study group? Find a study group until you like one. Can&#x27;t find someone, then at least get your social media straight: find mathematicians you like on YouTube, Twitter and the like. Email them, ask them questions, who cares they&#x27;re busy? Consume their content (isn&#x27;t 3Blue1Brown motivating? ;-) ) and see if you can engage more with them.<p>- Competence: You&#x27;re too long stuck at a problem and you feel demotivated. Well the theory predicts that, so you need to find a way to see your progress. Either do this by getting easier problems to solve or get better feedback mechanisms. One way to do that is to reflect after the fact (when you solved the problem) how it is possible to be stuck for so long. Then the next time you get stuck, you can include this meta-process and reflect on it again, over time you&#x27;ll see yourself get better with this reflection. So now you get feedback from two things that are relating to each other!<p>- Autonomy: Do you feel forced to do something? Try to see if you can find a choice within the activity. I did this while studying, I chose to study &quot;how to study as fast as possible&quot;, suddenly I found any topic fascinating. This is why managers forcing a certain work style down employees their throats are hurting their intrinsic motivation. Allowing employees to find out about their own ways of working yields higher autonomy.<p>I&#x27;m always noticing that when I&#x27;m unmotivated that I&#x27;m sorely lacking in one of these three aspects, and in most cases it&#x27;s relatedness as I have no one to bounce my ideas around with.<p>So ask yourself when you&#x27;re really unmotivated, are you low on competence, autonomy or relatedness?

Ask them ‘how motivated are you’  before the meeting<p>Only possible in organizations with amazingly high trust. If people have an inkling of a fear to lose their jobs, this won&#x27;t work. Otherwise it would work because it will add some self-reflection to the both of you. I think the employee should also ask it back to the manager! The reason: being self reflective on each other&#x27;s motivation allows you to understand it and influence it for being more productive in a way that you feel happy about.<p>2. Start with a check-in about their general well-being<p>This a variant of #1, this shouldn&#x27;t be a different point.<p>3. Provide personalized feedback<p>This also has the &quot;requires super non-toxic&quot; working culture requirement. The idea works though, I think self-determination theory explains it quite will in their &quot;competence&quot; part.<p>4. Discuss the performance blockers and challenges<p>should be lumped together with 3, it&#x27;s part of feedback or the feedback is part of this discussion.<p>5. Follow up on previous action items<p>This improves reliability. I think this works in both toxic and non-toxic cultures.<p>6. Discuss  career growth<p>Anecdata: in my case I left a job because they offered me the position of backend developer after being a freelance full-stack developer for 3 months. I like full-stack and front-end if you can&#x27;t figure that out after 3 months, then you haven&#x27;t been paying attention and you don&#x27;t care about me. In hindsight I was right.<p>7. Be their mentor<p>This is also the fastest way to demotivate someone if the mentor doesn&#x27;t fit or is a bad mentor. I have both had good and bad mentors in my life. As with anything social, it&#x27;s an amplifier, what the sign of that amplifier is depends on the relationship you have with those people.<p>8. Make them feel valued<p>#5 should be in this one as well.<p>9. Accountability matters<p>Yea this is called healthy collaboration (FYI: they mean the manager must be accountable). It&#x27;s good to say it though! Despite it being so simple, one could forget it. A non-toxic work culture is required.<p>10. Recognition is important<p>Well yes, rewarding fairly is super important. Not only is it important for extrinsic motivation but if you&#x27;re crossing the sense of justice with an employee, then you&#x27;re screwing with intrinsic motivation as well! I wonder why the article didn&#x27;t say that. We all know that if someone feels not being fairly judged they start to rebel either covertly or overtly. I had this a lot in high school and I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be any different in the workplace, especially when I read all the HN comments that contain the phrase &quot;butts on seats&quot;.<p>-----<p>In conclusion: this article is mediocre. By skimming it I pointed to some structural issues it had. Moreover, most tips require a non-toxic work environment.<p>This should be actively stated as such! Because I think in some cases it&#x27;s simply not possible, some places are so financially tight that based on that you can simply deduce it&#x27;s going to be a lot of stress to work there for anyone.<p>Nevertheless, I think tip #5 while basic is really valuable since it&#x27;s a tip that could always be implemented to quite a high degree. Moreover, the tips themselves are important to be stated and none of the tips were wrong. In my opinion, a subtle wrong tip would be: always smile to your employee! They need to feel your positivity. &lt;-- That&#x27;s wrong because while positivity is important, so is vulnerability at times and this tip destroys it. They never erred like that.<p>And despite giving it perhaps such a &quot;harsh&quot; conclusion, I do still think the article has value. I simply don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any unique value that someone like Simon Sinek wouldn&#x27;t be able to give you in a more clear and coherent manner.<p>After reading this, I feel like I could&#x27;ve written a better article and I suspect this is simply a piece of content marketing for the company.<p>If so, then I dare the people of peoplebox.ai to hire me. I dare to put the money where my mouth is. I think I could do better. (I think a lot of people on HN could do better for that matter.

The managers I appreciated the most were also genuine.  Genuine is a state of being and there is no formula to create that state.  If there was, it would not longer be genuine.

The question raised (&quot;Is Stripe collecting this data for advertising?&quot;) can be readily answered in the negative.

(CAPTCHAs use similar techniques but result in more UI friction.) Stripe.js is part of the ML stack that helps us stop literally millions of fraudulent payments per day and techniques like this help us block fraud more effectively than almost anything else on the market. Businesses that use Stripe would lose a lot more money if it didn&#x27;t exist. We see this directly: some businesses don&#x27;t use Stripe.js and they are often suddenly and unpleasantly surprised when attacked by sophisticated fraud rings.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to use Stripe.js, you definitely don&#x27;t have to (or you can include it only on a minimal checkout page) -- it just depends how much PCI burden and fraud risk you&#x27;d like to take on.<p>We will immediately clarify the ToS language that makes this ambiguous.

That said, I think they need to make some changes. First of all, they should lay it out clearly that the tracking is high-resolution and includes mouse movement. Second, the tracking should be disabled by default and more closely tied to the usage of Radar. Most businesses don&#x27;t need Radar until they reach a certain scale. Stripe could encourage the use of Radar when the account transaction volume reaches a certain size and use that opportunity to explain the benefits of enabling the tracking system.

The first title I worked on I was building the graphics engine and animation systems.  Originally in C, then in MIPS assembler to get as much perf as possible: with a fixed target the difference for your title would be mostly down to the performance of the graphics engine.<p>I got to the point where I&#x27;d fitted the entire graphics engine and animation system into 4K, so it would fit in the instruction cache, and moved as much regularly used data into the 1K scratchpad as I could fit (Yes, an L1 cache that you decided manually what to put in it!).  Access to the scratchpad would take 1 cycle.<p>Then I&#x27;d <i>&#x27;hand interleave&#x27;<\/i> asm operations.  Reading from memory was slow, it took 4 cycles, which normally would be filled with NOPs by the C compiler (1 load instruction, 3 NOPs).  So, I&#x27;d use assembly instead of C and try to fill those NOPs with other actual operations that didn&#x27;t need the memory being requested, essentially doing hand-crafted concurrency.<p>Because loading and storing from&#x2F;to memory was such a common operation, this would make the code very, very hard to maintain, and sent me slightly crazy for a while!  Often it meant doing x, y, z operations (for 3D processing, like vector multiplication) concurrently, but wherever the the NOPs could be reduced, more could be done.<p>With various other bits of cunning I eventually got it to the point where I broke the manufacturers specs for whatever Sony said the PS could do per-second (memory is a bit fuzzy about what those specs were, but I remember myself and the team being pretty damn pleased at the time).<p>It was a fun machine to program for.

I seem to recall one 2D game that managed to have 24bpp gameplay but it was a clever hack more than anything else. Internally the GPU always functions at 24bpp however, it just dithers and truncates to RGB555 so an emulator can actually remove the truncation and run at 24bpp &quot;natively&quot;.<p>Beyond that some of the GPU&#x27;s limitations can be improved in emulators with more or less complicated hacks. In particular a modification called PGXP can be used to side-channel the depth and sub-pixel precision data to the GPU implementation to allow perspective correct and more precise rendering: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-SXT-y0vKv4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-SXT-y0vKv4<\/a><p>It doesn&#x27;t work perfectly with all games and it&#x27;s fairly CPU-intensive but it looks pretty decent when it works well.<p>&gt;MIDI sequencing: Apart from playing samples, this chip will also synthesise MIDI-encoded music.<p>I don&#x27;t know what that means. I implemented the SPU on my emulator a couple of weeks ago and I&#x27;m not really sure what that refers to.<p>&gt;The port of the controller and the Memory Card are electrically identical so the address of each one is hardcoded, Sony altered the physical shape of the ports to avoid accidents.<p>To expand on that: the interface always talks to both controller and memory card within the same slot, so when you talk to memory card 1 you also talk to whatever is plugged into the controller port 1. Then in the serial protocol the first byte tells who you&#x27;re talking to (0x01 for pad, 0x81 for mc), and the other device is supposed to see that and remain in high-z.<p>So actually plugging a memory card in a controller port (or vice-versa) would work, the problem would be if you plugged two memory cards or two controllers in the same port, in which case they&#x27;d speak on top of each other.<p>Beyond that the protocol to discuss with the memory card and especially gamepad is, in my opinion, absolutely insane. It&#x27;s over-complicated and under-featured. It&#x27;s also incredibly slow (especially for memory card access).<p>Regarding copy protection:<p>&gt;On the other side, this check is only executed once at the start, so manually swapping the disc just after passing the check can defeat this protection...<p>That works with most games, but later games were more clever: you could relock the drive and restart the init sequence early on to see if the drive really recognizes the disc.<p>It was also used as a protection against early modchips: since those would constantly stream the SCEx magic string to unlock the drive (instead of just during the first sectors like a real disc would) you could lock the drive, read some sectors that shouldn&#x27;t be able to unlock it then re-check. If the drive is unlocked you know there&#x27;s a modchip and you display a spooky message about piracy. Note that this technique would detect the modchip even when playing with an authentic disc so you&#x27;d effectively be unable to play the game at all on modded hardware."],"time":["2020-04-21 13:32:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["travbrack"],"id":[22932629],"kids":[22932840],"parent":[22932134],"text":["Spyro looked a lot better without the textures IMO"],"time":["2020-04-21 08:52:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justlexi93"],"id":[22933446],"kids":{},"parent":[22932134],"text":["The PlayStation was quite great: a straight forward to use machine with unparalleled (for its time) 3D capabilities.

Good to have locked it in.<p>I&#x27;ve been following this frontend-gets-fullstack-abilities trend for a while. I think Next.js is the best expression of this idea, and is truly the crown jewel of Vercel and also the React ecosystem.<p>Unlike other React distros like Gatsby or Create-React-App, Next.js is the first &quot;hybrid&quot; framework that lets you choose whether to deploy static or serverless pages on a per page level. This means you can ship features without being locked into app level architectural choices. Even static pages get a &quot;Preview&quot; mode, solving a key pain point for content workflow. (all with the caveat that you must use a hosting setup capable of supporting these features, and naturally Vercel is the best place to do that if you don&#x27;t want to roll your own). A few months ago Dan Abramov noted[0]:<p>&gt; The next wave of techniques won’t be about putting everything on the client. Or doing everything on the server. It will let you move code between them without friction, and adjust the tradeoff to the use case. Take advantage of both. The Middle Way.<p>I see Next.js as the way most of the ecosystem will experience this colocation of client and server concerns.<p>The other trend I see is that React is continuing to work on  integrated client-and-server experiences. (Note: everything I discuss here are experimental projects by the React team, so should not be taken as an official roadmap). React Suspense&#x27;s introduction [1] was strongly tied to Relay, which introduces a compiler that offers stronger client-server guarantees for working with GraphQL [2]. React Flight will offer streaming server side rendering [3], while React Blocks will offer a generic way to suspend on queries without such strong coupling to GraphQL [4].<p>I expect that Next.js will also be the first place most React devs experience these improvements (they may be more under the hood by the time it rolls out), and naturally Vercel benefits.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s also fun to speculate on the future of Vercel outside of being &quot;hosted Next.js&quot;. Guillermo&#x27;s blogpost [5] has the appealing tagline &quot;AWS for frontend developers&quot;. How many of those great logos that run Next.js is Vercel actually capturing? Is Vercel appealing enough to them that they also host non-Next.js projects with Vercel? Can we view Vercel as a &quot;No Code backend&quot;? Can Vercel deepen its 3rd party integrations to become a true marketplace&#x2F;aggregator of frontend demand for backend&#x2F;api services? What, fundamentally, is Vercel selling other than bandwidth, serverless functions, and devops-as-a-service software? Maybe that&#x27;s plenty.<p>---<p>references<p>0: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;1193001108102373376\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;1193001108102373376<\/a><p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;building-great-user-experiences-with-concurrent-mode-and-suspense.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;building-great-user-expe...<\/a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;zth&#x2F;relay-the-graphql-client-that-wants-to-do-the-dirty-work-for-you-55kd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;zth&#x2F;relay-the-graphql-client-that-wants-to-do...<\/a><p>3: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dtsi1q&#x2F;react_flight&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dtsi1q&#x2F;react_fligh...<\/a><p>4: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;1239013168682274816\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;1239013168682274816<\/a><p>5: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rauchg.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;vercel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rauchg.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;vercel<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-21 12:53:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["erulabs"],"id":[22935014],"kids":{},"parent":[22933479],"text":["Congratulations on the funding Guillermo!"],"time":["2020-04-21 15:56:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crousto"],"id":[22935270],"kids":{},"parent":[22933479],"text":["Judging by the comments so far, the name change backlash is of unseen-since-Qwikster proportions…"],"time":["2020-04-21 16:34:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marban"],"id":[22933982],"kids":{},"parent":[22933479],"text":["From unbrandable to unpronounceable."],"time":["2020-04-21 13:38:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ezzzzz"],"id":[22934194],"kids":[22934240],"parent":[22933479],"text":["Literally just discovered Zeit, what I liked about it was the ability to choose different run-times, with a generous free tier, with none of the existential baggage of the other PAAS&#x27;s options out there.

The specifics of various cases have been different, but generally something happens that would force the issue (often an office move -- don&#x27;t know why we need to do that so much), and some people either need to leave the company or work remotely. In those cases, accommodations were usually eventually made for people seen as indispensable while others were let go (in one way or another). This is across various management regimes. One time there was a hard-line stance, &quot;move or be laid off&quot;. There was a months long game of chicken, but in the end it was the management that was replaced. (Not necessarily for that -- they made various counter-productive decisions.)<p>* I think another reason for the higher pay may be that (IMO) you really do need to be a better communicator as a remote employee. I think most people working remotely become significantly better communicators, over time, and that translates to more senior positions and pay."],"time":["2020-04-21 17:55:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["k__"],"id":[22936345],"kids":[22938178],"parent":[22935476],"text":["When I see payment for devs here in Germany, it&#x27;s no surprise.<p>I had the feeling, that US devs make about double of what German companies are paying.<p>So now I make more money and add to the exports that everyone in Germany seems to be so happy about :D"],"time":["2020-04-21 18:19:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jillesvangurp"],"id":[22943160],"kids":{},"parent":[22935476],"text":["For some people it is a bit of a revelation that this can work, at all.

The mean of a power law distribution is always higher than the media.  Hence, if you remove geographic barriers to software development work, the majority of software developers will see their salaries increase.  This comes at the expense of a few developers in high-paying areas (Silicon Valley, SF, NYC), who will see their salaries dramatically decreased.  We already see this - as someone living in Silicon Valley, I can&#x27;t take the vast majority of remote jobs because they don&#x27;t pay enough to live on here.<p>Someone&#x27;s inevitably going to ask &quot;If salaries are so unsustainably high in Silicon Valley, why do companies keep hiring there and paying those unsustainable salaries?&quot;<p>And the answer to that is that <i>opportunities are not normally distributed<\/i>.  In today&#x27;s consumer markets, consumers don&#x27;t split their dollars evenly between all firms providing a good, they tend to overwhelmingly go for the best product available in that market, particularly if that product gets on the market early.  And that means going for a location where you have deep talent pools in the many subspecialties needed to build that best product, and putting them all in one cube farm so that communication costs between them are at an absolute minimum.  Silicon Valley&#x27;s wage premium is a consequence of growth and of consumer herd behavior: if everybody either thought entirely for themselves or bought solely based on price without regards to features, distributed teams would have an advantage.<p>It&#x27;s a very similar phenomena as globalization.  In the 80s all of America enjoyed a large wage premium over all of the rest of the world.  As globalization broke down labor &amp; trade barriers and innovation slowed, the trend has been toward &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot;, which means that the factory worker in America will make something close to what the factory maker in China makes.  Global median wages rise (which they have done, substantially), but the gains are at the cost of the majority of American wages, with the exception of a few professions (tech, finance, some marketing) that have substantial skill-based barriers to entry.
