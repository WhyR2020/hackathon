It feels like a more sensible choice, including for their own business safety in case Google does some sneaky move to &quot;streamline their development&quot; and &quot;focus on the next generation of smartphones and Fuchsia OS&quot; or something like that.

(again, I get that not everyone here agrees with that) For whatever reason, Google has the resources and talent to make a browser that is preferred to the alternatives, by most regular users.<p>Chromium based Edge allows users to get the best of Chrome without the worst of Google. Google knows that if they get too aggressive with decisions that are biased toward Google&#x27;s bottom line (such as how they handle ad blocking and various privacy features), Microsoft can easily push back by changing these decisions in Edge. This is a very good thing.<p>True, there is also pressure on Google from Firefox (people can abandon Chrome for Firefox if Google is too aggressive), and there is also Brave (and others) if you want the benefits of Chrome&#x2F;Chromium without the worst stuff.

For example: I <i>think<\/i> that Firefox gives me a bit of additional privacy.  I <i>think<\/i> that Safari gives me that additional privacy as well.  Some people may feel like Chrome just works.  Some people just use what came with their OS.<p>When I do front end work, I tend to always test it in Chrome first.  Their devtools make that part of my job (quickly finding issues with the frontend) a lot easier.  Once it works in Chrome, I&#x27;m sure that the code is working, and any problems I encounter will just require browser-specific tweaks.<p>Anyway, long story short...I think that Microsoft really needs to pick something that Edge is best at if they want people to have a reason to use it (PS loading a highly browser-optimized page some number of milliseconds faster than the competition just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, personally).  Their niche has always just kind of been &quot;well it&#x27;s what comes with the OS&quot; - and that&#x27;s a fine way to get a userbase for sure.  I&#x27;m not faulting them - but if that&#x27;s their intended userbase, then I feel like they&#x27;re putting a lot of effort into this whole browser game.<p>I guess at the end of the day, I don&#x27;t <i>trust<\/i> IE or Edge or Chrome for my every day use.

Full disclosure: I&#x27;m in advertising.<p>The researcher states that increasing &quot;aspiration&quot; (their term) leads to dissatisfaction and more unhappiness. Sure! But aspiration is also why we invented the wheel, harnessed fire, founded fancy schools like Harvard, try to be good parents, etc. I don&#x27;t disagree that ambition and aspiration can make a person unhappy. But it&#x27;s also what drives literally all human progress.<p>So unless you believe primitive man was living their best life and that everything that has happened since then is a regression (and certainly some people hold that view), I find it hard to swallow that aspirations are a bad thing.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a negative to them. But virtually every good thing people have ever done was because of their aspirations.<p>Therefore I don&#x27;t agree with the notion that advertising is inherently bad because it raises people&#x27;s expectations for themselves. I consider that a good thing even if it comes at the cost of a decrease in personal happiness.<p>HOWEVER (I can feel your hatred), there&#x27;s a difference between motivating people to aspire to better things vs simply making them feel shitty about themselves so they&#x27;ll buy your crap.<p>ex: When a fashion brand shows impossibly attractive people wearing their clothes, they&#x27;re not showing us how to live better lives. They&#x27;re simply making us feel shitty for not being models, and then hoping we&#x27;ll make the conclusion that we&#x27;d look better if we bought those clothes. That doesn&#x27;t make anyone&#x27;s life better. That&#x27;s just a shit sandwich all around.<p>ex: When a tech company shows us a bunch of people being really productive using their products, it can inspire us to want to be more productive. If their product truly can make us more productive (like the invention of the PC... no reasonable person would argue that PCs didn&#x27;t make us more productive, right?), then that&#x27;s great.<p>ex: Pharmaceutical drugs have been a fantastic boon for humanity. We rely on them constantly to extend our lives and improve our quality of life. Yet some (many?) drugs are nowhere near as beneficial as they are advertised (I&#x27;m looking at you, Fentanyl).<p>So I think the question is simply: does the product actually improve our lives in the way the advertising suggests? Or is it just a bait-and-switch?<p>Advertising isn&#x27;t inherently bad, any more than aspirations are inherently bad. It boils down to what&#x27;s being advertised and how honest the ads are about it."],"time":["2020-01-15 17:16:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["screye"],"id":[22059864],"kids":{},"parent":[22054715],"text":["One pretty tangential anecdote.<p>My university enforced a no-laptop-no-internet rule (back in the 2011, 2G internet era in India) for our Freshman year.<p>It was the single best year of my life.<p>Me, a person who had grown up on and shaped by the internet, quickly realized how little of it mattered to my happiness after a few days away from it.<p>It made me realize how subjective things like happiness and satisfaction are.

We basically do it row-by-row: as the people in front of them leave, people in a row get up, get their bags, start walking down the line, and this cascades up the plane. The problem is that there is very little parallelism: while people in the next row to leave are getting their bags, no one is exiting the plane.<p>This is similar to a stall in a processor pipeline. We want to avoid stalls, which mean that we want people exiting the plane constantly. A <i>column<\/i> approach would work much better: people in the aisle get their bags before the doors open, and start leaving as soon as it does. As columns drain, the next column can get their bags and start to leave. This approach keeps people leaving constantly, while also keep the aisle constantly populated. Yes, the person in the last column in the back row still leaves last, but I claim they will leave sooner. (edit: Thinking about it more, I actually think the people in the last column in the <i>front<\/i> row leave last. If you&#x27;re in the back row, second column, you can stand up as soon as the person in the first column in front of you has started walking out. After the first column to leave, people will exit in reverse order because the openings will appears back-to-front. Trying to maintain front-row &quot;fairness&quot; will just result in a period of time where no one is in the aisle.)<p>The reason we do the row-by-row method, I think, is that our sense of fairness is influenced by who we&#x27;re looking at and proximity. We look forward, and we feel that the people closer to the door &quot;should&quot; leave first because they&#x27;re closer, and we&#x27;re looking at them, so we feel bad if we hold them up. But by doing the row-by-row method, we&#x27;re holding up everyone <i>behind us<\/i>, but we don&#x27;t look at them as much.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to enforce a column-by-column exit.

I suggest folks give the school a Google search as it has rapidly developed to become a phenomenonal environment with its own startup incubator and entrepreneurshi&#x27; degree with courses from VCs. I digress, but feel free to ask me any more questions about the school.<p>The dev degree program started its first cohort last year actually and it now is in its second year.<p>It is structured so students work 20 hours a week at Shopify and take 3 courses per semester at school. Students are required to work and go to school through the summer which allows them to complete the degree in the standard four years.<p>My peers in the program have I said great things. One of the key parts of the program is how one switches between different teams to get a better understanding of the software engineering landscape. Moreover the mentorship is very helpful and not only developing your technical skills by yourself skills.<p>One question that students and parents asked me a lot is if there is a requirement to work at Shopify following the completion of the program. Luckily Shopify has made it clear that they will not be expecting students to stay once they complete their degree, but it is my intuition that many people from the program will stay on after their large time investment into the Shopify ecosystem.<p>Overall, I would have entered this program myself for it for engineering students as well. Sadly, the program is restricted to computer science students as the Canadian accreditation requirements for engineering are not fulfilled while in the dev degree program.<p>Although people may say &quot;why do you need a degree?&quot;, it is difficult to find a job without the qualification of showing your ability to complete post-secondary in a field of candidates that did.<p>With initiatives such as Silicon Valley trip for students run by the Lassonde co-op Department, I am sure that lassonde will continue to innovate and engage students in meaningful ways beyond the traditional methods."],"time":["2020-01-15 15:14:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["swyx"],"id":[22051170],"kids":[22053113,22052151,22051714,22051573,22051512,22051923,22053116,22051492],"parent":[22050806],"text":["i am wishing i could go back 15 years and do this now. i was dumb enough to go to an ivy league for an unrelated degree, then change careers and go thru a bootcamp, and i&#x27;m now still 100&#x27;s of thousands in debt. if i was growing up today i would absolutely drop everything to do this. kudos to shopify but it really feels a little bittersweet."],"time":["2020-01-15 03:07:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["greenie_beans"],"id":[22054510],"kids":[22054587,22054562,22055108,22055044],"parent":[22050806],"text":["This is cool.

I&#x27;d recommend using a mix of SSDs at different lifetimes, and&#x2F;or different manufacturers, in a RAID configuration.<p>How different manufacturers deal with running SMART tests under load drastically varies. Samsung tests always take the same amount of time. The length of Intel tests vary depending on load. Micron SMART tests get stuck if they are under constant load. Seagate SMART tests appear to report being at 90% done or complete, but the tests do actually run.<p>Different SSDs also are more or less tolerant to power changes.

Follow on matching is very low.<p>* That&#x27;s right, pretty much 1 in 5 doctors will not go on to practice medicine because they cannot get a residency position.<p>* Residency salaries are complete shit. It&#x27;s not unheard of for residents to have to take out loans to payback loans during residency.<p>* Resident have absolutely no leverage.

I&#x27;m going to try and shed some light on them. (HN says my post is too big, so I&#x27;ll have to split up a bit).<p>There are four major groups of physicians:<p>-Residents. These are the folks that just completed medical school, and are doing four-plus years of training in a hospital setting to become independently practicing physicians. In year one they are called interns. By year three or four they have various amounts of independence: in internal medicine, family medicine, etc. they are basically practicing as full physicians, with some light supervision (the heavy supervision is years one and two). They are one of the hospitals most valuable employees: taking into account supervision costs, they are producing about 80-90% of the revenue of a &quot;real&quot; physician, for less than 1&#x2F;4 the cost. These are the guys who work 80+ hours per week without exception, do all the scut, etc. These are <i>not<\/i> &quot;mid career physicians&quot;. This is where &quot;old physicians had to go through it, so young physicians have to go through it.&quot;<p>--Resident Training: the AMA has been pushing to expand resident training spots for years. The funding is part of Medicare legislation, and <i>no one<\/i> has been willing to back expanding medicare spending in the name of training physicians. I know the AMA has been backing this because <i>I&#x27;ve attended the Region 7 and national meetings where the resolution to push for it has been passed, repeatedly<\/i>. Literally, hit DDG and enter &quot;AMA restricted residency training funding&quot; and your entire page of results is the opposite. They may have done so <i>more than a generation ago<\/i>, but... let&#x27;s move onto things that were done by, and affect, people not currently retired, eh?<p>-Hospitalists. These guys have completed their residency training, and elected to work for a hospital, doing in-hospital medicine. Their specialty is &quot;hospital medicine.&quot; They have no private clinic, no private patients, and are paid a salary by the hospital. Whether this is an integrated system like Kaiser, or ... <i>every<\/i> other hospital in the market, they&#x27;re very common. Their practice patterns are heavily dictated by the hospital, which is heavily dictated by the Centers for Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid Services and the major insurers. Their work is increasingly focused strictly on documentation, since documentation is the way that CMS and insurers (a) find excuses to refuse reimbursement, and (b) the way that CMS and insurers outsource collection of &quot;quality&quot; information, by forcing docs to structure their input in very discrete ways. These physicians don&#x27;t have to deal with billing directly, but they are constantly being pulled into trainings for the ways documentation requirements are constantly evolving, the ways in which payors want them order tests and in what order, etc. They constantly get phone calls from &quot;helpful billing people&quot; raking them over the coals whenever there&#x27;s a mistake. THe hospital keeps running tallies and reports on doctors&#x27; mistakes in this arena, aiming for public pillorying and, ultimately, withheld wages. (Docs don&#x27;t generally get bonuses, they get withheld wages - except for high-revenue services like procedures, where they may get a bonus for very high productivity.) These are &quot;mid career physicians.&quot; They tend to work an official 10-12 hour day, ten days on, ten days off. In reality, due to documentation requirements, and the fact that they get more patients than anyone could ever see and document in 10-12 hours, they tend to work 14+.<p>-Private Practice. These guys completed their residency and either opened their own private practice (almost no one can do that these days, with the complexity of the documentation and EMRs required by CMS and insurers, and attendant overhead costs) or have become employed by such a practice with the medium-term goal of buying in as a partner. They are likewise having their arms heavily twisted by insurers and CMS, without any sort of leverage to fight back and negotiate better terms. These guys are going out of business left and right. These are &quot;mid career physicians.&quot; Hours worked here are highly variable, depending on the specific practice pattern, number of employees and partners, etc.<p>-&quot;Private Practice.&quot; Because of the complexities and overhead that are now required to stay open, many practices... can&#x27;t. They sell to a local hospital - often at cost - and become hospital employees. The hospital offers solid salaries for the first couple of years, and then drives them out, replacing them with younger employees.  Many of the &quot;private practices&quot; you go to are thus actually practices run by the hospital, with an employee acting as the physician. These are &quot;mid career physicians.&quot; These tend to work 9-5 with one evening hour a week, or none. The spread of this is why no one can find a doctor to see in the evenings anymore.<p>Key to Understanding Medical Reimbursement:<p>This is not a free market. It is fee for service. You get a patient visit, it is coded as a particular service (usually a Level 3 Evaluation &amp; Management), and a fixed amount of reimbursed, assuming you meet various documentation requirements. If you do not, the amount is decreased or denied altogether. Private insurers peg their fee schedules to CMS, so CMS - directly or indirectly - drives all physician reimbursement. If you own a geographic area (such as part of a sweeping hospital network), that network will negotiate better reimbursement (e.g., &quot;112% of Medicare&quot;), but that is not passed along to employee physicians. Total revenue for a physician is amount of work-time per year divided by time-per-average-service, times reimbursement-per-average-service.<p>That&#x27;s it; that&#x27;s your cap.<p>Thus, most services patients want are strictly cost centers. The sort of things that other businesses compete on - e.g., ambiance, good front desk staff - are problematic for physicians, because you can&#x27;t pass that along to patients in moderately higher prices. The only way you can compete on service, and be free to set your prices accordingly, is to refuse all insurance and only take cash patients. There are vanishingly few such patients, largely due to a cultural expectation that insurance = healthcare. Actually paying cash for a primary care physician, at least, isn&#x27;t that expensive, but since that doesn&#x27;t cover all of your other healthcare costs, who can afford to pay that extra premium? Only upper-middle-class and up."],"time":["2020-01-15 19:59:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trey-jones"],"id":[22057549],"kids":{},"parent":[22055479],"text":["While I was having a vasectomy late last year I had a conversation with the doctor performing the surgery.

Classical liberal policies would change everything in the market.<p>In particular, there are a few things that crush doctors:<p>Problem: Cost of education: You require licenses per-state, and a license can be gotten only after a very grueling and expensive educational process in the half a million dollars range or more in student debt.<p>Solution: Make it legal to practice medicine with foreign education licenses. Doctors can study in countries where the education is free or nearly-free.<p>----<p>Problem: Too few people go into the medical profession per-capita in the US. Currently a 20-year in practice specialist doctor from any other country has to go through a lowly paid residency in the US to be able to exercise, plus compete in the very narrow H1B visa space.<p>Solution: Make a special purpose visa for medical professionals (Nurses &amp; Doctors) and allow them to practice medicine.<p>----<p>Problem: Malpractice insurance is extremely expensive due to the high levels of litigation in the medical profession, that far outstrip the typical responsibility of a professional. Some specializations require insurance of thousands of dollars a month!<p>Solution: Allow for malpractice waivers that let doctors practice at a cheaper rate, and let patients decide what kind of risk they are willing to get or not.<p>----<p>Problem: US has the lowest level of Primary Care doctors per capita of developed nations in great part because they are the least protected specialization by the AMA which is mostly compromised by specialty doctors. One rule made here is that PCP&#x27;s cannot collect &#x27;kickbacks&#x27; or revenue by referring patients to a speciality doctor, and thus the PCP works for free to provide referrals to specialists.<p>Solution: Allow for transparent processes of verticalization and monetization, which will bring PCP&#x27;s to a more natural rate count.<p>----<p>Problem: The government subsidizes medical insurance by making it tax exempt. This makes it so everyone gets insurance through their employer which in turn makes it impossible for a doctor to compete with the insurance model that is tax exempt by being  all-cash. The tax benefit allows insurance companies an oligopoly against small practices.<p>Solution: Eliminate insurance through employer and&#x2F;or get rid of the tax exemption.<p>----<p>Problem: The government pays a higher revenue rate if the medical practice is digitalized. This has pushed the entire industry into using electronic records to get that revenue boost long before its time, producing terrible technical solutions. (The biggest player in the space, Epic, collections millions of dollars a year per hospital and its made in Visual Basic)<p>Solution: Get rid of all electronic record requirement laws, subsidies, programs, etc.<p>----<p>I can keep going.

Addressing their three main points in turn:<p>&gt; <i>1. Increased height for a better reading experience<\/i><p>A high x-height is good for coding fonts, but this x-height is now <i>too<\/i> high. To my eye, this is now at the point where lowercase letters are getting <i>harder to distinguish<\/i> from uppercase letters at a glance, so instead of increasing legibility it&#x27;s actually decreasing it now. There&#x27;s a good reason most other coding fonts haven&#x27;t gone <i>this<\/i> high.<p>&gt; <i>2. The shape of ovals approaches that of rectangular symbols.<\/i><p>Again, this is a problem because it makes letterforms <i>harder<\/i> to distinguish. It&#x27;s important that the right side of a &quot;b&quot; look very different from an &quot;h&quot;... but if you make the right side of the &quot;b&quot; very straight, they look more similar. The whole point of letterforms is to be easy to <i>differentiate<\/i> from each other, not to make them more similar.<p>&gt; <i>3. JetBrains Mono’s typeface forms are simple and free from unnecessary details... The easier the forms, the faster the eye perceives them and the less effort the brain needs to process them.<\/i><p>Again, this is just factually false, or else all books would be printed in sans-serif body text instead of serif. The main reason serif fonts are used is that all their extra &quot;details&quot; make reading <i>easier<\/i>, not harder -- because the eye has more clues to differentiate letters. Now because of resolutions of screens, sans-serif is still sometimes a better choice on computer screens, but this makes distinctiveness of letterforms even <i>more<\/i> important, not less.<p>For example, they choose a single-story instead of double-story lowercase &quot;g&quot;, which is just harder for the eye to distinguish from a &quot;q&quot;. Getting rid of the stem on a &quot;u&quot; also makes it less distinguishable, and harder to read.

Personally, I insist on typescript on any node.js or frontend javascript codebase these days.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s not perfect. And, yes the inherent problems of javascript still leak through in many places. But with a little configuration, you can make the static code analyzer and compiler help you avoid most of that.<p>IMHO the amount of verbosity it adds is negligible. I actually measured a slight decrease in LOC when I was converting code. You add some type annotations (which IMHO also help human code readers) but then you also get access to syntactic sugar to offset that. It&#x27;s a fair compromise considering that most tools trying to help the developer have more to go on and basically work much better. Ballpark your number of LOC is not going to grow when switching to typescript.<p>But IMHO it&#x27;s just a gateway drug for developers to find their way to more capable languages. Personally, I&#x27;m interested in the direction that Jetbrains is taking with Kotlin-js, which with the next version will have some nice tooling around it to leverage typescript type definitions for integrating npms and hides most of the build tool madness behind gradle. The kotlin compiler has a much more sound&#x2F;strict typesystem than typescript and also the language has quite a few language features that the typescript developers have not gotten around to supporting yet (they&#x27;ve been making progress catching up with recent releases though). They are also addressing size of the minified code. With the recent improvements, hello world is now a lot more reasonable than it used to be (&lt;80kb instead of ~1MB). It eliminated unused code more effectively.<p>If you feel brave, you can get started with this on a modern react project right away. Most of the dependencies you&#x27;d use for that should just work fine with kotlin-js. But realistically it&#x27;s probably going to take another few years to stabilize. IMHO Kotlin is interesting because it is already widely used by frontend developers on Android and has a lively ecosystem of frameworks that might also make sense in a browser. Also co-routines are nicer than async await in typescript.<p>And of course WASM is opening up this space further to just about any language.

And all practical languages have strings, which are kind of a lowest common denominator when it comes to dealing with a type system that simply can&#x27;t express what you need.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;csharp&#x2F;language-reference&#x2F;keywords&#x2F;unsafe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;csharp&#x2F;language-refe...<\/a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flow.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;types&#x2F;any&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flow.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;types&#x2F;any&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-16 05:09:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bigodines"],"id":[22056648],"kids":[22056922,22056713,22056711],"parent":[22055341],"text":["yes"],"time":["2020-01-15 19:08:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22061261],"kids":{},"parent":[22055341],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-16 03:47:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["tekkk"],"id":[22059051],"kids":{},"parent":[22055341],"text":["TypeScript is great as long your business logic and typings stay simple.

I used to write c# and javascript all day. Every time I had to write javascript, it was much more enjoyable than writing the c#. I would often have to create classes purely because the language required them. All of these classes all over the place with no methods in them at all. A whole bunch of typing all over the place that I could tell I was never even mentally parsing, but still having to type and see on the screen.<p>Then I started working on my own and decided to use Node a lot in the situations where I would have to use c# at my previous job. There were no more bugs, no problems with refactoring, and it was much more enjoyable than writing c#.<p>Now this TypeScript is infecting javascript, and all the jobs and so on require &quot;typescript&quot; instead of javascript. It puts all the things I didn&#x27;t like about c# back into javascript. People will make all kinds of ridiculous claims that it is irresponsible not to use TypeScript, and that it improves productivity and so on. None of these claims are true and don&#x27;t get to the real reason that TypeScript exists.<p>Most well-structured programs aren&#x27;t one giant function that is hard to refactor. They are usually a series of isolated, small functions. There is even a trend towards &quot;microservices&quot; and function as a service and so on. These are things that reduce the claimed reasons for TypeScript, rather than increase it. Many times I see the reason for using TypeScript being &quot;it is good for large teams&quot;. Yet still, I see it used in teams of 3 people all the time.<p>The real reason TypeScript is used is because there are a very large number of programmers now, which means the quality of the average programmers is much lower than it has ever been. Many people who program often just copy and paste code from stack overflow. Many of these people were the same people who looked in fear at JavaScript, and couldn&#x27;t even understand it because it wasn&#x27;t the one language that they knew. TypeScript gives these people more safety, feedback, and familiarity to be able to do their job.<p>That is fine, but lets not pretend it is anything else."],"time":["2020-01-16 06:50:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ditonal"],"id":[22056784],"kids":[22057075,22061552,22060954,22061434,22059938,22061588,22057038,22057151,22062375,22061151,22056953,22061829],"parent":[22055940],"text":["Founders want employees to have the founder mentality without giving them founder equity.

It’s kind of a “hierarchy of needs”. You need time, and money — and sometimes neither seem to be available.<p>I can’t do the whole thing justice here, but for the sake of advancing my point — it begins with sorting out what’s urgent and important from what’s trivial and unimportant, and learning to be proactive. Personal finance is something to consider as well, because saving and reducing expenses can buy you some additional flexibility in your life.<p>With some spare time and money, you get to the question of — what do I do next? How do I learn, where do I start? Personally, I think the best way to learn is to build something! Build something that you’re passionate about, and try to solve a problem. Then, see if you can demonstrate value to others — speak to real people who use your product, empathize, and try to make it better.<p>In terms of big company vs startup, both — like anything — have their ups-and-downs.

The part that&#x27;s misleading is &quot;Haskell is based on category theory&quot;: while a major feature of programming in Haskell (the monad abstraction) was <i>inspired by<\/i> category theory, the truth is that moment-to-moment programming in Haskell doesn&#x27;t have much to do with category theory unless you want it to. Even monads require zero knowledge of category theory in order to understand or use! Some people find usefulness in category-theoretic abstractions, but many others—myself included!—don&#x27;t at all: I&#x27;ve actually improved the performance of Haskell code in the past by cutting out category-theoretic abstractions in favor of simpler code, and by now I steer clear of most Haskell code that wears category theory on its sleeve.<p>The part that&#x27;s boring is that &quot;Haskell is based on lambda calculus&quot;. The lambda calculus is a mathematical description of a simplified model of computation with functions and binding… and that&#x27;s basically it. Almost every modern programming language uses variable binding as a basic feature, and in that sense, is &quot;based on lambda calculus&quot;. Plenty of other languages, for example, are inspired deeply by Lisps (like JavaScript or Ruby) which in turn were directly inspired by the lambda calculus, but I don&#x27;t think that lineage makes them particularly math-like. Instead, being &quot;based on lambda calculus&quot; usually just means that they have variables and closures—something true of almost every popular language used today!<p>Now, Haskell-as-practiced can have a fair bit of math-inspired abstraction in it, which can be daunting to someone new to Haskell. Some of that abstraction is useful (e.g. monads), some of it isn&#x27;t, but the fact that it exists is more about vocal Haskell programmers and bloggers, and much less about Haskell-the-language being &quot;heavily founded on mathematical theories&quot;. And you&#x27;ll also find plenty of programmers and bloggers arguing <i>against<\/i> the more math-heavy parts of the ecosystem: just in the past month I&#x27;ve seen plenty of Haskell programmers passing around links like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplehaskell.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplehaskell.org&#x2F;<\/a> which advocates for exactly this less-mathy approach to Haskell."],"time":["2020-01-16 00:23:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alephu5"],"id":[22047915],"kids":[22059130],"parent":[22044262],"text":["I&#x27;ve been been learning haskell by building a standard monolithic web application: Postgres DB, some static content, REST API and firebase authentication.

Thank you all for your interest in this project. This website is still under construction, and we&#x27;re well aware that it&#x27;s severely lacking in information, I&#x27;ll try to find some time to update everything. Unfortunately marketing is not one of my skills.<p>The cleaner architecture is the whole point of the exercise.<p>I&#x27;m trying to avoid arguments why this would be &quot;better&quot; than anything else. Just some examples of things that I personally don&#x27;t like about IP, and that Ouroboros does differently. These points may not matter to you, and that is perfectly fine. I&#x27;m not a salesman trying to make a sell.<p>1) IP (and Ethernet etc) has source addresses in every packet. Ouroboros negotiates them at the start of the communication, and only has the destination address in the packets. This improves end-user privacy a great deal.<p>2) The Ouroboros end-to-end protocol, (which has the RTT estimator and retransmisison timeout (RTO) timer), runs in the library between the actual server and client programs. It runs at sub-millisecond accuracy. If there is an underestimation of RTT, at worst it retransmits a few extra packets (See 3). But these improve the RTT estimate.<p>3) Default TCP congestion control doesn&#x27;t play nice in lossy situations, having severe issues with throughput because of AIMD. Ouroboros completely splits the network and end-to-end protocol. Therefore the architecture only allows congestion control using Forward ECN at the network protocol (and only the network protocol). This is similar to the operation of DCTCP, but DCTCP has the ECN in the network protocol (IP), and the notification in the end-to-end protocol (TCP). I&#x27;m not fond of that as a solution (however, if I would run a commercial datacenter, I would run DCTCP, no doubt about that).<p>4) The Ouroboros end-to-end protocol is based on Delta-t, which doesn&#x27;t require the 3-way handshake of TCP. It does have a two-way handshake (called flow allocation) to negotiate endpoints and the peer addresses (as to avoid sending src in every packet). But it can also do a ECDHE key exchange at that time. So it can establish an encrypted end-to-end connection in 1 RTT. The implementation still does it in 2 phases, (it&#x27;s on my to-do list to piggyback the public keys).<p>5) Ouroboros has 2 types of layers, one for unicast and one for broadcast. This is where I think it really shines. The broadcast layer allows easy implementation of what is known as a &quot;multicast service&quot;. A PoC is in the obc program.<p>Some of this may still seem nebulous, and I apologize. It&#x27;s an unfunded pet project. But if I find interested people that ask interested questions, it will help me to update the documentation and make things more digestible&#x2F;palatable.<p>Thank you again for your interest."],"time":["2020-01-15 22:06:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["drummer"],"id":[22057518],"kids":[22058766],"parent":[22052416],"text":["I read the overview and it sounds a lot like QuantumGate <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantumgate.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantumgate.org&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-15 20:24:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["magdemsolrem"],"id":[22056119],"kids":{},"parent":[22052416],"text":["I&#x27;m fairly new to decentralization technology and web3, how would this relate to let&#x27;s say libp2p?"],"time":["2020-01-15 18:23:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gz5"],"id":[22055846],"kids":{},"parent":[22052416],"text":["very promising - looking forward to digging in and seeing the architecture.<p>i like the developer focus, e.g. use the C library to write ouroboros-native programs.  from a developer perspective, what types of developers for what types of use cases would benefit the most by leveraging ouroboros?"],"time":["2020-01-15 17:55:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bn7t"],"id":[22054198],"kids":[22054324],"parent":[22052416],"text":["Is this similar to cjdns or yggdrasil?"],"time":["2020-01-15 15:07:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["__s"],"id":[22060665],"kids":{},"parent":[22053747],"text":["Well written piece on expected value. Something he doesn&#x27;t get into is the shape of the skill factor<p>There&#x27;s quotes out there about how poker is 9x% luck, &amp; that last stretch of skill is a game of chess. What they&#x27;re talking about is skill cap. By this we mean that poker is such a hard game that not even the best players are playing it perfectly. See a recent AI Pluribus for some articles on how AI&#x27;s pushing this game<p>Essentially it&#x27;s about having a 3d graph with the three labels:<p>X: Player1&#x27;s skill\nY: Player2&#x27;s skill\nZ: Player1&#x27;s chance to beat Player2<p>Issue: skill may vary with different strategies, so that you end up in rock-paper-scissors scenarios<p>Then there&#x27;s a function over how much effort is required for a player to increase their skill. This is how we get games described as &quot;easy to learn, hard to master&quot; they&#x27;re games with high skill caps but which a player should be able to quickly have more than single digit odds against an experienced player<p>An interesting thing with this 3d graph is that you can make transforms on it while treating the game itself as a blackbox. For example, in StarCraft players will often play Bo3 in tournaments. Plenty of commentators will go on about how this let&#x27;s people bring a variety of strategies etc etc, but all it really does is avoid letting a single map&#x27;s balance be decisive &amp; exaggerates the advantage of skill. If you have a 70% winrate against someone, in a Bo3 you have an 80% winrate against them<p>This ends up creating interesting decision making scenarios when one can choose strategies which shift the role of luck in a game. It may make sense to play a strategy where even with perfect execution you only have a 40% winrate if the skillcap for that strategy is low enough &amp; your opponent is better. This sort of thing makes it that there can be a bit of a divide where players are stuck at a 40% winrate against players who are better than them until they&#x27;ve become skilled enough to rationally play the higher skillcap strategy"],"time":["2020-01-16 02:02:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["H8crilA"],"id":[22060318],"kids":{},"parent":[22053747],"text":["If you like his memos I recommend the &quot;bubble.com&quot; memo from 2000:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oaktreecapital.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;memos&#x2F;2000-01-02-bubble.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oaktreecapital.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;memos&#x2F;200...<\/a><p>Timely written, at the very peak of the mania (though Marks correctly admits that such precise timing is accidental, knowing well the difference between luck and skill :) ).

I re-designed the process and ran simulations until I had a new starting point. I replicated the first specimens and left them to themselves. They work now. They collect matter, they process it, they function! They REPLICATE! All it took was setting the penalty correctly.<p>&quot;What scales of size are we talking about? What components did you use?<p>&quot;Well, there <i>are no<\/i> components in that sense anymore. The level of integration is astounding! Everything that wasn&#x27;t absolutely needed for function was removed by the optimizer and that what remained was functionally compressed and reuses as many existing &#x27;components&#x27; as possible. That&#x27;s what I meant. It required a severe penalty for the introduction of new &#x27;components&#x27; and that is what did the trick. The results are self-selecting now. Specimen with more suitable parameters for the environment are able to out-replicate others and the succeeding ones were more likely to be based on successful, i.e. faster replicating ones. They improve themselves! And the results were <i>orders of magnitude<\/i> smaller than anticipated! This out-replication seems to have taken the role of selection. The things that work best will sometimes, by chance, create modified copies that work even better. Their faster self-replication makes them replace the old ensemble.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s prettty crazy.. How many orders of magnitude are we talking about?<p>&quot;Haha.. see, the power source is a component that uses chemical compounds as fuel and extracts power from them. These are one of the larger parts of the machines and even then they are not even a micron across. A micron! And I wouldn&#x27;t really call the rest of the parts <i>components<\/i> anymore. They <i>are not<\/i> clearly separated components anymore. The boundaries are fluid, a lot of parts are reused for different purposes, it is more one thing than a machine with different components. The whole things look like an <i>awful mess<\/i>! There is little discernable structure, heck, they don&#x27;t even have a rigid structure anymore! The whole things can warp and move but they work. They work! They react to the environment! They can move in direction of a chemical gradient when they require the material for replication! We are talking about micro-machines. Heck, most of their parts are on a molecular level.<p>&quot;Are you serious? That&#x27;s madness. They are basically undetectable at these sizes. Have you any idea how dangerous this might be if they ever escaped your lab? How do you turn them off? What if they started converting available matter into copies of themselves?!<p>&quot;Nah, they sure won&#x27;t escape and if they do, the range of materials they can consume is too limited. It would be of concern if they managed - which I admit is a possibility because of  their self-replication and the mixing of procedural parameters that occurs in the process - to increase the variety of input materials or worse, if they could harvest ambient energy in the form of heat or light.<p>&quot;What do you mean by mixing of procedural parameters...?<p>&quot;Yes, that was unfortunately required and makes the whole process somewhat unpredictable. Unfortunately - or maybe exactly fortunately? - I didn&#x27;t get very far with intentionally designing these things. Once I went down the path of self-replication and introduced a way to not only self-replicate but letting them mix their own procedural parameters with the ones from other copies in the process, working results appeared really fast. I&#x27;m wondering if that might be the next level of machines? Us being no longer being assembled from components that were created in a plant and being loaded with a program but working machines from almost nothing! Starting out small, increasing themselves in mass and complexity until they reach a working condition. They are basically plants themselves.<p>&quot;Spare me. How do you pause the process?<p>&quot;Welll, that&#x27;s sort of an issue so far. Since there are no separate components anymore, you can&#x27;t really switch off the power. You can physically destroy them though or introduce substances that interfere with the machinery to disrupt the processes enough so that they permanently stop working. Or you withdraw the building materials but since they are such minuscule machines, they require very little and will work for quite a while. They deteriorate on their own with time if that&#x27;s a relief. I do not know yet why this happens but after a while the processes slow down and most of the machines stop working shortly after that. On the other hand, they are frequently being replaced by succeeding generations which are usually more capable than earlier. It&#x27;s definitely something we need to look out for.<p>------<p>Yes, it&#x27;s totally off-topic but a short story I started a while ago.
