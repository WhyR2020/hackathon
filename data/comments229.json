How could the <i>python maintainers<\/i> do this to <i>us<\/i>.<p>The description of the migration process was a good read.

Not only did &quot;the community&quot; rallied around python 3 years ago, he isn&#x27;t really happy about it, but I&#x27;ll get to that later.<p>&gt; For nearly 4 years, Python 3 took away the consistent syntax for denoting bytes&#x2F;Unicode string literals.<p>Or, to put it another way, python 3 was compatible with python 2&#x27;s string types almost eight years before python 2 reached end of life.<p>&gt; An ecosystem that falters for that long is generally not healthy<p>This entire paragraph was a hypothetical. It seems he really wanted to criticize something that did <i>not<\/i> happen.<p>&gt; The only language I&#x27;ve seen properly implement higher-order abstractions on top of operating system facilities is Rust<p>And here&#x27;s where his true point becomes evident: this is a hype piece for a language he found that he likes better. He&#x27;s just attacking something in his previous language that he thinks is valid just as an attempt to highlight why the new toy is truly better. In short: He felt like complaining about the migration would be a good way to proselytize.<p>Just in case: no, it isn&#x27;t better, and I say this as someone who currently isn&#x27;t using python nor rust. I&#x27;m using a language that I&#x27;m quickly growing to hate more than I do either of them at their worst (no, it&#x27;s not JavaScript).<p>&gt; if Rust were at its current state 5 years ago, Mercurial would have likely ported from Python 2 to Rust instead of Python 3. As crazy as it initially sounded, I think I agree with that assessment.<p>So... The best he can say about rust is that it might be better than python 3 five years ago that, by his own opinion on everything he wrote before this, was terrible? Well, that&#x27;s a recommendation <i><\/i>not<i><\/i> to use rust if I ever saw any.<p>When a hype piece defeats its own point.<p>&gt; And speaking as a maintainer, I have mad respect for the people leading such a large community.<p>No, he doesn&#x27;t; he used several appeals to emotion beforehand to try to paint them as terrible people.<p>&gt; It should not have taken 11 years to get to where we are today.<p>This statement by itself is a truism that doesn&#x27;t really mean anything, but the implication is that python 3 is only worthwhile 11 years later and it took that long for it to be so I&#x27;ll reply to <i>that<\/i>.<p>No, it didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t even take that long for mercurial, they started the migration four and half years ago, not eleven.<p>&gt; am confident it will grow stronger by taking the time to do so<p>What is it to him? He should just move on to rust and be happy with it (sure, there are many people unhappy with it, but he wouldn&#x27;t take the effort to proselytize if he wasn&#x27;t).<p>In conclusion, I just don&#x27;t understand the need to tear something else down to prop up a new thing. I&#x27;m sure I would have liked a post about things he could do with rust, but now..."],"time":["2020-01-15 01:56:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ascotan"],"id":[22038170],"kids":[22038410],"parent":[22036773],"text":["Python 3 is the new Windows Vista."],"time":["2020-01-13 21:18:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sprash"],"id":[22037379],"kids":[22041851],"parent":[22036773],"text":["The transition from Python 2 to 3 was one worst things that could happened to the whole community.

Went more or less like this: it will be great to build software without having to write code: you&#x27;ll just have to specify what your program does. Except that a program&#x27;s exact specification is the definition of its code and that the job of writing such exact specifications is what developers do. Conclusion: any &quot;no code&quot; tool will just be another way to write code ;)<p>Obviously the trick is in the difference between exact and fuzzy specifications. As a software engineer I could say my main job is to translate approximate specifications of business needs into a list of specific instructions on how to solve them i.e. code that can run on a computer.

During my first job I once had to use a graphical programming tool to design and run computer simulations of a power plant: just connect some predefined building blocks, input some simulation parameters in each block and voilà! Except that the simulations quickly started to require hundreds of said building blocks, so that my coworkers spent their days clicking around only to start over when we needed to use different simulation parameters. Got trained a few hours on how to use the graphical tool but couldn&#x27;t accept I now had to click and input numbers all day long... Somehow found that an old user manual actually existed and discovered that I could instead write plain text files to specify the computer simulations. It used a very verbose ad-hoc language so I wrote a Python script to generate the files I needed and when the requirements changed I could redefine the simulation in minutes instead of days.

DevOps is way beyond what this space currently targets and is working to achieve.<p>To be crystal clear, Low Code&#x2F;No Code is not going to replace a company&#x27;s custom developed application that drives their core business.  It isn&#x27;t even going to replace the need for custom application development throughout an enterprise.  This is an augmentative technology stack intended for a different audience.<p>What it does do is empower non-IT employees to become what the industry likes to call &quot;Citizen Developers&quot;.  Think more Excel&#x2F;Access less &lt;insert favorite language&#x2F;framework here&gt;.<p>Where this technology currently shines brightest is at the lowest levels of work.  Every enterprise has pockets where work is getting done from Excel spreadsheets, Access databases, email chains, SharePoint&#x2F;Office documents and worse.  Essentially work that could be done easier and better with an application, but where the current enterprise cost, developer availability, political&#x2F;agility issues, or simple knowledge that the problem exists prevents that application from being created.<p>The best products in this space allow IT to setup a space where non-IT staff can create applications within the confines of the environment to address these problems.  For example, a department can go in on their own and replace a shared spreadsheet that is locked all the time from coconcurrent use with something that is truly multi-user.  On top of that, they get to enhance their process and improve productivity by having it generate emails to someone when work is needed, or automatically create new tasks when certain statuses are encountered, and other similar things associated with &quot;modern&quot; technology.  They do all of this on their own without needing formal IT development resources.<p>There are obvious benefits to an enterprise here - like replacing multiple unsupported&#x2F;bespoke solutions with a single known and supported platform - but there are multiple side bonuses as well.  For an example of one, the best products in this space have great APIs.  The staff making&#x2F;managing these applications may not even know they exist, and certainly can&#x27;t write against them, but now IT has a standardized way to get this data somewhere else when  needed.  Data driven organizations can use this to drive what I call &quot;Small Data&quot;, which is applying Big Data practices&#x2F;analytics to low level work product to improve processes.<p>The next major development in this space will be low code&#x2F;no code integrations.  When you&#x27;re talking about these low levels of work, they are generally mid-process actors.  Work comes in, gets done, and is handed to the next in line.  That data largely gets to these teams from some kind of export process in the upstream system - CSV dump, daily email, etc. - and then needs to get fed back up via a similar or worse method.  You can use the aforementioned API to fix this, but that again requires developer resources.  This may be doable to for interacting with a core upstream system but it isn&#x27;t always available when you have two bottom level processes looking to communicate.<p>The ability for &quot;Citizen Developers&quot; to be able to obtain the data they need from an upstream process, complete the work on it inside their application, and then return the results back to the upstream process or next process in line without having to write code or otherwise manually intervene will further drive productivity and usefulness in this space."],"time":["2020-01-13 18:58:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22034330],"kids":{},"parent":[22033827],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-13 14:38:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["uberdru"],"id":[22038415],"kids":{},"parent":[22033827],"text":["And using our new graphical &quot;workbench&quot;, your business users will be able to integrate applications without placing any burden on your development teams.

I played with a lot of these things because I was just getting into programming and I was still at the &quot;syntax is hard, maybe what I need is a simpler language&quot; phase...<p>A lot of these things failed for reasons that are, I think, fundamentally unavoidable if your goal is to not learn anything and just do it:<p>- Tools that emphasize (or function exclusively based on) configuration over over code are limited by things that you can configure. As soon as you stray beyond that, you not only have to code, but you have to code for a system that has <i>a lot<\/i> of implicit behaviour. That&#x27;s a hellish experience if you&#x27;re an inexperienced programmer. Figuring out why your code produces a result other than what you expected is hard enough. Figuring out why your code produces a result other than what you expected <i>because there&#x27;s a default configuration flag<\/i> that alters its behaviour (or, worse, that alters the result after your code correctly computes it) is way more complicated.<p>- Tracking changes in systems that emphasize (or function exclusively based on) configuration over code is insanely difficult, and reverting systems back to a specific state is pretty hard, too. This may be less of a problem today, in the age of containers, I guess.<p>- <i>Validating<\/i> changes in such systems is even more difficult than that, because a lot of the logic is implicit and hidden from sight. If you have to make a change in a system you&#x27;re not too familiar with, reading the code can give you an idea about what behaviour would be affected. If your change breaks something, reading the code can help you debug things. If there&#x27;s no code to read, or you can&#x27;t do it in the first place, and changing the header of a column just broke your reporting tool, you&#x27;re going to spend a few fun evenings at the office poking it with a stick until it un-breaks.<p>- Tools that emphasize integration of separate tools over coding result in systems that aren&#x27;t very fun to maintain. Changes in the way components interface were a problem even in the early 00s, and they weren&#x27;t on a rolling&#x2F;continuous release schedule, weren&#x27;t delivered &quot;as a service&quot;, and &quot;move fast and break things&quot; was just called being sloppy. Integrating a dozen third-party modules today requires full-time maintenance, from someone who can definitely code.<p>I do think that making it possible for end-users to automate their work is a direction worth pursuing, but this isn&#x27;t the way to do it, and I think there&#x27;s a wealth of lessons from two decades of failures to learn.<p>IMHO, some broad directions worth pursuing would be:<p>- A simpler and more stable development framework. Keeping up with JS and CSS frameworks (many of which exist precisely because pure JS and CSS are pretty painful to use if you want to develop a desktop-like application) is hard even for people who use them professionally. There&#x27;s no way you can ask business people to keep up with <i>that<\/i>. A more stable framework, that hides the fact that browsers were never meant for application development well enough (even if that means less flexibility) could go a long way towards making things easier.<p>- Better DSL integration in business tools. A lot of the business logic is written in the same language as, and embedded in, the overall application logic. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be the case. Template engines are sufficiently advanced today that you can do a lot with them, and I&#x27;ve seen people without much programming knowledge being able to use them productively.<p>- Oh and if we&#x27;re being honest: better code quality where code really can&#x27;t be eschewed. Virtually every business app I&#x27;ve seen in the last ten years is the same story: a user needs a change, they can articulate it perfectly well, they can describe the logic in pretty good details, sometimes they can even give you an Excel sheet that implements it so that you can see a few examples. The only reason why they can&#x27;t make the change themselves is that sorting a table by date instead of name doesn&#x27;t involve replacing SORT_BY_DATE with SORT_BY_NAME in a template, it involves changing half a dozen SQL queries, two hardcoded parameters in some JS function calls, and introduces a subtle bug because passing SORT_BY_DATE in that function call actually modifies the table in place, which is a global variable, and that table is then reused by another function which assumes it&#x27;s sorted by name."],"time":["2020-01-13 14:24:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mootzville"],"id":[22039178],"kids":{},"parent":[22033827],"text":["&quot;no code&quot; will work when the halting problem is solved..."],"time":["2020-01-13 22:58:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zubairq"],"id":[22033982],"kids":{},"parent":[22033827],"text":["Having made a no code tool myself at yazz.com I definitely agree with many parts of this article.

So no wonder people are so enchanted by the idea of software that doesn’t require code or coders. All they want is for their grand ideas to be realised as they imagine them. How hard can that be? If Computers can be made to identify faces, or translate French into Chinese, then surely their vision of an app that figures out the most efficient way to deliver parcels should be a walk in the park!?<p>For me, herein lies the problem. Computers are seen as magical devices capable of anything. Software, or code, merely the spells and incantations that breath life into those machines and commit them to do your bidding.<p>But! They are not magical devices. Code is not spells. Programmers are not magicians. There are constraints. Boundaries. Limitations. Great software is, in some way, defined by those boundaries. Great software is created not by people who believe that computers and code can be made to do anything. Great software is not the product of whim and whimsy. No. Great software is created by people who know the constraints, but see the opportunity within them.<p>Take for example, the Spreadsheet.

I suppose I may have gotten off track. My point is this: The problem is not that code is hard, or programmers difficult. The problem is that software — which was once borne out of opportunity that only the programmer could see — is now born of the whim and whimsy of people who know nothing of what a computer can do, or how it does it.

However, if your requirements fall into a domain that is common enough that no-code tools exist, people who don&#x27;t consider themselves developers can often get a solution in place remarkably quickly. Database apps (CRUD) appear to be the target of most no-code products -- define your tables, build your user interface, bind fields to columns and you&#x27;re good to go.<p>Of course, a real pitfall is that you often bump into the limitations of your chosen platform after having completed 80 percent of the work, and then you&#x27;re either stuck or need to devise elaborate workarounds.<p>We see many app builders that truly use no code in the traditional sense. The simpler of these tools essentially only allow users to wire together pre-fabricated building blocks, like content screens, chat rooms and the like. More powerful app builders allow logic to be described using visual flow charts.<p>We have taken the approach of trying to cater to spreadsheet users, and put formulas at the front and center of everything. (Much like Microsoft PowerApps, in fact, though Calcapp precedes it.) Formulas enable complex ideas to be expressed. Ultimately, we put our faith in users having an easier time learning a reactive, functional programming language than they would have learning a traditional, imperative programming language. Fundamentally, the reactive model enables users to express relationships between entities without having to concern themselves with ordering. Supporting only pure functions, with no side-effects, means that we can cache results aggressively, much like a spreadsheet.<p>There are limits to this approach, though. If you want users to press a button and have different things happen depending on a condition, how would you approach this? Currently, you can&#x27;t, at least not with Calcapp. Taking actions in response to an event being fired is, per definition, something that requires an imperative approach.<p>With some trepidation, we&#x27;re working on enabling formulas to be &quot;run,&quot; but only in response to events being fired. These formulas would have access to non-pure functions (changing global state) and even an assignment operator (as well as semicolons, so that multiple statements can be executed). We will likely call them &quot;action formulas.&quot;<p>The challenge is that all this should feel familiar and logical to an Excel user. For instance, we&#x27;re introducing anonymous functions (lambdas), which can run asynchronously in response to, say, a user pressing a button in a message dialog, but lambda parameters will have default names, meaning that using &quot;arrow syntax&quot; (like in Java and ES6) to name parameters will be optional. We&#x27;re trying hard not to introduce syntax that would look strange to an Excel user.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to refer to app builders supporting spreadsheet-like formulas as &quot;no-code tools.&quot; However, what about app builders supporting imperative programming, using a text syntax? We&#x27;re well aware that we could introduce functions like WHILE, DO and FOREACH that together with lambdas would turn Calcapp into a full (Turing-complete), imperative programming language. Can such a tool still be considered to be a no-code tool?<p>Probably not. I suppose that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s an additional moniker: low-code."],"time":["2020-01-13 15:20:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anigbrowl"],"id":[22039623],"kids":{},"parent":[22033827],"text":["<i>At the heart of the issue is the concept that “computer programming” - which is to say, writing code - is a constraint on the development of software. That there is some “higher level” on which people can operate, where development is much simpler but the end results in some way the same.<p>Specifically, the idea of writing business logic in text form according to the syntax of a technical programming language is anathema. To make an analogy: it’s a little bit like saying all software developers are like car mechanics, who get into the guts of an engine. But most people just need to be able to drive the car, and a simpler interface can be put on top of the machine (a steering wheel and some pedals).<\/i><p>This is a bad, bad analogy. There <i>is<\/i> a higher level on which people can and do operate, and it&#x27;s called &#x27;drawing flowcharts&#x27;.<p>The correct analogy for the case of a car is not abstracting the work of car mechanics to be more like a car dashboard, but making it easier to view car schematics as opposed to textual descriptions that convey the same information but have to be processed in linear rather than holistic fashion.<p>To be sure, there are many &#x27;build without code&#x27; tools available that over-simplify or promise that to never expose the user to any complexity, and that is indeed a delusion at best and a lie at worst. But the idea that complexity can only be effectively represented in textual form by elaborate syntax is equally absurd; it&#x27;s simply a product of what technology was practical at the time. It&#x27;s not better, as such; it&#x27;s just what he have a lot of.<p>Consider assembly language. I love it; it is so basic that it takes me back to the delight of understanding <i>Towers of Hanoi<\/i> type problems and I get a kick of out of reverse-engineering things in a debugger. But writing any kind of large project in assembler is not a good idea if you want anyone else to get involved, because it&#x27;s not very accessible - hence the popularity of high level languages.<p>But high level languages are in many ways a product of keyboard input and monitors as assembler was a product of punch cards and blinkenlights. They&#x27;re great, but they&#x27;re also hard to read - and so as time has gone by things like syntax highlighting and autocompletion have become standard in editors. You <i>could<\/i> learn to code without any syntax highlighting; it didn&#x27;t exist when I started. You <i>could<\/i> learn to just read everything in assembler.<p>But once you have a useful tool available, demanding that people refrain from using it because it makes things too easy is just expressing a sort of anxiety about the existence of shortcuts that were not available to you, and the resulting ability of others to catch up to you in less time than it took you to learn.<p>So it is with the &#x27;no code&#x27; trend. People who spent a long time learning to code <i>have<\/i> developed very valuable engineering skills, but that doesn&#x27;t make the more high-level component-assembly approach of no-coders invalid. The no-code people want to focus on domain problems (which they often understand very, very well) and not get caught up on the minutiae of language syntax; they&#x27;re comfortable with the fact that someone else has been able to automate that in such a way that the computer does most of the work. Fighting this trend is like getting hung up on the inadequacies of Lego - all that blockiness, the general inefficiency, and path-dependency problems of building things out of lego rather than making them from scratch - while overlooking the fact that it&#x27;s so easy that kids can do it and that it&#x27;s a fantastic way to quickly prototype any sort of toy you want.<p><i>In the first [flowchart] example, I need to know how the visual environment works. In the second, I need to know a language and a development environment. But both of those are skills that are easily acquired.<\/i><p>No! one of these things is <i>not<\/i> like the other. It&#x27;s waaay easier to understand flowcharts than it is to acquire all that syntactical and semantic knowledge. This isn&#x27;t to deny the utility of text for specificity, but to point out that it only seems equivalently easy because the author <i>already<\/i> learned to write code and has <i>not yet<\/i> learned visual programming in depth. I encourage people who doubt this to spend some time building actual electronic circuits. After all, programming is just high level circuit design, so it should be easy, right? And if you&#x27;re already good at electronics, why not just get into making your own components? After all, making electronic components like capacitors and resistors is just high level material science, right? Real programming is about pulling stuff straight off the periodic table and just working out the math, right?<p>Of course it isn&#x27;t, circuit design is its own discipline in which you spend a great deal of time wresting with (or exploiting) the fuzziness and quirks of electrical current flow instead of being able to take exactitude and precision for granted, and so on down. Conversely, the path forward for established coders in an increasingly modular world is exploiting their acquired skills of extreme precision and efficiency to make better modules that do things by magic and finally fulfil the promise of libraries to provide collections of functions that Just Work and do so reliably and speedily enough that they don&#x27;t need to be rewritten over and over and <i>it doesn&#x27;t matter<\/i> what language paradigm the downstream user has in mind.<p>In the article&#x27;s example, all the downstream user cares about is whether the email validator is RFC5321&#x2F;2 compatible and what speed throughput it has.

The observations or the theories?<p>We believe, as an assumption (or nearly as a matter of orthodoxy) that there are simple universal laws that govern consistent natural phenomena. One could argue that that is the foundation of our science of physics in that if that wrong, the whole thing falls down. But that has not “progressed” and really should not change... which seems consistent with the concept of a building foundation. Building foundations don’t move and shouldn’t move.<p>What about theories, which seem to be the focus of her blog post? Well we should be careful to distinguish between our theories and the fundamental laws we think they describe—the map vs the territory and all that. I would really hesitate to call our theories a foundation of physics. For one thing they are known to be provisional; intended to be changeable. That’s not how foundations usually work.<p>When observations contradict theories, the theories must move. From that perspective one could say that observations are more foundational than theories. Once a piece of evidence is properly observed, it doesn’t change.<p>And the thing is, we have collected major (I would argue foundational) observations in the last 40 years. We observed the Higgs boson and gravitational waves, and I would call both of those foundational.<p>That they agreed with existing theory is somehow being taken for a crisis? I guess it’s a crisis if your job is to come up with new theories and you’re lacking reasons to do so.<p>But there are plenty of mysterious observations yet to be explained.

The actual protocol (and conceptual model) you really want to learn and work with is simply called &quot;Internet Protocol Suite&quot;, commonly known as &quot;TCP&#x2F;IP&quot;.<p>Consider this comparison between OSI and TCP&#x2F;IP models from Wikipedia[1]:<p>&gt; <i>The OSI protocol suite that was specified as part of the OSI project was considered by many as too complicated and inefficient, and to a large extent unimplementable. Taking the &quot;forklift upgrade&quot; approach to networking, it specified eliminating all existing networking protocols and replacing them at all layers of the stack. This made implementation difficult, and was resisted by many vendors and users with significant investments in other network technologies. In addition, the protocols included so many optional features that many vendors&#x27; implementations were not interoperable.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>Although the OSI model is often still referenced, the Internet protocol suite has become the standard for networking. TCP&#x2F;IP&#x27;s pragmatic approach to computer networking and to independent implementations of simplified protocols made it a practical methodology. Some protocols and specifications in the OSI stack remain in use, one example being IS-IS, which was specified for OSI as ISO&#x2F;IEC 10589:2002 and adapted for Internet use with TCP&#x2F;IP as RFC 1142<\/i><p>There&#x27;s a similar discussion on the TCP&#x2F;IP article as well[2], highlighting the impracticality of OSI &quot;layers&quot; in terms of implementation.<p>&gt; <i>The IETF protocol development effort is not concerned with strict layering. Some of its protocols may not fit cleanly into the OSI model, although RFCs sometimes refer to it and often use the old OSI layer numbers. The IETF has repeatedly stated[citation needed] that Internet protocol and architecture development is not intended to be OSI-compliant. RFC 3439, addressing Internet architecture, contains a section entitled: &quot;Layering Considered Harmful&quot;.<\/i><p>In practice, a short discussion about SSL&#x2F;TLS is enough to point the inadequacies of OSI, and orient one towards conforming their conceptual model closer to TCP&#x2F;IP and relevant RFC&#x27;s.<p>The advice I follow personally, given the &quot;popularity&quot; of OSI (people call &quot;layer 1-7&quot; as if it were an actual thing, 90% of the blogs and literature uses the OSI model), is to simply <i>translate into TCP&#x2F;IP lingo&#x2F;concepts<\/i> in your mind whenever you read&#x2F;speak about it.

Most of the reason, for me, was finding Elixir&#x2F;Erlang AND their virtual machine BEAM.<p>Until Elixir and BEAM for me, parallel programming had been difficult because the competing mental models in other languages pretty much make for a textbook fantasy.<p>I&#x27;m sure some folks just hit rage land, &quot;Pardon me, you contemptuously ignorant and vile buffoon, what did you say?&quot; but if you&#x27;d be so kind as to let me qualify it...<p>Parallelism on computers has more or less evolved from things being asynchronous which gave us the <i>effect<\/i> of parallelism (yay, for concurrency) to real parallelism with the proliferation of multi-core computers. This jump from emulated parallelism to real parallelism hasn&#x27;t really been too thoughtfully designed into most languages, and for those starting out, depending on your language and runtime&#x2F;vm, you might be in for quite an odyssey. We live in a world where almost every language you use has NOT been designed with parallelism as a first class problem.<p>I&#x27;m going to try to give an abridged version of my odyssey, Please note I love anything I seem hate on in this tirade.<p>First was Ruby, pure and simple, it has (system) processes (forking), threads, fibers, and libraries implementing actors and event-loops :naive-heart-eyes: but _none_ of them offer real parallelism inside the runtime itself. When one writes code with one of those mental models it falls apart at the metal (hey, GIL) and eventually you&#x27;re left scratching your head, disillusioned with the world, and realize &quot;why am I even doing this if my work is CPU bound? It won&#x27;t matter.&quot;<p>Next up, I knew the JVM had &quot;REAL THREADS!&quot; I needed to get experience with another language and thought &quot;oh hell, yeah, baby, I&#x27;m gonna rock the shit outta these 1.. 2... 4 CORES&quot; watch out CPU bound tasks. Then came reality creeping in like Santa Claus in July... &quot;Creating threads is expensive? Oh. No, shit?&quot; and &quot;oh wow, so like, I now have between 1 and N threads, that I must to schedule, and now I lock my system somehow.&quot; I was told apply locks until the burning goes away, but it never does..<p>And in that a drunken haze of threading hell one night I saw what I thought was a beacon of hope, a JVM based Actor pattern named Akka. &quot;I get the actor model, how could this go wrong?&quot; So. Many. Ways. First and foremost is choking this new fangled &quot;thread pool,&quot; Akka had given me with my CPU bound tasks. How does one then gloriously obliterate CPU bound tasks? Oh shit... One goes right back to where they started... in a separate thread. Or one can do as I did, and GALAXY BRAIN the solution: create a separate pool for my CPU bound tasks. This also introduces a new gang of friends &quot;back pressure,&quot; &quot;priority,&quot; and my favorite &quot;contention.&quot;<p>Eventually, I kind of accepted fate, knowing that some mental model even if totally contrived was better than no mental model-- right? Still I believed there had to be something better, and I kept reading about how awesome Erlang was for this sort of thing [1] at the time and Elixir had just come out.<p>Peanut butter meet pickles. This shit was good.<p>Erlang the language, and it&#x27;s runtime&#x2F;vm BEAM, were designed to work together to solve a problem space: asynchronous, fault tolerant, and distributed systems. At that point of realization, I blacked out from astonishment that people could write asynchronous code in a language and run-time <i>designed<\/i> to do so. Turns out its mental model was for me, the end all be all, because they (lang&#x2F;vm) were, and this my big point, DESIGNED TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. On BEAM a &quot;process&quot; can be pre-empted (queue choir of angels) and thus _everything_ is non-blocking. The actor pattern was finally able to hit the metal in my head and my beard gained substantial majesty.<p>I write Elixir nearly all day long right now, and while I love it, I wish there were other options (I should probably check out Pony again) for me to use, but honestly, I don&#x27;t know of any. I&#x27;m beyond thankful for Erlang and BEAM since it really helped out my software development game and understanding how parallelism works.<p>P.S. Anyone know if is there a language designed for running on GPUs designed to make it easier to facilitate programming even if they&#x27;re slightly slower to execute, e.g. the Erlang&#x2F;OTP&#x2F;Beam of GPUs?<p>[1] BEAM is actually not great a CPU bound tasks, but that&#x27;s a different story."],"time":["2020-01-13 06:52:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22031779],"kids":{},"parent":[22030928],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-13 05:18:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["ww520"],"id":[22032012],"kids":[22032254],"parent":[22030928],"text":["Parallel programming is not hard inherently, just structure your data parallel friendly, i.e. pay attention to the dependency among data."],"time":["2020-01-13 06:16:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jhfdbkofdcho"],"id":[22031535],"kids":{},"parent":[22030928],"text":["Someone wiser than me observed, “the thing about parallel programming is that it always ends in tears.”"],"time":["2020-01-13 04:12:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Syzygies"],"id":[22031991],"kids":[22033202,22032044,22032037],"parent":[22030928],"text":["Haskell.<p>I&#x27;m at almost fifty years of programming (APL was an early highlight; punched cards weren&#x27;t) in many languages.

This is better because unlike Plex, it won&#x27;t transcode arbitrarily, but it&#x27;s far worse because the Jellyfin Roku app crashes frequently, has only basic page-based navigation (&quot;go to page 23 for media that starts with &#x27;T&#x27;&quot;), and it requires running a heavy media server for no real reason. I&#x27;m still reluctantly using Plex for the time being.<p>When I need something that I haven&#x27;t put in Plex, I fall back to the Android interface on the FireTV and use VLC to access the NAS over SMB. It still rankles that Roku won&#x27;t allow an easy way to access local media."],"time":["2020-01-13 22:14:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kbenson"],"id":[22039239],"kids":[22040676],"parent":[22038065],"text":["As of at least 5-6 years ago when I was doing independent development on the Roku there have been apps&#x2F;channels in the Roku channel store that can accomplish what the author is trying to do, and many for free.[1]  Perhaps the author should have looked into the applications that area available?<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;channelstore.roku.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;channelstore.roku.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;apps<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-13 23:05:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cronix"],"id":[22038957],"kids":{},"parent":[22038065],"text":["My 70&quot; Samsung TV is just being used as a dumb monitor.

Sorry for those having trouble viewing the site. That&#x27;s obviously never the intention. The current incarnation is actually a bit of an experiment. Unfortunately, my blog is only occasionally tested against front page traffic so I don&#x27;t always get a feel for what&#x27;s not working.<p>That said, I assure you I am intimately familiar with the tradeoffs of different methods of delivering HTML. TL;DR it&#x27;s my personal site and I&#x27;ll do what I want with it. It&#x27;s for fun. The previous version of this site used a static site generator I wrote myself[0]. I switched to client-side JS rendering for several reasons.<p>First, having a build step creates a dependency on both the build tool and a specific action. If you clone my blog[1] (with submodules) you should be able to host it exactly as-is from the repo. No build step required. I hold a fairly extreme view[2] on dependencies.<p>Second, I wanted user interactions within my site to be very fast[3]. After the initial load, subsequent navigations are much faster (and consistent) than retrieving a new static HTML page. Obviously once the HTML is cached that&#x27;s no longer true, but I&#x27;m optimizing for first-time visitors. Though I should give more consideration to the fact that most of you are only going to look at the one linked page.<p>Also, I plan to eventually add some quirky little things to the site which require maintaining state between navigations. For example, I thought it would be fun to integrate a little 2D adventure game with a character you can move around to scroll the content.<p>EDIT: I should also acknowledge that while I defend the use of JS on my site, I concede that supporting non-JS use cases would be far more true to supporting &quot;the simple case&quot; as fallback. Simply supporting browsers in the default configuration isn&#x27;t a very high bar.

Very few people on the outside are going to understand what you&#x27;re doing well enough to provide super valuable opinions.<p>I&#x27;ve spent ~18 months working full-time on a new start-up alone. It was supposed to take half that time, of course. It&#x27;s the most important work I&#x27;ve ever done by far and it&#x27;s the last thing I intend to ever build as an entrepreneur. I would have enjoyed having a co-founder on this project, however, realistically few people would be able to go along with something this time consuming and risky (no salary for two years). Sometimes it&#x27;s just going to be all on you and you have to want it badly enough to persevere.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating situation in the non-VC start-up land these days (that is to say, I&#x27;m intentionally not raising VC, I need max control to see it through long-term; a VC would fuck it up by prioritizing profit as the prime motive and their get-big-too-fast mantra). For a good engineer to join me for two years to do this, they might have to forsake $300,000 to $400,000 or more in total compensation. Or you have to take a dilution &amp; control smack to the face up front and go raise a million dollars in VC. In my opinion, having watched the industry closely since the mid 1990s, the huge financial trade-off for engineers in doing non-VC start-ups is an epic problem that dissuades a lot of people (for good, sane reason). It&#x27;s a simple equation: you&#x27;re an engineer in a top five tech city, are you going to sacrifice a million dollars (possibly a lot more in SV) in total compensation across three to five years to do a thing, if that&#x27;s what it takes? That&#x27;s a monster risk to take, particularly if you&#x27;re still in prime earnings years.<p>That equation also enables me and others to do things many other people won&#x27;t or can&#x27;t dare to try, they won&#x27;t eat the shit necessary to do it, or can&#x27;t rationally take on the risk.

I can run 20 low volume apps in a kubes cluster with a single VM. This is cheaper than any other hosting solution in the cloud if you want the same level of stability and isolation. It&#x27;s even cheaper when you need something like a Redis cache. If my cache goes down and the container needs to be spun up again then it&#x27;s not a big issue, so for cheap projects I can even save more cost by running some infra like a Redis instance as a container too. Nothing beats that. It gets even better, I can run my services in different namespaces, and have different environments (dev&#x2F;staging&#x2F;etc.) isolated from each other and still running on the same amount of VMs. When you caculate the total cost saving here to traditional deployments it&#x27;s just ridiculously cheap.<p>Kubernetes makes deployments really easy. docker build + kubectl apply. That&#x27;s literally it. Deployments are two commands and it&#x27;s live, running in the cloud. It&#x27;s elastic, it can scale, etc.<p>Kubernetes requires very little maintenance. Kubernetes takes care of itself. A container crashes? Kubes will bring it up. Do I want to roll out a new version? Kubes will do a rolling update on its own. I am running apps in kubes and for almost 2 years I haven&#x27;t looked at my cluster or vms. They just run. Once every 6 months I log into my console and see that I can upgrade a few nodes. I just click ok and everything happens automatically with zero downtime.<p>I mean yes, theoretically nothing needs Kubernetes, because the internet was the same before we had Kubernetes, so it&#x27;s certainly not needed, but it makes life a lot easier. Especially as a cheap lazy developer who doesn&#x27;t want to spend time on any ops Kubernetes is really the best option out there next to serverless.<p>If learning Kubernetes is the reason why it&#x27;s &quot;not needed&quot; then nothing is needed.

Kubernetes gives me the ability to scale up quickly when the need comes (which is soon, hopefully).<p>I evaluated AWS Fargate &amp; Kubernetes, Azure and GKE before settling on GKE. Amazon charges $148 per month just for cluster management alone. Google and Azure charge $0 for cluster management. This ruled out AWS for me. AWS appears to be a reluctant adopter of Kubernetes. They seem to want you to use Fargate instead. I tried it and found it to be crap--very hard to get things running.<p>I was able to get Kubernetes running on Azure and GKE fairly easily. There were minor hiccups on both those clouds. With Azure initial creation of a AKS cluster failed because some of the resource providers weren&#x27;t &quot;registered&quot; on my subscription. On GKE it was hard to get ingress working. Static IPs take a long time to take effect, and in the mean time you are fiddling with your yaml files trying to figure out what you may have done wrong, not realizing it is a GKE issue.<p>The awesome part of Kubernetes is that I didn&#x27;t need to learn almost anything about Google cloud to get everything working.

The reason for doing the Lisp was to allow me to create an assembler to replace NASM, I was not concerned with sticking to &#x27;the lisp way&#x27;, or whatever your local Lisp guru says. No doubt I will have many demons in hell awaiting me...<p>First of all there is no garbage collector by choice. All objects used by the Lisp are reference counted objects from the class library. Early on the Lisp was never going to have a problem with cycles because it had no way to create them, but as I developed the assembler I decided to introduce two functions, push and elem-set, that could create cycles. However the efficiency advantage in coding the assembler made me look the other way. There are now other ways that a cycle can be created, by naming an environment within its own scope, but again this was too good an efficiency feature to miss out on. So you do have to be careful not to create cycles, so think about how your code works.<p>No tail recursion optimization ! There is a single looping function provided in native code, while, every other looping construct builds on this primitive. There are also two native primitives some! and each! that provide generic access to iterating over a slice of a sequence&#x2F;s, while calling a function on the grouped elements. Standard some and each are built on these but they also allow other constructs to be built and gain the advantage of machine coded iteration. I try to stick to a functional approach in my Lisp code, and manipulate collections of things in a functional way with operations like map, filter, reduce, each etc. I&#x27;ve not found the lack of tail recursion a problem.<p>All symbols live in the same environment, functions, macros, everything. The environment is a chain of hash maps. Each lambda gets a new hash map pushed onto the environment chain on invocation, and dereferenced on exit. The env function can be used to return the current hash map and optionally resize the number of buckets from the default of 1. This proves very effective for storing large numbers of symbols and objects for the assembler as well as creating caches. Make sure to setq the symbol you bind to the result of env to nil before returning from the function if you do this, else you will create a cycle that can&#x27;t be freed.<p>defq and bind always create entries in the top environment hash map. setq searches the environment chain to find an existing entry and sets that entry or fails with an error. This means setq can be used to write to symbols outside the scope of the current function. Some people don&#x27;t like this, but used wisely it can be very powerful. Coming from an assembler background I prefer to have all the guns and knives available, so try not to shoot your foot off.<p>There is no cons, cdr or car stuff. Lists are just vector objects and you use push, cat, slice etc to manipulate elements. Also an empty list does not evaluate to nil, it&#x27;s just an error.<p>Function and macro definitions are scoped and visible only within the scope of the declaring function. There is no global macro list. During macro expansion the environment chain is searched to see if a macro exists."],"time":["2020-01-13 16:27:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["smabie"],"id":[22033759],"kids":[22036485,22033847,22037048,22034515,22036817],"parent":[22019594],"text":["This is cool, but the code is... strange? <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vygr&#x2F;ChrysaLisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;gui&#x2F;canvas&#x2F;tga.vp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vygr&#x2F;ChrysaLisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;gui&#x2F;canvas&#x2F;tg...<\/a><p>The code doesn’t look like Lisp at all.

What worked to get them where they are is no longer appropriate going forward. So it&#x27;s no wonder more men are opting out of work altogether because they feel they are in a no-win situation.

After all most of these elites and many of these journalists are males themselves.<p>One solution is the diversification of the elites, media and society in general. Not in superficial aspects like race, gender, etc, but ideology, thought and values. Seems like there is a lot of incest within the elite&#x2F;media class. They all seem to think alike and that&#x27;s not a good thing.<p>Also, these attacks on men are also ultimately attacks on women as well. Ignoring the fact that half of a woman&#x27;s genetic history comes from a man ( their father ), the attacks on men ultimately harm their future prospects of a husband, family and kids. And their future hopes of happiness.<p>Men&#x27;s suicide is increasing and women&#x27;s happiness has been plummeting.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w14969\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w14969<\/a><p>Add to that the below replacement birth rate of american born women, you&#x27;d think there was a crisis in america.

The numbers aren&#x27;t even close.  The big automakers here know this, and have tailored their product lines accordingly.  Ford is basically kept afloat singularly by F-series pickup sales, and have cancelled many sedans entirely.  They have an entire range of different sized trucks and SUVs for every market segment.  Same with Chevrolet.  Now pan over to Tesla.  Tesla has one single SUV offering, and sales of that SUV are dismal.  They just teased a pickup truck release with their &#x27;cybertruck&#x27; product, but the design was purposely off-putting, and it only served to make a mockery of the market segment.  So with one SUV that doesn&#x27;t sell, and a parody of what is currently the highest selling platform in the US, I&#x27;m not sure why anyone speculates Tesla is in a place of upward trajectory.  I don&#x27;t buy the argument that other car companies can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t pivot to counter either.  Porsche reverse engineered one of their Model S vehicles, admitted it was quite well-constructed, and then countered with the Taycan (by all reviews a better car) a mere 3-4 years later.  I&#x27;m glad a company like Tesla exists to force the market to the EV concept, but most people will buy an EV when they know it&#x27;s supported by a long established and trusted automaker like Toyota, Ford, Chevy, or Honda.  Tesla then exists as a proof-of-concept model for the bigger players to follow, not as a displacement.<p>It should also be noted, many motor companies are also investing quite a bit of money into alternative fuels like synthetic petrol and hydrogen, and don&#x27;t want to rely on an energy source which is primarily derived from conflict zones.

They describe it as an increase in volume of 14%, but it&#x27;s actually an increase in the FEV1 score by 14 percentage points. FEV1 is calculated by dividing the volume of air you can expel in one second by the amount they figure a normal healthy person could expel, based on your height, weight, and probably some other factors. So if you expel 50% of what a healthy person could, then your FEV1 is 50%. Trikafta increased that FEV1 value by an average of 14 points over placebo, in only a few weeks. That&#x27;s massive.<p>I&#x27;m 32 years old, diagnosed with CF at 6 months old, and before starting Trikafta at the beginning of November, my FEV1 was 24%. (That&#x27;s incredibly low. I was in the hospital on IV antibiotics, and we were all set to put me on the waiting list for a double lung transplant, when news of Trikafta came in and put the transplant on hold. At the time, I would get winded just by taking the trash down the hall to the trash chute, and would usually start hacking up a lung by the time I finished walking back to my apartment.) I go back to the CF clinic in just a few days to see just how much I&#x27;ve improved, but judging by just the way I feel now after about 2 months, I would not be at all surprised if I&#x27;m now pushing 40% for my FEV1. (And at the very least, I don&#x27;t expect to hack up a lung after every pulmonary function test, which has been the norm for the last decade of my life.) If I go from 24% to 40%, that would be over a 50% increase in actual air flow volume. That&#x27;s why this is a game changer.<p>The other big thing the article fails to mention is that the rate of exacerbations (which usually result in hospitalizations and a few weeks or more of IV antibiotics) dropped by about 60% over placebo. Exacerbations are where you see the biggest and sudden drop in lung function, so reducing the occurrence of those is really key to stabilizing our health.<p>Lastly, I want to mention that, while this drug isn&#x27;t yet approved for children under 12, they&#x27;re working hard on that. Theoretically, if a child were start taking this very early on, it&#x27;s very possible that they would never experience any symptoms of CF. Unfortunately for me, I&#x27;ve had 30-odd years of CF that has permanently wrecked my lungs and pancreas (probably my bones too), but I still find it crazy awesome to think that I might be the last generation that has to deal with this.<p>The $311k per year price tag is still an unbelievably large amount, but the article certainly doesn&#x27;t make any attempt to justify that price tag."],"time":["2020-01-14 04:39:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jelliclesfarm"],"id":[22037109],"kids":[22037392,22037343,22037408],"parent":[22031375],"text":["I can’t help but notice the $311,000 price.
