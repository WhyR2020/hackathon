My respects to him, his family and his work.<p>However I disagree with the article. I am also someone who has been on the receiving end of bullying and (rarely) on the dispensing end, but I feel that the premise of this article is wrong. The reason why people did not care about the highway of death is because 1) it happened a long way away 2) people like us, from our side, did it 3) very few popular faces said it was wrong and 4) it happened to people we don&#x27;t care about very much. These views can be summed up as parochialism, and they are usually the reason that we allow evil to be perpetrated against the innocent.<p>It&#x27;s also the reason we allow the poor of the world to starve (c.f. Living High and Letting Die, Peter Unger) which I don&#x27;t feel can be construed as bullying. A similar example is the behavior of the allies immediately after the second world war, who apparently did little to acknowledge the Holocaust.<p>My view differs from David&#x27;s in that I don&#x27;t think we seek to justify bullies because we think they are better than their victims - I think we seek to justify bullies because we don&#x27;t care very much about other people, due to lack of time and energy.

With Vim, there was always a barrier around writing extensions -- it never really felt like it was <i>meant<\/i> to be integrated with them.

There were some sharp edges but the interface felt orders of magnitude more clean than I was used to.<p>I had tried Emacs before but Spacemacs was poorly integrated -- I tried using package-install and I was dumped into a buffer with no evil-mode bindings.

He stays up until 2 am some nights answering support requests, and has put a lot of work into `doom doctor` so there are some rudimentary diagnosics included.

Figure out a process and just do it each and every day. I find that this helps with confidence.<p>2) Learn to say &quot;f<i>ck it&quot;.

It could be worse, so It can&#x27;t be that bad&quot;<p>3) Organize and plan things out. Prioritize things. Accept that you can&#x27;t always tackle all issues. Use a todo app and list out everything you have going on for the day. As new things come up, add them as a todo. Keep the list prioritized and just focus on the highest priority item at the moment.<p>4) Learn to tell people you can&#x27;t help them right now if it&#x27;s not a higher priority than something you are currently doing. I struggle the most with this one. I always end up feeling really bad if I don&#x27;t immediately drop everything and do whatever I can to help.<p>5) Close all those dang browser tabs. I&#x27;m sure you meant to come back to X thing 3 days ago... but honestly, it&#x27;s just a distraction. Close all your random applications down. Open a fresh browser window and only have the stuff you need to focus on for the day. If something is really important, use a bookmark or otherwise take note of the page so you can come back to it later.<p>6) Medications are often useful tools and can help with improving your quality of life. It could be worth talking to your doctor. Medications generally don&#x27;t solve problems, but if it can help improve your quality of life, it can be worth considering. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that it can potentially take a very long time to work out which medications are best for you. I take medication for high blood pressure for example.

This war is as often overlooked and relegated to obscurity as the article&#x27;s subject himself, but the blood spilt must shine through the heart of America in an inevitable fashion.<p>The rise of Korean film and pop music in American consciousness is a reflection of the cultural imperialism of the West. This is illustrated in Bong Joon Ho&#x27;s &quot;The Host&quot; (2006) moments before k-pop and Korean film became so massively popular in America.<p>Somewhat a reflection of these novels, the film&#x27;s portrayal of Americans in Korea is not all black and white. The opening scene shows an Anglo American officer commanding a local Korean man to dump toxic formaldehyde into the Han River, leading to the rise of a monster and a mysterious infectious pandemic (sound familiar?). Although the pandemic is revealed to be an American imperial hoax to seize power and quarantine the population, a local Anglo American GI is featured as a hero who fights alongside the protagonist against the monster. A toxic gas bioweapon called Agent Yellow is released in a failed attempt to defeat the monster, even though the gas is harmful to the local population. This may be a commentary on the American use of bioweapons in Vietnam against the cultural threat to American world hegemony (communism).<p>To summarize this chaotic chain of themes, perhaps as chaotic as &quot;East Goes West&quot;, the lasting struggle of asserting a personal and cultural identity in America is very relevant today. What does it take for a man or woman to rise above prejudice and establish themselves as a human being and valued member of society? Why should this struggle exist? Why should Americans be forced to engage with it? It is evidence of evil.

Fair enough.<p>However, it irritates me when I hear scientists loosely throw the word &quot;consciousness&quot; into these studies and here&#x27;s why.<p>In these studies, consciousness is always implicitly defined operationally as the electrical activity in some identified networks- DAT and DSM and front-parietal and sensory motor etc.. But the concept of consciousness has another life in philosophy where in works by people like Patricia Churchland and others, it references something more subtle- the mystery of why there should be anything we call experience at all.<p>Experience itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary to the working of any machine, including our brains. We don&#x27;t think our TVs have any experiences despite (being capable of) accurately representing all human visual experiences. The reason we don&#x27;t think they experience what they&#x27;re displaying is because we know how they work and we know there&#x27;s no ghost in the machine. Adding on &quot;experiences&quot; to an explanation of how TVs work is gratuitous and unnecessary.<p>But that&#x27;s not the case with humans-just the opposite.  Experience is absolutely foundational.<p>Descartes tried to boil his world down to what he could know with absolute certainty and arrived at his famous &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot;  formulation,  but actually, he skipped a step; that step is simply- &quot;There is experience&quot;.<p>Experience is perfectly gratuitous to any explanation of brain activity since all that activity, like an electrical storm, could take place in exactly the same way without it. We (our brains) could be, and most scientists believe are, very complicated, but purely mechanical machines. They could be exactly as they are with no more awareness- not to say feedback loops- than a blender.<p>But that account leaves the problem of experience or consciousness completely untouched. That would be O.K. except we know we have it.<p>The mystery of consciousness is not totally defined by  questions like of &quot;can I make you unconscious or conscious?&quot; or &quot;can I cause you to have this or that illusory experience by stimulating your brain?&quot;.  The mystery of consciousness is <i>why is there anything like experience at all ?<\/i><p>So whenever I read a paper that makes some confident assertion about consciousness, it gets under my skin. It&#x27;s electrical activity and perhaps human behavior and speech they are actually examining, not consciousness. I hear these papers gratingly assuming the consequent with respect to the biggest mystery there is. They are implicitly saying &quot;this is consciousness, this pattern of electrical activity in the brain and here is what we have discovered about consciousness&quot;. That&#x27;s one perspective, but to philosophers, both academic and non-academic, it&#x27;s a form of punting on the real question.<p>Consciousness is to brain science what AGI is to AI. Researchers just love to make assertions and grand predictions.<p>Actually the correlation between the two is closer than that since strong AI claims that consciousness can be captured in a computer; Kurtzweil and his Singularity concept is in this school of thought.<p>He and people like him claim that not only does experience arise as a direct result of brain activity but any substrate- including general purpose computer platforms- will similarly give rise to the same experiences if only they are programmed in a particular way, specifically, if the computations are functionally equivalent to the brain&#x27;s computations.<p>Are badly programmed computers therefore experiencing chaos? Well, why not?   Are simpler computers, like a thermostat which &quot;experiences&quot; temperature changes, also somehow dimly conscious? If that seems like a straw man argument to you, you should know Marvin Minsky bought it and so do a lot of other scientists whether they realize it or not.<p>All of this is just a non-starer to people like me. You don&#x27;t get to skip a step because it keeps your theory neat or provides you the promise of immortality because you uploaded your &quot;you&quot; to a machine.<p>Consciousness, understood in this way, is a genuine mystery which for now at least I don&#x27;t think we have the conceptual tools to even define much less make pronouncements about."],"time":["2020-04-09 21:21:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shireboy"],"id":[22825578],"kids":[22825758,22825803,22826069],"parent":[22823981],"text":["ELI5 &quot;anti-correlated&quot; here?

This is why a portable shortwave radio can pick up radio stations from the other side of the world.<p>Higher frequencies don&#x27;t benefit from these effects, and generally don&#x27;t propagate beyond direct line-of-sight. But in rare circumstances, atmospheric refraction can cause high-frequency radio signals to propagate much farther than normal, which is what seems to have happened here.<p>On a technical level, this radio contact was made possible by the recently-developed FT8 digital modulation scheme, which is designed to transmit a minimal amount of data (basically just a pair of callsigns) at only a few bits per second, so as to make even extremely weak signals detectable.

That&#x27;s what I love about going to galleries – the art takes center stage and if you want to learn more there&#x27;s a tiny sign next to it, and if you want more still you talk to whoever works there but the art comes first. I feel like your site is trying a bit too hard to make a sale. I absolutely agree that artists should be paid for their art, and I&#x27;m happy to pay for art that I care for, but ultimately I just want pretty things. Show me the pretty things first, then let&#x27;s talk business when I find something I like. I&#x27;m sorry if this comes off as too callous!<p>Also – and this is probably a really difficult problem to solve – I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m looking for in art. I just know some things I like, but probably not all. I love Monet and other impressionist painters, but I also love old Japanese woodblock prints like the great wave. I&#x27;m also a huge fan of cubism and I can&#x27;t get enough of art nouveau. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of abstract art, but I like some. I love evocative photography, especially in black and white. I feel like maybe my taste profile fits a multi-spoke radar chart, where each data point is a relative preference rather than a binary I like this or that type tick box filter. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what I mean by all this, just that your search does nothing to help me, and I&#x27;m probably not gonna spend too much time looking at page after page of stuff that may or may not be interesting to me. I would 100% subscribe to a feed that fits my profile though, and especially so if it&#x27;s smart enough to also understand other types of art I don&#x27;t know about, but perhaps might fit my profile anyway. I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, if your site could be my personalized art dealer, there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;ll spend more money then I probably should."],"time":["2020-04-09 23:22:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pavlov"],"id":[22825594],"kids":{},"parent":[22824618],"text":["I like it, and will definitely come back to see new works over time.

It’d be amazing to simultaneously fund new artists, bring regular Joes&#x2F;Janes into the art world, and have a sustainable business at the same time.<p>But that little MBA demon on my shoulder is whispering that targeting low willingness-to-spend consumers will result in, at best, strongly limiting growth and, at worst, a perpetually money losing business. I’m just speculating since I don’t know your financials, so if you’re already in the black, my apologies. If you’re both in the black <i>and<\/i> don’t care about growth, apologies again.<p>But assuming you want to grow and&#x2F;or aspire to be profitable, you’ll either need to grow the size of the art market (hard) or sell to wealthier (or at least, people who spend more of their money on art) consumers (less hard). Social proof is a huge factor for buyers of substantial art, to the point that a handful of people&#x2F;galleries&#x2F;etc get to define what constitutes great - and therefore very expensive - art (there was a great Adam Ruins Everything episode on this <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Dw5kme5Q_Yo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Dw5kme5Q_Yo<\/a>). My mom is very involved with the main art museum in my city, going on trips with other benefactors to buy art for the museum. She also buys art herself - not crazy expensive super known pieces like Damien Hurst’s shark, but still high-end pieces from up-and-coming artists (to put it another way, she buys pieces that aren’t in the $1 million+ range). She uses her own sensibilities primarily, but to find the art itself and ensure the price she’s paying isn’t for a dumpster, she relies on people in the art world.<p>So, I’m just suggesting you consider two characters of art consumers: (1) social proof drives their decisions and (2) there are often wealthier. Your creative juices might find something really innovative for the social proof component; I don’t have any specific suggestions at the moment. But on (2), consider targeting people in between Steven A Cohen (bought Hurst’s shark for $8-$12 million) and the &lt;$100 art buyer. Given the success (until recently) of Restoration Hardware, I believe you could find people willing to pay $1,000-$10,000 for art. People pay thousands of dollars for a sofa, why not the art that’s on display in their homes? You could imagine quite a few professional, internet savvy DINCs (dual income no children) in their 30s or 40s being interested in having a substantial art piece. They may be intimidated by galleries and not know what to select. Just something to think about to boost your margins."],"time":["2020-04-10 00:03:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lberkowiz1"],"id":[22832932],"kids":{},"parent":[22824618],"text":["As an artist on the site, I think it is fantastic.

Certain compiler features are only available to the maintainers, nor is there any way to use alternative package sites.<p>I don&#x27;t want to know what would ever happen if the Elm developers decide to take <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;package.elm-lang.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;package.elm-lang.org<\/a> offline.

On of the issues was the preference for 4-space indentations instead of 2-space. I understand that it&#x27;s important to have a single source of formatting for the language. But at that time there was no consensus on what amount of spaces to use. Basically, the community divided almost 50&#x2F;50 between the two. Moreover, a lot of core libraries and example code still used 2-space indentation. (that&#x27;s why I preferred it). Due to lack of consensus, there was a suggestion to add a flag to formatter to set the indentation. It required to change some parts of code to pass the flag to the formatting module. At that moment, one of the core devs stepped up and closed the discussion because he didn&#x27;t approve of this decision and he just said that 2-space people should adapt to the new 4-space default (that wasn&#x27;t supported by any majority).

This &quot;feature&quot; (used loosely) was largely undocumented, always verboten from distribution in user packages, and never intended as anything more than a stopgap measure in extremely rare cases.[2] It was &#x2F;officially&#x2F; not a core language feature intended for widespread usage, and consistently advised against by the Elm team. The removal of native modules was spoken about publicly months before the breaking upgrade. It came as no surprise to me. As an engineer who tries really hard to be responsible, I do not build software which relies on features which are advertised as &#x27;do not use unless absolutely necessary&#x27; and are soon-to-be deprecated unless I&#x27;m willing to accept the inherent risk of doing so.<p>The core Elm team was, in my opinion, extremely communicative, well-reasoned, and thoughtful in this change and in others, despite the inconvenience to a small subset of people. For each feature discussed in Luke&#x27;s post, there is an accompanying Discourse thread[3], discussion on Google groups, Github gists[4], etc., that carefully lays out the reasoning, and carefully consider the scope of a change (in the instance of the removal of custom operators, the Elm team analyzed the package ecosystem and determined less than 5% of packages were affected)[4].<p>I won&#x27;t cover the moral arguments around the obligations of open source maintainers as this has been covered ad nauseam with the Clojure and Rust fiascos of a similar sort - though I personally believe maintainers don&#x27;t owe anyone anything, and I try to treat all free software graciously, as a precious gift, lucky to receive it at all. I will say that Elm&#x27;s somewhat slow, closed BDFL-ish governance is well-documented as well[5, 6], available to all who seek to understand the Elm development process and decide for themselves if this is an ecosystem to hitch their wagon to. Of course the Elm maintainers get to patch their own runtime with native modules, because they are implementing core parts of the language, it&#x27;s practically tautological. That users living in userland cannot do it is not unfair; it&#x27;s a language design feature. What Luke seems to see as a stifling of an open community by the closure of issues and deletion of posts on the Discourse is often basic organizational maintenance to handle redundancies. Conversations around these issues have happened for months and in some cases years, and decisions have been made. They may not be to everyone&#x27;s tastes. That should be just fine! If someone went to Famous Amos Cookies on Discourse, Slack, their mailing list, and opened a Github issue and PR suggesting this genius idea they just had, it&#x27;s so good, wait for it - an oatmeal cookie without raisins! - I hope they would clean it up, close the issue, delete my posts, etc., for their own sanity. Not to mention that the opening to Luke&#x27;s opus here is an admission of his own rudeness to the Elm team on most of these fora. Of course the relationship with maintainers will be strained with this kind of behavior.<p>There are critiques of Elm, to be sure. The pace of releases is somewhat slow, custom operators might be nice for 3rd party parsing libraries, it might be cool to have a PR merged in to get that fuzzy feeling only OSS contributors get. But you cannot reasonably argue that Elm&#x27;s team has been unfair, discriminatory, uncommunicative, or arrogant (pathos, so much pathos here!). I don&#x27;t generally post comments anywhere, but articles like this are irresponsible and damaging not just to the well-being of maintainers who are being generous with their time trying to make something with great care, but to people (like many top level commenters here) who might have tried Elm but won&#x27;t due to an inside baseball post from a spurned developer.

Namely, it seems to me that the authors don&#x27;t actually want an Open Source project (or perhaps more accurately a Production-Ready Open Source Project). They may certainly want many of the advantages that Open Source brings, but are upset by what I think are honestly completely predictable consequences from not living up to the, regrettably for lack of a better word, &quot;responsibilities&quot; of Production Open Source. I say regrettably because I don&#x27;t want to get into an argument about what is actually &quot;owed&quot; -- I agree no one entered any contract or whatever. All I&#x27;m saying is if you put in the work to convince someone that something is production-ready, and convinced them to stake their livelihood on your project, then it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that they are upset when you prioritize abstract principles or decisions over their ability to ship. Again, I&#x27;m not implying you should be forced to have a process or do what they say, just don&#x27;t be surprised when your users get upset, and then on top of that accuse them of &quot;entitlement&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of convenient, and perhaps subconscious, confusion of terminology in technology. For example, people can point to the fact that a project isn&#x27;t 1.0 yet and argue &quot;well you should have known anything goes pre-1.0&quot;. But Linux was amazingly solid prior to 1.0, and even the term &quot;Beta&quot; has been watered down by Google&#x27;s infamous insistence of using the term for ages on their software. I&#x27;m not saying you have to agree with the watering down of technical meaning, but you <i>should<\/i> understand the unfortunate reality that a lot of this is mixed signaling. For example, a common one is &quot;It&#x27;s beta but we use it in production and it works great!&quot;, which if you break it down is kind of a used-car-salesman technique. It&#x27;s saying &quot;I&#x27;ve created plausible deniability for myself so that I owe you nothing, but the final thought I&#x27;m going to leave you with is an emotionally manipulative statement that wink wink it&#x27;s really ready to go&quot;.<p>Similarly, if you have a fancy landing page telling people why your product is better than other production-ready products, for example Elm compares itself against Angular, React, and Ember, then you are strongly implying you are a peer. So even though the words &quot;production-ready&quot; don&#x27;t appear on the page, there is a strong implication here. There&#x27;s certainly no asterisk anywhere saying &quot;pre-shipping numbers&quot;, something that game trailers will even do. Again, I don&#x27;t think this is intentionally deceitful, I think it&#x27;s supremely easy to  accidentally run into this sort of messaging. But you should absolutely be mindful of this and work against this.<p>Luckily, this is all fairly avoidable if you&#x27;re willing to take some simple steps. For example, just say &quot;this is a toy project&quot; or at least &quot;We absolutely do not recommend this for production&quot;, or even &quot;the primary purpose of this project is for researching ideas that interest me&quot;. That can completely avoid any miscommunication and sets expectations up correctly, and furthermore puts you 100% in the right in the event that someone ends up relying on your code... But no one wants to do that because it hurts adoption! This is what I mean by wanting to &quot;Having Your Open Source and Eating It Too&quot;.

Type sharing ensures correct-by-construction serialization between server &#x2F; client amidst any changes to your business logic data types, allows you to focus on your apps core offerings as opposed to minutia.<p>• Rich ecosystem. The Haskell ecosystem has many great libraries that compile w&#x2F;o any problems on the frontend.<p>• Concurrency. Programming with threads and synchronization primitives is now first class in the browser.<p>• Extensibility. Compared to Elm’s ports feature, the GHCJS FFI is a much simpler way to interface with third-party libs. Also, Haskell supports typeclasses, and Generic programming, a rich lens library, etc.<p>• Community involvement. You’ll be working directly at the intersection of a lot of interesting developments in GHC, specifically around cross compilation, syntax, lenses. Any new advancements to GHC has an impact on your frontend code. Also, many PhDs use, love and contribute to Miso. These people tend to be very smart, empathetic and intellectually curious as opposed to dogmatic and contentious that can be found in the software engineering industry at large today.<p>• Nix, a one-tool-to-rule them all for dev, build, and deploy. While not easy, deterministic builds are the future and help one to sleep at night (I’ve found). It can be used solely for personal dev, or for an entire organization, and anything in between.<p>• Virtual DOM. If your Haskell web framework does not handle the tedious task of DOM manipulation for you, you have been failed as a library consumer IMO. Miso has a very well-tested, simple recursive micro virtual DOM diffing library that can exist standalone and can detect regressions in performance via a benchmark suite.<p>• Simplicity. Unlike many other ivory tower libraries in Haskell, Miso maintains a simple interface. Many different common abstractions were explored in the early stages of development (free monads, FRP, etc.) and found lacking, unnecessary or replaceable by a simpler solution without sacrificing features. Miso does not attempt to hide behind complex type-level abstractions and blame end-users for their lack of understanding. As opposed to a top-down approach that shoe-horns an abstraction into an environment where it does not belong, Miso takes a bottom-up approach to fully understand its environment, the browser, it’s APIs, the DOM and its short-comings and provide a simple commonly-used abstraction to the end-user that can scale to large applications. This also makes it easier for newcomers to Haskell to get up and running quickly.<p>• Industry adoption. Several companies are using miso in production for various things in their company, from full product to internal tools &#x2F; data visualization.<p>• Isomorphic.

Type sharing ensures correct-by-construction serialization between server &#x2F; client amidst any changes to your business logic data types, allows you to focus on your apps core offerings as opposed to minutia).<p>• Rich ecosystem (the Haskell ecosystem has many great libraries that compile w&#x2F;o any problems on the frontend).<p>• Concurrency (Programming with threads and synchronization primitives is now first class in the browser)<p>• Extensibility. (Compared to Elm’s ports feature, the GHCJS FFI is a much simpler way to interface with third-party libs. Also, Haskell supports typeclasses, and Generic programming, a rich lens library, etc.)<p>• Community involvement (You’ll be working directly at the intersection of a lot of interesting developments in GHC, specifically around cross compilation, syntax, lenses. Any new advancements to GHC has an impact on your frontend code. Also, many PhDs use, love and contribute to Miso. These people tend to be very smart, empathetic and intellectually curious as opposed to dogmatic and contentious that can be found in the software engineering industry at large today).<p>• Nix, a one-tool-to-rule them all for dev, build, and deploy. While not easy, deterministic builds are the future and help one to sleep at night (I’ve found). It can be used solely for personal dev, or for an entire organization, and anything in between.<p>• Virtual DOM. (If your Haskell web framework does not handle the tedious task of DOM manipulation for you, you have been failed as a library consumer IMO. Miso has a very well-tested, simple recursive micro virtual DOM diffing library that can exist standalone and can detect regressions in performance via a benchmark suite).<p>• Simplicity. (Unlike many other ivory tower libraries in Haskell, Miso maintains a simple interface. Many different common abstractions were explored in the early stages of development (free monads, FRP, etc.) and found lacking, unnecessary or replaceable by a simpler solution without sacrificing features. Miso does not attempt to hide behind complex type-level abstractions and blame end-users for their lack of understanding. As opposed to a top-down approach that shoe-horns an abstraction into an environment where it does not belong, Miso takes a bottom-up approach to fully understand its environment, the browser, it’s APIs, the DOM and its short-comings and provide a simple commonly-used abstraction to the end-user that can scale to large applications. This also makes it easier for newcomers to Haskell to get up and running quickly).<p>• Industry adoption. (Several companies are using miso in production for various things in their company, from full product to internal tools &#x2F; data visualization).<p>• Isomorphic. Due to the rose tree structure of both the DOM and HTML, pre-rendering increases load-time and overall UX along with correct SEO."],"time":["2020-04-11 17:58:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["smaudet"],"id":[22841420],"kids":{},"parent":[22821447],"text":["I have wondered, it seemed like there was a community of dev professionals who had managed to make things work for them, they could have forked the project easily?

But none of it is idiom-changing revolution. These are mostly convenience functions, and you don&#x27;t have to use them all just because they&#x27;re there.<p>Every addition to the language is bikeshedded to death, goes through betas, revisions, refinements, before being stabilized <i>years later<\/i>.

This was a partly automated process thanks to &#x27;cargo fix&#x27;.<p>Some thoughts:<p>1. Most of the superficial changes, like &#x27;dyn&#x27; and Rust 2018, are easily handled using automatic tools.<p>2. The original Rust &#x27;Error&#x27; trait was clunky, and it lacked useful features like backtrace support. This led to a series of experiments and fads in error handling (e.g., error-chain, failure), which are only starting to calm down after recent enhancements to &#x27;Error&#x27;. More conservative Rust users avoided this by sticking with &#x27;Error&#x27; and living with the limitations.<p>3. Updating depencies has been surprisingly easy, with several notable exceptions. Very early adopters of &#x27;tokio&#x27; 0.1 had a fair bit of work to do once &#x27;async&#x27; stabilized. And OpenSSL has been a constant thorn in my side, despite being a native C dependency.<p>One handy tip: Don&#x27;t force yourself to constantly update your code to use all the latest features.

I&#x27;d like to bring some data to this discussion.<p>In 2019, we had eight releases: 1.32 to 1.40.<p>- 1.32: one language adjustment, finishing off previous module work<p>- 1.33: const fn can do a few more things<p>- 1.34: you can do a bit more with procedural macros<p>- 1.35: a few minor details around closures<p>- 1.36: NLL comes to Rust 2015. Not really a new feature so much as backporting it to an older edition.<p>- 1.37: you can #[repr(align(N))] on enums<p>- 1.38: no real language changes<p>- 1.39: async fn! some adjustments to match. Some more borrow checker adjustments.<p>- 1.40: #[non_exhaustive]. The 1.39 borrow checker adjustments are ported to an older edition. Macros can go in a few more places.<p>Really, 1.39 was a huge release, and other than that... all language changes were very minor, mostly sanding off some edge cases, making some things more orthogonal, stuff like that.<p>Most releases these days add some standard library APIs, maybe we have some toolchain improvements... but for all of 2019, we had one feature I&#x27;d call truly major.<p>I suspect that things were a lot more hectic previously, but the language has slowed way, way down recently. We have had two releases so far this year, and I would argue that the only real language feature was an expansion around match patterns. Which again, isn&#x27;t so much a new feature as it is adding a little bit to an old one.<p>Churn is real. It&#x27;s important to keep in mind.

Cautious, small, gradual changes over time seem safer than big releases every year or so, but particulary because of Rust&#x27;s approach to stability. When Rust has a new feature implemented, it does not immediately become part of the stable language. Instead, Rust only commits to stability for a feature once it has been properly tested.

I first got into it late 1997. I am astonished at how incompetent it is. The fact the OP made a career out of it and made some money is hardly amazing. For the level of talent required contrasted against the average compensation I am surprised not everybody is trying it. You too could be earning 6 figures in a low cost of living economy after completing a boot camp and 2 years experience not being any good.<p>Don’t really know how to do your job? No problem. After 30 years web technology standards have largely solidified and cross browser concerns are no longer noticeable. If you work on the front end a large framework and 10000 NPM packages can be pushed into a website to do all the heavy lifting. If that’s not enough jQuery is still a thing. If that’s still not enough the business will simply hire additional bodies to fill the gaps of accessibility and any original problems that might come up. The backend is pretty similar with Spring MVC, Maven, and tons of data packages that perform data or service handling for spring.<p>The last half of my corporate career has been spent trying to untangle the spaghetti mistakes of other developers who probably shouldn’t have writing any unsupervised code as opposed to writing original feature logic.<p>I know many developers have lost their jobs in the current economic crisis. This includes both good developers and really bad developers. In all the bad and disruption that comes from that I hope businesses will become more thoughtful about simply throwing money away on web technologies and developers.<p>Historically businesses have vaguely realized just how bad and incompetent their web technology is but never did anything to fix it. Some businesses, even large mega .coms, would go bust than fix it (and their business). Really the only answer ever applied was <i>hire better talent<\/i> without defining what that is and without any plan on what to do with or how to apply that new talent. That is a leadership&#x2F;business problem and not a technology or talent problem. Hiring is not the answer but instead only feeds the problem. It makes sense though, bad leaders aren’t going to blame themselves for problems like this and it’s generally not their money they are throwing away on bad decisions and empty solutions.<p>Other industries have solved these problems long ago.

Right now it&#x27;s 1:1 with the virtual space and makes geometric &quot;sense&quot;, but it might be nice to be able to focus on screens on the left&#x2F;right by moving your head less and having your focus move just as fast. For example, moving your head 50% of what you do now to zoom over to the same place would reduce neck strain when looking at those windows, but also open up a bit more window space if, for example, you could still move your neck 100% of what you&#x27;re doing and be able to &quot;look over&quot; far enough to fit another set of screens even further out.

Perhaps instead of craning your head to look at a window that isn&#x27;t &quot;straight ahead&quot; for a long time (as long as you&#x27;re working in that window), you could do a quick glance at that window and hit a keyboard shortcut that would recenter wherever you&#x27;re looking to be your &quot;straight ahead&quot;, so you could then straighten your neck back out and continue working in that window while in a more comfortable position. c.f. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;u6SI284.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;u6SI284.png<\/a><p>3) Likewise, we don&#x27;t all have amazing headset resolutions and there&#x27;s a lot of potentially wasted space whenever focusing on a particular window that&#x27;s not &quot;full-screened&quot;.

The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera.<p>&gt;Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed over the years with editing, camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films. [...]<p>&gt;In the 1890s, films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or slapstick. There was little to no cinematic technique, the film was usually black and white and it was without sound. [...]<p>&gt;Within eleven years of motion pictures, the films moved from a novelty show to an established large-scale entertainment industry. Films moved from a single shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions.<p>&gt;By 1900, the first motion pictures that can be considered &quot;films&quot; – emerged, and film-makers began to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.<p>Simply projecting desktop user interfaces designed for flat 2D screens and mice into VR is still in the &quot;novelty show&quot; age, like filming staged plays written for a theater, without any editing, shots, or film grammar.<p>VR window managers are just a stop-gap backwards-compatibility bridge, while people work on inventing a grammar and language of interactive VR and AR user interfaces, and re-implement all the desktop and mobile applications from the ground up so they&#x27;re not merely usable but actually enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing to use in VR.<p>The current definition of &quot;window manager,&quot; especially as it applies to X-Windows desktops, tightly constrains how we think and what we expect of user interface and application design. We need something much more flexible and extensible. Unfortunately X-Windows decades ago rejected the crucially important ideas behind NeWS and AJAX, that the window manager should be open-ended and dynamically extensible with downloadable code, which is the key to making efficient, deeply integrated user interfaces.<p>For example, the &quot;Dragon Naturally Speaking&quot; speech synthesis and recognition system has &quot;dragonfly&quot;, a Python-based &quot;speech manager&quot; that is capable of hooking into existing unmodified desktop applications, and scripting custom speech based user interfaces.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;t4ngo&#x2F;dragonfly\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;t4ngo&#x2F;dragonfly<\/a><p>Another more ambitious example is Morgan Dixon&#x27;s work on Prefab, that screen-scrapes the pixels of desktop apps, and uses pattern recognition and composition to remix and modify them. This is like cinematographers finally discovering they can edit films, cut and splice shots together, overlay text and graphics and pictures-in-pictures and adjacent frames. But Prefab isn&#x27;t built around a scripting language like dragonfly, NeWS or AJAX.<p>Here&#x27;s some stuff I&#x27;ve written about the direction that user interfaces should take to move beyond the antique notion of &quot;window managers&quot;, and enables much deeper integration and accessibility and alternative input and output methods.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14182061\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14182061<\/a><p>&gt;Glad to see people are still making better window managers! [...] I think extensibility and accessibility are extremely important for window managers. [...] I&#x27;d like to take that idea a lot further, so I wrote up some ideas about programming window management, accessibility, screen scraping, pattern recognition and automation in JavaScript. [...] Check out Morgan Dixon&#x27;s and James Fogarty&#x27;s amazing work on user interface customization with Prefab, about which they&#x27;ve published several excellent CHI papers: [...]<p>&gt;Imagine if every interface was open source. Any of us could modify the software we use every day. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have the source.<p>&gt;Prefab realizes this vision using only the pixels of everyday interfaces. This video shows the use of Prefab to add new functionality to Adobe Photoshop, Apple iTunes, and Microsoft Windows Media Player. Prefab represents a new approach to deploying HCI research in everyday software, and is also the first step toward a future where anybody can modify any interface.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18797818\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18797818<\/a><p>&gt;Here are some other interesting things related to scriptable window management and accessibility to check out:\naQuery -- Like jQuery for Accessibility<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;mediawiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;AQuery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;mediawiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;AQuery<\/a><p>&gt;It would also be great to flesh out the accessibility and speech recognition APIs, and make it possible to write all kinds of intelligent application automation and integration scripts, bots, with nice HTML user interfaces in JavaScript.
