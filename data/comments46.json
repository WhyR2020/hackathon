Reading the original humanizes him. He is at once humble and yet confident that he&#x27;d discovered something important. Today, we take Descartes ideas completely for granted, and even find them trivial, and yet to realize the immense shift in thinking it represented in his time, makes it all the more impressive. I would even argue that Descartes&#x27; ideas were more important than any save Euclid in forming the foundation of modern math and physics - he was the one that divorced the notion of &quot;quantity&quot; from &quot;length of a line segment&quot;! It&#x27;s just so great to read the original.<p>Interestingly, Riemann got almost all of his papers included in this book, the most pages by far of any author. Clearly Hawking <i>loved<\/i> Riemann - and no wonder. Riemann was the one who truly generalized geometry, and its interesting that his work in that area was mostly ignored until 50 years after it was published, when Einstein used it for General Relativity. He made enormous contributions to lots of other fields, too.<p>Oh, and it was really cool reading Boole&#x27;s words, and recognizing that he was explicitly talking in terms of creating a calculus of thought!<p>So, yeah, I love this book because we often talk about &quot;the shoulders of giants&quot; but we rarely actually read them directly.

Great question. What was the most &quot;mind bending&quot; moment in cinema? The ending to The Sixth Sense or the trial and conviction of Harvey Weinstein?

Lapham<p>“Cat’s Cradle” by Kurt Vonnegut<p>Above, in chronological order, are the books that changed my life. It is weird looking at that list, as each book is tied to such a fundamental shift in my life. They each taught me about something fundamentally new and different. Faith, spirituality, economics, thought, power, society, nature, technology. It should appear obvious by looking at the list, there are plenty of opposite pairs, dipole books if you will, present. Bending one’s mind has multiple phases, first when one goes from knowing nothing to knowing something. Depending on what was learned, this can definitely be mind bending. But not everyone rides the second phase, going from knowing something to learning that it wasn’t the whole thing, or wasn’t the only way to interpret such a thing, or wasn’t entirely correct, or perhaps, in our largely subjective world, is not true at all.<p>Certain books can only speak to certain people at certain times of their life. It’s just the beauty of the whole thing. And to the core of this thread, one actually has to believe something, truly and passionately, in order for them to then have their world view bent and turned on its head. This is the hardest lesson that many won’t really ever opt to face. The core of truth, learning, and wisdom comes when you finally read (and thus think) something that takes a belief you previously held as passionately true, unalterably true, core-to-identity true, and  made you wrestle with the reality that it may, perhaps, not be. That’s the biggest mind f<i><\/i>* of them all.<p>One’s entire worldview is constructed of things they believe. But those things you believe come, for some more than others, from what one read, purposefully or not.

For example, Uttar Pradesh, which is a state that has about the population of the entire US, had 5 or 6 state engineering colleges (+ IIT Kanpur + Univ. of Roorkee + Banaras Hindu Univ, which were national level institutions).<p>The AICTE which controls technical education in India, mandated that no CS department should take more than 65 students in a year.<p>I think what changed was Y2K. I suspect under pressure from NASSCOM, (led by the charismatic Dewang Mehta [1]), B.Tech in CSE got doubled in number by creating a second department called I.T. thus working around existing norms. In the 5 years following, engineering education itself got &quot;liberalized&quot; by allowing a large number of private for-profit colleges.<p>The impression was that they will become places like Harvard and MIT, just because private is better than public sector. Many of these colleges still do not want to employ qualified teaching staff - the faculty are mostly people with just a B.Tech degree from similar colleges, who did not get a job in the tech sector, hence are willing to pay for dirt pay, and under draconian corporate-style management.<p>The situation is true to this day.<p>An inevitable result has been the deluge of people ill-trained, but holding a degree, tarnishing the reputation of Indian engineering education.<p>TLDR: 20 years ago, there were very few engineering colleges in India, the degree was prized, and the graduates were kind-of well-trained. Then there was a huge and unregulated explosion in graduates from for-profit colleges. Today, the graduates who are assured of good jobs and whose degrees hold value, are still those from the pre-1990s engineering colleges.<p>Doctors have resisted a similar dilution of norms. But recently India achieved a significant &quot;number&quot; - one can only hope that the doctors are better off than the engineers.

The questions in the exam will be exactly same as those solved in the class. That means people without proper understanding of concepts can still get A+ grades by memorization techniques. But it is PITA if you actually have some interest in subject. You may not get good grades if you write right answers in exams but they aren&#x27;t like what is in the book.<p>* Too many people enter Engineering, especially CSE in hope of getting a Job. Entrance process is based completely on basic sciences and while better than other exams, people still game the system by studying four years for entrance exams. This and management quota in Engineering colleges leads to huge influx of students out of them somewhere like 2% - 5% actually have interest in the branch of engineering they take.<p>* Talent gets no recognition many times. Rote-based exams make it easy to distinguish average from absolute low. But average and talented appear to be at same level because a talented person can be as good as an average but hard working student in these rote based exams.<p>* Since there is huge influx of students and huge number of engineering colleges, most faculty is underskilled and better we could have robots teach us. We had a teacher who doesn&#x27;t appear to indent C code, but also has a &quot;qualification&quot; in &quot;distributed systems&quot; and &quot;computer networking&quot;.<p>* Something that has been a problem to me: I was pretty good in basic sciences, passed entrance exam with good marks without any tedious &quot;coaching&quot;, and I took up CSE because I was interested in computer science.\nThe first year of engineering syllabus consists of same common subjects to all branches, like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (Calculus) and introductory courses to other engineering disciplines (C programming is only CSE related thing they teach us). That&#x27;s improperly using one year. However relevant those subjects are, they aren&#x27;t as relevant as teaching programming&#x2F;CS related subjects in practice. We will have campus placements in 7th semester and due to this, we only get 2nd and 3rd year to actually study CSE. Even those subjects wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem apart from being waste of time - but they are too rote learning based and uninteresting - As in teaching some methodologies to solve some kind of numerical problems and asking them in exam. Today as I am writing this I have an online exam some hours later. I never thought I would be grades in 7&#x2F;10 range but the uninteresting and rote based nature of these exams doesn&#x27;t motivate me to study anything.<p>And this &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; kool-aid has another effect. I have seen even toppers of my class not understanding recursion and algorithm complexity. Because algorithm complexity is not taught in first year. We only get to learn C programming (No &#x27;advanced&#x27; concepts like malloc &#x2F; free, file I&#x2F;O) in first year. This is huge waste of resources because all these rote learned physics fundamentals don&#x27;t be useful for most of these people in practice. They will be forgotten after exams. If they had taught something related to CS, at least it would be useful to do side projects and have something more on our resumes, and would be perhaps useful as an engineer.<p>* Perhaps as a result of the above, Syllabus is far behind the actual advancements in technology. Git? Apparently only members of college&#x27;s coding club know what that is. Docker? What&#x27;s that?<p>I am frustrated. It is just pointless. Especially because all this is too costly for a middle class rural student and we have to get education loans. If it was not the societal pressure &#x2F; norms, I could have self studied and could have become a better engineer.

At first it just clicked certain locations that buttons would be on a fixed schedule to advance a quest to the end and repeat.  But then, being a flash game after all, sometimes it would take a second to load the next screen which throws off the timings and breaks the sequence.  So I changed it to wait for pixels to change color as an indication that something finished loading and to start the next sequence of clicks.  But that didn&#x27;t end up being very reliable because the colors &amp; locations weren&#x27;t always exactly the same, so I updated it to take a screenshot and use it to find the <i>average<\/i> color of an area of the game where a button would be which ended up being a much more reliable timing indicator.  But then it was very slow&#x2F;used a lot of CPU (and I needed all that CPU to go to running the flash game in a 2005 browser on a 2002 dell), and using a scripting language to sum up 100k pixels every frame just wasn&#x27;t fast enough.  So I wrote a single C function to do the color averaging on a byte buffer, <i>copied the raw compiled machine code (as hex) into AutoHotkey and directly called it with DllCall<\/i> to get the summed result: ah, much faster.  But there was still an unreliable aspect where the position of the game in the browser window and the location of the browser window was fiddly to configure, and my siblings had a hard time getting it set up.  It turns out IE used standard windows controls in the browser which (if you look in the right place) exposed the location of the flash bounding box, and with some calculations relative to the browser window I made all the click locations relative to the flash window, which solved that problem.  It think it also supported browser scaling because we liked to play it at higher than 100% zoom.<p>I ended up being more interested in the programming than the game, and my first published project was an array library to make working with associative arrays (where each element is a separate variable myarray1, myarray2, myarray3 etc) easier with insert&#x2F;delete&#x2F;append etc operations, before AutoHotkey added true arrays and objects.<p>Then I went to university for chemistry for 2 years before getting my wits about me and realizing that I would probably be more interested in CS."],"time":["2020-05-13 00:37:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geocrasher"],"id":[23157759],"kids":[23158574],"parent":[23156060],"text":["A thousand times, this.

You can also embed shell scripts or AppleScript. Each macro can have a number of triggers, most commonly Hot Key triggers.<p>## (Keyboard and) mouse shortcuts<p>Keyboard Maestro’s triggers can associate custom shortcuts with your macros. Most of my macros have Hot Key triggers, which capture to keyboard shortcuts. For example, Shift+Ctrl+S triggers a macro that puts my laptop screen to sleep.<p>However, to respond to a mouse input like Scroll Wheel Left, you would have to use a Device Key trigger. A Device Key trigger responds to a single device input, but sadly, it doesn’t block the input from being passed to the OS. In this example, whatever your cursor is over would scroll left in addition to the macro being activated.<p>To replicate the `Send, {NumpadAdd}` part of your script, you would add a Type a Keystroke block to your macro. One nice thing about KeyboardMaestro is it can record the keystroke, so you don’t have to remember names like “NumpadAdd”.<p>If you don’t want to buy Keyboard Maestro, macOS’s built-in Automator (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-ca&#x2F;guide&#x2F;automator&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;mac\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-ca&#x2F;guide&#x2F;automator&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;mac<\/a>, free) can be used in some cases. For examples, compare three of the solutions on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;137047&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;137047&#x2F;<\/a> for working around bad default <U+2318>C behavior in Books: my simple Keyboard Maestro solution, someone’s straightforward Automator solution, and my shorter, situation-specific Automator solution.<p>## Hotstrings for math<p>I used to use TextExpander ([TextExpander]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textexpander.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textexpander.com&#x2F;<\/a>, currently $40&#x2F;year) for something like this. I had `ddate` mapped to the current date, and `solang` marked to a block of markup I used on Stack Overflow. TextExpander implements the direct equivalent to AutoHotkey hotstrings, and is probably the best way to implement short hotstrings like `;a`.<p>However, for my purposes, I realized that I could insert pieces of text more simply by using another program I was already using: LaunchBar (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obdev.at&#x2F;products&#x2F;launchbar&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obdev.at&#x2F;products&#x2F;launchbar&#x2F;<\/a>, currently $30). While its most obvious feature is launching applications, one of its many other features is inserting text snippets. You define text snippets by putting text files in a certain folder. Your defined snippets are then added to your global list of searcheable items, alongside applications you can open and so on.<p>To insert a snippet such as the current date using LaunchBar, I open a LaunchBar window with Command-Space, type `date` to find the “Current Date (ISO format)” snippet, and press Return to insert it.<p>Also note that macOS makes typing special characters easier in general. All macOS keyboard layouts let you access an alternate layer of characters by holding Option. For example, Option-8 types ‘•’. If you would rather Option-A typed ‘<U+2200>’ instead of ‘å’, you could set that up by defining a custom math-focused keyboard layout with Ukelele (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.sil.org&#x2F;ukelele&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.sil.org&#x2F;ukelele&#x2F;<\/a>, free). I have used Ukelele to define my own keyboard layout “U.S. – Rory custom” that makes smart quotes and apostrophes (“”‘’) easier to type.<p>## Markdown links<p>You could do this with Keyboard Maestro. It has actions for reading from and writing to the clipboard, and for appending to, prepending to, and searching and replacing in text variables.<p>Just a few days ago I implemented a Vim editor mapping to do a similar thing: turn the selected text into a link with the clipboard used as the URL. Of course, it only works in Vim. Here’s the source:<p><pre><code>  &quot; create Markdown link from selected text using URL in clipboard\n  &quot; uses vim-surround, so can’t be vnoremap\n  vmap &lt;Leader&gt;ml s]%a()&lt;Esc&gt;&quot;*Pl\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\n## Fast Window Switching<p>I used to have something set up for this. I used Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) to map my fn key to the combination of Shift-Control-Option-Command. Then, with Keyboard Maestro, I mapped <U+21E7>^<U+2325><U+2318>F to open the Finder and so on. That let me type fn+F to switch directly to the Finder.<p>Karabiner was forced to be rewritten as Karabiner-Elements (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karabiner-elements.pqrs.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karabiner-elements.pqrs.org&#x2F;<\/a>, free and open source) because of changes in macOS, and it lost some features in the process. I haven’t checked if mapping of fn is one of them. I don’t use Karabiner-Elements because I rarely used my fn mappings and my current model of laptop doesn’t have real function keys to remap.<p>As for window groups to switch within, Keyboard Maestro doesn’t have a built-in concept like that. I think you could implement it, though – “if” statements can check the app of the current window.<p>## Remapping the calculator button<p>This would be a straightforward application of Keyboard Maestro.<p>## Scihubize<p>Same as above.<p>---<p>That covers everything in your article as much as macOS software is capable of. You may also be interested in…<p>## Features I use without equivalents in this article<p>Keyboard Maestro lets you define a Quick Macro – a sequence of keypresses and clicks. I can press Ctrl-F1 to start recording, execute a sequence, then press Ctrl-F1 to stop recording. After that, Option-F1 will run the sequence. I use this, for example, in my browser to scroll many adjacent newly-opened tabs down to the start of the content, by recording and replaying the sequence Ctrl-Tab, Down, Down, Down, etc.<p>Keyboard Maestro also supports image recognition for clicking on the screenshotted GUI element or waiting for something to appear on the screen. I’ve used this to make a macro that uses the System Preferences GUI to toggle a setting – it decides whether to move the selection up or down by recognizing the image of the currently-selected preference. I’ve also used it to abort a macro if I don’t see the expected window open after a certain step (which could happen if the GUI was in a certain state), to avoid executing further keypresses in the wrong window.<p>LaunchBar comes with a built-in clipboard history manager. I use this to copy, for example, both a title and URL in one window, knowing they will be saved. Then, after switching to another window, I use the clipboard history to paste both of them where they need to go."],"time":["2020-05-12 22:41:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gjs278"],"id":[23163771],"kids":{},"parent":[23156060],"text":["I wrote the autoclicker at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.garyshood.com&#x2F;rsclient&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.garyshood.com&#x2F;rsclient&#x2F;<\/a> that people still use today"],"time":["2020-05-13 07:29:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["bingo_cannon"],"id":[23156990],"kids":[23161585,23162926],"parent":[23154846],"text":["This looks really neat!

Toss a coin.<p>2. If heads, then toss the coin again (ignoring the outcome), and answer the question honestly.<p>3. If tails, then toss the coin again and answer &quot;Yes&quot; if heads, &quot;No&quot; if tails.<p>(The seemingly redundant extra toss in the first case is needed in situations where just the act of tossing a coin may be observed by others, even if the actual result stays hidden.) The confidentiality then arises from the refutability of the individual responses.<p>But, overall, these data with many responses are significant, since positive responses are given to a quarter by people who do not have the attribute A and three-quarters by people who actually possess it. Thus, if p is the true proportion of people with A, then we expect to obtain (1&#x2F;4)(1-p) + (3&#x2F;4)p = (1&#x2F;4) + p&#x2F;2 positive responses. Hence it is possible to estimate p.<p>In particular, if the attribute A is synonymous with illegal behavior, then answering &quot;Yes&quot; is not incriminating, insofar as the person has a probability of a &quot;Yes&quot; response, whatever it may be.&quot;"],"time":["2020-05-12 23:29:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fraggle222"],"id":[23162041],"kids":{},"parent":[23145350],"text":["Basically invented Proof of Work (see Bitcoin):<p>Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.

Personally, i spend more on food because i have no office cafeteria nearby. The benefits are mostly in quality of life and in having control of your life."],"time":["2020-05-12 22:38:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0x8BADF00D"],"id":[23161711],"kids":{},"parent":[23153825],"text":["&gt; The possibility of working remotely isn’t available to everyone, with one Canadian study estimating that only 44 per cent of jobs are compatible with telecommuting. Remote work is particularly common among university graduates, managers and professionals, but its practice also depends on the sector and the nature of the job. Finance, for example, compared to manufacturing, is more suitable to remote work. Consequently, many workers are deprived of an alternative that allows them to continue working during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.<p>This is due to a couple of different things. Our system for organizing production is outdated. The joint stock corporation is an outdated system. We need something more akin to DAOs. Then employees will be as equally empowered.<p>Additionally, the fiat monetary system encourages parasitism and inefficiency. With sound money, everyone can benefit. Unlike the current monetary system we have in place.<p>Cryptocurrency is a poor store of value, but I think is valuable in denoting ownership of something. If you’re given tokens in a DAO, it should be a token or coin that denotes ownership rather than a store of value. This way those who take on the lion’s share of risk, whether they are early investors or employees, will be rewarded the most. It also flattens the management structure substantially. Not much room in a DAO for parasites. Because you need to put your money where your mouth is, so to speak.<p>In summary, this inequality stems from outdated systems that need to be replaced. As I’ve stated in many previous comments, capitalism is the purest filter with which to perceive reality. There is no bullshit allowed.

I know both softwares pretty well (I read both manuals) but in the end, having 2 DAWs is useless.<p>I think overall, Logic has mostly an audience of &quot;hardware&quot; people. As in: musicians who compose and record with hardware, and then mix in Logic. From the top of my head, Calvin Harris and Disclosure use Logic, mostly for putting together recorded audio and mixing, but not really for writing. Also, professional mixers who are used to massive mixing consoles use either Logic, Pro Tools or Cubase. Adele&#x27;s &quot;Hello&quot; was mixed in Logic. These 3 DAWs have a lot of similarities. One of them is their &quot;skeuomorphic&quot; interface. Why do digital faders look like the real ones? There&#x27;s no need to. Alos, the arrangement-only view. Or the plugin inserts and bus&#x2F;aux channeling. But I think all of this emphasizes the need to satisfy the &quot;hardware&quot; audience, who want to have the digital equivalent of their hardware interface.<p>Ableton on the other hand (and Fruity Loops for that matter) didn&#x27;t look at the hardware. They created an interface for the digital age. That&#x27;s why faders are just colored bars. Session view? Genius. Very intuitive. Instrument racks to regroup plugins? Straightforward. You want to do parallel processing? No need for a bus or aux track: just create a second chain in your instrument rack and you&#x27;ve got your parallel processing done. It literally takes 3 clicks to go from a plugin insert to parallel processing. Color-tagging your samples and plugins? Yep. Compare that to Logic where loading a plugin requires you to navigate from dropdown upon dropdown. You can&#x27;t even group inserts to disable them all at once.<p>Now I used to go with Logic for my mixing and mastering purposes. Having 2 separate DAWs allowed me to separate the creative from the &quot;engineering&quot; process of mixing. Logic also has great comping features, a nice &quot;flex&quot; mode, a better quantization tool, and nice built-in plugins. Also, the slower workflow felt better for mixing. But now I just do everything in Ableton.<p>With this update, Logic is going into Ableton territory. Sampler-&gt; Sampler. Quick Sampler-&gt;Simpler. Step Sequencer-&gt;Session View. But I don&#x27;t think that adding a few features on top of an outdated workflow will turn me away from Ableton.<p>It&#x27;s weird that they&#x27;re going into that direction because I always felt that there was a clear distinction between Ableton and Logic, and that the lack of crucial Ableton features (like the aforementioned comping) was to not annoy the Logic developers.

If the predictor&#x2F;compressor is a biological or artificial recurrent neural network (RNN), it will automatically create feature hierarchies, lower level neurons corresponding to simple feature detectors similar to those found in human brains, higher layer neurons typically corresponding to more abstract features, but fine-grained where necessary. Like any good compressor, the RNN will learn to identify shared regularities among different already existing internal data structures, and generate prototype encodings (across neuron populations) or symbols for frequently occurring observation sub-sequences, to shrink the storage space needed for the whole (we see this in our artificial RNNs all the time). Self-symbols may be viewed as a by-product of this, since there is one thing that is involved in all actions and sensory inputs of the agent, namely, the agent itself. To efficiently encode the entire data history through predictive coding, it will profit from creating some sort of internal prototype symbol or code (e. g. a neural activity pattern) representing itself. Whenever this representation becomes activated above a certain threshold, say, by activating the corresponding neurons through new incoming sensory inputs or an internal ‘search light’ or otherwise, the agent could be called self-aware. No need to see this as a mysterious process — it is just a natural by-product of partially compressing the observation history by efficiently encoding frequent observations.<\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2xcyrl&#x2F;i_am_j%C3%BCrgen_schmidhuber_ama&#x2F;cp44iba&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2xcyrl&#x2F;i_a...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-12 20:29:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Animats"],"id":[23159738],"kids":[23160440,23161371,23164547,23164041,23164124,23163961,23163972],"parent":[23157312],"text":["It&#x27;s nice that someone now has the neural wiring diagram for part of a mouse brain.

For present-day AI systems, that means we have to look at the level of the computer chip. Standard chips use the Von Neumann architecture, in which one transistor typically receives input from a couple of other transistors and projects also only to a couple of others. This is radically different from the causal mechanism in the brain, which is vastly more complex.<p>This riles me up for so many reasons. Transistors (and computers) are capable of emulating more complex systems. Looking at a transistor you will not understand why your mail can&#x27;d be delivered, nor will you understand consciousness from an individual neuron. Consciousness is related to behaviour, and both are related to survival and the environment. AI&#x27;s don&#x27;t have such an environment as of yet so they can&#x27;t be conscious yet, but they could be.

But seriously, why should consciousness be so special as to require a quality that can&#x27;t be observed through behaviour (understanding that it is non-physical, non-observable)? P-zombies are just a thought experiment, and a bad one. Why should consciousness exist? To protect the body, to self reproduce, to exist. It exists to exist and evolve. And this is done by behaviour, by acting in a smart way. How would p-zombies come to be, if not through fighting for survival? Without the evolutionary mechanism there is no explanation for consciousness, and the evolutionary argument is sufficient. Consciousness is the inner optimisation loop, the outer one being evolution. They both work for survival, for their own sake.<p>An AI could repeat the same process by evolving as a population of agents cooperating and competing between themselves. They would have to be inside an environment that is complex enough, and they should be subject to evolution.

The idea is to detect whether seriously brain-injured patients are conscious, or whether truly no one is home... but the consciousness-meter tells us that about a fifth of them remain conscious, in line with brain-imaging experiments.&quot;<p>The consciousness-meter observes the system they are trying to make an inference on - but as others have pointed out, is not categorically different than brain scans [1]. Further it&#x27;s worth making a distinction between medical consciousness and the Qualia kind of consciousness - which I think this conflates. Largely because nobody knows how to measure the latter, and we are barely able to measure the former with &quot;Level of Consciousness&quot; and Grady Coma Scale being the standard. [2]<p>&quot;Our theory says that if we want to decide whether or not a machine is conscious, we shouldn&#x27;t look at the behavior of the machine, but at the actual substrate that has causal power&quot;<p>This seems to only address the medical form of consciousness and does not tie it to the philosophical concept in any concrete way - while also contradicting the concept that observation is the key.

I would argue it is impossible to actually measure whether a system has Qualia, it is inherently subjective - so it&#x27;s possible that they are simplifying without stating that directly.<p>I&#x27;d go further and ask, does it matter if it does?

The slightly longer answer is that whatever consciousness is, it appears to be an emerging property of a bit of wetware that we can simulate only partly and in a very imperfect way and only at a very modest scale currently that definitely shows no signs of being conscious. We know it&#x27;s the brain responsible for this stuff because damaging it or chemically manipulating seems to change people&#x27;s personality, sense of self, mood, etc. We can even read parts of the brain out and interface with it at a primitive level.<p>Scaling all that up is an engineering challenge with a mildly predictable roadmap measured in a couple of decades and exponentially larger than that beyond. We get better at hardware and at some point the complexity of the hardware exceeds that of the wetware.<p>However, fixing our algorithms and simulation detail (i.e. how this hardware is wired together) is a different matter. As my neural networks teacher used to joke: &quot;this is a linear algebra class; if you came here for a biology lecture you are in the wrong place&quot;. Full disclosure, I dropped out of that course because I was a bit out of my depth on the math front. But simply put, the math behind this stuff is a vast simplification based on a naive model of what a brain cell might do that happens to produce interesting enough results for specific use cases that have so far very little to do with emulating consciousness.<p>There seem to be lots of researchers assuming other researcher are actively working on that but mostly what is going on is people trying to get more practical short term results. Deep learning is a good example of such a thing. It might have emergent properties if you scale that up that might resemble something like a conscious. But doing that or validating that assumption is not actually something a lot of people work on and nor is it actually a goal for most AI researchers. Their goal is simply to figure out how to get this stuff to do things for us (image recognition, playing go, etc.).<p>But do we actually need to be exact with our modeling here? Mostly our brains seem to self organize from information built into our DNA. Those blueprints are at a different level of complexity than the end result by a few orders of magnitudes. And we know that personalities for the same sets of DNAs can widely differ (e.g. identical twins).<p>The way brains work is biochemically convenient under the constraints that life emerged under. But if you get rid of some of those constraints, there are probably other ways to get similar enough results.<p>IMHO a clean room replication of a brain like AI is unlikely to happen before we manage to drastically enhance the capabilities of an existing brain; which is a much easier engineering challenge. If you take that to the extreme, at what point is the wetware no longer essential and what happens when that is disconnected? Once you enhance or replace most of a brain, at what point does the resulting conscious hybrid entity begin and end? That seems a more likely path to producing a conscious AI. Experiments on that front are likely to be extremely unpopular for a while given the risk. But at the same time a lot of this stuff is already happening on a small scale."],"time":["2020-05-13 00:43:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["humanfromearth"],"id":[23160331],"kids":{},"parent":[23157312],"text":["Yes."],"time":["2020-05-12 23:46:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bergstromm466"],"id":[23162439],"kids":{},"parent":[23157312],"text":["The real question I have is: why do you want to have a complex relationship with a computer?

[1]<p>I literally just ordered a GoPro Fusion last night so that I can create 3D captures of hiking trails using photogrammetry. I will then use the 3D trail models for reinforcement learning for my off road robot. [2]<p>The basic pipeline is images to Meshroom (perhaps with pre-processing since Meshroom doesn&#x27;t seem to support 360 cameras), then instant-meshes to reduce the poly count of the mesh, Blender to map the texture on to the new low poly mesh, save as .glb file in Blender, then open in habitat-sim for machine learning. Blender was the hardest part to learn, but tutorials on youtube walk through the whole process.<p>Interestingly the GoPro Fusion is pretty cheap now, as GoPro has a new model which is apparently not much of an improvement. So while the new model is $499, the Fusion is currently $179 on Amazon.<p>Previously I have tried photogrammetry of trails with cell phone video. It works really well but the narrow field of view of the cell phone camera compared to the whole 360 degree scene means the resulting 3D reconstruction has lots of holes, and the model is only well reconstructed immediately around the trail - wider terrain is missed.<p>The 360 camera captures all angles, front and back, sides and top. It should make for some fun immersive video to throw on youtube but it will also be great for photogrammetry.

It drops me to a file browser... but still no &quot;Create&quot; or &quot;New doc&quot; button.

Generating &#x27;new&#x27; and creative images with computation is very interesting topic. I was particularly curious about the architectural and interior explorations from this user [1].<p>I signed up and explored what the free account permits [3,4]; however, I have to say I feel the same about this project as I did about &quot;NLP Tool for Technological Research&quot; (30 days ago) [2]. Unless you can upload an image you&#x27;re familiar with, something you&#x27;ve worked on, I just don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m seeing.<p>Personally, I enjoy studying composition. I enjoy abstract works of Suprematists, Cubists, Futurists, Abstract Expressionists. All of which I think could be more or less reimagined with computational means.<p>So for my WOW, I want to see what Artbreeder does to an image I&#x27;m already familiar with, or how it can imitate other visual styles.<p>In the last case I really need to see the input, because if the results appear similar to the input there will be copyright issues. In one of my experiments [5] I used the mixed images feature. This provides a graph which gives the appearance of showing how the image was created. Then again, not seeing any code, I don&#x27;t know for sure what else was used which may or may not be subject to copyright. I&#x27;m not saying the project should be open source, but maybe there is some detail that can be exposed, and used to recreate the effect with a different image. If you can do that, then QED the result is not cribbed from un-cited sources. It&#x27;s just computational pixel-pushing (heck, is it?).<p>I did some graphic design work early in my career and when we &quot;appropriated&quot; an image to be part of a photoshop composition, the rule of thumb was always you should not be able to reference the source from what you sampled. Some people spoke about 5-10% of an image; however, if you were doing something with any significant visibility and didn&#x27;t pay for the source, the first rule was make it unidentifiable.<p>I don&#x27;t have any particular need for images right now. This is just my first impression based on my experience and what I can&#x27;t get enough of--more abstract art, or something that takes an image I&#x27;ve studied, have intimate familiarity, and says, This will look much better upside down! haha<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=03b855cd8c852c56b338\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=03b855cd8c852c56b338<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22847429\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22847429<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=ee55675001b83a64f71f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=ee55675001b83a64f71f<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=14366daddf2f12087211\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=14366daddf2f12087211<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=a8ec4e77d27dc33f92f3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artbreeder.com&#x2F;lineage?k=a8ec4e77d27dc33f92f3<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-12 15:42:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sharemywin"],"id":[23147649],"kids":{},"parent":[23147392],"text":["really cool."],"time":["2020-05-12 00:03:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["oklol123"],"id":[23152752],"kids":[23152853],"parent":[23147392],"text":["This kills the arts"],"time":["2020-05-12 13:15:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrismsimpson"],"id":[23150682],"kids":[23152050,23150896],"parent":[23147392],"text":["Art should not be easy"],"time":["2020-05-12 06:50:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["braythwayt"],"id":[23155974],"kids":[23162026,23161056,23155979],"parent":[23153469],"text":["Something, something, “Build your brand by writing.”<p>Something, something, “Communicating with words is as important as communicating with code in a team setting.”<p>But moving up Maslow’s Hierarchy, writing about ideas you want to personally explore (a’la pg) is exactly how you force yourself to think those ideas through.

This quote is from Chapter 15, which covers promoting your work:<p>&quot;At one point I was the number two user on Hacker News. I might have slipped down to number three...I think that people underrate Hacker News massively. I think there is a meme in the community that Hacker News threads are populated by toxic commenters and that it is a ceaselessly negative place such that the world would be better without Hacker News in it. I think unequivocally Hacker News is an extraordinary venue for value creation throughout the world, largely by bringing together technologists who would not have otherwise met each other. There are people who make lifelong relationships from that site. I met my former co-founders there; Thomas Ptacek is one of my best friends for life; and it feels extremely unlikely that I would have my current job but for Hacker News. I think you could say that for many people who are nowhere close to being quote-unquote on the leaderboard.<p>Hacker News helps disseminate ideas, like my ideas on sales and engineering career optimization and the body of practice that is dealing with venture funding, both from the startup side of the fence and from the investor side of the fence. These things would be difficult to get access to unless you had a high-quality social network that already had an expert about them in it. It is basically one step short of miraculous that you could find George Grellas, who is an expert Silicon Valley lawyer practicing for thirty years, and have George Grellas patiently walk you through the impacts of the changes in the independent contractor classification in the wake of Microsoft abuses in the 1990s. By the way, George Grellas was a practicing lawyer for Microsoft. That I could read that as a person who was newly an independent contractor working in central Japan in the late 2000s&#x2F;early 2010s is one step short of miraculous.<p>I&#x27;ll acknowledge that there are certain threads that are generally low quality, mostly things that are removed from the core interests of the technology industry. It&#x27;s not a particularly great watering hole to talk about politics, for example.

The Wordsum task is a 10-item vocabulary test commonly used as a measure of verbal intelligence (see Malhotra et al., 2007 for a review). In this task, a word in large print (e.g., “CLOISTERED”) appears above a series of smaller print words (e.g., bunched, secluded, malady, miniature, arched). Participants’ objective is to pick a small print word that is the best synonym for the large print target word. Scores on the Wordsum task were equal to the total number of correct responses provided.<p>- Raven’s Progressive Matrices. We administered Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) as a measure of abstract reasoning and non-verbal fluid intelligence (Bilker et al., 2012). In this task, participants are presented with a partially obscured visual pattern and must select the available pattern fragment that will successfully complete the pattern. The RPM is comprised of 60 items broken up into five levels of difficulty. In order to decrease time demands on participants, we randomly selected four items from each of the five difficulty levels, resulting in 20 RPM items being presented in Study 1. We calculated an RPM score for each participant by calculating the number of correct responses they provided.<p>Assuming this study was in fact performed and isn&#x27;t some weird bullshit inception joke, these &quot;intelligence&quot; tests seem flawed at best."],"time":["2020-05-12 01:31:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["s_m"],"id":[23149184],"kids":[23151306,23150293,23150774,23150206,23151630],"parent":[23145433],"text":["If I were well known as a master bullshitter, I would simply convince the world that being a master bullshitter was a sign of intelligence."],"time":["2020-05-12 02:26:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_Microft"],"id":[23152005],"kids":[23153345,23152041,23152099],"parent":[23145433],"text":["It reminds me of a game called &quot;Nobody is perfect&quot; where there are cards with names and words that usually only few people know (don&#x27;t worry, nobody is perfect).

So:<p>Don’t be surprised if you don’t write much if any code any more.<p>Your non technical colleagues will look to you to be accountable for all things technology, and they won’t understand any division of responsibilities between yourself and your technical colleagues. You’ll be front of house for engineering. You will be the link between the business objectives of the organization and the technical roadmap which supports those objectives.<p>Say goodbye to having clear requirements. More often than not you’ll be helping shape those requirements rather than being handed them. Software project estimates are an impossible dark art, but you need to do it anyway and communicate your cost modelling and assumptions. Your colleagues will rely on those estimates regardless of the caveats you attach, and no degree of Agile will save you from needing to make hard-landscape decisions based on imperfect information.<p>Get comfortable with sticking your neck out and being a little bit wrong. Just a little bit though!<p>You will rarely make decisions. You will frequently facilitate achieving consensus on decisions.<p>People will complain bitterly when things go wrong, so make sure you can justify the reasoning behind your recommendations.<p>Grow a thick skin. Finance people will tell you your to-be solution is too heavy on capex. Finance people will tell you the as-is solution is too heavy on opex. Project delivery people will tell you your solutions can’t be built and they’ll want you to hold their hand every step of the way. Engineers will accuse you of being an impragmatic dinosaur and of living in an ivory tower and of not understanding the details (and if you’ve any hope of going home at a reasonable hour, they’ll be right on that last one). Your job is to soak up the criticism, learn from it, adapt to it, and broker something that best fits all those competing objectives.<p>There will be times when what’s globally optimal is locally suboptimal, and you’ll have to deliver that message to the locals.<p>Curate corporate memory - you’ll be consulted regularly by people who will expect you to act like a wise sage who can explain the deep history of how your architecture came to be, what forces shaped it, and where it is going.<p>Your role delivers long-term value for your organization and will be viewed as a hindrance in the short-term. Get yourself aligned to people who share those long-term responsibilities - Risk and Policy people would be good choices, Sales and Service people \nwould be bad choices.<p>Find a business architect who can collaborate with you on delivering the non-technical change (people and process) that goes with your technical change.<p>Learn to spot the difference between a fad that the industry wastes $$$ on and genuine innovation that could unlock $$$$$ of genuine value (hint: you’ll be lucky to do this once in your career).<p>Prepare for the money to run out. What does your solution look like if only half gets built? Think about how to break up big work into small packages of deliverables and transition states. Your engineers will want to deliver continuously. You need to get on top of the risks of doing that.<p>Learn to speak plainly and simply. Your role isn’t about being a master of all the complexities of everything. You need to identify themes and patterns, and communicate those in a way that your colleagues will be able to internalise. You need to train them to instinctively do the right thing rather than do the wrong thing or come to you for validation of everything they do.<p>You need to exude clarity and purpose and vision.<p>Learn to trust your engineers to do what they do best - solve technical problems.

Many IT architects use simple tools for diagrams. The most common in my industry were PowerPoint and Google Slides. Even for very complex diagrams that can cover an entire wall.<p>2. Other architects will abuse diagramming standards and other standards. Ask them to describe their diagram instead of assuming what it means. For example, the vast majority of UML use case diagrams I have seen were used to describe flow, which is technically wrong.<p>3. Consider your role as one of advisor &#x2F; mentor &#x2F; coach. The best architecture will not always win due to other constraints, and you need to be able to compromise.<p>4. Another of your primary roles is that of educator and communicator. Many times people need to quickly understand the systems from a high level in order to make decisions. And they will come to you for that understanding.<p>5. Along with the above, you will likely be working a lot more with management because you are participating in high level decisions that often involve how money is spent. Learn how management prefers communication. Start with the bottom line: &quot;the preferred solution costs X and we have two other solutions that cost less but come with some cons&quot;. And then drill down into details as needed. A junior communicating with management always gives the details and justification up front and that is the opposite of how management thinks.<p>I hope that helps.

Build up your own &quot;fitness functions&quot; and constantly ensure they are looking healthy. e.g. Incident metrics (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlassian.com&#x2F;incident-management&#x2F;kpis&#x2F;common-metrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlassian.com&#x2F;incident-management&#x2F;kpis&#x2F;common-me...<\/a>), SLOs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landing.google.com&#x2F;sre&#x2F;resources&#x2F;practicesandprocesses&#x2F;art-of-slos&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landing.google.com&#x2F;sre&#x2F;resources&#x2F;practicesandprocess...<\/a>), Lighthouse scores, Time from raising a PR to deploying in production, etc. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thoughtworks.com&#x2F;insights&#x2F;articles&#x2F;fitness-function-driven-development\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thoughtworks.com&#x2F;insights&#x2F;articles&#x2F;fitness-funct...<\/a> Don&#x27;t be &quot;abstract&quot; when talking about maintainability, testability, observability, etc, but be able to support them with numbers.<p>* Draw yourself a line. Find out where you are the decision maker and where you are not. Example: don&#x27;t make your entire judgement based on &quot;how many people can be allocated&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s the cost&quot;, &quot;will users like this feature&quot;, etc. Budget, people &amp; UX are not your decision making responsibility, there are Managers, Directors, Product owners for that. Give your recommendations, but let them do their job. It&#x27;s easy to fall into the &quot;I know everything better&quot; trap.<p>* Don&#x27;t be a &quot;hired gun&quot; working feature after feature, or a firefighter resolving issue after issue. Have an agenda for the technology itself that you work on 30% of the time. 6 months down the line, regardless of projects or firefighting missions – you should be in a position to prove that the technology is maturing, like: &quot;In the last 6 months, our number of incidents&#x2F;bugs has decreased from &lt;X&gt; to &lt;Y&gt;&quot;, &quot;our time to ship features has decreased from &lt;X&gt; to &lt;Y&gt;&quot;, etc.<p>* Don&#x27;t – just don&#x27;t – ever give abstract advice. A major difference between experienced and novice engineers is – giving concrete examples, facts or metrics to back up. If you don&#x27;t have an example or use case, and if you just have a hunch, just keep it to yourself and move on. Remember that what you do is what other engineers will indirectly follow. You have to set engineering culture by example. If you talk abstract stuff or behave opinionated, engineers will reflect it right back."],"time":["2020-05-12 16:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tyingq"],"id":[23153807],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["I&#x27;d focus on things like how to write good documentation, diplomacy, negotiation, mentoring, presentation skills, etc. Non-tech stuff.

Practice Clean Code (e.g. some of what Bob Martin writes about, some of it is a bit...special).<p>Learn about pipelines, version control schemes, and the &quot;best&quot; way to implement it given your constraints. Specifically, how code gets merged, when it gets built, in what environment. I can answer questions about details here. Edit: You will also need to know how to organize your board in Jira, Rally, Azure DevOps, or whatever, especially if you don&#x27;t have a Scrum master.<p>Understand how to decouple code into micro-services (and why it&#x27;s mostly unnecessary to do so). Have a solid understanding of testing principles, and what you want your TDD to look like (if at all) - mocks of everything or small units of functionality.<p>Understand database performance, modern authentication (JWT, OAuth2, intercepting requests).<p>This was all specific to Line of Business web apps btw..so may not relate to you.<p>When I play &quot;architect&quot;, I also need to draw diagrams and clearly split up work, so you need to learn to do that. I found it super helpful to have a high-level vision (as pretentious as that word is) for the software. Usually, no one has that.<p>I have also found that a lot of architects irl are just career bsers, so I might be going about it the wrong way, and I don&#x27;t have the title.<p>80% of the architects I know just say random stuff that makes no sense like &quot;Everything will go through an API&quot;, &quot;Use attributes everywhere&quot;, &quot;everything will be a microservice&quot; and tell you to implement their high level goals, but could never do it themselves. I have zero respect for them.<p>Since I am just ranting - some of the best advice I have heard (from the Python docs, though I don&#x27;t use Python). Have one, and ideally only one, way of doing certain things. Clarity is king.<p>To me, being an architect (not by title, but while leading fairly large teams) always meant being an example (at least in terms of code quality) and always being able to pick up a story from another dev if I dictated something - e.g. not asking devs to do what I am not willing to. This, combined with the vision of the whole product, often means refactoring and helping resolve merge conflicts for others - whether it&#x27;s in code, Entity Framework migrations, etc."],"time":["2020-05-12 15:53:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LoSboccacc"],"id":[23154571],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["thinking linearly, as developing require you to think about all the networked intricacies of software but that would make communicating goals harder.<p>you&#x27;re no longer putting together lego pieces, so to say, you&#x27;re writing the instruction manual.<p>figuring out integration point between responsibilities, identifying inter-dependencies and avoiding every interface to become a nimby turf war all rely on your communication skills way before on your technical prowess."],"time":["2020-05-12 16:47:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["riffraff"],"id":[23153750],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["I read that as &quot;what do I need to do to learn Excel&quot; and I thought &quot;yep, seems like a good question&quot;."],"time":["2020-05-12 15:30:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marsdepinski"],"id":[23154919],"kids":{},"parent":[23152092],"text":["Learn to write convincing and pleasant to read documents and learn to sell your ideas.
