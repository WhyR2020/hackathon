I&#x27;d have to manage to dredge through the math, but I suppose it&#x27;s possible but would lead to probably the most competence. Unfortunately however, I was hoping for the big MOOC sites to have more content. EdX has some decent introductory stuff but not much beyond that.<p>B) The other recommended way is the hobbyist way and what I suspect most other software people wouldnauggest which is just building shit that interests you, ignoring first principles. Unfortunately I&#x27;m not sure how this would work out, since my projects in any domain seem to be a bit, er, grand and you supposedly need a strong math background to build anything more than basic circuits.<p>I&#x27;d dread the math a lot less if it were more cut and dry. I wish I could just jump right to calc, differential equations, linear algebra, etc. But more realistically, it would involve me hunt and picking parts of algebra and  embarrassingly even simpler stuff. I was looking at some Khan academy stuff and while it turns out I remember more than I thought,  theres still plenty I had forgot even existed.<p>Another alternative that seems good, but not realistic is that there are some community colleges that have professional certificates that teach electronic circuits pretty quickly. Unfortunately this is prohibited by the absolutely fucked &quot;residency requirements&quot; for this state whereby I wont be a resident of my current state for years (at least for tuition purposes, I&#x27;m a resident for just about everything in a few months).

Music is undeniably great for your brain, which can include learning and memorizing a ton of lyrics, tempo and pitch.

Also some simple refactoring to just clean stuff up.<p>The other two problems to solve is keeping everything nicely organised as I really want this to get big in it&#x27;s interconnected complexity (though perhaps that&#x27;s a terrible idea), putting together a simple way to monitor the system&#x27;s running as the game designer.<p>Keeping scope small and focused is hard, enthusiasm gets you to want to add all sorts of wacky stuff.<p>All of the above is subject to change if I figure out a better way of doing it =)...<p>- [1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cs-students.stanford.edu&#x2F;~amitp&#x2F;game-programming&#x2F;polygon-map-generation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cs-students.stanford.edu&#x2F;~amitp&#x2F;game-programming&#x2F;...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-06 09:12:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pm2222"],"id":[22790492],"kids":{},"parent":[22786287],"text":["Clojure, clj tools, figwheel-main, leiningen, sqlite, https, certificates, csrf, reagent, uberjar, smtp.

My semester is predominantly General Education requirements. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of what we&#x27;re learning about:<p>- World Civilization I:<p>At this point in time, the course is following the Cro-Magnon&#x27;s during the Mesolithic age, specifically around the time that the Neanderthals&#x2F;Denisovans go extinct and Cro-Magnons evolve into Homo Sapiens Sapiens. This is also around the time that Cro-Magnon-Neanderthal hybrids cross the Beringia Bridge into modern day Alaska. During this time, there&#x27;s shifts in every single aspect of life on Earth. I&#x27;ve uploaded the most recent lecture notes for those that are interested.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textuploader.com&#x2F;14j86\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textuploader.com&#x2F;14j86<\/a><p>- Astronomy II:<p>This has been my favorite course this semester (aside from Computer Systems). My professor does an amazing job presenting the concepts and his passion is very apparent as he teaches. Unfortunately, that effect has been greatly reduced, with classes now being online. The other downer about online class is that I won&#x27;t be able to use the telescopes for lab. Stemming from our previous sections, which covered the Sun, star formation, and star evolution, we&#x27;re now covering the various models presented throughout time that tried to reason our position within the Milky Way through stargazing. Here&#x27;s the lecture if you care to watch.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?=AUlr2hlAPcM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?=AUlr2hlAPcM&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a><p>- Technical Writing:<p>Project 2, that accounts for 30% of my grade, was due Friday. The objective was to create documentation for a program or application. I was having a hard time finding a program, application, package, framework, or language I used, that wasn&#x27;t already documented to a high enough standard (coincidence? :P). I didn&#x27;t want to replicate any documentation that already existed so I decided to write an Angular library for creating a vertical or horizontal timeline and documentation for it. I turned it in two hours late, so I most likely will not get credit. Publishing my own code for others to use brought me more joy than I would&#x27;ve imagined.<p>- Computer Systems I:<p>The lectures have been covering pipelining,  control &#x2F; data dependencies, forwarding paths, etc. It&#x27;s extremely fun. In lab, we&#x27;re programming the Y86-64 ISA using C++.<p>Besides that stuff and my dance class, where we&#x27;ve learned about the dance throughout the 1900s to present, I&#x27;ve been going through a Udemy course on Kubernetes in preparation for my summer internship and CKA."],"time":["2020-04-06 06:33:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["happyrock"],"id":[22789946],"kids":{},"parent":[22786287],"text":["Clojure!"],"time":["2020-04-06 02:33:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Russelfuture"],"id":[22789730],"kids":{},"parent":[22786287],"text":["Learning Z80 assembler, matrix algebra, reloading (9mm, .45, etc.), how to draft detailed building plans (something that is detailed enough to get a building permit approved), and market &quot;Technical Analysis&quot; - the study of chart patterns to set buy&#x2F;sell points.<p><pre><code>  This all seems a bit silly, but everything is closed.  Also doing a lot of wood cutting and cleanup in the forest.  We built a custom designed Z80 SBC ( single board computer), with its own Z80MON monitor, and the genius guy I am working with has managed to put the BASIC interpreter into the monitor.  Just got MInipro installed and working on the MACbook, using HomeBrew.  I&#x27;m trying to get one of those TL866II pROM programmers - first one ordered got bounced by customs.  We&#x27;ve ordered second one, paid premium to have it couriered.  All the flights are ground-stopped, so it may be a while.   I really like the idea of building a whole computer from parts ordered from Mouser, having all the Monitor and interpreter code, and being able to download the code into A ROM chip, plug it in, and link to the thing with Kermit or Screen session from a Linux box, and have it process matrix data from our AI stuff.  \n <\/code><\/pre>\nWe live in deep farm country, where self-reliance is pretty hard core.  Some farms up the road from ours, are not even on the grid.   (They have wind generators and diesel tractors - some even have CNC machines).<p>We still have good internet access, and we are on-grid, but this whole virus-driven economic meltdown has absolutely confirmed our expectations.   We are seriously looking at something that will look like the 1930&#x27;s now.  I worked in 8080 Assembler years ago, and I&#x27;d forgotten so much.\nBut I&#x27;ve got two Z80 SBC&#x27;s working now, one with it&#x27;s own standalone VT-100 emulator board, and a little 40$ Chinese made VGA screen, which actually works pretty good.  I can run that config off two lithium-ion batteries.   The missing piece is to be able to use an SD-card.   We have a prototype of a much more complex SBC that has a sound chip, and an SD card driver chip.  It runs full CP&#x2F;M, but I like the more simple design, since it does ot use surface mount - real old school.<p>And there is this ton of other stuff that must be done.  We need to be able to reload, and I have all the dies and such for this.   We are also doing a bunch of in-house food preparation, since the electricity is still working, and so we are making different types of food that can be easily frozen.<p>And the price action on the investment portfolios is requiring attention, since we have these predictive algorithms that are offering some insite into where to place trades.  The markets are insane, but there are opportunites that do crop up. I realize that most traditional &quot;fundamental&quot; analysis is of little value in this kind of environment, as the automatic algos are running most of the action.   We have no chance at all of accessing any &quot;government money&quot;, so we are really working our existing systems just to try to bring in some liquidity by quick in and out action.   So far this is working, but it is absolutely crazy.<p>We have non-trading long-term positions on the left side of a tradional barbell, and these are just getting slaughtered.  It feels like stories I read about in wartime, those First World War stories.   Your whole &quot;picture of the world&quot; falls apart, and suddenly, all that crazy, hacky stuff you thought you would never really need or use (like the gas-mask in the garage) - suddenly, it&#x27;s the stuff that is keeping you alive, and your economic and technical process actually working.<p>So, I am going thru notes, and invoking stuff that we documented back in 1987 ( mkt crash), and in 1998 (Russian Default), and of course the 9&#x2F;11 stuff, which was short and sharp, and followed by a big pop.   But the data this time suggests no - too much has been badly damaged already.  \nSo we are mainly working on a plan to survive economically, for the next 12 months.<p>We should be OK, but only because we had these backup Plan B and Plan C&#x27;s and such.  \nWe went to Costco two days ago, and a hundred people were lined up, out into the parking lot, as &quot;social distancing&quot; was being enforced.   It&#x27;s making us pull out the SHTF playbook plans.   It could all be summed up as &quot;We are reviewing our strategies for maximum independece, and actively working to enhance our capacity for fully independent action.&quot; And I am reviewing all my Linux notes - we have several flavours of Linux boxes, that run the analytic and data management stuff.  Need to ensure we can keep on keeping on.  So far, it&#x27;s all ticking along ok, but it&#x27;s all up to us now.  We are learning to be 100% self-supporting, I guess would sum it up. So far, it&#x27;s working.\nBut it&#x27;s a new world now.

The John Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard [1] you&#x27;ve almost certainly seen by now is built with ArcGIS feature services &amp; Operations Dashboard.<p>All that follows is my personal opinion; I do work for Esri but I&#x27;m not speaking for them here.<p>A lot of the modern ArcGIS stack is based on feature services hosted on ArcGIS Online (Esri&#x27;s cloud service). Feature Services combine a SQL database with a REST API and spatial analysis. They&#x27;re particularly useful if you want to store spatial data and put it on a map, but it works with non-spatial data, including relational data, as well.<p>Once data is in a feature service, you can visualize it in 2D or 3D maps, add data to it with off-the-shelf apps (we have Survey123 for surveys, Collector for field data collection, and QuickCapture for rapid data entry). You can build stories around the data with StoryMaps, data-driven websites with Hub, and dashboards with Operations Dashboard.<p>If the field apps aren&#x27;t enough, you can create custom web apps with web app builder, custom native apps (Qt) with AppStudio, or totally custom apps with the developer APIs.<p>We even have open source apps [2] that demonstrate how to use the platform for common scenarios, like indoor routing, data collection, and taking data offline.<p>Sorry if this comes off salesy, I just really like sharing this stuff since I think ArcGIS tends to go under-utilized outside of GIS circles.

You build applications by composing high-level building blocks, which are small business logic units and are chained together on a visual graph of your application.<p>The cool this is that you can re-use &quot;code blocks&quot; across projects and they follow the same input&#x2F;output rules (plain JSON) so you can mix + match languages in a single project. If you want to make an API endpoint, you just add an API Endpoint block, wire that to a code block, then wire that to a response. Easy. Same with Cron jobs -- you just link a timer to a code block and you&#x27;re good.<p>Logs are handled in the UI for you so you don&#x27;t have to muck with AWS at all (the deployment to AWS is effectively an implementation detail that you don&#x27;t have to know about). Pricing is the same as AWS (usage based) -- we just add a surcharge as a flat percentage.<p>It started out as a side project to solve a similar frustration to the ones you&#x27;re describing, and it&#x27;s snowballed from there (I&#x27;m a co-author of Refinery). :P<p>It&#x27;s still fairly early (and we&#x27;re adding big features still).

We started working on Internal after realizing that most companies can&#x27;t dedicate valuable engineering time to build and constantly maintain&#x2F;upgrade their internal tools.<p>I&#x27;ve led engineering teams from seed to series C companies (10 - 50+ people) for several years.  Maintenance and permissioning are always the biggest problems when it comes to building these tools yourself, so we&#x27;ve built Internal with these things in mind by focusing on how startups actually go from zero to one and then scale beyond that.<p>When you use Internal, we offer a CRUD tool with fine grained permissions, auditability and controls to get you started.  In my experience, most startups use open source software for this or build it themselves.  Both of these approaches reach their limits very quickly in terms of quality and maintainability and lead to tons of issues when trying to pass audits down the line.<p>With respect to flexibility, it&#x27;s there when you need it. We offer a feature called Spaces for when you need to customize the UI and build tools quickly, but we do this in a way that keeps you from shooting yourself in the foot.  You can build Spaces without SQL or javascript knowledge and you can quickly create useful tools without needing to know how to code.  If you need additional customization after that, we allow you to hook into existing business logic via http services or graphql endpoints and expose that to the end-user as &quot;functions&quot; which can be consumed when configuring a Space.  We also offer several out-of-the-box integrations including Salesforce and Stripe so you can quickly integrate with existing services with little to no effort.<p>Let me know if you would like to talk or want a demo.

That and some math about how many hospitalizations that is vs. hospital beds available in the U.S, and the reports coming out of Italy that made it clear that the high death rate was not because of China&#x27;s air pollution or smoking rates (both of which were reasonable hypotheses with the data available, particularly the increased male mortality and preponderance of smoking among Chinese men).<p>On a systemic level, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the decision makers simply have not updated their mental models with this new information.

Anyone could splice together a video just like that one with material from any TV news network or politician, from the tip of South America to the extremes of Siberia and everything in between.<p>In many ways, and sadly, PG reveals (perhaps proudly) his own bias on this front.  This is very much a hit job on Fox News and the right.  One can&#x27;t claim intellectual superiority and do this at the same time.  Sorry.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that Fox News isn&#x27;t without fault.  They are.  Everyone is.  NOBODY understood this well enough to say anything intelligent about it.  NOBODY, from politicians to doctors and, yes, newscasters and celebrities.<p>What we can say is that nearly everything that was said or predicted during the early phases of this thing by almost everyone has now been proven wrong by this cruel virus and its behavior.  That isn&#x27;t an indication of nefarious intent.  Ignorance?  Yes.  Malicious intent?  I doubt it.  Political battle?  Yes, likely, sadly...because nobody really understood this thing was going to get ugly.<p>Faulting anyone, from Trump to local officials is, from my perspective, intellectually dishonest and counterproductive.  This is where I have a problem with the media.  I am sure the founders did not pen the first amendment with the intent of providing protection for extreme political alignment in the media.  We have, somehow, allowed this to happen, and, what is worse, we have not come up with a way to curtail it.<p>Watching US coverage and press conferences is a display of just how politically aligned the media has become.  Their focus is, 24&#x2F;7, to attack the political party they are not aligned with.  In order to accomplish this they are more than willing to take things out of context, distort reality, fabricate narratives and disseminate lies.  As someone who works hard to remain as neutral as possible, a registered independent who has equal disdain for both major parties, this is truly revolting to watch.

These are the leaders of the US state with the most cases and most deaths.  They are not taken out of context.  And they are clearly telling people to, effectively, go out there and get infected.<p>This is the real reason for which places like New York and Louisiana are in such trouble.  Their leadership failed the people.  They failed miserably.  They were ignorant, political and just plain wrong.  And they got everyone infected.  It&#x27;s one thing to start with a handful of cases.  It&#x27;s quite another to tell people to pile into subways, festivals, restaurants and other high-traffic public environments and effectively help the virus replicate.  You then start your odyssey with thousands of cases, not a handful, which can&#x27;t end well.<p>Either we dismiss this as collective ignorance and excuse it as such, or we don&#x27;t.  Yet, other states took it very seriously.  People took it seriously.  The trigger for most was when Trump shut down travel from China.  That was on January 31st.  Love him or hate him, an neutral observer would instantly understand this was a seriously out of band move and one that could not have been taken lightly or unilaterally.  That was a very strong signal that something was seriously wrong.<p>For me, that event, added to the R0 data that was coming in, told me this was serious and it high likelihood of going way beyond China.  During the first week of February I bought three months of supplies for our family.  Various states around the nation started to take measures as well.  Places like NY and Louisiana, instead, decided closing the doors to China was racist and, as if the virus cared about political defiance, actually promoted mass gatherings and helped the virus spread and infect large numbers of people.<p>Yes, I agree with the general message issued by PG.  However, I strongly suggest the article needs to be edited in order to remove the intellectually dishonest and politically one-sided focus.  It simply isn&#x27;t true and it is wrong.  There&#x27;s a very direct and well documented link in the video and Twitter record of who in the US is directly responsible for hundreds of thousands of people getting infected and likely tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people dying.<p>This isn&#x27;t a joke.  People are losing partners, mothers, fathers, siblings, sons and daughters.  Let&#x27;s not lie or distort the truth due to political alignment and effectively join the very group we are accusing of being dishonest."],"time":["2020-04-06 22:42:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["known"],"id":[22796136],"kids":{},"parent":[22792119],"text":["Next version of #CoronaVirus should infect only Politicians; Earth will become a better place for Humans;"],"time":["2020-04-06 20:02:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["edw519"],"id":[22792975],"kids":{},"parent":[22792119],"text":["<i>Instead they just continued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic has made clear, is to talk confidently about things they don&#x27;t understand.<\/i><p>Those of us with I.T. managers have been putting up with this forever:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-06 14:08:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["atomashpolskiy"],"id":[22792437],"kids":[22796930,22796471,22792456],"parent":[22792119],"text":["What a ridiculous zeal.<p>Hardly anyone at this point is arguing that there actually is an issue.

Your projects are probably too ambitious to start. Graphical games are actually quite complex. Start with small projects and work your way to larger ones. My first projects were chrome extensions and silly command line tools. They helped me build some resilience that I used later to complete more complex projects.<p>* When you do tackle larger projects, do your best to see them as a series of smaller projects. Each project should deliver some value on its own. I recently built a web game about navigating a randomly generated maze and avoiding monsters. Here&#x27;s how I broke it up: first I built a command line tool to generate mazes. Then I separated the core functionality into a library. Then I deployed an API wrapping that library. Then I built a simple UI that allowed a user to navigate that maze. Finally, I started adding enemies. Each enemy was its own project, each with more complex path finding than the last. At each step in this process, I had learned something new and had a deliverable to show for it.<p>* Your question suggests that the problems you are trying to solve are not interesting enough. This belies a beginner mindset: that you have to be interested first, and then work happens off the fuel of your interest. The truth is that most interesting projects involve a lot of days where the creator feels disinterested, but shows up any way. The most important thing you can do for yourself is cultivate the resilience required to keep showing up, so you can reap the satisfaction of completing great work later."],"time":["2020-04-06 16:49:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["themdonuts"],"id":[22794860],"kids":[22795958,22795761,22795509],"parent":[22792829],"text":["Get people using it.

Formally write down what you want to develop with milestones, with a go&#x2F;no go decision at each milestone. If you decide not to continue at a milestone, that was part of the plan, so you completed the project.<p>* work on things that develop skills you expect to bring to the workplace and apply there.

Inspiration is useful, but it&#x27;s fleeting or at best inconsistent. The sooner you stop relying on inspiration to last, the sooner you&#x27;ll learn to find other ways of motivating yourself.

Resist the temptation to just jump into your latest idea and instead write about it. If its a compelling idea you will return to it. If not let it be a passing idea.<p>- Practice personal Kanban where you limit yourself to X number of concurrent projects.

If you&#x27;re constantly chasing the finish line and fire up all cylinders to get there as fast as possible you&#x27;ll never make it, but if you run for the joy of running and do so consistently you&#x27;re guaranteed to get there eventually (the tortoise and the hare)."],"time":["2020-04-06 18:03:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tunesmith"],"id":[22796407],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["For me I think I just learned to stop being hard on myself for not finishing.

Sorry for the long post, it&#x27;s tough to write concise. It also doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m describing insights that took me 10 years to get sharp.<p>I have thoughts and intentions.<p>I have behaviours.<p>It&#x27;s always puzzling to me how bad I am at predicting my behaviour purely with my thoughts and intentions. I guess people who are addicted to something that want to quit can relate (my addiction: gaming&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;HN -- I&#x27;ll get back to this).<p>Because of this weird mismatch I&#x27;ve said to myself: the predictive value of my thoughts and intentions is 0, it&#x27;s actually negative even. So all I can do is observe myself behaviourally. Humans are quite bad at this, and research shows that friends help with this. People outside of you observe your behaviour better than you do. So either (1) get help from friends to do this or (2) observe your behaviour like a ninja. Luckily for me, I happen to be an introspective person by default, so I chose option 2 (you can also choose both at the same time).<p>So do not trust your thoughts and intentions.<p>So observe your own behaviours.<p>After 10 years, I found out 2 fundamental motivational triggers. One I found out about recently, and I am still figuring out how to (ab)use it, and the other one has been (ab)used for years.<p>1. I work amazingly well under pressure and stress. This is especially the case when my schedule has no minute of spare time and has some vague accountability system.<p>Example: I was incapable of studying one degree at university, but I was amazingly capable at studying 2 degrees, while working on the side, while having a social life and a girlfriend. I had too little time in my schedule, so I used 4 hour work week tricks to get it manageable.<p>What I also did was define a priority list. A lot of priorities on the bottom of that list suffered an ill faith. But my most important priorities (and then some) succeeded.<p>There is one downside with this. Yes, I was motivated. But I also was stressed the whole time, and while the stressed was manageable, I don&#x27;t think it was a particularly fun time. It sometimes was, and sometimes wasn&#x27;t, but the pressure felt painful. And while it worked for my motivation, it does do a lot of damage to me existentially.<p>However, the good part: I do now have skills that I wished to have. And existentially that actually does really help.<p>So motivation-wise: it works amazingly well. Regarding life decisions: mixed results.<p>2. Remember my addictions? I realised that I&#x27;m simply motivated by human contact. Not just any human contact, but I am not fully clear on the conditions yet. I know that I must like the person and feel a connection in some cases.<p>A couple of cases where I&#x27;ve seen this:<p>A. Making music with someone just watching me (I was super motivated). Making music alone the next day (I didn&#x27;t do anything).<p>B. Same story with playing Hack The Box. I hacked 16 hours per day for a month and my buddy was simply putting in a normal work week of it. He said: &quot;you&#x27;re so much more motivated than me.&quot; But I knew if he&#x27;d stop playing Hack The Box, then I&#x27;d stop playing eventually as well.<p>C. I thought a lot of university courses were easy, but not easy enough to do nothing about it and pass a test. So I would go to the lectures and be bored out of my mind because psychology is an easy degree :D However, those lectures did actually motivate me to then engage with the course material after the lecture. And the thing is, I thought I would be capable of doing that on my own, but I never was. So I continued going to lectures and be bored, in order to be motivated later.<p>I am still figuring out how to exploit this, because this motivational factor properly exploited is me winning at life. It has: connection, productivity and a sense of &quot;we&#x27;re in this together.&quot; I&#x27;m noticing I find it a bit hard to make friends. I can&#x27;t just say: oh, I like topic x now and then befriend someone in that topic. If I could, I would be a lot more productive.<p>(I&#x27;m now realising this should become a blog post, moving on :P )<p>Writing all this gave me a new idea. I&#x27;m basically like a framework and I found 2 motivational &#x27;hooks&#x27; into it. The thing is, I don&#x27;t have a lot of control over these hooks, things can stress me out (which motivates me) or things can make me feel connected (which motivates me). If something hooks into my &#x27;motivational code&#x27; and I don&#x27;t want it to be there then I basically tend to say I&#x27;m addicted to: games, YouTube and HN (fun fact: I don&#x27;t like playing games alone that friends did not introduce to me).<p>This means my mind needs to figure out on how to exploit this, but also it begs the question: how does this work? I am pretty sure it&#x27;s emotional and it&#x27;s a need based thing (self-determination theory <i>definitely<\/i> comes to mind here).<p>My question to you is: what are your motivational hooks? How does the environment hook into your motivational code?<p>BONUS FACTOR!!! (I&#x27;m not making fun of marketing people :P )<p>3. I made a side project for a month called doodledocs.com. It partially came out of motivation factor 2. I was interviewing for a company and they gave the most boring 2 day take home exercise that I saw (make tic tac toe). So I decided to make something awesome instead with their technology, and it took me a month. Just having someone judging my work and me being in the same room as that person helped quite a bit. However, another motivational factor was that <i>I am frustrated<\/i>! I am frustrated with how not far we are with having a pencil natively on the web. So I made this app.<p>But frustration is definitely less of a factor than the other 2. Frustration on its own doesn&#x27;t work, but it does reduce the amount of stress (factor 1) or connection needed (factor 2).<p>So I guess you could say there are necessary motivational factors and sufficient motivational factors. A bit of stress or a bit of connection is necessary but doesn&#x27;t make it sufficient. A lot of connection, for example, does make it sufficient. Also, for example, a bit of connection + a lot of frustration does make it sufficient.<p>I hope my self analysis helped you a bit. And if you&#x27;re curious about why I wrote this all out in the open and not on my laptop: I am motivated by people reading it and reacting to it. My sense of connection (motivation factor 2) is definitely at play here."],"time":["2020-04-06 14:37:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22793131],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-06 14:33:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[22794135],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["Yes, all the time, the time left for coding after work is very little, family and friends always take priority.<p>Some of my hobby coding projects are more than 10 years old by now.<p>The only ones I managed to stick all the way to the end were side projects that had a real customer at the end, so I had to actually deliver, or face the consequences of having someone really unhappy."],"time":["2020-04-06 16:41:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gkilmain"],"id":[22795714],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["I&#x27;ve been working on a side project now for about 8 months.

If that&#x27;s the case, lots of small, half-baked projects can definitely be educational.<p>You&#x27;re also mentioning projects that take significant ramp-up time before they might start to get a life of their own.<p>So, that being said, I have a couple of book recommendations:<p>If what you want to do is learn software development in a growing way, I highly recommend Mastering Software Technique: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software-technique.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software-technique.com&#x2F;<\/a>. It&#x27;s all about using bursts of time to learn new things as fast as you can. For your situation, it sounds close to what you&#x27;ve been practicing, with just a tiny bit more process.<p>If what you want to do is actually build something on the side for people other than yourself (which is _not_ a requirement for learning useful things), then I recommend <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jessicaabel.com&#x2F;growing-gills&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jessicaabel.com&#x2F;growing-gills&#x2F;<\/a>.<p>For me, I&#x27;ve embraced the non-essential nature of my side projects. I&#x27;ve had quite a few over the years, some large, some small. Being able to put one on the back-burner and come back it later has been very handy. Most of my sideprojects these days are ones I can get to &quot;done&quot; in a day or two, and I have a couple longer-running ones that I pick at off and on. My motivation for a particular project varies, some are meant to scratch a _very_ specific itch:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yumaikas&#x2F;dirx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yumaikas&#x2F;dirx<\/a> was basically done in a late night and a morning\n- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idea.junglecoder.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;idea&#x2F;274\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idea.junglecoder.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;idea&#x2F;274<\/a> I&#x27;ve done 3 times, first in bash, then in Go (in a rather late night, to scratch an itch), and then again in Nim (to learn Nim, and compare it against Go).<p>Some projects I have are a lot longer running. Both PISC &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pisc.junglecoder.com&gt;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pisc.junglecoder.com&gt;<\/a> (now on indefinite hiatus) and Tabula Scripta &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yumaikas&#x2F;tabulaScripta&gt;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yumaikas&#x2F;tabulaScripta&gt;<\/a> have run a lot longer than my typical project. One quality of both is that they have work at quite a few different levels of detail. Am I tired of parsing work? I can work on prototyping a game in PISC. Do I want to make the performance dramatically better for my artificial Fibonacci benchmark? Great time to break out the Go profiler. Do I want to make it way easier to concatenate strings in a stack-based language? Maybe today I figure out how to write an evalbot. (These are _all_ things I did in PISC at different times).<p>Tabula Scripta is still early days, I haven&#x27;t had the time to use it for that sort of experimentation, but it will have a similarly broad set of applications and problems to solve.<p>And, like other people have said, it definitely helps to do you side projects in a different IDE&#x2F;Language than your work. And if learning is a big motivator, keeping your projects smaller, or making them the sort of things that&#x27;s easier to break into smaller parts can be very helpful."],"time":["2020-04-06 17:08:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nerder92"],"id":[22797118],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["Do It with a friend which is equally curious an committed as you are."],"time":["2020-04-06 21:50:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["somurzakov"],"id":[22794413],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["find a customer for your side project. even if it is one customer, even if she is a friend of yours.<p>getting a feedback from your early customer will be more than enough to keep you motivated"],"time":["2020-04-06 17:10:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["westonplatter0"],"id":[22794817],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["What were you intensely curious about at 12 years old?

Here&#x27;s my take. I have a decent sized graveyard of one-day projects, half dozen serious attempts and one published project with some 10k users. In line with some other suggestions in this thread, the published project scratches my own itch while scrapped ones were meant to be consumed by other people.<p>If gamedev is your thing, try participating in a game jam or two. They are awesome way to use same limited attention span and actually finish something. If you see yourself spending too much time on graphics&#x2F;sound, try some heavy constraints. For example, use just 3 colors for everything, or compose all graphics just from single shape.<p>Introspection is good. Keep doing what you are doing, and keep learning from what worked better or worse for you.<p>Treat your side project as small sandbox, a place to play. Don&#x27;t put deadlines, don&#x27;t worry about sunk cost, allow yourself to write bad code without much planning. You can incrementally get to point where you want it to be. Try to see at which point earliest you can wrap it up and publish as MVP.<p>I noticed that it is very easy to start, and gets exponentially harder as you go on. When you set up the project, each development time slice doubles the result. First you have nothing, then it&#x27;s &quot;hello world&quot;. Then you put up some dynamic text. Then you hook up some crafty mechanism behind the text. It is exciting and motivating. But after a while the project slows down. It is because there are already some mechanics in there, and each new feature has to be aligned and connected with existing ones. The complexity grows and more and more time has to be invested in each new step. This is nature of software development. Polish also takes surprising amount of time. You have to be aware of it and plan your energy accordingly.<p>All this accumulated complexity makes your mind crave a new project, a fresh canvas where everything is simple and new. Usually it will manifest in form of new idea that is so much better than the current project. What works for me is to take hour or two and take some notes and flesh out this new idea, and then archive it for time being.<p>Some more advice I got from other people: A good place to stop the development session is when you are almost done with feature. This will motivate you to pick up the project next day, and you&#x27;ll quickly get into mindset needed to start next feature.<p>Don&#x27;t share with others what you plan to do. There&#x27;s a psychological effect where you get small amount of gratification by telling others about imagined finished project. You want to delay that gratification until you have something done because it will give you motivation needed to put in the hours. On the other hand, do share your progress on social networks.

I like to do many things and explore new ideas. Curiosity takes me in different direction. At times, I question my personality and character. Perhaps the feeling of &quot;curiosity killed the cat&quot; is applicable when we are feeling this way.<p>But let&#x27;s reframe this!<p>What if we start to accept this trait, not as a flaw, but as a part of who we are? Once you come to the realization, you start holding yourself accountable.<p>I have been working on a side project (www.wisecharlie.com) for almost 3 years and continue to do so for many years to come. To give you a background, I am a developer and I enjoy the creative side of code and design. So, it is natural for me to keep exploring new ideas, but I also know the importance of execution. Following are the ways I have held myself accountable to this particular project:<p>1. No expectations (goals) other than a form of exploration.<p>I have a revenue generating product, but that does not mean, my goal is to sell the most I can, get as many people to come visit my project and get the most sign-ups. I care about the topic, constant work-in-progress and iterate over it periodically. The process itself brings me joy.<p>2. Sticking to one project at a time removes a cognitive load of finding new ideas.<p>For some, creative block is a real thing. From the creative standpoint, I have built the website using plain JS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS, then built the blog using Gatsby. I wanted to learn about webflow so I re-built it during Christmas. I don&#x27;t have to think about new ideas every time I want to learn something new.<p>3. Incremental steps as opposed to a giant leap.<p>I assign myself one task at a time on a monthly basis. That is it. I don&#x27;t set ambitious goals of 100k users or any of that. This has allowed me to work on this project for over 36 months without feeling burnt-out. It is a turtle race so take incremental steps and make frequent progress as opposed to a giant leap. If I complete my assigned tasks, I allow myself to jump on to other ideas. This allows me to stay accountable and execute consistently.<p>4. Pick a hobby that has nothing to do with side project.<p>With lack of human interaction amid global stay-at-home orders, I find myself to be draining my productivity (rarely, but it does happen). To fix this, I picked up on sketching because I wanted to forget about everything that is happening around me. Sketching helped me with that because if I don&#x27;t focus, my shapes don&#x27;t follow the desired form. Here is the link to my sketch work <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mihirchronicles&#x2F;status&#x2F;1216075216159485953\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mihirchronicles&#x2F;status&#x2F;12160752161594859...<\/a>.<p>I am sharing these resources so I can share real cases from my own life and inspire you to take steps that may work for you. Good luck! It is okay to feel how you feel, but I would suggest you to make incremental steps, define your process and take a long-term view.<p>The advice I share took many years of learning and doing.

I mean, I still do feel guilt often, and am still on a lookout for some way(s) to cope with it... But interestingly, in my case, for one of the projects, my itch was so strong eventually, and I was so often annoyed I don&#x27;t have this tool, that it kinda &quot;forced&quot; me to find the strength to push through to the completion, even when it was becoming a chore. Since then, I again abandon projects with guilt repeatedly ;) but again also have one among them, that I&#x27;m coming back to on and off, when I feel fancy, and trying to push forward. Again, I&#x27;m kinda repeatedly getting annoyed I don&#x27;t have it for myself; when annoyance of not having it becomes bigger than my memories of annoyance developing it, I&#x27;m getting back to it again :) sometimes looking at it reminds me too much and is enough to scare me away again, but sometimes I&#x27;m just so angry I say to myself screw everything and sit and push through :) Still, also as others said, I look at the unfinished &quot;hobby&quot; ones also sometimes as some kind of research I wanted to do, thus honing my skills or just randomly &quot;playing with my mental muscles&quot; in various ways anyway - kinda as a kid plays in a sandbox however they want.

A lot of comments alluded to this here, and the best I&#x27;ve seen it articulated was in James Clear&#x27;s book Atomic Habits. You have &#x27;Motion&#x27; which is thinking, imagining, whiteboarding, planning, talking about...everything that goes <i>around<\/i> the doing.

At the very least, recognize when you&#x27;re in Motion and when you&#x27;re in Action, so you&#x27;re not trying to fool yourself.\nSee also Shonda Rhimes&#x27; &quot;A screenwriter&#x27;s advice&quot; [0].<p>2. The closer you get to finishing something, the greater the resistance is to finishing it. This was articulated in Steven Pressfield&#x27;s &quot;The War of Art&quot;. IT becomes a struggle, and it&#x27;s not fun, and anyone who tells you otherwise is flat out lying. There is fatigue from the project, and there&#x27;s also the fact that it&#x27;s not quite what you had in your head when you dreamed about it. Because you couldn&#x27;t dream the imperfections. This this is not a fault of implementation (any creator will fess up to feeling this way). So acknowledging all of these and fighting through it is a crucial skill for getting things done.<p>3. Without a Process, there&#x27;s not going to be an outcome.\nI started as a developer, then switched to writer, and now I do both. It&#x27;s the switching to becoming a writer that taught me how to get stuff done, because I honed the process. I knew what it would take to get a project from start to completion. Different projects take more or less time, but the stages are clear. \nWhen I tackle something now, be it in code or in writing, I set up a roadmap. One that I can say definitively for each step, when it&#x27;s done, and what&#x27;s next.<p>4. Domain: it really, REALLY, helps to build up domain expertise in something. The tech is the HOW, but the domain is the WHAT and the WHY. Without a good WHY, odds are the project is doomed. A domain is really about mining more interesting questions, and staying engaged with ideas. So that even when you hit into difficulties, the curiosity about the problem helps you push through.\nI&#x27;m kinda not surprised you&#x27;d give up quickly on building a solitaire with Y, cause who cares, right? \nAnd the answer is...you don&#x27;t care. You don&#x27;t really want a solitaire, because you know that problem&#x27;s been solved to a good enough extent that it simply doesn&#x27;t matter.\nIt&#x27;s hard doing things when you can get yourself to feel they matter. With a domain, this happens less.<p>5. So another thing writers say a lot is &quot;Show, don&#x27;t Tell&quot;. And at some point in my life I decided to take that mantra seriously. I felt I&#x27;m done with SAYING (on my CV and anywhere else) that I can do X, Y, Z. I was going to SHOW it. It just makes life simpler and easier when you can just shrug and say, &quot;Yup, done that, here&#x27;s the link.&quot; So the point here is that even if I&#x27;m doing something in order to learn, it HAS to have an outcome that can be offered to others. Whether they like it, or buy into it or whatever is a different question, interesting in its own right. But my view on folders filled with half baked ideas is that it&#x27;s not good at all. If you&#x27;ve read &quot;The Goal&quot; (if you haven&#x27;t, I recommend it) - this is is inventory, and it&#x27;s a liability, not an asset.<p>6. Saying No. This is REALLY HARD. There is more stuff you&#x27;ll want to learn than time to learn it. There are more projects you&#x27;d like to get done than the time you&#x27;re awarded in life. And there is genuine pain in declining to do something you really want to do, because you need to focus on something else. But the alternative to this pain is, ultimately, those folders filled with half-baked ideas. Though I am getting better at saying no, I have yet to get better at not feeling the pain.<p>7. Time management. Everyone has the same 24hrs in the day. The only question is, how much of this time gets wasted. A lot of people I respect don&#x27;t spend time on social media. Author Michael Lewis has talked about how it drains creativity out of you in small bits, like air going out of tires. I wholly agree. [Right now, with the covid situation, deep work is super hard. People are just dealing with it however way they can.]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenpencils.com&#x2F;comic&#x2F;161-shonda-rhimes-a-screenwriters-advice&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenpencils.com&#x2F;comic&#x2F;161-shonda-rhimes-a-screenwrite...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-06 20:27:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chucksmash"],"id":[22795597],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["You can improve matters by a) scoping projects less ambitiously and b) enforcing a novelty budget on yourself.<p>A very ambitious project which you will never finish might actually be three small projects which you will finish and seventeen small follow-up projects you&#x27;ll decide to never take on. Better to get the three under your belt than try to sprint in 20 directions at once and bail with nothing to show for it.<p>Say that you decide &quot;I&#x27;m going to write a personal ontology engine flexible enough to store everything I know, with a snazzy, super intuitive frontend written in &lt;new-to-me framework X&gt;, a plug-in system for easily creating visualizations for specific types of data (oh, like, what if my personal knowledge DB could take FEN+PGN and let me replay and annotate interesting chess games in-line, that&#x27;d be so sweet!), a bespoke query language, the whole thing will be backed by &lt;new-to-me storage backend Y&gt; and, hell, I&#x27;ve been meaning to start containerizing apps at work, I wonder if I should be using docker-compose as I do this or maybe like kubectl, ...also I need to dive into the literature around building ontologies, knowledge graphs, etc. Also, it should probably have emacs keybindings. Probably also support for rebinding keys and defining macros too. Also, it should have a pluggable module interface for scraping semi-structured data sources containing things I don&#x27;t actually know right now but which I would like to learn at some point. Maybe I can use the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia documents as a scaffold to get the thing started. Oh geez, this is really going to need to support multimedia as well, not just text. Really, this kind of thing would be very valuable in many different contexts. It&#x27;d be great if it could be used to automatically generate questions about a topic. I could integrate a spaced repetition algorithm with the question generating bit and then I&#x27;d have an amazing study tool. Hmmm, I&#x27;d better keep the whole thing as flexible as possible so maybe at some point down the road I can productize it! Sure it&#x27;s a long shot, but it&#x27;d be revolutionary if I could pull it off. I&#x27;ll start tonight!<p>To steal from Alan Perlis, &quot;When someone says &#x27;I want to build a personal knowledge DB as a side project and I want it to have perfect ergonomics, top grade discoverability, unlimited extensibility, and unparalleled ease of use,&#x27; give him a lollipop.&quot;<p>Even if you don&#x27;t get stuck in feature daydreams or analysis paralysis and manage to start the thing, your &quot;gee it&#x27;d be swell if&quot; side project has a five or ten plus year &quot;labor of love&quot; todo list attached to it. The mismatch will sink you unless against all odds this actually is your labor of love.<p>As a personal example of the scoping into smaller projects which were standalone (though not a good example of enforcing a novelty budget) I wanted to make a personal activity tracker in 2018 or so. Initial conception was the all-singing, all-dancing, kitchen sink Swiss Army knife of personal data tracking and visualization, implemented in all the technologies I&#x27;d been meaning to try out. The backend would be a gleaming beacon of modern infrastructure with everything containerized from the outset, code written in Rust (in which I was a neophyte), phone app written in Kotlin (in which I&#x27;d only done the Koans, and with no other mobile dev background, but hey, &quot;Anko&quot; seems to be The Thing to use now, hmm)...<p>Having been bitten by the bug you ask about in the past, I set that aside. Instead, I did a bunch of smaller projects with each on their own bringing a reasonable sense of completion:<p>1. Two Python scripts - one to configure desktop OS notifications to fire on a cron schedule (&quot;Nag! Update your data for &lt;x&gt;&quot;) and one for CRUD operations on time series metadata and data points themselves. Just backed by local sqlite. Finished in &lt;1 day. Hey look, MVP! Time to start tracking data!<p>2. Docker setup for building a Rust binary and then trimming away build tooling to get a deployable artifact. 1-2 days? Containerization itch: scratched. Could be a 101 level blog post.<p>3. PostgreSQL docker image with CREATE&#x2F;DROP TABLE scripts. Half a day? I guess I learned about Docker data volumes. I can refer back to this Dockerfile in the future, which is like 9&#x2F;10ths of how I make progress quickly on new projects.<p>4. docker-compose setup for a Hello World level Rust binary that reads a record from a postgres db running in a separate container and writes it to stdout. Half a day? Hooray, orchestration.<p>5. &quot;Hello World&quot;-as-a-Service web app that uses Rocket to send a Hello World application&#x2F;text response. Not very long to finish. Novelty framework itch, scratched.<p>6. Learn about Diesel. Use Diesel to make a single SELECT COUNT(*) query against the DB. Send query result as application&#x2F;text response on a dummy endpoint. Done. Could probably be broken off into a &quot;Intro to X with Y and Z&quot; type blog post.<p>7. Update SELECT-as-a-Service web app to make a meatier query and serialize response to JSON. Learn about Rocket request guards for managing DB connections. Another day or two? If step six wasn&#x27;t enough for a 101 level blog post on the topic, seven definitely is.<p>8. Port the Python CRUD functionality to a Rust REST API atop Postgres. Deliverable: approximately all the backend we&#x27;ll need.<p>9. Update the Python CLI to use the REST endpoints. Another day? Done.<p>10. Start doing Android Hello World apps. Using unfamiliar APIs in an unfamiliar dev environment in an unfamiliar (but nice!) language. Eww, this sucks. I&#x27;m not having fun any more. Maybe I should first learn vanilla Java Android app development, then Kotlin, then build on that basis with Anko, then...<p>And then, at that point, I realized that aside from enjoying daydreaming about the idea of a personal activity tracker, I didn&#x27;t actually give a crap about having an all-singing, all-dancing personal activity tracker. While I&#x27;d been happily chugging along building the thing, I didn&#x27;t care enough about the underlying functionality to bother taking two minutes a day to, y&#x27;know, actually track the data when the MVP nag script ran on its cron. When I bailed though, instead of &quot;ugh, another incomplete useless waste of time,&quot; I ended up with several completed small projects and more knowledge about what I actually wanted (to futz around building a personal activity tracker, not to have one)."],"time":["2020-04-06 19:16:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["daotoad"],"id":[22794829],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["Adderall"],"time":["2020-04-06 18:00:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["JoelMcCracken"],"id":[22793336],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["I used to be in this position. Your question really resonates with me.<p>I think I have broken the cycle, but it is hard to be sure of something like this of course. I have certainly been able to make more progress on projects than I have been able to in the past.<p>I think this has helped me:<p>- Make a Someday&#x2F;Maybe list. Capture your ideas and put them on the list. This can just be a text file. Feel free to add implementation notes. Then, when you have time, you can come back and see if the idea still compels you. The examples you give, for example, sound like things I might have on my own &quot;someday&#x2F;maybe&quot; list.<p>- Evaluate your ideas&#x2F;projects. Do they spark interests? What are the reasons why you desire to complete the project? Do you think that desire will carry you through to project completion?<p>I&#x27;ll give you some examples of myself:<p>For a time, I was really unsure what I wanted to do after I became dissatisfied with Ruby. I wanted to keep exploring functional programming, especially pure functional programming. I also really wanted to work with the actor model, and at the time Rust 1.0 was just being released, so I started working on that at the same time.<p>At the time I played around with a lot of things. But I ended up focusing on learning Haskell, and my goal was to completely work through this book <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;haskellbook.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;haskellbook.com&#x2F;<\/a>. I was able to finish this after several &quot;false starts&quot; with Haskell over the years.<p>Why did I keep working on this project, instead of any of the other myriad shiny things that pop up on HN? Well, a few reasons:<p>- I really wanted to familiarize myself with pure FP. I had become dissatisfied with OO techniques, slowly thinking of them as an evolutionary &quot;dead end&quot;, and wanted to explore something else. IMO, Haskell was the best way to explore this.<p>- I also really wanted to be able to &quot;read&quot; Haskell. Generally speaking, Haskell has become a sort of &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the functional programming community. You often see snippets using its syntax and read concepts explained using its ideas. When I encounter terms like &quot;typeclasses&quot;, I wanted to go from &quot;eyes glossed over&quot; to &quot;comprehension&quot;.<p>There are more reasons, but suffice it to say that I thought that given my long term goals, not knowing Haskell had become a stumbling block. So, I decided to change that, and working through the cited book has worked for me.<p>I didn&#x27;t <i>only<\/i> work on this project. I did take a few breaks here and there as needs must, and interest naturally waxes and wanes, but the motivation held and the project is completed.<p>Having completed it, I have a few new projects that also have compelling reasons for me to work on them. I have flip flopped between them at different times, but there have been good reasons for doing so, and the reasons have not been because I lost interest, but because of external factors.<p>- Realize that you will still sometimes just desire to experiment with something for a little bit. That&#x27;s OK. The other day I downloaded and messed with Electron. It was just something I wanted to try out and satisfy my own curiosity for something random. But you should think of this as being a time-boxed experiment, and not something that you are committing several years of your hacking life to. Unless, of course, it <i>is<\/i>, but in that case, count the opportunity costs before mentally committing yourself.<p>-----<p>Edit:<p>I forgot to include this link; I think it might help you too. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.fogus.me&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.fogus.me&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-100101-method-my-approac...<\/a> It has been discussed on HN a few times."],"time":["2020-04-06 15:05:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nomanlaghari"],"id":[22794368],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["please vist below website for poetry \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2yErlmt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2yErlmt<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-06 17:05:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["victorMLL"],"id":[22795371],"kids":{},"parent":[22792829],"text":["gvhgvb"],"time":["2020-04-06 18:56:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["crucialfelix"],"id":[22791185],"kids":{},"parent":[22790623],"text":["This alone was worth opening the page:<p>&gt; argonaut-*\n&gt; (server-client distributed deployment infrastructure) for some of the package descriptions in the suite this name is a groan-inducingly obvious Greek-mythology pun, but others don&#x27;t even mention that its message protocol is encoded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON &quot;Jason&quot;)"],"time":["2020-04-06 07:48:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fbelzile"],"id":[22793459],"kids":[22793629,22794535,22793532,22794130],"parent":[22790623],"text":["&gt; mysql-* a Structured Query Language server named after the original developer&#x27;s daughter &quot;My&quot; (cf. also mariadb)<p>Learned something new today...

To me, the “audience” is the most interesting component, and the “performers” are almost irrelevant, except to the extent that they must provide some fantasy that  (ever so nominally) purports to be reality (or lies purporting to be truth). The psychological   process by which the audience fully commits to and “believes” the fantasy, while at the same time being fully aware on some level that the fantasy is obviously untrue is fascinating, and deserves much more attention and research. Obviously, this is closely related to the idea of doublethink, but kayfabe gives more agency to the audience. Rather than being forced to engage in doublethink by big brother and an authoritarian government, kayfabe “believers” are all together with each other the agents of their own delusion.
