Square Knot &#x2F; Reef Knot -- This is the shoelace tie, and its one of the simplest knots. Learn this knot backwards and forwards you&#x27;ll use it a lot. Avoid the granny knot (a mistaken reef knot). Beginners will often tie the granny knot instead of the square knot. If you can do a square knot, the &quot;Surgeon Knot&quot; is a useful variant which is more secure.<p>2. Figure Eight -- Superior to the overhand knot in almost every way imaginable. Never use an overhand knot, always use figure eight instead.<p>3. Bowline Loop &#x2F; Sheet Bend -- When a loop must be sturdy and unmoving, the bowline is one of the best. The Sheet Bend is nearly the same, except you tie two different ropes together. I keep a bowline loop on any &quot;pocket twine&quot; because making a bowline loop is the start of many advanced knots. Such as...<p>4.

It took me 7 months to create a binary-compatible, pretty dang functional port of Lucene. I called it Montezuma[1], and it&#x27;s still actually used by people.<p>About half the time was spent implementing the text analyzer, document store, and indices. The remaining 50% was spent implementing search (and parsing the query language). It was a very rewarding experience--It was one of the largest projects I&#x27;d worked on, mostly solo (I got some help near the end), in an area I knew nothing about, working in an extremely test-driven fashion (over 2000 unit tests when I was done).<p>I did not, however, learn as much about indexing and search as I expected.

From there the logs get consumed by our SIEM (in our case Sumologic, which is a great service). We keep logs hot for 90 days and ship archives back to s3 for a year. Set up the lifecycle management stuff, keeping log files forever is not only a waste but can actively hurt you if they ever get exposed in a breach.<p>I highly recommend formatting your logs JSON (even if you have to do it by hand like in Apache).

So now you have to coerce to something like {&quot;foo.bar&quot;: &quot;baz&quot;}, and then you have to escape the dot when querying...<p>Finally, if you solve all the above, you&#x27;ll hit problems with high cardinality of unique fields. Especially if you are accepting arbitrary nested values, at some point someone is going to log something like {users_by_email: {&lt;email&gt;: &lt;user id&gt;}} and now you have one field for every unique email...<p>These problems are tractable but a massive hassle to get right without majorly locking down what applications are allowed to log in terms of structured data.<p>As a seperate issue, Elasticsearch does fuzzy keyword matching by default. eg. if you search for &quot;foo&quot; you&#x27;ll get results for &quot;fooing&quot; and &quot;fooed&quot; but not nessecarily for &quot;foobar&quot; (because it&#x27;s splitting by word - and the characters it considers part of one &quot;word&quot; aren&#x27;t obvious).\nThis is great if you want to search a product catalog, but horrible when you&#x27;re trying to find an exact string in a technical context. Yes you can rephrase your query to avoid it, but that&#x27;s not the default and most people won&#x27;t know how to structure their query perfectly to avoid all the footguns.<p>Finally, as others are saying here, Elasticsearch is just painful and heavy to manage.<p>As for what to use instead...I don&#x27;t have good answers. I haven&#x27;t exhaustively checked out all the other products being mentioned, but in my experience a lot of them will have similar issues around field cardinality, which means it&#x27;ll always be possible to cripple your database with bad data. This is less of an issue if you&#x27;re just running a few services, but in larger orgs it can be nigh impossible to keep ahead of.<p>For smaller scale deployments, don&#x27;t underestimate just shipping everything to timestamp+service named files as newline-delimited JSON, and using jq and grep for search and a cronjob to delete&#x2F;archive old files.<p>When it comes to the &quot;read from local source and ship elsewhere&quot; component, I&#x27;ve had the best luck with filebeat (specifically for files -&gt; kafka). Most others tend to read as fast as they can then buffer in memory or disk if they can&#x27;t write immediately, whereas filebeat will only read the source file as fast as it can write downstream.<p>Note however that all such components are awful to configure, as they seek to provide a (often turing-complete) configuration file for transforming your logs before shipping them, and like most turing-complete configuration scripts, they&#x27;re less readable and more buggy than the equivalent would&#x27;ve been in any real programming language.<p>Ok, rant over.

My random observations over the years of dealing with Fry&#x27;s:<p>- Almost all the floor people are paid in part on commission.  Even the cashiers salary is in some part commission based.  Like, how can a cashier have any control over what somebody purchases in order to maximize their commission?<p>- Their Point of Sale software seemed to be the most antiquated homebrew garbage on earth.  The thing would print out a mile long receipt, even in their cafe.  Like, to order coffee the cashier had to do a bunch of steps in on the terminal just to complete the transaction--super bizarre.  I&#x27;m pretty sure some owners nephew &quot;who knows computers&quot; must have programmed that thing way back in the day and the owners never bothered to modernize.<p>- The stores always seemed depressing, even ten years ago.  Shelves were always dirty with crap strewn about.  The isles always had some shelves that were empty with no inventory, or the majority of the inventory out of stock.<p>- Years ago my monitor crapped out on me and I had an extended warranty.  The cheap fuckers didn&#x27;t replace it but actually wanted to spend several weeks somehow repairing it. I still have pictures on my phone of the absolute mountain of paperwork they gave me for this processes.  It was completely insane.<p>- All the people working there never seemed happy.  Several times I overheard employees yelling at each other in neighboring isles.  I always got the feeling store management was running the place like a pressure cooker--&quot;gotta sell XYZ of whatever or you are fired&quot; where &quot;XYZ&quot; was some product nobody on earth wanted.<p>In short, Fry&#x27;s always had a weird vibe to me.

No, just the ones that sell the most. Knowledgable staff? No, only those willing to settle for essentially minimal wage. Clean stores? No, we cut the staff and only sweep as needed. Bright lights?

I also lived a couple blocks away for a few years in the 90s.<p>For me it went downhill at the time they bought Infinite Universe (or whatever that store they acquired was called) and expanded nationwide. Actually it was kind of going downhill by the time they opened a store in Campbell.<p>I think the Fry&#x27;s unique proposition was that it sold the stuff the folks inside the industry used, but retail. I remember being amazed the very first time I entered the store (when there was only one, remember) that they sold heat shrink. All sizes. All colors. They carried products that otherwise the only way to get was to order from a distributor, which was a pain because you had to know exactly what you wanted, or trawl through paper catalogs, wait for delivery, all that. Or you could get in the car, zoom round to Fry&#x27;s and pick up what you needed.<p>Then over the next few decades two things happened: first, in order to keep making more and more money Fry&#x27;s expanded both geographically and with more product lines. This took them outside the bubble where orange 5mm heat shrink off-the-shelf is something people want, and into competition with Costco and Walmart for basic computers, fridges, etc. Second the differentiation vs old line distributors eroded as everyone bought everything online with next day delivery. If you want orange 5mm heat shrink today, Jeff can get it to a locker near you in 1&#x2F;2   a day[1].<p>In addition, Fry&#x27;s became just a painful place to shop. e.g. since the early 1990s if you tried to buy DRAM modules there, the sales person would give you hassle about being an idiot for wanting tin plated contacts vs gold. They began strip-searching customers on exit when they moved into the brown box. They stopped carrying most professional products: e.g. if you wanted the simplest thing for a data center cage such as a shelf or a 4U ATX case, they probably wouldn&#x27;t have that.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;16-Heat-Shrink-Tubing-1-100FT&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B06Y26JF2M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;16-Heat-Shrink-Tubing-1-100FT&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B06Y...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-04 05:50:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mmanfrin"],"id":[21949369],"kids":{},"parent":[21945492],"text":["My mom, in 4th grade, dated one of the Fry boys.

By 2040: cost to evolve AGI drops to $10 billion and most governments and wealthy financiers own what we would consider a sentient agent.

The gradient does <i>not<\/i> necessarily lead to the greatest decrease in the function.  Specifically, if our function of interest is f and we&#x27;re currently at the point x, then f(x - alpha grad f(x)) for some alpha may or may not be less that f(x + beta dx) for a different dx and beta.<p>For example, consider the quadratic f(x) = 0.5 x&#x27; A x - b&#x27; x where &#x27; denotes transpose and we have implicit multiplication.  Let A = [2 1;1 2], b = [3; 4], x = [5;6].  This is convex and quadratic with a global minima of [2&#x2F;3;5&#x2F;3], inv(A) b.  Now, grad f(x) = A x - b = [13;13] and moving in the direction [-13;-13] will not get us there in a single step.  However, dx_newton = -inv(hess f(x)) grad f(x) = [-4 1&#x2F;3, -4 1&#x2F;3], which brings us to the global minima in a single step.<p>The value in gradient descent is that, combined with an appropriate globalization technique such as a trust region or a line search, it guarantees convergence to a local minima.  Newton&#x27;s method does not unless close enough to the minima.  As such, most good, fast optimization algorithms based on differentiable functions use the steepest descent direction as a metric, or fallback, to guarantee convergence and then use a different direction, most likely a truncated-Newton method, to converge quickly.  Meaning, the gradient descent direction rarely leads to the greatest decrease.

I&#x27;d try something like:<p><pre><code>  To place a piece, first select it from the case, then click any empty square on the board.\n\n  To remove an existing piece from the board, click once on it.\n\n  Use the buttons below for standard starting position or to import a FEN position.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf you&#x27;re up for modifying the controls, I was expecting something like: clicking a piece currently on the board selects it. A second click on the same square deletes that piece, while a click on any other square &quot;moves&quot; the selected piece there, emptying its source square and overwriting the contents (if any) of the destination square."],"time":["2020-01-03 22:02:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SilasX"],"id":[21948855],"kids":{},"parent":[21946588],"text":["Nice! One suggestion, though: a common operation is to take one board position and move one piece on it.

What&#x27;s holding them back is dumb legislation. In EU, they are limited to 25 km&#x2F;h top speed and 250 W motors, which is not enough for everybody. Legislators think that if they are allowed to become more powerful then more people will die in accidents. True, but cars kill even more people so why don&#x27;t we ban them?<p>For fit people in good weather, 250 W is plenty enough. But not for overweight people or people with movement disabilities. The energy required for movement is proportional to the weight, so it makes a ton of difference if the rider weights 100 kg or only 70 kg. To ride in rain or snow you need sturdier tires which means that the frame and motor needs to be heavier further contributing to the weight.<p>This issue is solvable but legislation is way behind. If, or when, e-bikes running at 30 - 35 km&#x2F;h with 750 W motors becomes street-legal, they would become usable by almost anyone. You&#x27;d easily do a 15 km commute without breaking a sweat.

It always has—full stop!<p>Whether in recent years the risk of bushfires has increased or not because of global warming is essentially irrelevant to the argument.  In fact, the recent bushfires in mainly Eastern Australia are long overdue (which goes contrary to the global warming argument—no, don&#x27;t put words in my mouth by suggesting that I&#x27;m a denier, I&#x27;m just stating a fact).<p>First, let me say that I do have some understanding and experience in such matters:  decades ago when I was a young kid in primary school I stood on a hill overlooking the township of Leura in the Blue Mountains of NSW and watched a raging bushfire tear through the township burning down over 100 houses in about an hour.  It is hard to describe or paraphrase neither the emotion that I felt then nor the experience I gained from witnessing the conflagration.  Living in a bushfire-prone area, I&#x27;ve seen many fires like it over the decades.<p>It taught me a salient lesson about how truly dangerous and idiosyncratic bushfires can be—unpredictably, brick houses would often burn down whilst weatherboard ones would often be spared, and the fires would often unexpectedly gobble up ones out in the open whilst leaving houses with many trees and undergrowth in their yards or nearby.<p>Second, I&#x27;ve had to fight bush fires to save property, it&#x27;s hot, horrible and extremely dangerous work.<p>The key issues are these:<p>-  It can take many decades for a truly major bushfire to reoccur in a given location.  For example, the recent fires in the Jamison Valley in the Blue Mountains of NSW burned through bushland that has not seen a major fire for over 50 years.  Over such a long time, the undergrowth becomes thick, it&#x27;s a tinderbox just waiting to ignite, and on the first truly hot day or lightning strike off it goes.<p>-  Fire fighting in national parks miles from houses and other property is usually a waste of time (as I&#x27;ve just witnessed in the Jamison Valley where the water bombing was essentially useless (the fires progressed unhindered into more uninhabited national parkland despite ongoing efforts) and the cost of the fire-fighting helicopters was enormous for essentially nought effect).  Fire fighting efforts would be more effective if they concentrated on protecting townships and populated areas.  Nevertheless, gung-ho fire fighters have to be seen doing something even if it is useless.<p>-  Unfortunately, as truly major fires only repeat every 50 or 60 years, these fire fighters don&#x27;t have a firsthand memory of past events—simply:  corporate memory of past fires is lost from one major fire to another and thus it usually results in stuff-ups which can be serious, loss of live etc. as we&#x27;ve tragically seen again in the recent Australian bushfires.  (Remember, loss of life in bushfires in Australia is tragically common.)<p>-  Residents in fire-prone areas often have short memories, they grow trees in inappropriate places and the tree-hugging councils make things worse as they will not take action to remove a dangerous fire situation.  For example, near Echo Point in the popular tourist area of Katoomba (near where the fire was burning in the Jamison Valley) only a few weeks ago I personally witnessed the terrible situation of weeds and undergrowth right near housing and population centres that should have been removed by the Council.  After all, fires are nothing new to that area but Council has done SFA about removing the fire threat.<p>-  If fire fighting is overly successful in national parks and reserves, it can make the situation much worse for when the big one comes <i>[which it inevitably will]<\/i> as the fire will be much more intense.  Instead of just burning the leaves of the trees it&#x27;ll also kill them—great 400-year+ trees that have survived many a previous fire are now gone forever!  It&#x27;s damn stupid to do this!<p>-  For those of you not in Australia who think I&#x27;ve lost my senses by saying this, you need to keep in mind what I said at the beginning—the Australian bush <i>must burn periodically to survive<\/i>.  The seeds of many trees, Banksia for instance, only germinate after a fire has opened their seedpods.  The aim should be to allow this to happen on a natural cycle whilst still protecting life and property.  Unfortunately, the Australian people are like ostriches with their heads in the sand, decade after decade they continue to fuck-up fire management to the nth degree and they do so at the risk to life and property.<p>Finally let me note that Californians are not much better.  Why they have let the Australian eucalypt, which burn like incendiary torches due to being full of inflammable eucalypt oil, overrun their state simply defies any reasonable logic that I can think of.  Moreover, eucalypts, like many introduced species, grow like weeds in California (when I first went there both the size and the leafiness of the eucalypts amazed me).  Unlike Australia where the eucalypt is native, Californians have a choice.  It seems to me they ought to eradicate them, if for no other reason than in the interests of safety."],"time":["2020-01-03 18:45:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["karma993"],"id":[21946676],"kids":{},"parent":[21945493],"text":["Karma"],"time":["2020-01-03 16:30:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sitkack"],"id":[21945869],"kids":[21948844,21945941],"parent":[21945493],"text":["Should use drones to harvest the meat ASAP."],"time":["2020-01-03 15:03:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hydgv"],"id":[21946159],"kids":{},"parent":[21945493],"text":["&gt;Nature Conservation Council ecologist Mark Graham told parliament: “[Koalas] really have no capacity to move fast enough to get away [from the flames].<p>Seems like natural selection to me<p>lol someone was so irked by this small dose of truth that he proceeded to downvote all of my past comments"],"time":["2020-01-03 15:34:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["s5ma6n"],"id":[21944977],"kids":[21949632,21945030],"parent":[21943960],"text":["Ugh, I felt an itch because of the x-axis ordering.

Plus i could withdraw that money at any time I choose with no issues. A few days later after he had my account reflecting a further $10,000 in winnings, I was encouraged to put another $5000 towards anther investment. This time my money is 100% insured and again i could withdraw at any time. My account got to around $26,000 in about 2 weeks and i needed to withdraw as we had agreed that I needed the $10,000 at a particular date. At this time i stopped hearing from him because he had tried to convince me that making a withdrawal takes away the benefit of insurance etc. I insisted because i needed the money. My account went up again to over $30,000. I started to contact support in order to make my withdrawal. After a while they became very rude, the person i was trying to plead with to give Oscar my message told me that i was giving him attitude. then as i continued to call, Mr Oscar Ford called me back to say he had just came out of an i think 9 hrs meeting and was fired because he had lost a client&#x27;s $3000,000.

One example :<p><i>... the crucial deal that brought the Iraqi government together was made not by them but by Suleimani. In the months before, according to several Iraqi and Western officials, Suleimani invited senior Shiite and Kurdish leaders to meet with him in Tehran and Qom, and extracted from them a promise to support Maliki, his preferred candidate. The deal had a complex array of enticements. Maliki and Assad disliked each other; Suleimani brought them together by forging an agreement to build a lucrative oil pipeline from Iraq to the Syrian border. In order to bring the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in line, Suleimani agreed to place his men in the Iraqi service ministries.<p>Most remarkable, according to the Iraqi and Western officials, were the two conditions that Suleimani imposed on the Iraqis. The first was that Jalal Talabani, a longtime friend of the Iranian regime, become President. The second was that Maliki and his coalition partners insist that all American troops leave the country. “Suleimani said: no Americans,” the former Iraqi leader told me. “A ten-year relationship, down the drain.”<p>Iraqi officials told me that, at the time of Jeffrey’s announcement, the Americans knew that Suleimani had pushed them out of the country but were too embarrassed to admit it in public. “We were laughing at the Americans,” the former Iraqi leader told me, growing angry as he recalled the situation. “Fuck it!

The other 6 bitplane mode is &quot;Halfbrite&quot; which doubles the palette size for a total of 64 colors, where the second half 32 colors are half the intensity of the first half.\nWhen running with 6 bitplanes, agnus (the memory controller if you will) steals a lot of cycles for Denise (the display chip) from both the 68K and the blitter. The blitter being crucial for drawing filled polygons.<p>The second thing that made the Amiga revolutionary (and one could argue, for this reason, that the PCI architecture of Hombre&#x2F;AAA is not a true Amiga no matter Commodore&#x27;s demise) - the second thing is the way that Agnus orchestrates memory access much like the microcode inside a CPU orchestrates registers and ALUs. In particular, Agnus controls the memory address lines and chip-register-address lines; the chip-register-address and the memory address lines are opened up simultaneously against eachother with one reading and the other writing. So, for instance, when reading bitplans, agnus opens the chip bus using one of the register addresses 0x110-0x11A for BPL1DAT to BPL6DAT depending on which of the 6 bitplanes is being read; while at the same time driving the appropriate memory address by putting the contents of agnus registers 0x0E0-0x0F6 for BPL1PTL&#x2F;H to BPL6PTL&#x2F;H on the address bus of the &quot;chip memory&quot; DRAMs. The datalines of the DRAM and the special chips (Denise here) directly open on eachother (eg. DRAM and Paula chip-selected at the same time.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I did it justice and got the elegance of this architecture across in this short post.

The article states that &quot;There are no bitplanes here like on the Amiga we saw in the previous entry.&quot; This is slightly inaccurate. ST does have bitplanes, but the organization is interleaved to 16 bit words, unlike on Amiga where the bitplanes are stored as separate memory regions.<p>So in 1 bpp hires mode, there&#x27;s just a single bitplane (and the memory layout is identical when comparing to Amiga 640x400 interlaced hi-res 1 bpp screen mode). In 2 bpp medium res (640x200, 4 colors), there are two bitplanes, alternating bitplanes for every 16-bit word. So 16 bits of bitplane 0 for the first word, then 16 bits of bitplane 1 for the second word (these together form the first 16 pixels), and so on. In the 320x200 low res mode there are four bitplanes interleaved in the same way.<p>What this means from the programmer&#x27;s perspective is that you can do similar bitplane tricks as with Amiga, e.g. modify just one of the bitplanes independent of the others. For instance effects where car headlights change the background image colors can be done the same way on both machines: render to just one bitplane and use the palette to achieve the change in colors.<p>However, when with Amiga it&#x27;s trivial to modify bitplane pointers independent of each other to scroll graphics around, on Atari ST all bitplanes are tied to the same base pointer (because they are interleaved in the memory). (And to make things like full-screen scrolling even more difficult, this base pointer is aligned to 256 bytes, i.e. the low byte of the video memory base address is always 0 on Atari ST - on STE this is programmable.)<p>There are some cases where the interleaved bitplane format gives benefits: while neither of the machines are good for writing texture mappers (or other effects that require manipulation of single pixels), it&#x27;s slightly more efficient on Atari ST because the layout allows some tricks (e.g. using MOVEP instruction to write 8 pixels to all 4 bitplanes at once from a single 32-bit register).<p>From the point of view of a game like Another World, the bitplane arrangement of Atari ST doesn&#x27;t really cause additional problems when comparing to the Amiga. The issue is the lack of blitter (and STE blitter isn&#x27;t that great improvement, it doesn&#x27;t have the line drawing capabilities of Amiga blitter and has less flexible src&#x2F;dst mechanism, so no wonder it isn&#x27;t utilized by the game)."],"time":["2020-01-03 16:42:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bluedino"],"id":[21937927],"kids":[21939655,21940418],"parent":[21937607],"text":["The SNES was the platform I played &quot;Out of this World&quot; on.<p>The interesting thing about it was, it was a polygon game that ran without using the SuprFX chip.<p>With the SNES being sprite-based I could never figure that out."],"time":["2020-01-02 19:06:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Waterluvian"],"id":[21943330],"kids":[21946498],"parent":[21937607],"text":["I think hardware limitations were a huge source of creativity in games.

Cars are simply far more convenient than public transit or biking or walking, when supported appropriately by infrastructure and policy.

I’m OK with having convenient car driving options and incurring a higher degree of risk as a result. A small number of deaths does not make me feel generally “unsafe” on the roads and I will happily take the reduced travel times as a trade off. The CDC’s data also indicates that vehicle related injuries and deaths have been falling since the 1980s, unrelated to recent traffic calming measures. I bet this trend will continue with rapid declines caused by the standardization of back up cameras, collision avoidance, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, and so on.
