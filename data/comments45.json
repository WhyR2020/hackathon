The idea was to connect students and parents who witnessed gun violence with community resources (i.e. not just the cops) that could provide guidance and therapy. This same protocol could be adapted to notify everyone &quot;exposed&quot; to the shooter&#x27;s phone and provide those resources on the fly.<p>One other semi-dystopian possibility is using the protocol to apprehend criminals. Most people would not accept real-time location tracking by the government, and so such functionality is out of the question (or at least not publicly available to the majority of citizens, local LEO included).

When colliding with the wall, you get the temperature and pressure needed to keep them separate.<p>- Planck took this and showed why nothing happens when the lights go out on a room full of dark pots and pans. Newton&#x27;s Law of Cooling said one should glow white hot and every other one gets darker. Planck used Boltzman to say you need to build up a little energy before you change color.<p>- Einstein took Planck&#x27;s work and said you have a start, you have an end, you have a particle, a photon. Slowing down and spinning up your clock is a medium of heat transfer just the same as conductive surfaces or convective mediums. The photon hits an entire object at once, not just one spot, that&#x27;s why energy level matters over intensity and can describe everything in photons and photoelectricicty.<p>- Other scientists looked at this and said you are either throwing beach balls at a brick wall, and don&#x27;t know if the brick wall is moving towards you at a thousandth of an inch a century. Or you&#x27;re throwing a medicine ball to someone on roller skates. You push them back so you know they stopped still, but just don&#x27;t know where.<p>- Bohr took this to model the atom for orbitals. Here you need a full number of cycles for something to exist.<p>- Pauli showed that the electron has spin on it&#x27;s own. Spin produces magnetism. Magnetism is the atom looking for an electron not just up the conductive chain but everywhere, so an exchange of photons.<p>- Shannon brought more abstraction in terms of entropy as available choices<p>When I think of the atom, I think of what&#x27;s needed on the inside to make the outside exist. I think of a hollowed golf ball with dimples, or a sphere made of sticks all connected at the center. The surface can move, the inside makes it happen.

Could you really blame people for wanting to get it right and not handicap themselves relative to the other students?<p>Given that, the university then has a responsibility to make it as hard as possible to cheat.

Whether or not the individual is healthy, is primarily not an individual matter, but depends on the structure of his society.”<p><U+2015> Erich Fromm, The Sane Society (1955)<p>“Enclosed within his artificial creation, man finds that there is &quot;no exit&quot;; that he cannot pierce the shell of technology again to find the ancient milieu to which he was adapted for hundreds of thousands of years. . . . In our cities there is no more day or night or heat or cold. But there is overpopulation, thralldom to press and television, total absence of purpose. All men are constrained by means external to them to ends equally external. The further the technical mechanism develops that allows us to escape natural necessity, the more we are subjected to artificial technical necessities.”<p><U+2015> Jacques Ellul, The Technological Society (1954)<p>“What is more, the whole apparatus of life has become so complex and the processes of production, distribution, and consumption have become so specialized and subdivided, that the individual person loses confidence in his own unaided capacities: he is increasingly subject to commands he does not understand, at the mercy of forces over which he exercises no effective control, moving to a destination he has not chosen. Unlike the taboo-ridden savage, who is often childishly over-confident in the powers of his shaman or magician to control formidable natural forces, however inimical, the machine-conditioned individual feels lost and helpless as day by day he metaphorically punches his time-card, takes his place on the assembly line, and at the end draws a pay check that proves worthless for obtaining any of the genuine goods of life.<p>This lack of close personal involvement in the daily routine brings a general loss of contact with reality: instead of continuous interplay between the inner and the outer world, with constant feedback or readjustment and with stimulus to fresh creativity, only the outer world-and mainly the collectively organized outer world of the power system-exercises authority: even private dreams must be channeled through television, film, and disc, in order to become acceptable.<p>With this feeling of alienation goes the typical psychological problem of our time, characterized in classic terms by Erik Erikson as the &#x27;Identity Crisis.&#x27; In a world of transitory family nurture, transitory human contacts, transitory jobs and places of residence, transitory sexual and family relations, the basic conditions for maintaining continuity and establishing personal equilibrium disappear. The individual suddenly awakens, as Tolstoi did in a famous crisis in his own life at Arzamas, to find himself in a strange, dark room, far from home, threatened by obscure hostile forces, unable to discover where he is or who he is, appalled by the prospect of a meaningless death at the end of a meaningless life.”<p><U+2015> Lewis Mumford, The Pentagon of Power (1964)<p>&quot;On all sides man was continually made to feel the natural limitations of earthly well-being. The efficient ministering of the technical, hygienic and sanitary appliances with which man has surrounded himself is spoiling him. He is losing the good-humored resignation in the daily imperfections of human well-being which formed the disciple of earlier generations.<p>But at the same time he runs the risk of losing the natural ability to take human happiness as it offers itself, as well. Life is made too easy. Mankind’s moral fiber is giving way under the softening influence of luxury. In earlier civilizations, whether Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or any other, there was always this in contrast: in principle the value of earthly happiness is deprecated relatively to celestial bliss or union with the All. As all these religions, however, do recognize a relative worth of early pleasures, and consider them as God-given, denial of the value of life meant ingratitude. It was the very realization\nof the precariousness of every moment of human well-being which caused it to be appreciated at its true value.<p>In the present there is a contrast also, but it is a very different one. The increase of security, of comfort, and of the possibilities of want-gratification, in short the greater ease of living has had two results: On the one hand, it has prepared the soil for all forms of renunciation of life: philosophical denial of its value, purely emotive spleen or aversion from life; on the other, it has installed the belief\nin the right to happiness. It has made people expect things from life. Related to this there is another contrast. The ambivalent attitude which wavers between the renunciation and the enjoyment of life is peculiar to the individual alone. The community, however, without hesitation and with more\nconviction than ever before, accepts earthly life as the object of all striving and action. It is indeed a true worship of life.<p>Now it is a question for serious consideration whether any advanced culture can survive without a certain measure of orientation to Death. The great civilizations of the past have all had it. There are signs that the philosophical thought of today is also coming to it. It seems only logical, more over, that a philosophy which rates “living” above “knowing” should also include the end of life in its\nvision.&quot;<p><U+2015> Johan Huizinga, In the Shadow of Tomorrow (1936)"],"time":["2020-05-13 23:35:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gentleman11"],"id":[23167004],"kids":[23167242],"parent":[23166748],"text":["Why stop with monitoring people’s online activities?

Some people made a ton of money in tech through a combination of hard work, having a really great idea, and luck, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. Other people saw how much money they made and the market and other piled in to try and get rich, some of them had good ideas, some of them had ideas that sounded good. This was the rising of the bubble, VCs want to get in on this, dreams of exorbitant wealth played before their eyes, they started funding tech ideas even if they didn&#x27;t think they were good or there was clearly no way for the idea to actually be that profitable. But it didn&#x27;t matter, this is when we started spouting things like &quot;don&#x27;t invest in a product, invest in a star team&quot;, &quot;pivoting&quot; began to become big, questions about actual revenue were hand waved with words like &quot;market capture&quot; and &quot;penetration&quot;.<p>Then we hit the height of the bubble, the second stage hadn&#x27;t actually really produced any wildly profitable companies but other big tech companies bought them, for their engineers or platform, or data or something, at obscene valuations and so the VCs and founders still made a killing. The dream for founders and engineers went from &quot;have a good idea that you can build something on&quot; to &quot;how can I get myself bought by Google&quot;, VCs meanwhile went from &quot;will my capital work out here&quot; to &quot;I need to get in fast on the first rounds and some other sucker will be willing to buy it for more on the next round of funding.&quot; This is when the idea no longer mattered, what you did, how you were going to do it, none of those things mattered anymore. Move as fast as you can the faster you move the more likely you were to hit the &quot;next big thing&quot;, in reality you were just playing the lottery, but instead of VCs buying $5 lottery tickets they were buying $5 million dollars stake in companies. Engineers rather than paying with their hard earned cash for the scratch-n-win were suckered into paying with hours of their lives in hopes of scoring big on the &quot;being bought out jackpot&quot;. Things seemed to peak with the WeWork fiasco, ideas that were stupidly blindingly obvious, and already being done were suddenly transformed into these hot new golden geese because they used tech jargon to cover up the fact the emperor was wearing no clothes.<p>We are now in the bubble popping for tech, corona probably wasn&#x27;t the way anyone saw the bubble popping but now the contraction in capital, and the easy money drying up will show which companies had a solid good business model, which ones were iffy, and which ones were completely ludicrous.<p>This ended up being a lot longer than intended but really sometimes you don&#x27;t need fancy explanations or complex financial analysis to figure out things, sometimes plain old common sense can help you better see the forest for the trees."],"time":["2020-05-13 22:12:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alexbanks"],"id":[23171102],"kids":[23171301],"parent":[23170255],"text":["In the post-covid world, you have to actually make money and have ROI to be worth invested in."],"time":["2020-05-13 21:57:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Mizza"],"id":[23171027],"kids":[23171522],"parent":[23170255],"text":["Capital faces a &#x27;fundamental reset&#x27;, says torch-wielding mob."],"time":["2020-05-13 21:52:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nathanaldensr"],"id":[23170871],"kids":[23171206],"parent":[23170255],"text":["I wish I could read the article as the headline sounds interesting.

Manager sent out specs on google doc, I video-confed the Seattle dev, we agreed upon the breakdown of work, I did the backend statistics stuff with apache math &amp; finagle, he did the frontend in mustache.js, then we got code reviews &amp; lgtm. That was one of the very few things that actually shipped with zero friction, because none of us ever saw each other in person. Everything was email &amp; gdocs &amp; git. Really enjoyed that experience."],"time":["2020-05-12 20:06:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["heelix"],"id":[23166417],"kids":{},"parent":[23155647],"text":["I&#x27;ve really come to miss the whiteboard walls.

Furthermore there is a lot of focus from day one on this CR decomposition which serves to say that a linear transform from R^m to R^n might map to a subspace of R^n with smaller dimension r &lt; min(m,n) and while in some sense this is true it is itself quite &quot;unphysical&quot;—if a matrix contains noisy entries then it will generally only be degenerate in this way with probability zero. (You need perfect noise cancelation to get degeneracies, which amounts to a sort of neglected underlying conserved quantity which is pushing back on you and demanding to be conserved.) In that sense the CR decomposition is kind of pointless and is just working around some &quot;perfect little counterexamples&quot;.

This has first meant the joint statement extending the lockdown to June 1st. My speculation is that this also means that the whole area moves at the same rate as the slowest county.<p>One Alameda County supervisor implies that perhaps he could have gotten them open by May 18th. I doubt that because the power to do so is not directly invested in the board but rather the county health officer. The health officer is acting in concert with the other counties health officers.<p>The leader of this group is the Santa Clara health officer, Sara Cody, who has been credited with architecting the lockdown. The officer has been very vague about opening the counties up to phase 2, saying that it will be frustratingly slow (a).<p>The officer points to insufficient testing and insufficient numbers of workers to contact trace (b). The officer said that they are weeks away from having enough workers to contact trace and that tests are only 20-25% towards the goal.<p>My issue with the tests are that they are voluntary. There is probably no way to meet that goal unless you force people to test. You can tell by the number of tests in each county. It isn&#x27;t really going up very fast (c). At present rate, you are talking about several months. The issue doesn&#x27;t seem to be insufficient tests. It seems to be mostly that people aren&#x27;t going in to get tested since the positivity rate is actually going down.<p>I also think that the health officers want to work in concert since one county moving faster than the others will create pressure on the other counties to move at that rate. There is already such pressure since the rest of the state is already moving faster.<p>A good percentage of the Bay Area is insulated from the effects of the lockdown since many can work from home. The big tech companies have been relatively unaffected by covid-19. Government employees are still being paid.

Temperature check at entrance, mask requirement, strict hand sanitization, etc. Then let Musk commercialize the process of opening up businesses.<p>Some background:<p>I followed Corona (COVID19 now) from late January very closely and read most published papers. I strongly supported the &quot;flattening of the curve&quot; and encouraged the lockdown and we practiced&#x2F;and practice strict social distancing.\nThat being said, hearing countering arguments from various scientist (2013 Noble prize winner [0]). The Swedish epidemiologist [1]. That the lockdown makes no sense unless we are going to have a vaccine when we come out of the lockdown.<p>Remember, the initial lockdown was mostly argued for flattening the curve (in addition to maybe it worked in China lets follow them). If you look at the curves (flattened vs. spiked) they have near the same areas, meaning those original scientist who argued for it, never argued the lockdown was going to reduce the net infection by COVID but to slow it down to help the health care system gear up and also not get overwhelmed (lack of rooms, ventilators, etc.)<p>That being said, we can copy some smart and common sense stuff from places like Taiwan (I&#x27;ve spoken to people who live in Taiwan and life is almost back to normal but they just wear masks in public) that has allowed them open up and I&#x27;m hoping Tesla is learning from these practices.<p>What we have not heard from our governor (feels like many of his stuff is partially motivated by planning for a 2024 presidential run) or county officials a clear pathway to opening up.<p>Here&#x27;s what I want to hear from them:<p>1 - we are distributing masks to every house. \n2 - we are requiring mask in all public places or when you&#x27;re passing by anyone within 1 car length (6 feet is hard to visualize) \n3 - we are distributing hand sanitizers to every public facing business. \n4 - we are requiring all credit card terminals to be touch-less or any customer using it, must apply hand sanitizer before and after using it. \n5 - we&#x27;ll start deploying IR thermometers to malls and large public facing businesses (Costco, Safeway ) and will test for temperature. \n6 - Take extra measures to protect the seniors and elderly. Continue to have senior-only operation hours (at Costco, etc.) everyone working in adult care facility needs to be tested and monitored. \n7- Daily PSA by local TV&#x2F;radio in English, Spanish, Chinese...how to best sanitize your hands, how to best use mask and how to effectively maintaining social distancing even with mask. \n8 - Ticket&#x2F;fine those who are not wearing mask. Maybe the first offense is a warning if they don&#x27;t have a mask and the police office will hand them a mask.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some of these, but not a in concrete single articulated plan of execution with timeline. Right now most policies are made with bad data. Not statical sampling of confirmed COVID (though it&#x27;s changing [2]) but rather raw numbers. It&#x27;s obvious the more you test the more confirmed cases you&#x27;ll get. Everyday, you hear about how numbers are increasing (that might be true, but it&#x27;s not really scientific) Where as statistical sampling would tell us what percentage of the population is infected and if the infection spreading or staying flat.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bl-sZdfLcEk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bl-sZdfLcEk<\/a> \n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bfN2JWifLCY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bfN2JWifLCY<\/a> \n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NTXgbN6uB1I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NTXgbN6uB1I<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-12 01:33:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["54351623"],"id":[23148842],"kids":[23148941],"parent":[23146897],"text":["If I was a Tesla employee I&#x27;d strike for quadruple pay and benefits.
