Professors dread making them, they take real time, and they indirectly “reward” those who can’t make the first sitting (with more study time, etc). Some do refuse to do it. Still, universities compel teachers to do it because the value of having each student tested is considered a crucial part of the mission.<p>I get that this is a different situation; there’s a social unity component, some experiences can’t be exactly recreated. But is completely booting someone for missing one initial meeting in spirit with the mission? Is so much lost from a recorded version that it is truly better for that seat to stay empty for 6 weeks and one less person to be able to join the next batch as a result of a time zone gaffe?

There is no reason there has to be any delay at all in the UI. Graceful degradation of intellisense is acceptable depending on project complexity, but there should never be any sort of perceptible hitching or delays when moving code windows around, scrolling, typing, switching tabs, minimizing&#x2F;maximizing, etc. If my PC can display the complex 3d scenes of Overwatch at 2560x1440p@180FPS with &lt;5ms input latency, I cannot comprehend any rational argument for my IDE being unable to achieve even 10% of that performance objective.<p>I understand that use of frameworks like ElectronJS make it virtually impossible to achieve my stated objectives, so perhaps we need to dust off some APIs and re-learn old tricks. Think about the aggregate developer hours that could be saved with 1 heroic implementation effort. Imagine if you could load a VS solution in less than a second and immediately start clicking through the UI in any direction without any fear that it is about to sandbag your ass with frustratingly-arbitrary UI delay soup.

The latter has been the focus for the last three years, and those products now appear to be winding down. But the former was a huge success - both Servo&#x27;s parallel CSS engine and its GPU-based graphics layer are now shipping in Firefox.<p>While it seems unlikely that Mozilla will continue to prototype things in Servo, we&#x27;re still building lots of innovative technology (and writing lots of Rust code) directly in Firefox.

The content grows old and stale, errors do not get corrected, and the writing is often what I would call draft quality even when its published.<p>There are always a lot more consumers than creators of content on any platform. Most people going to use a resource are not the same who can write about it, not everyone on YouTube has something to share or make a video. And why give it away for free when you can make a paid course, give a talk, charge consulting fees, sell  a solution to a problem?<p>You need to align incentives. Again, why contribute to something and possibly deal with the pain of moderation for free (costs instead of gain). Should we blindly trust the wisdom of the crowds? The other cost of free, is that the community may not  be capable or not interested in sufficient moderation - this leads to low quality content which chases people away, even if there is good content right next to it.<p>OWASP&#x27;s incentives and objectives have never been 100% clear to me. There are some big security players involved, but it seems more interested in research, community, grants, etc versus content. When you look at MDN, Mozilla has a clear incentive to document these things so developers build more &quot;standard&quot; vs &quot;Chrome-focused&quot; web apps, which helps keep users on FireFox since all of their favorite sites are less likely to break without FireFox simply copying decision made by Chrome. By documenting expected action and quirks, it forces Google et al. to try to move back towards agreed upon standards.<p>In security, I am generally more reliant upon vendor write ups and content from people with a reputation. Security has a much smaller population than web dev. Also, for web dev a lot of people pick it up and feel comfortable writing publicly even when they are just starting out (See Dev.To).

There are so many applications of entropy and statistical physics in computer science, and I find it fascinating that the same general properties are useful in such different contexts.<p>For example, there&#x27;s a well-known phenomenon in probability called concentration of measure. One of the most important examples in computer science is if you flip n coins independently, then the number of heads concentrates very tightly. In particular, the probability that you are more than an epsilon-fraction away from 0.5n heads is at most around e^{-epsilon^2 n}. This is exactly the setting described in the article with the sheep in two pens, and this inequality is used in the design of many important randomized algorithms! A classic example is in load balancing, where random assignment sometimes produces &#x27;nice&#x27; configurations that look very much like the high-entropy states described in this article (but unfortunately, many times random assignments don&#x27;t behave very well, see e.g. the birthday paradox).<p>The sum of independent random variables is well known to have concentration properties. An interesting question to me is what sorts of other statistics will exhibit these concentration phenomena. An important finding in this area is the bounded differences inequality (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;~cscott&#x2F;past_courses&#x2F;eecs598w14&#x2F;notes&#x2F;09_bounded_difference.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;~cscott&#x2F;past_courses&#x2F;eecs598w14&#x2F;n...<\/a>), which generally states that any function that doesn&#x27;t &quot;depend too much&quot; on each individual random argument (and the sum of bounded variables satisfies this assumption) exhibits the same concentration phenomenon. There are some applications in statistical learning, where we can bound the estimation error using certain learning complexity measures that rely on the bounded differences inequality. In the context of this article, that means there&#x27;s a whole class of statistics that will concentrate similarly, and perhaps exhibit irreversibility at a macroscopic level."],"time":["2020-08-14 20:09:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["leafboi"],"id":[24165531],"kids":{},"parent":[24140808],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wI-qAxKJoSU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wI-qAxKJoSU<\/a><p>In the video above you will witness a metal wire in a disorderly shape spontaneously form into an organized spring shape when entropy is increased (the wire is heated).

In my opinion, a well made containerized system is far superior an experience:<p>- Deploy times are certainly slower, up to 50x slower than non-containerized. However, we&#x27;re talking 30s deploys versus 20 minute deploy times, all-inclusive. The sidenote here is that you can drastically reduce containerized deploy by putting in some effort: make sure the (docker) containers inherit from other containers (preferably self-built) with executable version that you need. For instance, you might inherit version X of program A and version Y of program B before building only a container with version Z of program C, as A and B barely change (and if they do, it&#x27;s just a version bump in the final container). Even better, just build a code container during deploy (so a container with essentially only code and dependencies), and keep all the executable as separate images&#x2F;containers that are built during development time;<p>- Containers do allow high-speed fixes, in the form of extremely simplified rollbacks. It is built into the entire fabric of containers to allow this, as you just change a version number in a config (usually) and can then rollback to a non-broken situation. Worst case, the deploy of fixed code in my case does take only 20 minutes (after the time it takes to fix&#x2F;mitigate the issue, which is usually much longer);<p>- Local environment is _so much easier_ with containers. It takes 10 minutes to setup a new machine with a working local environment with containers, versus the literal hours it can take on bare metal, disregarding even supporting multiple OS&#x27;es. On top of that, any time production wants a version bump, you can start that game all over again without containers. Most of my devs don&#x27;t ever worry about the versions of PHP or Node they are running in their containerized envs, whereas the non-container system takes a day to install for a new dev.<p>Containers can be heavy and cumbersome, but in many cases, a good responsibility split can make them fast and easily usable. In the specific case of docker, I find treating the containers like just the executable they are (which is a fairly default way of dealing with it) works wonders for the easy-and-quick approach."],"time":["2020-08-13 12:30:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["darksaints"],"id":[24157766],"kids":{},"parent":[24141628],"text":["I have long felt like containers, and VMs before then, have been abused to the point of absurdity.

With containerized: no idea. Seems a largely unsolved issue, probably because &quot;containerization should not do any firewalling&quot;. And partly because of how network mapping works, the problem is mitigated (but not solved!) there.<p>* Monitoring: at least three popular docker images that I used forgot to add logrotation, crashing after long term running. That in itself is bad (and shows lack of detailed finish in many images) but it shows you need to monitor. I used munin and am now migrating towards prometheus&#x2F;grafana, but I really have no idea how to properly monitor a flock of containers. Another problem that has been solved for ages, but requires time&amp;effort in a containerized env.<p>* Timed jobs (cronjobs). There is tooling to spin-up-and-run containers on timed schedules, but no-one as easy and stable as having Ansible write a file to &#x2F;etc&#x2F;cron.d&#x2F;osm_poi_extract (or use systemd, fine with me).<p>* fail2ban, tripwire, etc: small tooling that is hard to do or requires extra attention in a containerized setup.<p>* unity: if you rely on 3rd party containers you&#x27;ll quickly have a rainbow-spectrum of machines: Ubuntu LTS, Ubuntu edge, Ubuntu ancient, Alpine, CentOS, a rare freeBSD. The interface is consistent, the underlying tech is not: troubleshooting is a terror if you first have to spend 20 minutes of googling &quot;how do I know what version Alpine I have and how do I get curl on this damned thing to see if elasticsearch is maybe giving results on localhost&quot;.<p>I realize that my 16+ years of prior linux-sysadmin experience hinder me here: I&#x27;m probably trying to make a containerized setup do the same that I&#x27;m used to, but which is not really needed (tripwire, fail2ban, firewalls?).<p>But for me, containers -in production- solve no problem.

Of course, as anything, it also brings new problems. Here&#x27;s why I went for it:<p>- Before, when I just SSH:ed to servers and rscynced files, I had many situations where I forgot what change I did on a server, how it was set up, and so on. I found Docker when I was looking for tools to put those various commands and bash scripts into one place for central storage and easy re-creation of the environment. Dockerfiles and containers makes everything reproducible and reduced to the smallest amount of steps needed to get something correctly setup.<p>- I would find that something worked locally but not on remote due to different versions of some dependency. Docker images ensured I could test in almost identical environments. It&#x27;s also easy to try new apps without worrying about polluting the current environment, so I&#x27;m not faster in trying out solutions and rolling back&#x2F;forward dependencies.<p>- I would test things on the server, because I was not able to run the exact setup on my local computer. This takes time and risk breaking real stuff. Docker images fixes this.<p>- I would struggle with knowing what services ran or not. Part of this came from me not knowing all the ins and outs of Linux, so I felt it was hard to get an overview of what&#x27;s running. docker ps makes it easy to see what&#x27;s running.<p>- Updating a traditional app often required me to change more things than just update a source tree. It could be starting&#x2F;stopping services, adding files in other places. So updates tended to become manual and error-prone (I didn&#x27;t do them often enough to remember by heart what&#x27;s needed). Docker and primarily docker-compose encapsulates all the stuff into simple commands.<p>- Before, my apps would use mixed sources of configuration - environment, config files in different places, command line arguments. More importantly, they would often be stateful, saving things to files that needed to be managed. With Docker, i was somewhat forced to align all config in one place and make everything else stateless and that makes things much cleaner.<p>-  As a hobbyist, I rarely had the time before to go over the security of my servers. I find that Docker provides a better secure default in terms of making it clear what services are open to the world and by reducing the attack surface.<p>Of course, containers have brought some problems too:<p>- Lots of apps were not ready to be containerised, or required a lot of hacks to do so. So I&#x27;ve done a lot of debugging and sleuthing to find the right way to run and configure various apps in Docker. These days, the official Docker images are much better and exist for almost all apps, but there is still a lot of &quot;messy magic&quot; built into their Dockerfiles.<p>- More often than not you want to get into the container to run something, debug, ping, check a file, etc. This gets more convoluted than before, and you need to learn some new tricks to e.g. pipe in and out data. It&#x27;s made harder by the fact that many images are so minimalistic you don&#x27;t have access to the full range of tools inside the containers.<p>- Logging in Linux is IMO a mess since before, but still with Docker it&#x27;s not great, just mashing up stdout for all containers and unclear rotation procedures. There are many ways to deal with it, but they often require lots more tooling, and it still gives me some headache.<p>- Yes, waiting for build and transfer of images adds a bit of time to deploy. And it&#x27;s somewhat annoying to deal with two version control systems, e.g. git and Docker Hub. I haven&#x27;t gone all in on CI yet but that would automate more and just let me use git."],"time":["2020-08-14 14:32:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24141978],"kids":{},"parent":[24141628],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-13 12:58:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["temptemptemp111"],"id":[24142090],"kids":{},"parent":[24141628],"text":["I like docker-compose - but anything more (k8 &#x2F; swam) I think is just too complex to be worth it in the long run."],"time":["2020-08-13 13:15:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["Bedon292"],"id":[24161828],"kids":[24162013,24163231,24164594,24165129,24165949,24164871,24162539,24165920,24162874,24162644,24162974],"parent":[24160608],"text":["I love Django &#x2F; Django Rest Framework and have used it for a long time, but we recently dumped it from a project in favor of FastAPI.<p>There is just so many layers of magic in Django, that it was becoming impossible for us to improve the performance to an acceptable level.
