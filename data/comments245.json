They are intellectually rewarding but too often spiritually draining, being at the intersection of massive effort and a high chance of failure.<p>So, I&#x27;ve teamed up with an incredible developer&#x2F;founder friend and we have a goal - build something both fun and deliverable!

And now you can!

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 2-3months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: In case you&#x27;re only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn&#x27;t find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important)."],"time":["2020-01-03 11:40:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mparrott123"],"id":[21944229],"kids":{},"parent":[21936440],"text":["Man Group Alpha Tech | Quant Python Engineer | London, UK | Onsite | Full Time<p>As a Quant Python Engineer in Alpha Tech at Man you will be building the tools, frameworks, libraries and applications which power our Quantitative Research and Systematic Trading.

I say scrum like, because absolutely nobody does it &quot;by the book&quot;. And if you do, you are doing it wrong because you are being rigid and dogmatic. Every agile manifesto signee will tell you that (I&#x27;ve heard several of them talk about this). I meet a lot of &quot;you are doing it wrong&quot; types. You know the type. Self styled agilists that throw the book at you and seem to love having lots of post its stuck on their walls that provide the illusion of progress in the absence of exactly that.<p>These days, I prefer Kanban style processes for several reasons. Most importantly, the practice of ignoring new requirements for two weeks (aka. doing a sprint) is not sustainable in most projects I&#x27;m on. It&#x27;s just not a thing. Stuff changes all the time, deal with it now instead of in two weeks. Another reason is that I prefer continuous deployment and automating PM reviews away so we don&#x27;t block shipping stuff over somebody&#x27;s opinion. Sprint deadlines are utterly meaningless from a release point of view if you release multiple times per day. If it&#x27;s better than what we have then merge and ship it ASAP. If it&#x27;s obviously broken, obviously fix it now ASAP and don&#x27;t wait to have a meeting about it in 2 weeks. Do that multiple times per day. Have responsible processes to ensure bad stuff gets caught before it is merged. It works. Shipping early means you catch stuff early and get feedback from real users rather than opinionated PMs and managers detached from reality. Also people stop throwing things over the fence when they are confronted with the consequences of what they did right away. It forces them to think end to end, a quality that I find is often missing with engineers because they are being shielded by layers of management.<p>Finally, I work with remote developers a lot these days. Anything involving telcos or meetings is downright painful; especially if you add language and cultural barriers. Having full day scrum ceremonial crap is just not something I have a lot of patience for. Doing that over a hangouts meeting is just an exercise in futility.<p>Kanban of course does not stop you from having regular planning meetings, estimation sessions, retrospectives, etc. All that can still work and if it adds value to your team, by all means keep on doing that. IMHO it makes less sense in distributed teams and those require more asynchronous approaches. I find decoupling what we do from when we do it in a Kanban style to be helpful. If the backlog is getting too short, add more stuff and add it in the priority you want things fixed. Don&#x27;t allow your team to lose focus (aka. multi task) and set concrete goals. Have breakout meetings when things need clarification. Don&#x27;t pile on too much work in too much detail until it is ready to get done. Doing CD means you can specify changes in terms of what you have in production and how you want things changed. I find that injects a sense of reality that just stops a lot of BS. from ever happening."],"time":["2020-01-02 10:45:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hyfgfh"],"id":[21933470],"kids":{},"parent":[21927473],"text":["More 4 year to make Mickey Mouse public domain or the law extent the period again."],"time":["2020-01-02 07:46:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rgj"],"id":[21940430],"kids":[21942807,21940614,21942044,21940558,21946424],"parent":[21939161],"text":["My anecdote:<p>Around 1993 I had a Commodore Amiga with an A590 external hard drive.

At least if you call &quot;realistic conditions&quot;. Congestion control will introduce additional round trips, depending on your link parameters (bandwidth, latency, OS configuration like initcwnd etc.) and limit your bandwidth on the transport layer.

That is, once the cwnd is raised from usually 10 mss (~14,6kb for most OSes and setups), your OS will cache the value and re-use the larger cwnd as initcwnd when you open a new tcp socket to the same host. So if you do 100 benchmark runs, you will have one &quot;real&quot; run, and 99 will re-use the cwnd cache and produce non-realistic results.

Instead of doing this:<p><pre><code>    while connection.accept():\n        handle_connection()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nyou might do something like this:<p><pre><code>    connection_pool = []\n    while connection.accept():\n        connection_pool.append(handle_connection())\n        if len(connection_pool)&gt;=MAX_CONNECTIONS:\n            await wait_any(connection_pool)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd there you go.

It&#x27;s more code but it&#x27;s also defining exactly HOW to provide back pressure. Your specific use case might warrant providing back pressure not based on connection count but cpu usage or average response times.

In my opinion that should be an error. I can&#x27;t think of a single scenario where it&#x27;d be proper form to never await an awaitable. You might await immediately, sometime in the future, or at the end of the program. But you never don&#x27;t await at all.<p>Threading isn&#x27;t any easer, or harder.

Most of this provided speed and cache-ability is specifically gained by preprocessing all the data you will use in your map into tiles.<p>The general steps for turning raw data into Vector Tiles are:<p>1. Determine a hierarchy of your data. For example if you are talking about roads at some zoom levels you will want to see only highways or major roads while at other zoom levels you will want all your data.<p>2. For each tile at each zoom level; Select your data following your hierarchy rules, simplify your data based on your zoom level (for example you might need less points to display your road) and then clip your data to your tile and encode it to your Vector Tile.<p>The problem is that doing these steps is often very complex and requires thought about the cartography of your final resulting map, but it can also drastically effect performance. If you are dynamically serving tiles from PostGIS it is very hard to reduce large quantities of data quickly in some cases. For example take a very detailed coastline of a large lake that is very precise and you are wanting to serve this dynamically. If you are attempting to serve this data on demand each time you need a tile you have to simplify and clip a potentially massive polygon. While this might work for single requests, if you increase in scale this quickly adds lots of load to a PostGIS server. The only solution is to cache the resulting tiles for a longer period to limit load on your database or to preprocess all your data before serving.<p>Preprocessing of all the tiles is already something other tiling tools such as tippecanoe are really good at doing and comes with the benefit of helping you determine a hierarchy for your data. Preprocessing might seem excessive when it comes to making potentially millions of tiles, but in general it makes your application faster because it is simply serving an already created tile.<p>Therefore, if your data does not very change quickly I would almost always suggest using preprocessing over dynamic rendering of tiles. You might spend more effort maintaining something than you expect if you start using PostGIS to create tiles on demand over existing tiling tools."],"time":["2020-01-02 19:56:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jokoon"],"id":[21937599],"kids":[21937966,21937771,21938485,21937987,21938049,21937892],"parent":[21936825],"text":["I wish I could learn to build my own tiles, vector or PNG.

The company has more than doubled in size since I&#x27;ve been here, so I&#x27;m not exactly old-school but I have seen change.<p>When I started Google felt like one company.  I was blown away that I could look at any piece of code (besides Google X and parts of Android) and file a bug against any team when something didn&#x27;t work.

There is a lot more negativity, and a lot of it is justified (you&#x27;ve seen the news).<p>However I still love the people I work with directly and what we work on (Firebase, fwiw).  And one strange positive about how large the company has gotten is that I can just focus on that.  I no longer get too worked up about what&#x27;s going on over in far-flung teams and that&#x27;s fine with me.  And I don&#x27;t naively participate in company-wide forums expecting a good mood.
