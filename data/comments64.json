One piece of advice that I&#x27;ve learned from teaching people regex syntax is that it&#x27;s much easier to keep it to three basic topics at first (Repetition, Alternation, Concatenation), and then describe the rest of the stuff (character classes, character escapes, etc.) as &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; that makes those previous topics simpler, or provides more power. I usually introduce groups pretty early but most people get them notionally because they&#x27;re kind of like algebraic parentheses. And then I&#x27;ll expand on groups as well to show more power, escapes, etc.<p>For example,<p>(a|c|d|e|f|g|...|z) uses only notional groups and basic alternation while [abcdefghi...xyz] shows character classes, and [a-z] shows ranges - each step builds on the previous step and shows how to make them easier. For the learner this seems to act as building blocks rather than &quot;separate things that are kind of alike I need to learn&quot;<p>This is similar to how you can talk about repetition as<p>aaaaa, then aaaaaaaaaaaaa, then a<i>, then aa<\/i>, then a+, then a?, a{0,1}, a{0,5}, a{1,5}, a{,10}, etc. which simplifies, then generalizes the idea of repetition from a very natural concept build on concatenation to an opaque looking syntax that turns out to be both general and powerful<p>After that, most of the time I need to explain how capturing works, and how to turn it off and so on. Good tools help here and it starts to move away from a whiteboard exercise into something more active. But if students have followed you to this point it starts to make them feel very powerful as they&#x27;re suddenly parsing things apart and transforming them.<p>At the end I usually follow up with a big on anchors (^ and $) and other odds and ends (case insensitivity, global search, greedy and non-greedy, etc.) and usually turn people loose after that. I&#x27;ve rarely found people who actually need lookarounds and other advanced topics and those are usually covered one-on-one as they need.<p>But this is fairly minor quibbling and is just rearrangement of what&#x27;s here. I think this is overall a nice clear explanation. Regex syntax is honestly pretty simple once the syntax magic is explained.<p>What I think would be really helpful is a tool where somebody can type in a regex, have it checked for syntax and then generate the list of strings that would match it (within the constraints of limits on infinite repetition operators, like turning * to {0,2} or something."],"time":["2020-05-01 21:46:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["digitalmaster"],"id":[23044467],"kids":{},"parent":[23042079],"text":["Learned more in just the first few pages than I have in my many years of copy-pasting regex from StackOverflow.

If I knew what all those terms meant and the context with which they are meaningful, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be trying to read &#x27;RegEx for Regular Folk&#x27;.<p>&gt; Substrings which match the pattern are termed “matches”.<p>As above, but it&#x27;s also slightly confusing here that we&#x27;re defining matches and we haven&#x27;t even talked about what a pattern is yet. As such, I can&#x27;t even visualise or conceptualise what I would be matching or similar. If I press on regardless, this is just some unresolved debt that I will have to reconcile later or I will just get frustrated and put the book down.<p>&gt; A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.<p>Ah, good, we&#x27;re defining a pattern <i>after<\/i> we&#x27;ve already described a &#x27;match&#x27;.<p>&gt; Regex finds utility in:<p>&gt;input validation<p>And straight out the bat we&#x27;re hit with a term that is only going to be relevant for techie people.

For me the best explanation of regular expressions comes from Al Sweigart in &#x27;Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&#x27; [1]. He not only gives a pretty thorough explanation of pattern matching before bringing in any domain-specific terms, but he also motivates why you would want to pattern match in the first place. He gives context for circumstances under which you might reach for regex as a tool.<p>I&#x27;m looking through the later pages of this book and as a techperson I&#x27;m thinking &#x27;this is beautiful. I can see the examples clearly, there is a clear correlation between the visuals and the exercise.&#x27; I&#x27;m also thinking as a folk person &#x27;when the hell will I need a match?

Ameelio is a non-profit that&#x27;s building free technology to transform corrections and criminal justice. We&#x27;ve recently launched Letters, our first application that lets loved-ones of incarcerated individuals send physical mail for free. Currently, the situation is that two corporations own communication throughout the prisons and jails in the U.S (Global Tel Link and Securus). They charge ridiculous amounts of money just so that you can stay in contact with your loved-ones. We&#x27;re hoping to change that.<p>I actually discovered Ameelio last year through a Hacker News post (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21129557\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21129557<\/a>) that didn&#x27;t gain much attention. Zo, the founder, had reached out looking for support and contributors through a hiring post. When I read the post, I decided to look more into the project. My first thought was just &quot;Wow!&quot;. I really vibed with the concept because it&#x27;s something that hits really close to home.<p>I&#x27;ve had friends and family that were incarcerated before so I know exactly what it&#x27;s like dealing with the struggles that come from that experience. When someone is incarcerated, it&#x27;s not just a punishment for them. It&#x27;s an attack on their families, as well. In my experience, poverty is oftentimes a direct cause for incarceration. Mistakes are made and you get put into a situation, a system, that doesn&#x27;t value reformation, but instead looks to profit. To communicate with a loved-one on the inside means spending money that you don&#x27;t have. If your family is struggling financially, it means that you&#x27;re out of luck. This shouldn&#x27;t be the case.<p>I believe that a system focused on reformation would be much better for our society than a system based on profit. Why should a corporation be able to take control of communication between an incarcerated individual and their loved-ones meahwhile charging high prices knowing that it&#x27;s their only option? Why have we allowed that to happen? Being a part of this project is my way of stepping up and making sure we can deliver an alternative option for those families that are struggling.<p>I&#x27;ve received amazing support from this community before and thanks to you guys I&#x27;ve been able to focus my efforts on projects like this. Any and all feedback is welcome. If you&#x27;re interested in using our app then feel free to check it out.

There&#x27;s no theory about why this is better, it is just usually how it&#x27;s done and it seems to work when we can pull it off.<p>The bottom layers are your primitives and axioms. Simple building blocks. This is where designers want to create a most minimal and simple set of tools that can help facilitate unlimited complexity at the upper layers (Think a minimal set of language primitives that allow for Turing completeness)<p>The middle layers are your theorems. Different permutations and compositions of your axioms to implement things like business logic or whatever logic you want. This is where good designers should try to stuff as much complexity into as possible.<p>The Top and final layer is the interface. Something that is built to directly access the middle layer while providing an interface that is simple and more understandable from the perspective of a user. This is probably the least theoretical aspect of the stack as you have to factor in things like art and human psychology into how you build an interface.<p>A good example of this will be your phone. The primitives are assembly language instructions, RISC. The middle layer is all the code that facilitates programming and applications and the interface layer is the touch screen.<p>Note that you don&#x27;t have to look at it from a birds eye view from CPU instructions all the way to touch screen. You can zoom in and look at just a web stack: Java on the backend all the way up to react on the front end.<p>By zooming in you will see systems that violate the design principle I describe. Java as a primitive has become incredibly bloated and so has React and the javascript tool chain. There are several reasons for why this happens: Lack of planning, optimization requirements inevitably violate design principles, lack of knowledge, lack of central direction and more.<p>Either way, always remember that the ideal design that most people should strive for is complexity sandwiched by simplicity at the primitive layer and the interface layer.

I’m Cedric, a software engineer, mentor, ex-startup founder, and T-shaped person with years of experience working on software systems and product engineering. I sometimes organize study groups, contribute to open source, be part of the larger tech community, and mentor junior devs. I started as a full stack engineer after which I got into mobile dev and then moved to machine learning engineering. I did my fellowship at fast.ai during my mid-career switch in 2017. I have been on 1-year sabbatical learning new skills. I spent 14 months in educational retreat from 2019 to Feb 2020 — 7 months as an Entrepreneur-In-Residence (EIR) at Antler and the rest of the time in code retreat. I&#x27;ve written before about my 16 years career in tech: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cedricchee.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;career-and-code-retreat-retro-16-years-working-in-tech&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cedricchee.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;career-and-code-retreat-re...<\/a>.<p>In my last role, I created a medical diagnostics SaaS business for physicians. I build a deep learning application using PyTorch (CNN), Golang (APIs, services, gRPC), TypeScript&#x2F;React (frontend), Apache Beam&#x2F;Airflow (basic data processing), and many more.<p>I&#x27;m interested in doing more backend engineering in Golang. I&#x27;m also down for a new adventure with the right team. I just love learning. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cedricchee.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;hire-cedric-chee&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cedricchee.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;hire-cedric-chee&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 08:20:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["highlysyntropic"],"id":[23049258],"kids":{},"parent":[23042616],"text":["Remote OK<p>Location: Variable.

Until recently, the navigation for the docs is horrible, everything in one big HTML file, difficult to jump in from Google search result.<p>3. Rudimentary tooling for development phase. When you&#x27;re working on a new idea for a product, you will experiment A LOT with the schema and data. When you write wrong data, with most RDMBS you can use GUI to right-click and delete or edit. In Dgraph, you must write mutation query (assuming you remember the syntax, as it is a bespoke language). Dgraph GUI is very minimal.<p>4. About the mutation.. in Dgraph (as far as I know) there&#x27;s no referential integrity in the DB-sense. Like, you can make FK to non-existent object, or insert something invalid without returning error (but it&#x27;s not stored, since it&#x27;s invalid). The &quot;integrity check&quot; is in your app.<p>5. Because of #3 and #4, I find it easier to just drop the whole database and recreate it along with seed data, every. time.<p>6. The documentation for the Java client library is very minimal. So there you go, unfamiliarity with the query language (&quot;GraphQL+-&quot;), with the Dgraph itself, and with the client library.<p>I still use Dgraph, it&#x27;s a good fit for my app, but if you&#x27;re starting on a new business idea, maybe don&#x27;t use anything fancy. My mistake, being a developer, I mixed research (new tech!) and bootstrapping.<p>(In case you&#x27;re wondering, my app is <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;s.id&#x2F;axtiva-android-test\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;s.id&#x2F;axtiva-android-test<\/a> -- still version 0.0.x, but recently I&#x27;m releasing weekly)"],"time":["2020-05-01 21:33:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cube2222"],"id":[23045196],"kids":[23046139],"parent":[23031762],"text":["Haven&#x27;t used DGraph itself but I&#x27;ve used the storage engine they built for it - Badger, an alternative to RocksDB better optimized for SSD&#x27;s - in two projects.<p>One was for event saving and retrieval, which was able to sustain a stable 60k writes &#x2F;s with simultaneous 10k reads &#x2F;s.

Replacing HTTPS is a waste of time. Also, most of the benefits of the document format could be gotten with a sane subset of HTML. There are no mandatory bad parts to HTTP or HTML.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this &quot;The Web is too complex, we need Gopher&quot; sentiment on the Fediverse a few times and it looks like the same class of thinking as &quot;C++ &#x2F; Rust is too complex, we need C.&quot;<p>They are complaining about how _bad_ parties use HTTP and HTML and concluding that _good_ people should disavow HTTP and HTML as a result. It is like refusing to drive your pickup truck because someone else&#x27;s truck has truck nuts on it.<p>But I&#x27;ve run websites with the &quot;Motherfucking website&quot; HTML style and it&#x27;s fine.<p>All the complexity of the web is opt-in. Switching my site to Gemini wouldn&#x27;t prevent, say, the New York Times from wanting a complex HTML website. All I&#x27;m doing is shooting myself in the foot to spite my enemy. The FAQ says they intend to co-exist with the web, so I&#x27;m sure they agree with me on this. They just want to lead by example. I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good example.<p>About extensibility, from Section 2.1.2 in the FAQ:<p>&quot;Gemini is designed with an acute awareness that the modern web is a\nprivacy disaster, and that the internet is not a safe place for\nplaintext.  Things like browser fingerprinting and Etag-based\n&quot;supercookies&quot; are an important cautionary tale: user tracking can and\nwill be snuck in via the backdoor using protocol features which were\nnot designed to facilitate it.  Thus, protocol designers must not only\navoid designing in tracking features (which is easy), but also assume\nactive malicious intent and avoid designing anything which could be\nsubverted to provide effective tracking.  This concern manifests as a\ndeliberate non-extensibility in many parts of the Gemini protocol.&quot;<p>These claims are made:<p>- Privacy violations are inherent to HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS&#x2F;HTML\n- Making a protocol non-extensible is feasible<p>But if you&#x27;re specifying a completely new client and server, you could also just refuse to send and accept the ETag and cookie headers that are known to allow privacy violation.<p>And no protocol is non-extensible. They seem to think that software and ideas are controlled and owned by the first people to think of them. But if Gemini catches on, then it can be forked. This should be obvious to people working in FLOSS. I seem to recall it happened to IRC. Designed simple, forked into incompatible competing versions, the official next version is in dev hell, and now it&#x27;s also competing with XMPP and Matrix.<p>Perhaps that belief is why they chose to make a new spec instead of defining a subset of HTTP and HTML. They think that HTTP and HTML are atomic and we must not reuse any good ideas from them, they&#x27;ve been tainted with bad ideas, so we have to change everything all at once.<p>To this end they even made the status codes different from HTTP.<p>&quot;Importantly, the first digit of Gemini status\ncodes do not group codes into vague categories like &quot;client error&quot; and\n&quot;server error&quot; as per HTTP.  Instead, the first digit alone provides\nenough information for a client to determine how to handle the\nresponse.&quot;<p>They could have just specified a subset of HTTP status codes, to make it easier to remember which codes are which. Personally I like having 4xx and 5xx separate. Maybe they were really happy to save 33% of status code bytes compared to HTTP.<p>Regarding performance, the spec says, &quot;Connections are\nclosed at the end of a single transaction and cannot be reused.&quot;<p>I believe there&#x27;s also no inline media, so 1 document == 1 connection == 1 request.<p>Again, this is completely possible with a sane subset of HTML and HTTP - Just write a server that can&#x27;t reuse connections, and write HTML that doesn&#x27;t have inline media. Use a linter or transpiler (from text&#x2F;gemini to HTML) to enforce that.<p>But if you _do_ reuse connections, or use something like QUIC, then you can get better performance. So they are making that impossible. Again, until someone forks it and adds it anyway.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m the crazy one because there&#x27;s clearly a few people working on this project seriously, and I&#x27;m one person writing a rambling comment. But I don&#x27;t see the point.

Not sure I&#x27;ll continue playing with it, but from the spec I have a couple of suggestions you are free to implement or ignore.<p># Denial of Service<p>Permitting zero or more whitespace characters in a request a introduces a denial of service because the request is no longer bounded. Just keep sending whitespace to keep the connection open. Mandating a single character closes this particular hole.<p>It&#x27;s possibly a minor DoS considering other attack vectors, but why leave any low-hanging fruit?<p># Caching, ETags and Tracking<p>Caching is great, and I&#x27;m sure Gemini devs wouldn&#x27;t object to caching if it could be handled without introducing user-facing privacy issues. Here&#x27;s a sketch for an ad network protocol that I think would work with Gemini:<p>1. Client requests URL X.<p>2. Server replies with a redirect to &quot;X?tracking-id&quot;, where tracking-id is associated with a set of IP addresses.<p>3. All links in the document append the tracking-id to preserve it.<p>Anytime a client accesses a document in the ad network, the tracking-id quickly returns. People often have multiple IPs for their laptop, desktop, phone, tablet, etc. but there would be enough overlap in these sorts of requests to correctly tie a set of IPs to a unique client.<p>What cookies, etags, etc. permit on the WWW is doing this without requiring sharing the client IP database.<p>So maybe what we can do is still enjoy the benefits of caching while at least <i>detecting<\/i> when some shenanigans are at play. The ad network outline above is observable behaviour from which we might be able to infer shenanigans.<p>To reintroduce caching without amplifying the tracking powers, and add the ability for the client to verify the server&#x27;s ETag is legit, rather than treating it as an opaque identifier. If an etag for content specified the hash function used, then the client can verify the integrity of the document. So take the HTTP ETag header to a syntax like &quot;ETag(sha256): ...&quot;<p>Like the ad network outlined above, malicious servers could craft slightly different versions of a document for each IP and so generate unique ETags that may permit some sort of tracking in a similar way. However, the gemini document has no notion of hidden data (like comments and hidden fields in HTML), so any such shenanigans will always be visible in some way in the document itself, eg. embedding a unique hash code at the end, for instance.<p>So in the end, adding caching in this way should improve efficiency without appreciably amplifying tracking.<p># Transclusion<p>A language with a construct becomes more expressive if it also includes its dual. Gemini has document-level references, where a document points to another document, but it lacks transclusion which is a <i>dereferencing<\/i> operation, such that you can embed another document into the current document.<p>So links in Gemini are:<p><pre><code>    =&gt; gemini:&#x2F;&#x2F;some&#x2F;url\n<\/code><\/pre>\nTransclusion would be its inverse:<p><pre><code>    &lt;= gemini:&#x2F;&#x2F;some&#x2F;url\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis is pretty handy actually. Kinda like iframes without the headaches. However, unlike iframes, I don&#x27;t think the client should load the URL itself, but rather all communication should go via the server for the top-level document. This is again to avoid amplifying the tracking powers, since a top-level document server could append tracking-id to transcluded URLs and then they act just like tracking cookies."],"time":["2020-05-01 22:08:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23048296],"kids":{},"parent":[23042424],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-02 03:32:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["azinman2"],"id":[23045915],"kids":[23046664],"parent":[23042424],"text":["“ In\nthe same way that many people currently serve the same content via\ngopher and the web”<p>Is this actually true?"],"time":["2020-05-01 21:58:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aspenmayer"],"id":[23027483],"kids":[23040575,23041370],"parent":[23027482],"text":["‘One important trend to notice is how often Google Analytics, Google’s DoubleClick, Facebook, and Twitter are ingesting the user emails — these are organizations that should be receiving deletion requests en-masse and they should all have processes to handle this type of effort already (Facebook likely has this tech already based on conversations on this research and additional research from a private report from several years ago).‘<p>‘This type of email user data in a URL bar synced into Javascript pixels is most typically blocked by a regular person through “Ad blockers” or through browsers like Safari, Brave, and Firefox — those browsers use Javascript&#x2F;cookie blocking as a default features to protect users (each browser handles it slightly differently).

Not all dropshipping is from China or international in general because of the unpredictability and latency. It makes more sense to dropship from stable and predictable suppliers for products that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to create demand for. This article could have been written in 2005 and I think a lot of the reason why many of the people mentioned are expats selling to international markets is because ad rates in the US are generally too high to support this kind of business model in the US currently in 2020.<p>In the US the dropshippers I work with and am very familiar with use mainstream sources with predictable shipping times as do I when I dropship a selection of items very occasionally. The course sellers would generally not be selling courses if they could be scaling their business instead. Dropshipping is not generally a high margin business whereas course selling is. A scaled dropshipping business can make a lot of money but it is not a laid back type of operation really -- it&#x27;s labor intensive and generally requires some in house automation to make sure that your offers for products match the offers you have from your suppliers.<p>GRQ dropshipping seems exciting and sexy because you never have to take possession of the inventory and you don&#x27;t need to put a lot of cash up front if you get paid fast enough. Normal dropshipping is as boring as a wrench or a hammer. Also this article sort of conflates private label dropshipping with dropshipping more generally. They are really quite different things. The typical private labeler takes possession of products here in the US and probably does not dropship the bulk of their stuff just because customer expectations are pretty high for delivery speed and predictability. If you are sourcing from AliExpress or what have you, it&#x27;s just a lot easier to suck up the unpredictability as the seller and then to sell it to the final buyer with more predictable fulfillment without dropshipping."],"time":["2020-05-01 17:37:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["beh9540"],"id":[23042669],"kids":[23042832,23042809,23042862,23042764,23045060],"parent":[23041138],"text":["I have had two relatives get roped into this world - one ended with them forgetting they had to pay sales tax and owing massive amounts of money, to the tune of millions in back taxes, the other fizzled out pretty quickly.<p>The craziest part of it was they totally bought into the &quot;super secret&quot; nature of the whole thing.

For example, Moen (US market) plumbing fixture products seem to have excellent customer&#x2F;tech support, documentation and parts dispatch.

I worked on a very similar project for a small chunk of my life. I was a PM whose life was made a lot harder by not having a tool like this and when I joined a startup that had built a similar tool internally, I realized that it would be a great business. I want to provide some free (and unsolicited) advice:<p>Your number #1 challenge is going to be go to market strategy.  There are actually a number of companies that have tried to solve this problem and either outright failed or seemingly hit some bumps. YC funded a few of them: Release, FeaturePeek, Dockup. There&#x27;s also a company called Runnable that was acquihired by Mulesoft. Initially I was encouraged by the proliferation of companies in the space - we couldn&#x27;t all be wrong. In hindsight I should have realized that it wasn&#x27;t as rosy as I had thought since it doesn&#x27;t seem like these companies have had gangbusters success.<p>In my experience, there are roughly three types of pushback you&#x27;re going to get from potential customers:<p>1) We can build that better in a week. This one is very difficult to overcome because at the end of the day it&#x27;s not really about the truth of the statement, it&#x27;s more about the engineering skill of your prospect. Building this product is a  unique and interesting engineering challenge, and I haven&#x27;t met a DevOps person who wouldn&#x27;t be excited to try to build it themselves. I tried a lot of different approaches but have never successfully convinced someone it would be a lot easier, faster and more efficient to buy an already existing solution from us. Your mileage may of course vary.<p>2) Our setup is too custom to work with any generic tool. This one is probably pretty frustrating to hear since you folks have clearly put in a lot of effort to make it work with a variety of build configurations. The interesting thing here is that this reason can often then turn into (1). Our solution required people to containerize their app if it was not already and most people replied that if they were going to do the work to containerize their app, they would just do a bit more work and build this internally.<p>3) My database is too big&#x2F;too sensitive to work with this. Many startups have small databases that can easily be copied quickly. However, some have multihundred gigabyte ones that are too large to copy on demand. You either have to include that latency in the product which in my opinion makes it borderline useless, or figure out some way to work around it. You can use RDS snapshots but by our calculations those will be quite expensive. You can hope your customers have some test database (they don&#x27;t) or you can try writing back to their shared staging (or more realistically) their production database. None of these options are realistically very attractive.<p>All of that said, it&#x27;s clear you have some really cool technology here. One thing I&#x27;d suggest you&#x27;d look into is a related market: developer environments. Most companies I&#x27;ve worked at have software engineers putzing around for the few days&#x2F;weeks getting their dev environment set up. This is a very expensive waste of time IMO. If you could provision a cloud development environment on demand, that doesn&#x27;t require any scripts to set up or database migrations to run, that would be huge. The value of skipping that ~2 week setup time multiplied by the number of engineers a company hires really begins to add up. Just my 2c.<p>Happy to chat about this more if you&#x27;re interested. I don&#x27;t feel like sharing my contact info on HN but if you are determined enough I&#x27;m certain you can probably get in touch.

The rendering engine was very strong, and supported all sorts of features like area lighting, depth of field, motion blur, global illumination, caustics, volumetric lighting, etc. All of these were supported way back in the day before they became more common in other engines, and of course, using these features made your render times horrific back on early-2000s single-CPU machines.<p>The way a lot of us did modeling in POV-Ray was with a pencil and some graph paper.

Or at least, whether we&#x27;re fully considering the downsides of privacy as strongly as its benefits.<p>Privacy now lets us hide things that we didn&#x27;t want others to intrude upon.  That may be a good thing.  But I can also imagine that a byproduct of increasingly stronger privacy is that the social function of monitoring and group shaming of bad behavior is diminished.  You no longer are allowed to know what your neighbors are doing, or speak up because someone&#x27;s privacy might be violated.   People used to know what taxes their neighbors paid.  If you didn&#x27;t want to be gossipped about, you didn&#x27;t engage in certain behaviors.<p>It cuts both ways I think.  People now can report on things privately, yet increasing privacy itself enabled more bad behavior.<p>Privacy (and anonymity) allows people to get help that they previously felt ashamed to raise or report.  That may be a good thing.  But maybe it also lets smaller and smaller (more individual) concerns take the stage away from things that are bigger more pervasive but less attention-grabbing important issues.

Where desirable investments exist, excess capital is flooding in to capture limited supply and causing inflation <i>in the prices of those investments<\/i>. Without a return to high employment, injections into capital markets cannot and will not reach Main Street and restore demand. Where demand is primarily driven by Main Street and is relatively elastic, we are beginning to see deflation, e.g. in the CPI which saw 0.4% deflation in March alone.<p>Arguing that the dollar, as a single fiat currency, has a single value is slowly becoming an outdated concept. The dollar is increasingly valued by Main Street and decreasingly valued by Wall Street. Ordinarily, this would be bridged by arbitrage - by Wall Street purchasing deflated investments and by Main Street selling inflating assets. But Wall Street can&#x27;t capitalize on the low price of airline and retail stocks until governments permit those businesses to fully return to the market (whether they go bankrupt or not before that happens still being an open question, in spite of the Fed&#x27;s injections), and Wall Street is failing to capitalize on other deflated opportunities, most spectacularly the failure to seize the opportunity posed by the collapsing price of oil due to a lack of storage. Meanwhile, Main Street has no appreciating assets to sell - the most common of which used to be real estate, but the failure of housing policy to encourage affordable mortgages and home-ownership has caused more and more of Main Street to rent their housing instead.<p>So there&#x27;s real deflation that&#x27;s being masked by an assets bubble. What will burst the bubble? If the Fed is committed to infinite QE, then eventually, political intervention. Look for the following:<p>* Intervention in housing: price-controls in rent and mortgages, as they become increasingly inaffordable for a Main Street with no income.<p>* Intervention in medical care: expansion of Medicare and Medicaid, as the demand for healthcare grows among the unemployed who have lost access to employer-provided health insurance.<p>* Intervention in additional markets that cater mostly to Main Street demand - food, clothing, energy.<p>Already we see Trump intervening in meat production to force meat suppliers to stay open.

It&#x27;s easy to make something that performs the basic functionality.<p>I have spent basically every waking hour of the last month and a bit working on a ventilator for my employer (part of Ventilator Challenge UK - project recently suspended). Making something that delivers air in the right duty cycle for breathing is easy. There&#x27;s a few more things you want to do:<p>Blend O2 and Air (&quot;FiO2&quot;). Ventilators need to deliver Oxygen rich air to patients, but not usually 100%. Blenders are harder than you&#x27;d think to make. Note also that having pure O2 in your system means that there&#x27;s a load of stuff you have to get right to prevent fire.<p>Alarms. This is the big one. most of the implementation (even taking account the next feature), was about checks and associated alarms, for blockages, failures etc. Making sure that we beeped loudly if something looked wrong. Note that &#x27;not beeping&#x27; is a much WORSE failure than &#x27;not ventilating&#x27;. If something goes wrong (including complete hardware failure of the ventilator), as long as a healthcare practitioner is aware and responds, then there isn&#x27;t an issue. If the ventilator is happily ventilating away but something is obstructed then the patient might die (there are backup checks like pulse oximetry on the patient, but they&#x27;re slow).<p>Assisted breathing. Driving a solenoid on and off at a particular rate and duty cycle gets you &#x27;mandatory breathing&#x27;. That is great for keeping someone alive. If you&#x27;re not unconscious though, it is both incredibly unpleasant and doesn&#x27;t help you get weaned off and get better. What you want is a device capable of sensing attempted breaths and using the ventilation to &#x27;help&#x27; them. This feature isn&#x27;t 100% necessary - the early plans in the UK were for a massive shortage and for the simplest things we could get in a hurry.

That was then connected through a wireguard tunnel to my home dmz network. Which backed to a dual xeon v2 work station. The latency was very good under 20ms, and really good speeds. I&#x27;m lucky to have fios in my area.<p>The Xeon  workstation died, I then backed up to several think pads. Those were not performant either. So I got several HP t610 nodes, raspberry pi speed with sata 3. Rook took all CPU, and to boot they were running at 90c constantly. Even after re paste and with fan mods. I didn&#x27;t want five little space heaters next to my desk.<p>After all this I ditched the home setup. I had gotten parts for a local Epyc server after my xeon&#x27;s died. But sold them due the current situation.<p>In the end I had wanted to start a series of blogs on Kubernetes and micro service development.

I would really recommend a Ryzen 1600af (6c&#x2F;12t zen+ 65w), either asrock rack x470, or a basic b450. Both can take ECC, and should land a little node under 500ish or so. There are also SFF PCs Lenovo ThinkCentre M93, comes to mind. But at that price 90$ a node, I&#x27;d rather move up the stack a little bit.<p>If you&#x27;re waiting to buy local. DigitalOcean has been very well priced. If you want to learn the internals, grab a dedicated server and set up KVM, to get familiar with the internals. On the upper end you can get a new ryzen 3rd gen dedicated for 90$ a month. I look at it as a 90$ class I take once.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Kube is always right. But I avoided it for a long time, backing up to docker swarm. Now, I feel at a base it&#x27;s not much more complicated than docker swarm, now that I&#x27;ve done this deep dive.
