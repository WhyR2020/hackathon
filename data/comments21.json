If, for example, Russia ends up exploiting the marginalization of African Americans in order to sow domestic discord, as suggested in Thomas Rid’s New York Times op-ed (Rid, 2020), then the policy response should be twofold.

Tremendous work was done decades ago in both domains.  Put simply, you can only get so far with neural networks when your only option is an 8 bit microprocessor with 64k-bytes of RAM and a a megabyte or two of non-volatile storage.<p>One of the key differences between now and then is the monumental improvement in computing power, sensors, hardware in general and energy storage.  As a result the devices we produce today look far more impressive.

Using instruction counts to compare the performance of two entirely different programs (e.g. GCC vs clang) would be foolish, but it’s reasonable to use them to compare the performance of two almost-identical programs (e.g. rustc before PR #12345 and rustc after PR #12345). It’s rare for instruction count changes to not match wall time changes in that situation. If the parallel version of the rustc front-end ever becomes the default, it will be interesting to see if instruction counts continue to be effective in this manner.<p>This is a supremely surprising conclusion, especially in 2020. Is instruction count really still tied to wall clock count?

The tide is (or should be) a familiar feature to any British holiday maker. Many of our nicest beaches are completely submerged at high tide, such as Tenby. At low tide beaches are revealed allowing safe passage to islands which were cut off only hours before. Conversely, some beaches are nicer at high tide. The low tide at Weston-super-Mare leaves a mile of treacherous mud in place of the sea.<p>But these flats are the most fascinating of all. On first glance these areas can seem boring: vast stretches of mud, sand and saltmarshes with just a glimpse of sea right in the distance. But it&#x27;s treacherous and mysterious. Apart from the odd samphire picker, nobody comes out here. Twice a day the landscape is utterly transformed by the tide. And it happens so quickly.<p>I recently visited a favourite place of mine in The Wash. There are two artificial islands here that were built as a failed experiment to build a freshwater reservoir. The smaller of the two is accessible across the saltmarshes which are usually dry. The path used to be a causeway, but these days the whole marsh is above mean high water spring. The larger island can only be reached by crossing the perilous mud flats at very low tide. But it&#x27;s riddled with deep tidal channels and quicksand. Legend has it King John lost his treasure out here as his baggage carts were consumed by the rising tide.<p>On my recent visit I decided to go at a very high tide. The highest of the year. I expected it to be more fun as the island would be more like an island, but I didn&#x27;t expect the saltmarshes to be completely flooded (even though this is well known by locals, and now me). We decided to wade across anyway. The water was knee deep and I was carefully looking out for tidal inlets. As the tide was now receding, these inlets begin to flow outwards like a river, and with enough force to carry you with them. I felt confident enough only because I&#x27;d been here before. We reached the island now an hour after highest tide. Within another hour the sea recedes enough to reveal bizarre looking fingers of water formed by the never ending tide as it gently washes in and out like clockwork every 6 hours.<p>When you read tide tables for an unfamiliar area the numbers don&#x27;t really mean much, other than one is higher than the other. But think about it: a metre of water. That&#x27;s how much higher the tide was on that day. If you live in a flat area just imagine how much would be covered with an extra metre of water. It&#x27;s scary. But fascinating."],"time":["2020-09-08 12:42:47"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["tpmx"],"id":[24403261],"kids":{},"parent":[24390353],"text":["Are there proper warnings for this place in Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Microsoft map services?

Some choice quotes:<p>• &quot;Many people grasp and hold on to life, like those caught by a flash flood who grasp at weeds and brambles. Most are tossed about between the fear of death and the torments of life: they do not want to live but do not know how to die. Cast off your solicitude for life, then, and in doing so make life enjoyable for yourself. No good thing benefits us while we have it unless we are mentally prepared for the loss of it.&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Epicurus says &#x27;It is a fine thing to learn death thoroughly.&#x27;  Perhaps you think it is a waste of time to learn something you will need to use only once. But that is the very reason we ought to rehearse: if we cannot test whether we know it, we should be learning it always.&quot; — Seneca riffing on Epicurus (not to be confused with <i>Epictetus<\/i>, a Stoic; he even has a discourse titled &quot;Against Epicurus&quot;)<p>• &quot;As the water clock does not empty out its last drop only but also whatever dripped through it before, so our last hour of existence is not the only time we die but just the only time we finish dying. Death is not one event; the death that takes us is our last.&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Years are not given out by quota. There&#x27;s no way to know the point where death lies waiting for you, you must wait for death at every point.&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Let death be before your eyes every day, and you will never have a base thought or an excessive desire.&quot; — Marcus Aurelius<p>• &quot;The torment we feel comes about through our own agency, because we become alarmed when we believe that death is close at hand.  But isn&#x27;t it close to everyone, ready in place and every moment?&quot; — Seneca<p>• &quot;Think about arranging the present as best as you can, with serene mind.

Which is why, when starting from scratch as CTO at two companies, I set it as a top priority from day one.  In both instances, onboarding was optimized as much as possible.  In one company, we used Okta, and 90% of accounts needed to be productive (Git, Jira, Confluence, the HR system, etc) were auto-created prior to the start date.   We reduced, as much as possible, the need to manually create or request access to needed systems.  Instead, based on your job function, we already knew what you would need access to and automatically made those requisitions.  I realize this is easier to do when you are starting from scratch, but it demonstrates that it is feasible.  It’s simply a matter of will and valuing the importance of a smooth onboarding experience.  After all, you spent a ton of time and money finding this candidate - why not get them productive as fast as possible?<p>Setting up the development environment was also scripted.  We had scripts for setting up and installing the tools needed for frontend and backend development.  Common aliases and scripts were shared via a shared “dot files”.  In most cases, it was possible to checkout the relevant repos, run unit tests, commit code and deploy to production on the first or second day.  There is no reason one can’t have all you need ready to go on day one.  Certainly things get out of date as time passes, but the expectation of every new hire was to improve the documentation and fix any flaws.  This “onboarding as code” mentality also made it easier when an experienced engineer needed to set up a new laptop.  Documentation is like a garden - it needs to be constantly weeded and pruned.<p>Finally, there’s the matter of learning the tech stack, code base and current toolset.  Again, this needs to be a deliberate, well thought out experience rather than an ad-hoc, thrown into the deep-end of the pool, sink-or-swim challenge.  A manager needs to make it their top priority to figure out how to get new employees (or internal transfers) up to speed and confident as quickly as possible.  This requires special skills in writing good documentation and figuring out the various learning styles of engineers.<p>I agree - if you onboard, and struggle getting code to compile, can’t find the right documentation about how things work - then it sours your experience with the company.  In some cases it feels like onboarding is a struggle and it’s a badge of honor to have survived.

Any single one could easily be read hundreds of times over during the lifespan of a librarian. Therefore, the book’s gibberish nature did not come of its own accord but simply sprouted out of its relation to us and our lack of knowledge concerning the Library as a whole. In other words, for any book to make any sense to any librarian, it must have recognizable patterns, like those in language. And since every possible book that could exist did, most of them were simply random, nonsensical strings of characters. Leaving the librarians themselves to search for the language or sets of languages that could bring meaning to them (them:themselves or them:the books no one was sure). This was reflected — maybe the same sort of reflection Tanner was searching for — in the various languages the librarians did know and use; the ever-evolving nature of them, incorporating and condensing larger and larger swaths of ideas that then needed to be condensed even further into shorter acronyms for quicker reference.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@odell.brenden&#x2F;a-return-to-the-library-of-babel-cb8f479f6000\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@odell.brenden&#x2F;a-return-to-the-library-of...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-07 15:29:18"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["Animats"],"id":[24396607],"kids":[24397234],"parent":[24395822],"text":["Prediction and compression as a way to encode data cheaply is a reasonable idea.

The more that data is compressed, the harder it becomes to compress it further (Chaitin, 2006).

Compression is relevant inasmuch as our brains perform lossy compression to capture the relevant regularity in our sense data. But this is only the start of the analysis; it doesn&#x27;t explain anything useful about our cognitive architecture. The problem is strong compression trades space requirements for computational requirements. But going all-in on compression is optimizing for the wrong thing in the context of a bag-of-neurons computational model.<p>von Neumann architectures are good at fast and precise state transitions. A bag-of-neurons is good at leveraging relationships to minimize computational requirements. Thus a plausible cognitive architecture for the mind should emphasize relationships rather than computation. A good cognitive architecture is one where relationships in the data are maximally revealed by the architecture, thus minimizing the computational burden to access and utilize the relationship. This explains why the visual system takes up so much volume of the brain. 3-dimensional sense data is packed with interrelationships and these relationships need support from the cognitive architecture to be utilized. The compression view is only useful to a point--after that the constraints on the bag-of-neurons model become dominant and must drive the architecture search.<p>When it comes to phenomenal consciousness, the question then becomes: is there anything it is like to be a process whose topological structure maximally captures external and internal state relationships? My intuition tells me the answer is yes. One functional requirement of a human brain is that it `believes` it is the author of its decisions. To manifest this `belief` requires a self-representation of itself distinct from the environment, i.e. a target of the attribution of authorship.

Foreigners don&#x27;t always understand the dictatorships use a two-pronged approach, one part being heavy-handed violence and the other being heavy-handed propaganda. Like it or not, there&#x27;s always a percentage of the population that buys into the propaganda, either by being stupid or by being centrist.<p>The protesters are very intentionally being careful to not give any excuse. That&#x27;s why you see 70-year-old grandmothers walking in the streets wearing pure white, they want the evidence to be obvious when the police shove down and beat grandmother&#x27;s bloody. They also want it to be impossible for the state to spin them as violent criminals<p>In short, these people are brave as f<i><\/i>*<p>Many do suspect this will end in all out violence, but everyone knows that would give Russia an internationally acceptable excuse to join the party. The current thinking is Lukashenko may make a mistake (it is widely reported internally that he is on heavy medication and typically takes an entire month away from office following the election period, which has been impossible with the constant mass protests). His family has begun to leave the country, excluding his young son who he takes with him everywhere.<p>The people are being careful to say, at least for the time being, they do not want him dead, they only do not want him in the country. They&#x27;re trying to give him every opportunity to flee and leave them to repair their own country<p>If you want to help, the biggest thing you can do is continue to give them international recognition. Share it on social platforms. After the first wave of violence, the international outcry caused Lukashenko to order the police to temporarily stop the beatings. The protests have continues to grow, and the violence has started again (as we all know, dictators have a really small playbook of possible control tactics). International outrage is more effective than you might realize.<p>EDIT: For those unaware, IT has grown significantly in Belarus. It&#x27;s debated why this is the case (e.g. perhaps the dictatorship just does not know how to extract value from a company where seizing assets just leaves you with an empty shell of a previously valuable company), but regardless multiple Belarusians are entering the world stage with a reputation for being competent&#x2F;capable&#x2F;innovative with technology. It&#x27;s been a interesting emergence of a new skilled class. Right now, Lukashenko is squishing that with his actions. Shutting of the internet is one example. Another example is retaliation, such as what is being done to PandaDoc (a Silicon Valley-based company). Their founders are Belarusian. After a statement by the founders, the state retaliated by raiding their Minsk offices and arresting employees.

I&#x27;m going to give you the keys to the PHI kingdom, I need to know who&#x27;s soliciting me. Are you two twenty-somethings with amazing skills and ideas, or 20 ex-Epic employees looking to fill a particular gap you found? Without this general information I wouldn&#x27;t know what sort of project to think about including you in.<p>2. Where are you? I&#x27;m under contract with numerous health agencies that require data to be on US soil. I have no idea if you are in Romania or Virginia. (Side note, government is the biggest purchaser of health care and therefore your paths will cross at some point, even if it&#x27;s simply being downstream of federal or state data.)<p>3. How compliant are you? Your one page tells me nothing about your understanding of HIPAA, nor how you ensure the security and privacy of the data you will be exposed to. It may seem as if anyone in the space _should_ know about this and the reader can assume compliance, but frankly it&#x27;s not the case. Yell at me about your third-party audits, your ability to transact PHI, as well as any SOC&#x2F;FISMA compliance you have.<p>4. What have you done before? There are a lot of corners in the niche, and I&#x27;d need to know what systems you&#x27;ve worked with, what you&#x27;ve built and who for, so I can get an understanding of whether or not you&#x27;d be a good fit.<p>As for leads, with most conferences going virtual your usual approach of HIMSS is buggered, but Healthcare Datapalooza just put out a call for presentations so they&#x27;re likely looking for (virtual) sponsors already.

I have no expertise in healthcare technology, so maybe that&#x27;s the reason, but I could not understand what types of problems you are solving and what you are doing from your website.<p>1. For example, &#x27;Reimagining Healthcare&#x27; is an empty phrase. All your sentences seem vague to me: &quot;Comprehensive Healthcare Solutions and Integrations with FHIR, HL7 and SMART&quot;, are you consulting on how to create these solutions?  are you developing these solutions? are you selling a created solution? Are you integrating somebody&#x27;s else solution?<p>2. There is not a lot of connection to your company in your texts:\n&gt; Healthcare Data Interoperability and Analytics\n&gt; Standards like SMART and FHIR allow healthcare providers to store and share data in an interoperable manner which enables organizations to derive insights to provide effective care efficiently.<p>This is a good description of these standards and why they are important, but what is your connection here? If you are using these standards, then mention it directly. Maybe something like this is better:\n&gt; We use standards like SMART and FHIR to allow healthcare providers...\nAll other texts in Services section have the same problem.<p>3. I don&#x27;t understand the Solutions section. It looks like a collection of icons and slogans. Let&#x27;s take one example: Cloud. So I can guess that you are developing your solutions to be deployed on the cloud. But why make clients guess? Write it directly and mention why this is good. &quot;Our solutions are deployed on cloud. This is good because &lt;...&gt;.&quot;.<p>4. This is just a suggestion. I would add a section of Problems that you can solve. Client come to your sites with problems. So I would write: &quot;1. You have problem X? We can solve it by doing Y.&quot;<p>Overall, you have to think from the eyes of the client. What is the client looking for?<p>But again, I do not know anything about your field. I don&#x27;t know who your clients, what problems they have, and what technology you are building.

The main issue is you&#x27;re trying to sell something that customers don&#x27;t buy - any integration, FHIR or HL7 or something, is only ever needed to get one product to talk to another. Usually a new one to talk to the old one; and the business selling the new product is the one in whose interest it is to get the integration working.<p>While it&#x27;s always possible to take existing kit and do more&#x2F;better automation, this kind of operational improvement tends to have little to no budget unless there&#x27;s some specific project being undertaken (e.g. going to structured reporting). Generally, although people are often unhappy with internal software, the business will be operating as-is pretty comfortably. You&#x27;d need to deliver an awful lot of value to make it worthwhile paying you what you need.<p>I would probably look to better define your customer. You might have a better shout trying to approach ISVs who are selling new healthcare products, and asking them to use you as a delivery partner. Many ISVs have weak deployment teams and cannot deal with complex integrations, but they will be the ones with a customer and a contract.

What today would count as &quot;artisanal&#x2F;handmade&#x2F;organic&#x2F;bio&quot; mostly was the old normal, up until that time frame. (At least where I live, in Germany.)<p>I remember from my childhood (I am 51 now) that even then there was a difference in longevity between industrial supermarket bread, which wasn&#x27;t that common then, and bread from the bakery. My mother tried that supermarket stuff several times for financial reasons, and came to the conclusion it wasn&#x27;t worth it because of the waste, which the bread from the bakery didn&#x27;t cause. She even tried that freezing stuff, and toasting it in a pan, so that was common knowledge then, too. Didn&#x27;t really matter. Bakery bread lasted maybe 3 to 4 days in a bread box. Supermarket bread got stale after a few hours(bought in the morning, bad in the evening, mold after 2 days at the latest. Bakery bread didn&#x27;t.<p>Nowadays I have a factory outlet of an industrial bakery and  \ntwo artisanal bakeries in walking&#x2F;bicycling distance, so I can get that industrial stuff almost fresh from the conveyor belt, thereby eliminating any vagaries regarding transport.<p>It tastes and feels ok, but makes my nose run, sometimes even sneeze and phlegma in my upper throat.

He provided tons of context before he introduced that example, and it&#x27;s a real-world example from a language that nearly a billion humans speak. By choosing an example that is from a language that is foreign to most of his students - he&#x27;s helping his students understand that the actual concept he&#x27;s teaching is not just an english linguistic feature or a western-centric mannerism - it&#x27;s a communication pattern that occurs widely.<p>I feel bad for the future UCS students who will miss out on his class. I also wonder to what degree this decision will have a chilling effect on the content of other lecturers at UCS. Could history professors see this as a reason to exclude primary content that reflects the racist realities of the past? Or maybe music professors will reconsider whether they can teach the work of artists who might be cultural appropriation? It&#x27;s hard to say.<p>I hope that another university makes this professor a job offer - or at least speaks out in support of his teaching. This seems so bizarre that I can only reckon with it by imagining it&#x27;s a west-coast cultural phenomenon.

I&#x27;m probably going to be disappointed by this one, but I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic. Definitely the best 2020 news so far. HeXeN was one of most thrilling games of my childhood. It left a big impression on me. I even made a pretty creative balancing&#x2F;fun mod for HeXeN using the source port Vavoom. I lost the code in a hard drive crash though.<p>The game was far from perfect and there are good reasons it didn&#x27;t reach the popularity of DooM or even Heretic. What would you do to make HeXeN and HeXeN II more fun? Here&#x27;s my take:<p>1. Both HeXeN games suffered from unfun level design. It was nice looking, but confusing to navigate, especially switch hunting. You alternatively had adrenaline rushes and pixel hunting. I think both provide a different experience and doesn&#x27;t mesh better than Chess Boxing.<p>2. HeXeN classes don&#x27;t really have distinct playstyles. They&#x27;re all shooters at core except for Warrior&#x2F;Paladin. More could be done to diversify them. In particular, no late game weapon was meant for up close.<p>3. The game is too linear and not very modular in its level design. You can warp to any Heretic level and start slaughter from that point. It was a legacy of DooM design which was originally meant to play with limited lives, arcade-style.<p>4. HeXeN 1 was notorious for &quot;haha, you die!&quot; traps that required either foreknowledge or LIGHTNING reflexes to dodge.<p>5. Low enemy variety compared to DooM 2. You kept fighting the same few dudes over and over, and 4 weapon limit per class is... not a lot, even with Tome of Power.<p>6. They should limit the ability to hog inventory items, for example like in Heretic where you can only carry 1 of each to next level.<p>7. HeXeN never rewarded people for finding secret rooms. It punished those who didn&#x27;t find them, because instead of goodies they had switches and keys mandatory to progress. H1 and H2 had very few optional secret rooms."],"time":["2020-09-07 12:45:13"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["unixhero"],"id":[24398606],"kids":{},"parent":[24396463],"text":["2020 has been a great year in this regard;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1213210&#x2F;Command__Conquer_Remastered_Collection&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1213210&#x2F;Command__Conquer_...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-07 13:21:24"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["lostgame"],"id":[24396802],"kids":[24397109],"parent":[24396463],"text":["There seems to have been a renissance of this old school early &#x2F; mid 90&#x27;s FPS genre lately.

It&#x27;s fairly expensive here in the UK, usually 10-15% of the bicycle&#x27;s value annually and insurers typically only pay out when the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you&#x27;re on your own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you&#x27;re chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.”<p>None of that is true. I founded a UK bicycle insurer (not your usual one though).<p>Our price is locked in max at 10%  per year but it’s less if people claim less in our collective. On average people have been paying 6.5%.<p>We settle partial and full theft claims. Stolen handlebars are more common than stolen wheels.<p>It makes no sense to have customer prove to you as an insurer that the bike was properly locked beyond asking “was it locked to an immovable object?” and “did you own a lock of a certain standard at the time of theft?”. It’s almost impossible to prove and by that you could always reject a claim.<p>I haven’t heard of a specialist bicycle insurer which requires you to lock a bike inside all the time. Why would you buy theft insurance? A lock of certain rating is enough, depending on insurer between 24h-48h - after that you abandoned your bike in the eyes of many insurance contracts.<p>Last note.. of course this article focuses on theft but you’d also be covered for damage which can be the bigger risk depending on your use case (e.g road cycling or mountain biking)."],"time":["2020-09-07 23:19:23"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["II2II"],"id":[24403143],"kids":{},"parent":[24397852],"text":["I have had two bikes stolen, both of which fit into the &quot;bike shaped object&quot; category.
