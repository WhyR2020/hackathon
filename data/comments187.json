Unfortunately, this is precisely the medium (&quot;looking&quot;) through which many developers learn best.

So we start to emulate the &quot;look&quot; of clean code (example are everywhere!) instead of the intent. And you know what happens... a mess.<p>For those of us who have finally made it to the other side of the above process, clean code is more of a &quot;feeling&quot; than a &quot;look&quot;. Of course we can point to pain points in the code and explain why this or that might need to be refactored in order to be more &quot;clean&quot;, but our spidey-sense is our guiding light _not_ some internal catalog of &quot;unclean&quot; code snippets to avoid.<p>For me the most important part of writing clean code is making sure it can be understood (which means it can be changed).

I don&#x27;t know any fucking rule that wouldn&#x27;t allow me to do such a thing. I recognize eyes of a fanatic when I see them, so I&#x27;ve shut up.

Certainly not for consumption purposes; we avoid it for capital purposes.  We have a mortgage, but we saved and paid cash for the last car we bought; we might take a loan for a car... but even then we know the return we expect to get on the car would far out-weight the cost of the loan for the kind of car we&#x27;d entertain buying.  A loan for education?  Not unless a conservative expected rate of return justifies the debt: and I don&#x27;t mean over a lifetime... but more like a decade.<p>2) A follow on to 1... We will avoid savings&#x2F;investing (except for a very liquid, minimal emergency fund) if there is debt we can pay off early.  Retirement savings are an exception because of tax law considerations.  Our mortgage is low interest, and we might do better investing that money... but we might not and I know how much we save if we kill the mortgage early.<p>3) Don&#x27;t spend what you don&#x27;t have.  Do your damnedest to not spend what you do have.  Much of this goes back to 1.  Many people create a budget as a means to give themself permission for otherwise unregulated spending on consumption goods... they&#x27;ll budget a bit for savings and a bit for necessities... you know what&#x27;s fair and &quot;rational&quot;.  But everything else is fair game and their budget, if they keep it, removes the guilt of what to me would look like over-spending.  The default should be don&#x27;t spend and justify each purchase.  Yes, sometimes leisure is a worthwhile investment into yourself&#x2F;family: but think through those decisions and alternatives that achieve the goal of leisure, but not at the cost.<p>Aside from that we use off the shelf software for tracking; but tools really are a minor consideration compared to having a healthy attitude to money and spending.  We don&#x27;t produce budgets because our default thinking is healthy.

All require your family to work together and each member to grow in self-discipline. Here are tactics that worked well for my my family.<p>1. Learn to live below your means. This lets you build savings. The best tool here is a budget. Our family typically cooked at home, brought lunches to school or work, and bought staples on sale. Our kids had to choose activities that fit the budget.  If it wasn&#x27;t in the budget, we thought long and hard about buying it. If you need help, Dave Ramsey&#x27;s books are good place to start.<p>2. Your next priority should be pay off high interest debt as fast as you can. If you have long term student loans, pay them down as best you can and start to accumulate (by saving) a six month emergency fund in an FDIC insured bank. The large percentage of families in the US where a $500 unexpected bill is a major problem is way too high. The emergency fund gives you breathing room.<p>3. Once you have an emergency fund, you should make sure to start saving for retirement and college for skill upgrades or for children. Someone once wrote that compound interest was the 8th &quot;Wonder of the World&quot;. It is wonderful if we are talking about savings but is quite a taskmaster if we are talking about debt.<p>4. Become a self-directed learner. Invest time and focus in keeping your skills updated. Training budgets and travel to conferences were early casualties when my employer had major budget woes - that landed the company in bankruptcy. I paid my own way for critical training I could not get on-line. Some coworkers criticized me for this. I did what needed to be done. Those who didn&#x27;t stagnated...<p>I wish you well. This will not be fun at the beginning and there will be times in your life you have to put up with things you don&#x27;t like but can&#x27;t afford to fix now.

Capital One Money Market for Emergency Fund and Capital One Checking for checking.  M1 Finance for taxable and tax-advantaged market accounts.  Amazon Prime Credit Card (through Chase).<p>My approach started with Dave Ramsey, but has evolved a little based on &quot;I will teach you to be rich&quot; and some others.  In general, I see my finances as a funnel - income comes in and flows to fixed expenses, then to retirement savings and kids education, then to short term savings.<p>* Tell incoming money where to go, don&#x27;t live paycheck to paycheck.  Doing this better is probably an area I could improve.<p>* Ensure a 1000 emergency fund in a savings account if you have none already. This is &quot;lost my job&quot; money.<p>* Ensure income &gt; expenses. So much could be said about this, but it&#x27;s simple math in the end.  You won&#x27;t get ahead if expenses &gt; income. If this is not the case, focus first on income (ask for raise, look for second or better job, do side gigs), then on expenses (cut spending, get out of vehicle&#x2F;credit card debt).<p>* Periodically review spending and see how you can spend less or increase income.  I do much of my own car work (~3k this year) and work on some side gigs.<p>* Don&#x27;t go into debt except for house.  Pay credit card off each cycle.  It is there ONLY to get the 1-10% reduction in spending via cash-back rewards.  I don&#x27;t personally feel chasing reward cards is worth it, just pick one that does cash back with minimal fuss.  For us this was Amazon Prime&#x27;s chase card.<p>* Ensure 3-6 months expenses in an emergency fund (Capital One Money Market).  Example, if you average spending 3000&#x2F;mo, you need 9000-18000.  Now you have that long to look for a new job or float a huge emergency, etc.<p>* As long as that is maxed out, put as much as possible each month in tax-advantaged accounts.  Max out IRAs&#x2F;401ks&#x2F;education savings&#x2F;health savings&#x2F;etc.  Max out matched retirement accounts (401k, etc) first. Lest I sound rich, I&#x27;m not where I can do this every month yet.<p>* For IRA, use M1 because it&#x27;s fee-free.  Research a simple blend of ETFs in proportions relative to your risk profile.  If you have a while before retirement, something like %90 Stock (VT,VTI), 10% Bonds (BND)<p>* Save any remaining in taxable stock account at M1 for short term savings (car&#x2F;vacation&#x2F;large projects&#x2F;etc).

(that becomes more and more egregious given their changes).<p>We also live within our means which means managing future costs to the extent that we can&#x2F;could. We paid off student loans, cars,  and credit card debt. Then saved for a down payment and bought a house. We track 100% of the money coming in and the money going out and categorize it in as many ways as possible. This sounded pretty anal retentive to some friends of mine but they had to admit I knew exactly how much money I spent on food, mortgage, utilities, entertainment, etc each month. And that knowledge was usually enough to keep things from getting out of hand.<p>We targeted saving 10% of our income every year. Early on that was a more aspirational target, but by keeping our burn rate as constant as possible, with raises the target became achievable. We typically reserved 50% of any &quot;bonus&quot; or unexpected money for spending foolishly (well on things that aren&#x27;t normally budgeted) and saved the other half. Once our savings reached a point where we had enough for emergencies we bifurcated into savings for us and savings for the kids college.<p>Then we started getting stock options or employee purchasable stock from our companies and used that to start a brokerage account (today I&#x27;d probably just put it in e-trade or something and go long on the S&amp;P 500.) We were fortunate (really, its all about luck) to have chosen some good companies where the stock had some value. We diversified stock to fund the college fund.<p>We were always &quot;behind&quot; our peers in terms of new cars, or fancy vacations because we chose not to go into debt on such things once we could save up for them.<p>Looking back at it though it didn&#x27;t really matter what program we used, what mattered were three things:<p>1) Keeping the discipline to track every dollar. This avoids &quot;burn creep&quot; where you start spending more and more and don&#x27;t know it.<p>2) Always minimizing variability in costs (going from renting which was variable to a mortgage which was fixed, going from credit cards as cash flow (having a burn rate that is not always met by your cash flow means the occasional finance charge) to credit cards as payment device (once you have a reservoir of cash for overages you can always pay 100% of the balance every month)<p>3) Re-evaluating and adjusting costs every couple of years (new phone plan, swap out cable for satellite, sattelite for over the air, swap out ISP providers, magazine subscriptions, Insurance, etc. Any recurring cost from vendors in a competitive market has opportunities on about a 24 month schedule)<p>The only other thing is that we started pretty explicitly associating lifetime costs with bits of gear. (accounts call it depreciation) Basically saving $25 a month for &quot;phone instrument&quot; means that in 24 months you have a $600 to buy a new phone) Once you are keeping track of costs long enough and go through a replacement cycle or two you can get a pretty good feel for what things should cost)"],"time":["2020-02-11 19:59:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["turc1656"],"id":[22303583],"kids":{},"parent":[22300314],"text":["I have used Personal Capital to pull in all the transactions and classify them into expenditure groups (entertainment, meals, utilities, etc.).  Once you do it for a month or two, it pretty much knows what everything is (and knows a lot by default already).  Then you can see where all your money is going and determine if you are spending too much in any one area like meals or something else that&#x27;s discretionary and make changes.  If you have your bank accounts hooked up along with your credit and retirement accounts you can also see your monthly cash flow as well as your net worth.  You can also add your mortgage data to pull automatically like any other account.  Also can log anything else that doesn&#x27;t have an account which it can connect to and you can update manually to get the full picture.<p>For investments I&#x27;m restricted at work for compliance&#x2F;legal reasons so I&#x27;m limited to ETFs and similar products (no individual securities).  I&#x27;ve heard great things about Robinhood and would probably just use them or another no-commission broker (there are a bunch now).  The easiest way to get good returns is just use index fund products.  They have low fees usually and aren&#x27;t that risky.  You don&#x27;t way outperform the market unless you really just get lucky, but it&#x27;s very simple and easy to do.  Full disclosure - I work in this area of financial services, but it really is a far cheaper option than just about anything else.  Unless you have a stellar financial adviser (top 15%), they aren&#x27;t usually going to be able to justify their fees over the long haul.<p>I pay my credit card multiple times a week so that I never pay interest and never get tempted to do anything foolish.  Every day on the way to work I log on and pay whatever has posted that morning.  My card has 2% cash back on everything, no limits (Citi DoubleCash), so it&#x27;s very simple and straightforward.<p>I contribute enough to max out the legal 401k contributions allowed by law.  If you can afford that, you should definitely do it.  At the very least, get the employer match if you have one.<p>I have free accounts with Credit.com and Credit Karma.  Log in periodically when they update to see where it has moved and why.  They give recommendations - sometimes they are silly or not-realistic.  But at least you can see what&#x27;s going on and monitor for free.<p>Your credit card also probably has an identity protection tool - highly recommend this as it is part of good personal finance.  Register all your known accounts, IDs, etc. so that you can get alerts if that data is being traded on the black market.<p>As far as additional savings, it&#x27;s a roller coaster because every time I up the checking account over a series of months some large expenditure is needed (home repair&#x2F;improvement, car, medical, something).  But I try to mentally have a bottom in my head that I don&#x27;t want to see the account go under and if it does, I try to cut back on extraneous things until it goes up by a fair amount.  Over time, I raise that bottom.  That allows for some growth in additional savings without having to be micromanaging a budget.<p>I always buy used, cheap cars.  Neither my wife or I are car people.  We don&#x27;t care.  Just an A to B type of thing.  Highly recommend that.  Pay X up front out of pocket every 5-10 years and then only around $1,200 a year in maintenance.

When people believe a certain way or lack confidence, they continually sabotage themselves with every choice and missed opportunity in live.<p>On the flip-side, continued wealth is never assured: people can convince themselves they are invincible, have infinite money and&#x2F;or otherwise sabotage their cash cows like pissing-off their customers."],"time":["2020-02-12 05:31:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thsealienbstrds"],"id":[22300335],"kids":{},"parent":[22299575],"text":["It seems to me that the amount of politics discussed on a platform is related to how popular that platform is.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s difficult as much as it just requires some explicit effort and habits. For example:<p>- We have video standups over Zoom and ask people to turn on video as often as possible. This helps a ton IMO. It&#x27;s tempting to just do async Slack standups (and we do on occasion) but it shouldn&#x27;t be the norm.<p>- Our broader group uses Tinypulse to send out weekly questions. Answers are anonymous. If the questions are good (ours are), you&#x27;ll gain a lot of insight into how your team is feeling. I might learn, for example, that I&#x27;m not spending enough time with ICs discussing their career path or that people overall are pretty happy.<p>- Weekly one-on-one&#x27;s with my team. Again, over Zoom with video on. This is the best way I connect with my team and get at their emotional state.<p>- Code reviews. We do them traditionally in GitHub (every PR requires 2 approvals) but we also have synchronous code review sessions 3x&#x2F;week in Zoom. These are just 90min blocks on the calendar and attendance is optional. During these sessions, anyone can present a PR, walk us through the code and demonstrate the feature. We don&#x27;t do pair programming but I think this approach is even more valuable. It has increased our velocity, reduced bus factor, and provided another form of &quot;connection&quot; for our team.<p>- Every quarter we either do a team visit to the office or an offsite for our broader group.<p><i>&gt; In my team, we&#x27;re doing a &quot;check-in&#x2F;out&quot; inside each meeting where we take turns by answering &quot;With what emotion you&#x27;re entering&#x2F;exiting this meeting?&quot;.<\/i><p>To echo what others have said, this feels like a weird thing to do in a meeting.

Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>162 page PDF [last updated: February|4|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

They had no intention of actually releasing Android at the time, and it wasn&#x27;t close to being ready for release anyway.  Apple then released iPhone and beat Google to the punch, and I remember us all thinking &quot;oh shit this is WAY better than the janky, blackberry-esque prototypes we have in development&quot;[1].  So everyone at Google scrambled to get something out the door in response, and the compromise was the HTC G1&#x2F;Dream on the cheapest carrier at the time (T-mobile).

The basic ideas of how to get language models working are just about in place. Transformer networks, and recent innovations like GPT-2, googles reformer model, etc are precursors to the real machine learning boom. Machine learning as we have known it, has been stuck as an optimization tool, and used for computer vision here and there. NLP, and with it, the ability to create, synthesize, and understand content, will change the internet.<p>More than that, I think NLP will unlock new ways of interacting with computers. Computers will be able to handle the ambiguity of human language, transcending their rigid “only do exactly what you tell them” models of the world.<p>Edit:<p>Adding this to give more technical context. I think most people don’t know where the line is currently between what possible, and what’s not, but also what we are on the cusp of. And we are on the cusp of a lot.<p>A quick explanation of one area is here:<p>Basically, transformer models are the best for NLP. They use something called attention based mechanisms, which allows the model to draw correlations between pieces of text&#x2F;tokens that are far apart. The issue is that this is an O(n^2) operation. So the model is bounded by the context window, which is currently mostly at 512 tokens, and is thus, bounded in how much it can understand.\nRecent innovations, and further study, will broaden the context window, and thus unlock better reading comprehension and context understanding.\nFor instance, the ability to answer a question using a piece of text is mostly stuck at just finding one paragraph. The future will see models that can find multiple different paragraphs, understand how they relate, pull the relevant information, and synthesize it. This sounds like a minor step forwards, but its important.\nThis will unlock better conversational abilities, but also, better ways to understand how different pieces of textual information relate. The scattershot of information across the internet can go away. Computers can better understand context to act on human intention through language, unlocking the ability to handle ambiguity. This will change the internet.<p>Again to empathize, these models only started showing up in 2017!

Dozens of different random products around the warehouse end up with a secondary, identical barcode associated with them.<p>3) Someone orders boxes. Inventory system probably automatically sends pickers to the closest source of SKU 12345, of which there are - unusually - many scattered around the warehouse.

For example, when I came to hash tables while studying data structures, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how the hashing functions did their magic. Every book or online lecture I came across showed how to use a generic hashing function and moved on to dealing with hash conflicts. I couldn&#x27;t move on because I kept coming back to questions like &quot;ok, but why this hashing function? If I change my data a little bit, is this still the right hashing function to use? How can I tell?&quot;<p>Somehow, people who had formal education managed to sail past these questions. I suspect that having someone to answer these questions when they came up played a crucial role in them understanding the material.<p>My point is, some of these materials are almost deliberately designed to be consumed with an instructor who can answer questions. Especially for the difficult courses.<p>In the end, when I was teaching myself the basics, I had to go hardcore and pick up TAOCP to keep up. TAOCP has a reputation for being a very dense reference book and being unsuitable for self study - but I found the opposite to be true. Prof. Knuth painstakingly covers every minor detail leaving nothing unaddressed. (His treatment on hash tables has several pages on hashing functions that gave me a clear understanding of how things work). I would recommend following that path if you are trying to study the basics without formal instruction. It&#x27;s a little harder, but you are more likely to end up successfully digesting the fundamentals and move on to more advanced topics.<p>Today, I have fully rod myself of insecurities, and I have developed a habit of going to the most comprehensive treatment of a topic if I&#x27;m trying to teach myself something difficult.

As a bonus, check out Daniel Jackson&#x27;s approach to software design in ocw&#x27;s 6.005 from 2008, and how he explains three approaches to software design (state machines, functional and relational&#x2F;OO). The best and most systematic explanation that I know of how to properly use the much maligned Design Patterns, and a very useful in practice design technique called JSP (although the course is in Java, all the design techniques are universal, this JSP stands for &quot;Jackson Structured Programming&quot;).<p><i>Computer Architecture<\/i>: the MIT combo <i>&quot;Computation Structures&quot;<\/i> (on edx) and <i>&quot;Computer System Engineering&quot;<\/i> (on ocw and youtube) will teach you systems design all the way from atoms to the whole internet.

One is an area less prone to economic recessions, with higher wage equality and a more egalitarian and humanistic approach to business. On the negative side though there is an insidious xenophobia that permeates the area. Essentially a lot of the ads they run (for example for their supermarket brand Eroski) do so on a platform of &quot;its better because its basque&quot;.

BUT - this form of acquihire transfers wealth to the talent not directly to their bank account, but by giving them ownership in the company.  That&#x27;s a powerful retention tool, and if for some reason they can&#x27;t make it work, the talent is sure to remember that Cards gave them a chance to save the company and turn it around through their investment and subsequent transfer of ownership. Moving acquired talent to ownership positions is a powerful play.”<\/i><p>This is what capitalists had to say about a move to socialism in this case.<p>I would argue that socialist institutions (much different than state-capitalism or its near-synonym: state-socialism) are preferred to capitalist ones, in the marketplace.<p>People form lines around the block stretching for years to get into the Mitchell Lama housing cooperatives in NYC. They have far lower costs than landlord-owned buildings, and yet the same level of facilities or better. They are effectively nonprofits, because they are run by and for the cooperators. Few vacancies because many people don’t want to leave, unlike the high turnover and 12%+ vacancy rate in privately owned buildings. I suspect credit unions vs banks are similar.<p>Workers in a company would not vote to ship their own jobs overseas or do massive layoffs.<p>So do I advocate libertarian socialism? Yes. I want to see more institutions be democratically governed, like many universities are close to it, etc.<p>Note: SOCIALISM is different than SOCIAL DEMOCRACY which is typically done on a city or state level to tax capitalist organizations and give public services and universal safety nets to everyone.<p>However, socialism isn’t a panacea. Newcomers are still hazed and treated just like countries treat peniless immigrants. So we need social democracy too. Perhaps one day social democracy will take place on a global level.

Then it does the same optimizer computation for all parameters on each GPU. That&#x27;s OK for vanilla SGD because vanilla SGD has no optimizer state variable. But for Adam, the naive approach has to store a copy of full set of Adam m&#x2F;v storage on each GPU, which is super memory consuming. Actually, after the 1st phase of All-Reduce each GPU has its subset of gradients. Each GPU can do Adam SGD for that subset, and importantly, it just need to keep m&#x2F;v corresponding to that subset of gradients. After the Adam optimizer completes, the 2nd phase of Ring-AllReduce will scatter the updated parameters to all GPUs. Therefore, that&#x27;s memory saving and computation saving. (The naive approach is more general as it allows optimizers to use optimizer variables of different network layers. But most optimizers, like Adam, don&#x27;t really need that capability.

Making even a moderately successful, let alone category-defining product is <i>super hard<\/i> and it&#x27;s nowhere near enough to just have an idea, whether represented on a napkin, or in a demo video, or even in a tangible prototype. Ideas are cheap, even ideas that are rather prescient.<p>Making successful products also requires TIMING, LEVERAGE, and EXECUTION.<p>TIMING - build something too early and you waste capital fighting uphill against a market not ready for the idea. Product-market fit is not always possible for any given idea at the current moment in time. For tech, things like battery density, speed, screen tech, internet bandwidth, cost etc are critical to time correctly.<p>Example: Youtube and Netflix appropriately timed the cost of storage and internet bandwidth so they were ready to go when streaming was just becoming cost-effective, versus earlier efforts like Broadcast.com. It wasn&#x27;t a leap to conclude video streaming was a good idea even in the 80s or 90s, but it needed to be timed.<p>Additionally, timing things <i>culturally<\/i> matters a ton. People need to be ready for an idea, to incorporate a new product into their life. The window of what&#x27;s cool or acceptable is a moving target, what&#x27;s uncool now may be cool in 5 years. It&#x27;s often other interim products that shift this window.<p>Example: Google&#x27;s launch of consumer-focused Google Glass and the immediate blowback that resulted.<p>Finally, pioneers get arrows in their backs. You reveal your grand ideas too early and you&#x27;ve just paid for a ton of concept development R&amp;D that others can just pick off for free.<p>LEVERAGE - Ideas require business leverage to succeed in market. Things like brand leverage where you&#x27;re already trusted in the market and have a history of delivering quality, the ability to scale manufacturing to meet demand, business relationships and scale to get access to special components or lower component costs, a well-oiled organization with deep talent bench, etc.<p>Example: The iPhone would not have been what it is without the iPod. Apple leveraged its talent, its history of manufacturing iPods, its suppliers, and its huge consumer appeal. It also used that to negotiate with AT&amp;T to have complete control of the UX and to get unlimited data plans.<p>EXECUTION - Lots of high-concept ideas are lousy at the exact details and execution of the idea. Cool, you can send a fax from the beach, but under what conditions? Is fax even the right modality? Is the UX cumbersome, or require a laborious setup process? Its often the little things that separate market defining products from abject failures, even when they check the same boxes.<p>Example: Galaxy Fold is great high concept product that doesn&#x27;t execute on its promise because its too fragile and creates a screen crease.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to do a great job on details, but within the wrong constraints. You can be efficient (doing things right) but still not be effective (doing the right things). Specifically in the case of this &#x27;iPad of the 90s&#x27;, they didn&#x27;t have the enabling technologies to make a great experience - things like fast refresh rates, multi-touch, beautiful screen, etc. They probably did a fantastic job with the pen, but the pen was the wrong constraint.<p>Basically the creators are severely downplaying the timing, leverage, and execution required to make products successful, and seem to think this cool but barely-launched concept could have been the most successful product on earth (iPhone). I doubt the team would have been able to produce anything more than a PalmPilot or Treo, both of which were OK products for their time, but ultimately are just mostly forgotten preludes to the product that DID define the category."],"time":["2020-02-10 23:53:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["csours"],"id":[22292499],"kids":[22293799],"parent":[22292122],"text":["I wonder if the name is related to Captain EO[0]?
