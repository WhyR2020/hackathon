Unfortunately, this one leaves a lot out.<p>* The ECMA-35&#x2F;ECMA-48 escape sequence and control sequence processing is wrong.  It is a common error made by people who have read escape sequence lists, but the actual way to process output to a terminal involves a proper state machine, which handles <i>all<\/i> sequences, even unknown private ones.  ECMA-35 and ECMA-48 define ranges of Intermediate, Parameter, and Final characters.  One needs to handle the succession of such characters fully, otherwise one ends up like Konsole, which breaks when given some control sequences, erroneously displaying part of the control sequence as text.<p>* In that same vein, the actual code for CSI is U+009B.  The ESC plus open square bracket sequence is a 7-bit alias, from when the world was not 8-bit clean.  That 7-bit world hasn&#x27;t been the case since the late 1970s.  There is a whole range of control characters from U+0080 to U+009F.<p>* Continuing in that vein, the correct terminator for OSC is ST, U+009C.  There are moreover rules about ESC, CAN, SUB, CSI, OSC, PM, DSC, and so forth occurring partway through control sequences.<p>* Even more: The actual code for Reverse Index is U+008D.  The ESC plus M sequence is but another 7-bit alias.  For best results, translate the <i>entire<\/i> set of 7-bit aliases into the actual C1 control characters and handle them in their true 8-bit clean forms.  It&#x27;s a simple addition calcuation.  It&#x27;s silly that people write terminal emulators in the 21st century that are decades past the years of not being 8-bit clean, and that handle Unicode, that nonetheless still recognise only the 7-bit alias forms of escape and control sequences as if we still live in a 7-bit world.<p>* Just don&#x27;t work from the console_codes manual page for Linux.  At all.  That documents an idiosyncratic, very limited, and in some famous places <i>downright wrong<\/i> terminal emulator.  I set out explicitly to provide the feature set of that terminal emulator.  <i>You<\/i> should not have to.  Use ECMA-48, ECMA-35, and ITU T.416.<p>* Several years ago people started coming around to the reality that SGR 38 and SGR 48 were supposed to take colon-separated <i>sub<\/i>parameters, not semicolon-separated parameters.  The world has been gradually rectifying an almost 30-year-old error.  The correct source of information is ITU T.416, <i>not Wikipedia<\/i>.<p>* On the positive side, note that this terminal emulator does not have zero meaning default.  Zero means zero.  This is a good thing.  Zero meaning default went away entirely in 1991, and was superseded in 1986.  But note that various test programs haven&#x27;t progressed past 1976.  Particularly, note that several of the tests in vttest will fail when zero means zero.  (I myself just implemented Mode 22 for getting vttest to work, even though technically Mode 22 has been deprecated since 1991.)<p>* Although many modern terminal emulators agree on not providing blink any more, the <i>reason for<\/i> not supporting blink (wasted battery power continually blinking parts of a framebuffer) does not apply to something that renders onto an outer terminal rather than onto a GUI.  Let the outer terminal emulator make this decision.<p>* A lack of reverse video is a shame, and there isn&#x27;t a reason for not having it represented internally at least.  However, it is non-trivial to pass through.  Only Konsole really gets it right, and some terminal emulators get it profoundly wrong.  Interix cannot turn only it off, (U)RXVT decides to do something completely other than reverse video sometimes, and PuTTY erases using the wrong colour when reverse video is on.<p>* In that vein, note that several terminal emulators support subparameters to SGR 4 nowadays, giving different underline styles, including curly (SGR 4:3) and dotted (SGR 4:4) amongst others.  Mine does, as does kitty (not KiTTY).  The Windows Terminal people have it on their to-do list.<p>* You&#x27;ll find that there are still outer terminals that do not support SGR 38:5&#x2F;SGR 48:5 and there are still outer terminals that do not support SGR 38:2&#x2F;SGR 48:2.  One actually has to translate colour systems.<p>* &quot;hard refresh&quot; misses out a lot that a full-screen TUI program needs to do, from unsetting origin mode and margins, through resetting the cursor shape, to turning off automatic right margin and erase colour mode.<p>* People <i>will<\/i> complain about lack of DECSCUSR support.  VIM, NeoVIM, and others do make use of it, including several XTerm extensions to it.  And this <i>will<\/i> highlight the aforementioned deficiciencies in the control&#x2F;escape sequence processing model.  DECSCUSR is a CSI-begun control sequence with U+0020 as an intermediate character and U+0071 as the final character.<p>* People will complain about lack of scrolling region support, too.  Full-screen TUI applications that present windows&#x2F;panes redraw scrolls significantly less efficiently without it.<p>* Not handling ISO 2022 graphic sets is actually a feature, nowadays.  It&#x27;s a feature of Mosh (q.v.).  But again the partial escape sequence processing won&#x27;t handle this properly.  There are several Intermediate characters involved in the G0&#x2F;G1&#x2F;G2&#x2F;G3 designation escape sequences, not solely U+0028.  The state machine for decoding them needs to correctly decode all of the Intermediate, Parameter, and Final characters of such a sequence, too.<p>* Unfortunately, for full keyboard support -- particularly for (U)RXVT, the SCO Console (and derivatives), and Interix as the outer terminal -- one has to add non-standard extensions to ECMA-48.  Handling function keys sent from URXVT is particularly egregious.  (I myself actually use a patched URXVT, to remedy a couple of its more extreme problems, including a hardwired assumption of 10 function keys.)<p>* You really don&#x27;t want to ask the outer terminal for anything other than the new ECMA-48-conformant mouse reports (DEC Private Mode 1006) or the old DEC Locator reports.  The other report styles (1005 and 1015) have significant problems.  Vanilla URXVT is deficient in this regard, unfortunately.<p>* It&#x27;s actually ECMA-48 in <i>both<\/i> directions, outer terminal <i>input<\/i> in addition to outer terminal <i>output<\/i>.  DECFNK et al are valid ECMA-48 control sequences, with parameters and a final character.  It is a very common error to mishandle them with pattern matching and fixed buffer offsets, but it is an error nonetheless.  It&#x27;s an error that becomes very apparent whey trying to implement modifier recognition.  Learn from the pain that users  have configuring the recognition of modifiers in pattern-matching systems like GNU Readline, editline, or ZLE.  Make it parse ECMA-48 properly, so that parameter recognition in input control sequences <i>just works<\/i>.<p>* Deferred wrap should be cancelled by cursor motions.<p>* Tab stops are set by CTC and HTS.  They should not be fixed at every 8 columns.<p>* Passing the TERM environment variable straight through, whilst otherwise ignoring it, is going to cause no end of problems."],"time":["2020-04-12 12:19:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kentt"],"id":[22851019],"kids":[22851179],"parent":[22843705],"text":["Is this mostly for using w&#x2F;o i3?

It happens that recently I became involved in writing a book on Digital Filters [8] when I knew very little about the topic. As a result I early asked the question, &quot;Why should I do all the analysis in terms of Fourier integrals? Why are they the natural tools for the problem?&quot; I soon found out, as many of you already know, that the eigenfunctions of translation are the complex exponentials. If you want time invariance, and certainly physicists and engineers do (so that an experiment done today or tomorrow will give the same results), then you are led to these functions. Similarly, if you believe in linearity then they are again the eigenfunctions. In quantum mechanics the quantum states are absolutely additive; they are not just a convenient linear approximation. Thus the trigonometric functions are the eigenfunctions one needs in both digital filter theory and quantum mechanics, to name but two places.<p>&quot;Now when you use these eigenfunctions you are naturally led to representing various functions, first as a countable number and then as a non-countable number of them—namely, the Fourier series and the Fourier integral. Well, it is a theorem in the theory of Fourier integrals that the variability of the function multiplied by the variability of its transform exceeds a fixed constant, in one notation l&#x2F;2<U+220F>. This says to me that in any linear, time invariant system you must find an uncertainty principle. The size of Planck&#x27;s constant is a matter of the detailed identification of the variables with integrals, but the inequality must occur.<p>&quot;As another example of what has often been thought to be a physical discovery but which turns out to have been put in there by ourselves, I turn to the well-known fact that the distribution of physical constants is not uniform; rather the probability of a random physical constant having a leading digit of 1, 2, or 3 is approximately 60%, and of course the leading digits of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 occur in total only about 40% of the time. This distribution applies to many types of numbers, including the distribution of the coefficients of a power series having only one singularity on the circle of convergence. A close examination of this phenomenon shows that it is mainly an artifact of the way we use numbers.<p>&quot;Having given four widely different examples of nontrivial situations where it turns out that the original phenomenon arises from the mathematical tools we use and not from the real world, I am ready to strongly suggest that a lot of what we see comes from the glasses we put on. Of course this goes against much of what you have been taught, but consider the arguments carefully. You can say that it was the experiment that forced the model on us, but I suggest that the more you think about the four examples the more uncomfortable you are apt to become. They are not arbitrary theories that I have selected, but ones which are central to physics.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inters.org&#x2F;Hamming-Unreasonable-Effectiveness-Mathematics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inters.org&#x2F;Hamming-Unreasonable-Effectiveness-Mathema...<\/a><p>I don&#x27;t know any QM, but it does not surprise me in the least that, trying to calculate something about rotation, you end up with a formula for Pi. Is it there because of a connection to how the world works, or is it there because we happened to ask a question where two effects of the real world canceled each other out and all that remains is something about math? Sure, &quot;no circles were involved&quot;, but rotation was involved, and it is just as Pi-heavy a model as anything involving circles. Also, QM is full of integrals of sines, for reasons explained in the quote above, which introduce a bunch of Pi scaling factors that have nothing to do with reality and everything to do with the tools we chose to model it with, etc&#x27;.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying that the universe doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of Pi factors in its machinery, just that this specific case doesn&#x27;t sound like one of them, and that the distinction is interesting and mind blowing, to me at least)."],"time":["2020-04-13 01:06:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tobrien6"],"id":[22855887],"kids":{},"parent":[22844196],"text":["This is from 2015 FYI.

You’re “not authenticated” at that point, so 401 it is.<p>But it really seems like auth processing should have its own “off ramp” in the HTTP request-processing lifecycle—i.e. if you ask for auth, and auth fails, you get a code and the request isn’t processed any further, so it doesn’t matter that the request you made is auth-required.<p>(After all, we mentally model HTTP resources, fundamentally, as URLs; and URLs put the auth stuff in the <i>origin<\/i> part, not in the <i>request sent to the origin<\/i> part. I would naively expect that an auth failure would resolve at the same stage as an unrecognized Host name!)<p>When you’re coding an HTTP client, it’s very hard to debug a corrupt Authorization header, because all you know, when you have anything even slightly wrong, is that the server is pretending it didn’t see it!<p>-----<p>And yeah, I know, in practice, why this isn’t the way things are. Historically, one of the first uses of the Authorization header was through Apache’s mod_auth_basic, which refers to an .htpasswd file in a directory to determine the set of valid auth credentials for all resources descending from that directory. In this model, auth is resource-specific, rather than server-specific; so it makes sense that, if you’re sending auth, and auth is unrecognized, but the specific resource you’re authing <i>against<\/i> turns out to not <i>require<\/i> auth, then the server can proceed just fine without sending you a 401.<p>However, I don’t think there’s any modern use-case where auth is resource-specific like that. HTTP auth “realms” are almost always per-origin these days. It makes a lot more sense to think of auth as something happening at the level of an implicit <i>HTTP gateway<\/i> between the client and the server ultimately sending the resource, where the gateway can know what server (realm) the client wants to route to—and so can auth the client on that basis, and deny the request if that auth fails—but the gateway <i>can’t<\/i> know anything about what the auth requirement policies are for individual resources on the backend it’s sitting in front of."],"time":["2020-04-12 17:09:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ccmcarey"],"id":[22848330],"kids":[22848397],"parent":[22848192],"text":["Might want to update the title to indicate that this is for the API."],"time":["2020-04-12 16:08:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ivoras"],"id":[22848336],"kids":[22848387,22848344,22848352,22848346,22848451],"parent":[22848192],"text":["Ah, progress!

You can have coffee service and a bar if you want.\nIt&#x27;s the metaverse, like Ready Player One. (Except too sluggish under load, something slowly being fixed.) It looks great, but overkill for most people who aren&#x27;t regular Second Life users and know how to drive the thing.

This interview has oodles more thought provoking stuff beyond the “Maxwell’s equations” quote. Sometimes I feel like we worship more than actually listening to what is being said (and thinking about it and understanding it).<p>&gt; <i>Perhaps it was commercialization in the 1980s that killed off the next expected new thing. Our plan and our hope was that the next generation of kids would come along and do something better than Smalltalk around 1984 or so. We all thought that the next level of programming language would be much more strategic and even policy-oriented and would have much more knowledge about what it was trying to do. But a variety of different things conspired together, and that next generation actually didn’t show up. One could actually argue—as I sometimes do—that the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually led to a considerable retrogression in many, many respects. You could think of it as putting a low-pass filter on some of the good ideas from the ’60s and ’70s, as computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen. In the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they were. So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>The user interface, which is still the predominant approach today, is a user interface as the access to function. If the area is interesting, you eventually wind up with something that looks like the control panel of a nuclear reactor. So this is the agglutination of features. [...] Corporate buyers often buy in terms of feature sets. But at PARC our idea was, since you never step in the same river twice, the number-one thing you want to make the user interface be is a learning environment—something that’s explorable in various ways, something that is going to change over the lifetime of the user using this environment. New things are going to come on, and what does it mean for those new things to happen? This means improvements not only in the applications but also in the user interface itself.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>SF — What do you wish you had done differently in the Smalltalk era? AK — I had the world’s greatest group, and I should have made the world’s two greatest groups. I didn’t realize there are benefits to having real implementers and real users, and there are benefits to starting from scratch every few months.

Accessor methods are not appropriately named for JavaBeans, so that’s not the reason either.<p>AFAIK the accessor methods generated by the compiler are in all ways functionally equivalent to simply accessing the fields directly.<p>But the accessor methods take up more space and add code to the class which increases class size and could be avoided. It’s slightly more cumbersome to use value() instead of just value. And, presumably, compilation takes slightly longer as the compiler (hopefully?) elides the method call and... replaces it with a direct field access.<p>There must be a benefit to all these costs, but what is it? what is their purpose? why do they exist?<p>Serious question, I can’t work it out and it’s driving me nuts.<p>Edit: turns out I’m wrong, methods can be overridden, I misread an article.

One of the things I wonder about the post-COVID-19 world is what&#x27;s going to happen to research as a career, whether it&#x27;s in academia or in industry.  In computer science I&#x27;ve noticed these two trends occurring in the past 30 years:<p>1.  Industry has largely moved away from funding long-term blue-sky research, increasingly shifting toward short-term, product-driven research projects.  We have moved from places like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC where researchers had a large degree of freedom to places like Google today where researchers are assigned to product teams (see the paper &quot;Google&#x27;s Hybrid Approach to Research&quot; which describes how research at Google is operated: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pub38149&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pub38149&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>2.  Academia has its own challenges: (1) the competition for a professorship due to the fact there are more PhD graduates than there are professorships, (2) the competitive environment for obtaining research grants from the NSF, and (3) the increased reliance on adjunct faculty members, who don&#x27;t have tenure.<p>The economic effects of this COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly lead to universities reducing their hiring.  Some universities may even face closure.  The sudden shift to online teaching may also have permanent effects on the future of university education.<p>I believe that there are many opportunities for students that will become available if online education becomes the new normal, especially if online education leads to reducing the cost of a university education, which is a serious problem in the United States given the student loan crisis.<p>However, I&#x27;m concerned that a move toward online education will accelerate the trend of adjunctization occurring across academia and may even lead to the concept of tenure disappearing at all but the most competitive schools.  I believe places like Stanford, MIT, and Harvard will emerge from the post-COVID-19 world just fine.  I also believe that public research universities like UC Berkeley and University of Washington will emerge fine.  But what about regional comprehensive universities such as the California State University system?  What about small private universities that don&#x27;t have the prestige of places like Caltech or Harvey Mudd?  It&#x27;s these types of universities that will face the most pressures to adapt to a world of compelling online educational choices.<p>I&#x27;d like to still be able to pursue a career in research, ideally with autonomy and the ability to pursue long-term projects, but between the trends that have been occurring for the past 30 years as well as the challenges of a post-COVID-19 world, I might not be able to pursue such a career."],"time":["2020-04-12 14:02:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0xddd"],"id":[22847621],"kids":[22847643],"parent":[22846852],"text":["I can&#x27;t help but suspect some bias in an article that defines neoliberalism as &quot;academic-speak for capitalism&quot;.

The basic idea is that the cells are divided between dark “sea” cells and light “land” cells. We run Brain in the sea, and on land we run not Life but AntiLife. All the land cells are normally firing cells, and the presence of an active AntiLife cell is signaled by having a land cell which is not firing. Full details on EcoLiBra are in the Cellular Automata Theory chapter.<p>&gt;The name EcoLiBra suggests 1) an ecology of Life and Brain, 2) a balanced situation (equilibrium), and 3) the human intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli, known as E. coli for short. The third connection is perhaps a bit unsavory, but remember that E. coli cells are in fact the favorite “guinea pigs” for present day gene splicing experiments. As one of the goals of CelLab is to promote the development of artificial life, the designer gene connection is entirely appropriate.

The pervasive presence of Brain&#x27;s refractory state makes it less likely for a sea cell to have seven firing neighbors and be turned into a land cell. Unless we change the transition rules, the land will always melt away. So to give land a fighting chance, I now say that a sea cell becomes land if it has seven or six firing neighbors. Also I use better colors: Black, blue, and green for Brain; red and yellow for AntiLife.<p>Here is a variant I call &quot;ECO&quot; that runs &quot;ANNEAL&quot; on the water&#x2F;land plane, and (for giggles) a heat diffusion in the upper left-over planes.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SimHacker&#x2F;CAM6&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;CAM6.js#L3331\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SimHacker&#x2F;CAM6&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;CAM...<\/a><p>[More discussion and code in the original post...]<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22438816\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22438816<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-12 11:00:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jlevers"],"id":[22844164],"kids":{},"parent":[22843306],"text":["This is a terrible loss, and seeing the comments here makes me firmly agree with sentiment I&#x27;ve heard a number of times recently: it would be wonderful if culturally, it became more typical to tell our teachers&#x2F;mentors&#x2F;idols what they mean to us <i>before<\/i> they die, instead of saving that outpouring for after their death.<p>RIP."],"time":["2020-04-11 22:56:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hdivider"],"id":[22850841],"kids":{},"parent":[22843306],"text":["It appears he died by COVID-19:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailyvoice.com&#x2F;new-jersey&#x2F;mercer&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;covid-19-kills-renowned-princeton-mathematician-game-of-life-inventor-john-conway-in-3-days&#x2F;786461&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailyvoice.com&#x2F;new-jersey&#x2F;mercer&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;covid-19...<\/a><p>I went through some of his work in detail while in college.

But it doesn’t allow similar movement for photons, and that’s why light can’t move through silicon easily.<p>Uhhh.. not really. I’ll try to explain (forgive my ad-lib MatSci from 20 years ago). Efficient light generation is a matter of direct or indirect bandgap. A direct transition is one where the electron wave number is unchanged in dropping from the high to low energy state, so it can be completed with a single photon (light). An indirect transition fails conservation of energy and momentum with one photon, so it requires phonon (heat) interactions. Semiconductors have an energy gap between the highest few occupied state and the lowest few unoccupied states, and these are the only states that can exchange energy. Direct transitions generate mostly photons, so even if it gets absorbed, it will get re-emitted intact until it leaves the material. Indirect transitions means that phonons remove energy each time, so it all becomes heat. In normal conditions, Indirect materials are more transparent, although direct materials can become transparent by population inversion, which is when there are more electrons in the high-energy states then the low-energy states for the bandwidth of the photons being generated. Then any photon generated is more likely to generate more photons on its way out (stimulated emission) than to be absorbed. This is what you want. Okay I’ll stop now, but there are tricks that you can use to get this behavior in silicon, an indirect-bandgap material, which is the topic of the article."],"time":["2020-04-11 19:13:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xt00"],"id":[22840480],"kids":[22840599],"parent":[22840034],"text":["Super cool -- one challenge will be that in order to live on the hot processors of today, these emitters will need to still work at around 400K -- the good news is that these appear to still work well at around 300K -- but it sounds like these go to nearly no bandgap at higher temperatures and shift into the infrafred.

Over time, it&#x27;s beneficial for the PM to help educate key non-technical leaders about the costs of constantly changing direction.

You want to move that churn upstream from development to product at the very least, but possibly even further up to stakeholders or clients."],"time":["2020-04-11 14:00:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arendtio"],"id":[22840454],"kids":{},"parent":[22827275],"text":["You have to include multiple perspectives.

So instead I thought I&#x27;d give a very simple recipe and set of rules how to deal with customer requests that I follow, to try to align with this:<p>- Never promise a feature immediately when receiving a feature request. Say &quot;Thank you for the feedback, we&#x27;ll discuss this with the development team and get back to you if there&#x27;s any news regarding this&quot; (tag the user, so you can actually do so)<p>- Never choose to develop a feature until you&#x27;ve gotten at least three separate requests for it. This will help you not over-adapt to random noise, and make sure the product stays relevant to a majority of users.<p>- Never promise a timeline if you choose to promise a feature. Keep stress levels manageable for you and your dev team.<p>- If you have something &#x27;up next&#x27; on the roadmap already, you may choose to share the estimate with the inquirer - but favor not doing so, and underline that it&#x27;s an estimate not a promise if you do. Estimates also become much more reliable if random stuff doesn&#x27;t get to jump to the top of the priority list all the time. Your roadmap is a priority queue, not a stack<p>- Consider thinking of it as two priority lists. One is for smaller feature requests and improvements, the other for larger projects and system&#x2F;business needs (e.g. refactoring, features to target new demographics rather than existing users). Not progressing on either list is frustrating for everyone, so think of yourself as a scheduler trying to guarantee progress on both threads. For example you could have a rhythm where it&#x27;s ~1 month of work on one or two big projects (until completed), then ~1 week of work on smaller feature requests and polish, then repeat. This way you batch up many smaller tasks so you don&#x27;t incur the cost of context switching for your dev team while they are working on a bigger feature (which typically require deep concentration over many days), you don&#x27;t block major projects, but you also get to be relatively responsive to customer requests.<p>- Remember that things take time. Your job as a product manager isn&#x27;t to cater to every user&#x27;s every need immediately, it is to plot a path through an endless and evolving roadmap in order to 1) Keep the business alive and prospering 2) Keep the development team productive and sane 3) Make customers happy.

There is an ungodly amount of distortion, omission, and loss in transmission between prospect&#x2F;customer and engineering. If you have a prospect, meetings should include people from business, and engineering. If in any case only one person was there, this person should write up their notes or be downloaded&#x2F;debriefed while the memory is still fresh. If someone is updating you on the phone get the most you can when they just got out of the meeting. Sometimes you ask a question and they can go back to the person they just met who&#x27;s probably having a break by now and ask, take copious notes and dispatch them. If you got anything wrong, they&#x27;ll correct.<p>Written meeting notes should be disseminated, and then corrected and augmented so that:<p>- Those who weren&#x27;t there get an idea of what was actually said (we have meeting minutes in version control and anyone in the company can pull them and know exactly what I discussed in X town at which hour with whom)<p>- Those who were there realize they didn&#x27;t hear&#x2F;understand the same thing or plug holes. One catches what another has missed.<p>- Track rationale and decisions: All development through issue tracker. Avoid the &quot;why was that feature added&#x2F;removed two months ago again and now it&#x27;s to be removed&#x2F;included?&quot; and not knowing why.<p>This should bring everyone to the same &quot;initial conditions&quot;. If you don&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s telephone game and you get a human-centipede like result.<p>Include form to request a feature in the product itself. Directly from the users so there&#x27;s no distortion. Everyone should get that issue.<p>Also, if there&#x27;s no product there is no business, which makes me wonder why the tech side is taking the backseat in a fintech startup. Fintech is like an airplane: you take a bus, you add wings, and you have an airbus that can travel faster and farther. Remove the tech, and it&#x27;s just finance.<p>Add monitoring and analytics. We&#x27;re working on that ourselves after putting out a lot of fires that looked the same.<p>Second: customers drive product roadmap in terms of <i>raw data<\/i>. Whenever users or customers ask something or raise an issue, ask yourself what is the underlying issue and what are they <i>really<\/i> trying to do. &quot;Job to be done&quot;. Drill vs hole. Customers complaining is similar to patients complaining: they&#x27;ll tell you about <i>symptoms<\/i> and then want you to fix those symptoms and they&#x27;ll propose solutions and features. You gently take notes, and then dig deeper.<p>The analogy I use is that customers will ask for a robot with IoT and blockchain support that automatically integrates with Amazon API and orders mops, tracks the item, and has AI and image segmentation and recognizes Amazon drone, and receives the mops and automatically loads them. Because AI, blockchain, and IoT. Yes, it&#x27;s not a sentence.<p>Your job is to ask why, figure out they always find water on the floor, and then look up and find there&#x27;s a leaky pipe, then fix the leak.<p>In other words: do not really listen to the &quot;implementation&quot; or the &quot;solution&quot; customers propose. These only fix symptoms and are easily swayed by whatever piece with a clik-bait title prefixed by &quot;This AI robot&quot; someone with 2 minute attention span has written that the customer half read taking their morning coffee, and wanted to bring to the product not to be left behind by the competition.<p>What one really looks for is the problem. The problem almost never manifests itself, you have to dig to get it. It&#x27;s muddy. People could be pissed at you because &quot;What do you not get in an AI IoT robot that orders mops?&quot;. This is where having social skills and getting good at interviewing comes in handy.<p>People demands and their behaviors are the solutions <i>they<\/i> have come up with to a <i>problem<\/i>. The problem is that they almost never tell you about the <i>problem<\/i>, and you may have a better solution. Think of it like code review: code I push is my implementation or a solution to a problem. The implementation is dictated by my skill, experience, sophistication, sleep I had yesterday, etc. Code review helps find better ways.<p>Third: all developers do support. This focalizes and aligns everyone. You have a hundred issues in your issue tracker. You have thought of great features. A lot of the issues are about bugs.<p>We opened our internal ML platform to about 30 students of our colleague so they could get a one click notebook with all libraries installed, a lot of RAM, a sweet K80, and hundreds of gigabytes of data for their project. We added the students to a dedicated Slack workspace. The platform is not ready, but precisely. This is a jolt.<p>Users would complain about something. We would notice a pattern. We would investigate, then figure out what to do.<p>They&#x27;re doing two things:<p>- Exposing things we wouldn&#x27;t have found<p>- Putting the finger on what hurts the most amongst the issues we are aware of.<p>One person who complains about something is one thing. Ten people complaining about the same thing that prevents them from working, that&#x27;s another thing.<p>We have worked differently in the past. There have been changes to the company and changes in how product development is done. The business side of our company used to talk to the executives of the client company. We have been paid for all our products, whe have shipped them to spec, none of them is used, none of them can be reused, all of them left us with scars, and that way of working almost destroyed the company.<p>Fourth: everyone should be clear on what the team is doing, and what the team is <i>not<\/i> doing. This issue is not a priority. We will handle this one, this one, and this other one by this date. This part is handled by this person. Avoid the &quot;I thought Alice was working on it&quot;.<p>Fifth: -good engineering practices go here-. Good test coverage. Patches get their tests, good commit messages, root cause analyses, and eventually knowledge base. A test harness is not &quot;directly&quot; good for the customers, but it gives confidence that you won&#x27;t break everything. Loosely coupled, modular code: it allows for people to develop with different speeds and reduces dependency on unrelated parts, which is <i>really<\/i> frustrating."],"time":["2020-04-10 00:25:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davismwfl"],"id":[22827687],"kids":{},"parent":[22827275],"text":["It is completely normal to include feature requests in a product roadmap and to be getting them developed when appropriate, that definitely isn&#x27;t a problem.  Things are also different when you have 1 client versus when you have 10+ clients.  When you have 1-2 clients you generally do things you wouldn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t normally do under good product management standards.<p>So let&#x27;s assume you fall into the 10+ client category.  The company should have a defined and published product roadmap that is being worked, new features should be vetted against the client demographic (e.g. it should benefit more then 50%, I usually set the bar higher early on like 80%) and if it passes that then it would be defined and put on the development schedule, but it should not disrupt the existing planned sprints on the roadmap.  That means the client might have to wait to get this new feature, but the benefit is the product can be designed, kept reliable and stable and not get polluted with a bunch of make shift code and hacks.  None of this has to be a crazy long process, it can be simple and quick and if sprints are 1-2 weeks, most likely many features can fit within the next 30-60-90 days at most (obviously assuming proper staffing etc).<p>The sales side of the business should never be in control of the development schedule, or product roadmap, it is a direct conflict of interest.  Product management should be owned by an operations type person, CTO, COO but for sure a non-sales, and&#x2F;or marketing focused person.  This is what will make the company successful faster and help keep the product stable and on schedule.  Founders when small have to wear many hats so they will be violating this all the time, but by the time they have hired a product manager, sales teams etc, the hacky crap has to stop if they want to succeed.<p>None of this means a client (or business) can&#x27;t get a new feature turned around pretty quick, it just means that there is alignment of features to more than one client and that product stability, reliability and schedule are managed as first class problems.  Startups struggle with this thinking it will slow things down, and they will lose deals, when in fact it speeds things up and makes everything more predictable.  The key is requests can be done faster when the development teams can keep tech debt low and design things into the product properly.  It also prevents the scrap it and rewrite it that happens when you don&#x27;t plan well enough.  To be fair, there is almost always 1-2 scrap code repositories early in the life of a startup, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, just usually works out that way because of people repeating preventable mistakes they haven&#x27;t yet learned.<p>I do think it is important to recognize when you are first starting the company it is more free for all, scrappy and hacky, but even in those circumstances you should not be implementing features just because one client made a request."],"time":["2020-04-10 00:04:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jokull"],"id":[22841705],"kids":{},"parent":[22827275],"text":["Your job is to bridge business and engineering.

If you are a half-decent engineer in ANY language you can make your code refactorable for changing requirements. Whining that types makes that harder just shows your own limitations.

That shows passion and grit. I&#x27;ve built two teams from scratch now in totally different circumstances and it is simply breezy to find a wide variety of experience levels to craft a team from; they are by far the best teams I have ever worked with, with zero duds.

As a long time user of Java&#x2F;OOP here are my thoughts on Scala and why it has so many things things going against it. Consider the following:<p>1) First, Scala is designed and developed by &quot;ivory&quot; tower academics primarily for research&#x2F;PhD thesis purposes. Nothing wrong with that. But that also means language features are added not to solve a practical problem but mostly to show that &quot;it can be done&quot;&#x2F;&quot;prove a point&quot;. When you are awake at 3 AM early in the morning because a release made in the evening went awry and you are trying to grep though logs&#x2F;code to see what caused the issue I can assure you that debates about &quot;pure&quot; versus &quot;impure&quot;, Monads, Kleisli arrow will be further from your mind. So the problem that Scala seems to suffer from is that of &quot;image&quot;.<p>2) Second, Scala is neither a fully functional (FP) nor object oriented (OOP). Support for mixed&#x2F;multi-paradigm sounds nice on paper but let me ask this question: do you know of any hard core FP programmer who is excited about inheritance or abstract classes or other OOP features? Vice-versa the same thing can be said about many OOP programmers lukewarm response towards many functional features of Scala. I believe that support for mixed&#x2F;multiple paradigms has hindered large scale adoption of Scala. The language seems to be caught at cross-roads not knowing which way to advance next.<p>3) Third is lack of niche. True, I absolutely love &quot;Spark&quot; and primarily use it to extract&#x2F;manipulate data from HDFS&#x2F;Hive storage but I am gradually gravitating towards &quot;Python&quot; libraries due to their ease of use. What about better Java? Kotlin check. What about sidecar systems used by DevOps? Go check. What about a better designed system language? Rust check.

Many people got excited and implemented these new paradigms in production systems without regard to the immaturity of their own grasp of the concepts (think of how many years of imperative&#x2F;OO programming you had under your belt before feeling confident of setting the style for a project), the learning curve they were non-consensually committing their coworkers to, and the hiring, productivity, and morale burden they were saddling their employers with.  From the management point of view, allowing Scala in the door meant running the risk of waking up one day with a bunch of Scalaz in the codebase, one grinning functional programmer happy as a pig in shit, and the rest of the team shouting and cursing.<p>Likewise, on top of the real problems created by ill-conceived adoption, the irrational backlash against new paradigms is real as well.  I&#x27;m old enough to remember the fuss over OO programming.  Many experienced, successful coders were scared that they were about to become personally obsolete.  Some OO proponents insinuated — and panicked veteran coders believed — that a large number of procedural programmers would have to retire or switch careers because they were too old or not intellectually nimble enough to adapt to object-oriented programming.  Major companies such as Sun responded to these fears with a marketing blitz to prove their <i>their<\/i> OO technology was simple and easy to learn and would herald a new age of programmer productivity.  Programmer culture was more driven by magazines and books in those days and therefore much more easily influenced by industry marketing.  The &quot;simplicity&quot; of Java was an invention of Sun marketing, a successful self-fulfilling prophecy as Java became so familiar that similarity to it became millions of programmers&#x27; benchmark of simplicity.<p>There has been no total war marketing blitz for functional or actor-based programming from a company with the same stature that Sun had in the 1990s.  The emotional reaction, the resentment at feeling a step behind the future, the anxiety about whether you will ever be as comfortable and confident in the new paradigm, operate virtually in a vacuum, or worse, in the echo chamber of the internet.  Whatever latent fear of functional programming a person feels, the prospect of using Scala will bring it to the fore.  The only countervailing force is the (usually lone) individual pushing adoption, and they are unlikely to be up to the challenge.  There is a tension between programmers who are more oriented towards business problems, or who just want to get their job done and go home, and the programmers who get excited about different and potentially better ways to express programs.  They both think of themselves as humble and results-oriented and have a hard time accepting each other as being equally humble and results-oriented in their own way.  They both experience the other as snobbish, condescending, and threatening to their self-image as good engineers.<p>Sadly, the root of the problem is that Scala is expressive and powerful enough to be a natural vehicle for these new paradigms.  An engineering organization should not fear expressive power, because they should have a culture that is incompatible with a single engineer (or a small cabal) committing their peers to a learning curve without consultation, debate over the cost and payoff, and buy-in from the team.  Unfortunately, there seems to be an assumption that beyond choosing a language, you have no ability to consciously choose a style.  I.e., Scala-as-a-better-Java (the least imaginative approach, but not a bad one) is an impossibility.  This is grounded in the assumption that any aspect of a language that can be abused, will be abused, and that engineers cannot make collective decisions about how they will work together, which are odd assumptions to make about the behavior of highly paid professionals.  As someone who wrote C++ professionally for many years, I can testify that it is possible for engineers to conform to coding standards that restrict them to a strict subset of the expressive power of a language.  However, it sometimes requires management authority to bring people in line -- and perhaps this is a deal-breaker in an industry where teams of engineers are supposed to be entirely self-managing."],"time":["2020-04-11 19:07:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dlandis"],"id":[22843837],"kids":[22844634],"parent":[22830779],"text":["Scala is an awesome language and studying it helped me improve as a programmer more than I can describe.<p>That being said, even though Haoyi said he doesn’t think Java has “caught up”, the fact is it has closed the gap significantly on the language side, and will always remain ahead in other ways (performance as one example).

And I don&#x27;t mean a one-man show like Justo Martínez [0] or a &quot;modern&quot; cathedral like the Sagrada Familia, but an actual authentic gothic cathedral like it would&#x27;ve been professionally built in the 14th century. These buildings are just so interesting and beautiful [1]. I remember seeing an arte documentary a few years ago in which several French gothic cathedrals were analyzed. Apart from their structural complexity, there constructions were surprisingly modern. In many of them, concealed iron rods or chains were used to ensure stability and make it look like the stones are somehow magically kept in place - or to safe the building. For example, an iron chain was tightened around Amiens cathedral [2][3] to fix structural defects which resulted from a mistake made during construction. An interesting aspect of their esthetic appeal is also their regularity, which is kind of a side effect of using a catalog of standardized building elements which were mass-produced by the stone quarries to keep the costs down. For example, if you look at this picture [4], you can actually spot a lot of these basic form elements which could be re-used for other windows or doors.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Justo_Gallego_Mart%C3%ADnez\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Justo_Gallego_Mart%C3%ADnez<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;c&#x2F;ce&#x2F;20121007_Beauvais_CathedralStPierre_DSC00749_PtrQs.jpg&#x2F;1280px-20121007_Beauvais_CathedralStPierre_DSC00749_PtrQs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;c&#x2F;ce&#x2F;20...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amiens_Cathedral\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amiens_Cathedral<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;Philippe_Dillmann&#x2F;publication&#x2F;225434112&#x2F;figure&#x2F;fig1&#x2F;AS:439926857703426@1481898144856&#x2F;Photograph-of-a-Amiens-cathedral-view-of-a-nave-pillar-and-of-the-triforium-b-the.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;Philippe_Dillmann&#x2F;publi...<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.fotocommunity.com&#x2F;rosettenfenster-8359847c-0966-446f-83fe-0478b2520cc1.jpg?width=1000\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.fotocommunity.com&#x2F;rosettenfenster-8359847c-0966-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-12 13:36:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22844913],"kids":{},"parent":[22844118],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-12 01:15:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22844844],"kids":{},"parent":[22844118],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-12 00:59:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["ghostDancer"],"id":[22846833],"kids":{},"parent":[22844118],"text":["If you like this , maybe you will like how they are rebuilding  a whale ship from the XVI century trying to use traditional techniques and materials. : <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.albaola.com&#x2F;en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.albaola.com&#x2F;en<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-12 10:46:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["boomboomsubban"],"id":[22845729],"kids":[22845813],"parent":[22844118],"text":["How does ~26 years to construct compare to 13th century castles?

Coming from the two major OS vendors, we now have a point where we can get it to be shut off after the threat is contained. The proposal by Google &#x2F; Apple does not touch upon the serverside other than recommending restrictions on usage of the data that is gathered and shared.<p>&gt; Find out if someone specific is sick<p>Many countries already have mandatory reporting paths for infectious diseases, if you operate an office building it is likely that you will find out if somebody using that building has to quarantine themselves for a few weeks already.<p>You will want to know if someone specific that you have been in contact with is sick. This reads like you are pointing out the main reason for why we do contact tracing in the first place as a negative leakage path.<p>&gt;  I won’t know who they are, but I can at least grab aggregate information about where coronavirus getters travel.<p>You do not know who they are, you can track an infected persons movement (assuming 100% coverage) at most over a single day. Existing tracking using Bluetooth and other signals a typical smartphone puts out already allows you to do more. The problem in this scenario is a lack of customer protection rights, not one of the proposal being bad.<p>&gt; Increased hit rate of stationary &#x2F; marketing beacons<p>Again, that&#x27;s a policy issue more than a technical one and pretty US centric. As you correctly point out it also isn&#x27;t new. The data they gather now will likely be less useful than what they can get with the broken MAC randomization stuff phones put out before.<p>&gt; Leakage of information when someone isn’t sick<p>The alternative to the first bullet point is running around infected. The second point seems unrelated to the method of contact tracing. With existing manual contact tracing, the health authority could also tell you that you&#x27;re infected and get your DNA.<p>&gt; Fraud resistance<p>Most civilized countries have central reporting for positive test results, making the fraud resistance argument moot. This supplements existing, manual, contact tracing. The proposal itself has nothing to do with that part of the workflow, it merely helps app developers to take care of a crucial and previously hard part of the stack and suggests a well designed crypto scheme to ensure privacy in the scope of the exchanged data itself.<p>The only realistic scenario in here seems like that of existing stationary marketing beacons, which I&#x27;d propose to look at in terms of realism and the tradeoff between the status quo of manual contact tracing (which is inefficient, labor intensive, and error prone). In the realism aspect, marketing firms are hardly on the edge of technology. How likely is it for a major player to upgrade their systems with this tracking capability in the timeframe of the pandemic? What insight do they gather on those infected? If you&#x27;re infected you would have to realistically share a few days worth of keys."],"time":["2020-04-11 09:31:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liamuk"],"id":[22818589],"kids":[22840862,22840326,22840177,22840620,22830153,22843891,22841621,22840054,22853281],"parent":[22818300],"text":["Hi HN!<p>One of the creators here.<p>It&#x27;s a cross between Zoom x Pokemon.

(There are similar feats which have been developed by speedrun aficionados, but I tend to ignore most of them as they are ‘impure’: for example, one can turn the SNES Super Mario World into an arbitrary game like Snake or Pong but you need the new programs loaded up into extra hardware, so in my opinion, it’s not really showing SMW to be unexpectedly TC and is different from the other examples.<p>I fail to see the difference; as far as I understood it, the Sumer Mario World examples were done by just playing the game?
