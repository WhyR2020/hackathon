This stack allows people to ship beautiful webapps (= web protocols and languages, weblike experience) in a format like native applications, with the addition of desktop integration, but ... now we have HTML5 developers shipping binary blobs for the operating systems and CPU architectures they choose.  It&#x27;s cool that that includes common Linux distros as well as the leading commercial OSes, but what if I want to run RISCV instead of Intel&#x2F;AMD, or FreeBSD, or &lt;insert any other system entirely capable of running the usual stuff from the Unix ecosystem that some people call the &quot;Linux desktop&quot;&gt; instead of Linux, and why is an HTML5 developer&#x2F;publisher making that choice?  Add to this the fact that Chromium itself is an open source project that is widely ported to systems other than Android&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;Windows, but the upstream apparently doesn&#x27;t accept portability patches.  Suddenly that matters if the unit of delivery includes an internal browser executable.<p>I understand the practical reasons for all of the above, but it irks me on some level; the whole point of all of the huge tower of open standards involved was to avoid this situation.

We (AgFunder.com — a Fund focused on foodtech &amp; agtech) launch a new fund every 6-12 months with a 6 week offering period, precisely because we can effectively take capital at any time. Investors range from individual, family offices, and corporates.<p>We went from $0 to $30m AUM in two years over five funds. For a given investment, we generally invest out of multiple funds (typically 2-3) that have capital to deploy and have a simple formula based on target check size to deal with tight allocations. We’ve written checks as low as $100k and as high as $1m.<p>For our fund admin, we use Assure Fund Services which costs about $15k to set up each vehicle with 10-years of k-1 and admin services. They also manage the bank account. Assure used to run angellist’s SPVs.<p>With so many funds and LPs (&gt;250) we built a reporting tool that builds a quarterly report for each LP based on the funds they’re invested in and what companies those funds are in.<p>This has removed a lot of cyclicality you see in funds where you are either fundraising or investing. We have mostly inbound, do very few in person meetings, and if you prefer to wait you can see our progress and come in in the next Fund in six months. The relationships with the LPs are great and many are far more sophisticated than institutional LPs because they often know the space better. Still, I don’t see institutional LPs stepping into this for a long while. They’re very very conservative and like things done like they’ve always been done (no wonder VC has such poor performance as an asset class)."],"time":["2020-09-03 07:10:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dzink"],"id":[24360659],"kids":[24365867],"parent":[24351515],"text":["The aggregate fees are quite high (1.5%+2% of contributions every year in management fees alone) and while larger funds \nmay pull this off occasionally partly due to signaling, you are not getting exclusive access to the startups with this setup.

People might prefer this new crack-lit, which mutes their ability to sense ugliness, parasitism, disgust, or horror, but its existence does not obviate the existence of Chiang.

With this round of funding, they&#x27;ve officially passed &quot;unicorn status,&quot; and that&#x27;s kind of a double-edged sword.<p>The problem, at risk of stating the obvious, is that investors are hoping for big returns, and that means big revenue -- and that means changing the definition of &quot;success&quot; on Patreon. To hit a few hundred million in revenue a year and earn their valuation, they&#x27;re going to need to start competing with not just YouTube and Twitch, but major music labels and indie-friendly TV&#x2F;film studios.

At least for the things I use it for. If all it was was a way to give people a donation and nothing else then it wouldn&#x27;t matter but many people use it as a way to distribute digital media for $$$<p>But, there is no catalog of media. All you can do is go through old blog posts. The UI of the blog posts is a single page app that you pick &quot;more&quot; at the bottom of every 10 posts.  It crashes often and you have re-start back at post 1 when it does and paginate your way back to where you started. Fixing the pagination would be nice but fixing the entire UI around actually helping people distribute their media would be even better.<p>In fact many people don&#x27;t even put their media on Patreon given how bad the UI is and are forced to find 3rd party solutions<p>Also, Patreon is horrible at discovery. For the most part you have to find out about people to become a patron of offsite. Some of that is the people on Patreon not knowing what they are doing but arguably Patreon needs a better way to browse people and concretely know what they&#x27;ll get access to. Not just &quot;you&#x27;ll get access to special videos&quot; but rather tell me exactly which videos, how many, how long are they, what is each individual video about, etc....<p>Even for artists Patreon could generate a series of thumbnails, small enough that just the thumbnails are not enough but large enough that you can tell what art you&#x27;ll get access to.<p>Given how bad the UX is it&#x27;s slightly infuriating they&#x27;re the most popular of such sites. I guess that just means there is plenty of room for someone to steal their market.<p>Further, Patreon has lots of people scamming for $$$, reselling other people&#x27;s art.

Housework (fixing things, cleaning etc), finance, time management, how to actually learn&#x2F;study effectively, mental health awareness, working out with correct technique and not ruining your body, how to eat healthily are all things that I value more than knowing the intricate details of how the European Union came to be (knowing history is useful and interesting, but I&#x27;d have rather spent that time on the aforementioned things).

They told me 1.15.9-gke.9.\nBut my team at work is still getting reports of CPU throttling causing increased latencies on GKE workloads in these clusters.<p>This means<p>1. we&#x27;re using a kernel that doesn&#x27;t contain the patch.\n2. the patch wasn&#x27;t sufficient to prevent unnecessary CPU throttling\n3. latency is caused by something other than CPU throttling<p>To rule out 1, I again checked that our GKE clusters (which are using nodes with Container Optimized OS [COS] VM images) are on a version that contains the CFS patch.<p>```<p>dxia@one-of-our-gke-nodes ~ $ uname -a\nLinux one-of-our-gke-nodes 4.19.112+ #1 SMP Sat Apr 4 06:26:23 PDT 2020 x86_64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz GenuineIntel GNU&#x2F;Linux<p>```<p>Kernel version is 4.19.112+ which is a good sign.

Top graph shows an example Container&#x27;s CPU limit, request, and usage. The bottom graph shows the number of seconds the Container was CPU throttled as measured by sampling the local kubelet&#x27;s Prometheus metric for `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total` over time. CPU usage data is collected from resource usage metrics for Containers from the [Kubernetes Metrics API][6] which is returns metrics from the [metrics-server][7].<p>The first graph shows usage is not close to the limit. So there shouldn&#x27;t be any CPU throttling happening.<p>The first drop in the top graph was decreasing the CPU limit from 24 to match the CPU requests of 16.  The decrease of CPU limit from 24 to 16 actually caused CPU throttling to increase. We removed CPU limits from the Container on 8&#x2F;31 12:00 which decreased number of seconds of CPU throttling to zero. This makes me think the kernel patch wasn&#x27;t sufficient to prevent unnecessary CPU throttling.<p>This K8s Github issue [&quot;CFS quotas can lead to unnecessary throttling #67577&quot;][8] is still open. The linked [kernel bug][9] has a comment saying it should be marked fixed. I&#x27;m not sure if there are still CPU throttling issues with CFS not tracked in issue #67577 though.<p>Because of the strong correlation in the graphs between removing CPU limits and CPU throttling, I&#x27;m assuming the kernel patch named &quot;Fixed CFS quota throttling issue.&quot; in COS 77-12371-141-0 wasn&#x27;t enough.<p>Questions<p>1. Anyone else using GKE run into this issue?<p>2. Does anyone have a link to the exact kernel patch that the COS entry &quot;Fixed CFS quota throttling issue.&quot; contains? A Linux mailing list ticket or patch would be great so I can see if it&#x27;s the same patch that various blog posts reference.<p>3. Anyone aware of any CPU throttling issues in the current COS version and kernel we&#x27;re using? 77-12371-227-0 and 4.19.112+, respectively.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;omio-engineering&#x2F;cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;omio-engineering&#x2F;cpu-limits-and-aggressiv...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs&#x2F;release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-227-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs&#x2F;release...<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.getcloudapp.com&#x2F;o0u8KoEn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.getcloudapp.com&#x2F;o0u8KoEn<\/a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;debug-application-cluster&#x2F;resource-metrics-pipeline&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;debug-application-cluster&#x2F;r...<\/a><p>[7]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;cluster&#x2F;addons&#x2F;metrics-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;cluster...<\/a><p>[8]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;issues&#x2F;67577\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;issues&#x2F;67577<\/a><p>[9]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.kernel.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=198197\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.kernel.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=198197<\/a><p>[COS]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-02 21:23:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devit"],"id":[24352061],"kids":{},"parent":[24351566],"text":["Thy should have just upgraded the kernel to a fixed one, which definitely does not require to upgrade the whole distribution.<p>Also if they are using Kubernetes normally there is no reason to not upgrade the whole distribution as well, since only Kubernetes will be running on it, and of course that&#x27;s widely tested (the containers each choose their own distribution, only the kernel is shared)."],"time":["2020-09-02 13:12:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24356030],"kids":{},"parent":[24351566],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-02 20:13:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["poisonta"],"id":[24355078],"kids":{},"parent":[24351566],"text":["You should not run more than one application&#x2F;service in a VM if you are worried about the performance.
