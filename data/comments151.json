Why boils down to two ideas - a) you are not hired in teams, so you cannot rely on classmates; and b) we&#x27;ve made students so scared to help each through fear of academic integrity and copyright violations that we had to create a special activity centered around looking at someone else&#x27;s code.<p>The first idea is rather obvious - the teams you build while learning may be enjoyable but that does not directly translate to hireability. PP Exercises are still scored primarily through correctness over contribution, so a slacking student can do less and potentially learn less without fear of too much penalty to their course grade.<p>The second idea is more an opinion about the state of CS ed. In an English class, if I wrote something that wasn&#x27;t good, I could rely on peers to help. If I need help on my weight lifting form, I can show my form to others for advice.

That created some fatigue in me, and it helped to have someone giving out their thoughts actively. Even when not aligned on a common view point, simply going by one&#x27;s approach first based on ease-of-implementation sounds practical. we could try other ideas always right..<p>- Creating bugs became more apparent. i.e., every software bug is someone&#x27;s creation, and pair programmer would actively think about what&#x27;s going on, makes the code less buggy<p>- Software architectures and designs are easy to justify at the end, because you&#x27;ve one more already on board, at least to some extent. If the person isn&#x27;t aligned with the other&#x27;s thinking, its very easy to pin point the item. Usual management style is, someone with different eyes (managers, tech leads) review once its gotten to some place.<p>- What was mild inconvenience was: my pair programmer was Vim guy, I&#x27;d like sublime text. Our style of thinking was also different. It made few things better, but ultimately you are asking someone to push their approach onto you. Some adjustment needed.. but okay. I&#x27;d prefer reading papers in depth before finding a common theme to implement, they&#x27;d prefer jumping into code, and then tweaking and hacking. My motivation&#x2F;internal agenda is to write novel work, they&#x27;d want to simply get best numbers out. Aligning on something at this high level I thought has pros and cons..<p>- Overall, pair programming really helped me see myself. Its like getting active feedback, but not in the formal feedbacks designed in companies. If both like to some extent doing it together, its a good way to grow as a person and engineer.<p>- In workplaces there persons would not say I don&#x27;t like pair programming with this person, unless do&#x2F;die situation, at least in small companies. This pushes everyone to learn some people skills to see how things are going on.. I felt some discomfort at this aspect, but okay.<p>- I always had some insecurity about whether I am good enough for my goals or current project. I admired how many things are done by my pair programmer, and that made me feel whether they like working with me. It was always running on the back of my head.

For strangling the poor soul sitting next to me out of sheer frustration.<p>Joking aside, pair programming (not as in occasional bout of problem-solving which needs a fresh eye, but as an everyday routine) only works when the problem is well-defined and people involved are of about same level of skill (otherwise it becomes a training session rather than production - which could be valuable but is definitely not the stated goal).<p>I am a highly skilled and experienced software engineer who did make notable contributions in a bunch of subfields - with awards and such.  I noticed that most my peers (including those I consider at my level of skill) have a real trouble following my thought process - for example I tend to work in highly non-linear fashion, jumping all over the place, and in stop-and-go bursts.  I could spend a month or two literally doing nothing, letting my mental model of what I&#x27;m building to settle and clarify. When the time comes the actual coding becomes nearly an exercise for fingers.<p>Another issue is depth of the abstraction stack - for most software people I met it&#x27;s rather shallow.  My personal notion of a &quot;full stack engineer&quot; is somebody who understands computers from how quantum effects make transistors work all the way up to the psychology of users, corporate finance, and macroeconomic trends - and everything in between.  When you are aware of the fact that programming choices you make do not exist in a vacuum, and are dependent (or should be dependent, if you have a clue) on deep understanding of computing substrata, math behind it, the ways the product will be used, and the business objectives and environment - you would either need to force your choice on your pair peer (in which case there&#x27;s no benefit of the &quot;second opinion&quot; as there&#x27;s none) or to spend a lot of time and effort just giving him the background necessary to understand justification for your decisions.  In my experience attempts to do so usually get dismissed as &quot;that&#x27;s philosophy&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s irrelevant&quot;, or &quot;we have work to do&quot;.<p>The stated advantage of PP - the better code quality - could be just as well achieved by a combination of disciplined thought, careful and elaborate execution, and actual learning from errors and mistakes - reflection on the ways I make mistakes is somewhat of an obsession for me; by now I usually know where I made a mistake even before I fire a debugger to confirm it (interestingly, I observed the same obsession in people who are engaged in seriously risky and technically complex endeavors like flying search-and-rescue missions or technical diving).  (FWIW I&#x27;m of a very low opinion of merits of code reviews... wastes way more time on bikeshedding than saves on troubleshooting.  Of all my decades writing code I may recall maybe a handful cases where it actually helped to find a bug which wouldn&#x27;t be immediately apparent otherwise.)"],"time":["2020-03-07 07:28:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["qubex"],"id":[22502848],"kids":[22502975],"parent":[22499224],"text":["My mother passed away when I was 11, in 1992.

I could have said it in similar words. I was managing teams of up to 8 people this way. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but I basically always managed teams. Until I hit a roadblock.<p>It was a time when I was working with very little coaching from above. I thought I was doing well, I had great loyalty in the team, and I thought that I would soon advance to being an “ordinary” manager. Change of director, and much more involvement of the new person in what I was doing day to day, and soon I got very clear signals that I would not be manager material. That was it. Soon, the world was turned upside down, and a very different set of people came into lead positions, while others left. Apparently, a different culture had set in.<p>What I had to learn over time -<p>- managing up and managing across is at least as important as managing down. You can be the greatest coach to your team members, but if your prime internal partner isn’t talking favorably of you you’re not in a great position. I had only a few presentations to do for upper management, but those did not go well - partly because of content, but also partly because at the time I didn’t come across as confident. I wasn’t able to sell what we were doing, and that didn’t land well.<p>- the management that surrounded me liked the “sensing” type, in Myers-Briggs nomenclature, wheras I’m deeply rooted “intuitive”. What does this mean? Sensing types perceive the world as it is, through their senses. They value concrete actions and tend to favor short-term thinking. They get unconfortable when things are too abstract. Intuitive types create the world in their heads, and then bend the real world to become close to their imagination. You should know the culture you are surrounded by and how you fit in. Chances are that as a manager you are better of being a “sensing” type. As a leader, though, being a visionary might be just fine. These are needed, too, but they probably have not advanced through a management ladder.<p>- if your talent is in being a tech leader, this talent might become a liability if you’re leading teams. In fact you might have to deal with a team that has quite average technical talent compared to you, and you still need to let them go in order to maximize the team’s potential. Otherwise, chances are that they continue to look up to you to give them the technical direction, and that is neither a great way to boost their careers, nor a good way to remove yourselves as the bottleneck.<p>- There is an initial impulse to try showing what a great manager you are by asking for a large team. The opposite is true. Large teams are a liability, and require you to deliver large impact. It is better to be impact driven from the start, then the team size will follow suit. There might also be cases where you should ask for your team to shrink.<p>- The manager is also responsible for setting the tone, the culture of the team. This should be aligned with the business, not with the team itself. Typical example is when there are competing teams with overlapping responsibilities. A bad manager might just become competitive and play zero-sum games. If you’re doing it right, though, you become more of a diplomat, and reach a agreements that put both teams and the business in a position with less frictions. This might in fact be your only job for a long time, and so you better have a team that can work independently on the technical aspects.<p>Long story short, management is a profession that is very different from a development role and a TLM role. Being good at one is not a good predictor if the other, and in fact I would say they are slightly negatively correlated."],"time":["2020-03-06 22:46:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thatiscool"],"id":[22508683],"kids":{},"parent":[22500472],"text":["this is a great summary."],"time":["2020-03-07 01:20:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lala26in"],"id":[22505514],"kids":{},"parent":[22500472],"text":["The advise written has lot of implicit assumptions.

The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>172 page PDF [last update: March|5|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

So as a rule of thumb you could say 10% of America infected, ~1% of those people are hospitalized, and 10% of <i>those<\/i> people die. Every year.<p>Do we close events during the winter because of the flu? Of course not. We would never be able to have a winter-season event ever again.

Malaria kills 50,000 a month.

I&#x27;ve managed to convince myself to have moderate levels of confidence in it; please tear it apart.<p>1) The Diamond Princess is our best source of data. Every person who got infected on it was identified (~700), and those who were infected got the best medical care possible. This led to a ~1% mortality rate (6&#x2F;700) and a ~5% ventilator support rate (35&#x2F;700). 6&#x2F;700 is subject to significant error in both directions, but let&#x27;s go with it.<p>2) Their average age was in the upper 40s, so assuming younger people don&#x27;t suffer the most serious ill effects from it, a guess for the general population might be a 0.5% base mortality rate and 2.5% ventilator support. This is a rough order of magnitude estimate: obviously expected mortality should be adjusted for actual age distributions.<p>3) South Korea&#x27;s mortality rate is 0.6%. Cases outside of Wuhan but within China have a reported mortality rate of 0.4%. Singapore (at ~100 cases) is 0%. These are all consistent with the estimated mortality rate I extrapolated from the DP.<p>4) All of the areas mentioned in 3) have very aggressive testing protocols. No evidence has come up suggesting widespread infection among the broader community. This includes China randomly sampling some areas and not finding meaningful unknown pockets of infection.<p>5) But what about Wuhan? It has a much higher mortality rate (&gt;3%). The reports on the ground suggested that it was the medical system being overwhelmed that drove the mortality through the roof. If we assume everyone who needs a ventilator but doesn&#x27;t get one dies, that explains in one fell swoop Wuhan&#x27;s elevated mortality rate.<p>6) What about Italy? Its mortality rate is ~3.5%. But, compare the number of hospital beds in Italy and SK. It&#x27;s ~3&#x2F;1k vs ~10&#x2F;1k. SK is already running into issues with hospital bed availability, so it stands to reason that the situation is much worse in Italy. Italy also has a significantly older population than SK. So it&#x27;s starting to run into the same nightmare scenario as Wuhan. Of note, the US has a younger population than Italy, but fewer hospital beds.<p>7) What about Iran? It has ridiculous mortality rates. My best explanation is that testing constraints probably lead to more undercounting of infections in the hardest hit areas, so Hubei, Italy, and Iran probably all have artifically elevated mortalities, while the reality for all of them is much closer to 2.5%.<p>8) There&#x27;s no need for weird hypotheses about Asians having different proteins in their lungs, there being multiple strains that act radically differently from each other, China running secret death camps for the infected, etc.<p>9) Policy-wise, we need to keep the rate of infection low enough such that the medical system is not overloaded. This is possible, as it&#x27;s been done in multiple countries, and that&#x27;s the difference between a severe-but-normal flu season and over a million dead in the USA. We also have to start taking decisive action yesterday, with today being a second best option."],"time":["2020-03-06 10:36:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Grue3"],"id":[22502298],"kids":[22502336],"parent":[22501702],"text":["South Korea already has huge experience with SARS <i>and<\/i> MERS.

I like to make a card as soon as I come across something interesting, but the delay to get Anki started, and to create the card, etc just makes it frustrating.

This is effective because it&#x27;s a quick way to make cards, thus solving the problem of slow card creation.<p>3. I fared better with lots of small, one-sentence cards.

Some things I&#x27;ve had used it for to great success:<p>1. Memorizing Japanese vocabulary, pitch-accent, and basic grammar rules. It would probably be useful, at least to some degree, for any language like this.<p>2. Any certification which required strict memorization. All the basic ComptTIA certs were like this, and the CCNA:R&amp;S cert (unfortunately) required memorizing commands and their syntax.<p>3. Verses in the Bible (though this is pretty basic in comparison, just Address &lt;-&gt; Text).<p>In all honestly I think one of the best things you can do if you need to memorize something is make the flash cards yourself, whether with Anki, another app, or even just index cards. This forces you to think about what it is that you&#x27;re trying to memorize and phrase the text of the cards in a way that you understand. After that, reviewing is just kind of &quot;maintenance&quot; in my opinion. There was definitely a marked difference in my retention when I was using pre-made Anki decks vs. creating them myself. It is also easier to create cards using the desktop app.<p>It&#x27;s a side note, but I also don&#x27;t agree with Anki&#x27;s pricing model. The app is free on Android[1] but $25 on iOS[2]. I think I heard (I don&#x27;t have a source) that the developer&#x27;s justification was that they needed to make money from the all the time and effort they spent creating Anki, plus hosting costs, etc - so why not do a cheaper price on both Android&#x2F;iOS, or do a free-to-download app with a subscription model?

But that&#x27;s just my two cents.<p>------&gt;8------ quoting from the article ------&gt;8------<p>We should point out that when our specialists contacted Intel PSIRT to report the vulnerability, Intel said the company was already aware of it (CVE-2019-0090). Intel understands they cannot fix the vulnerability in the ROM of existing hardware. So they are trying to block all possible exploitation vectors. The patch for CVE-2019-0090 addresses only one potential attack vector, involving the Integrated Sensors Hub (ISH). We think there might be many ways to exploit this vulnerability in ROM. Some of them might require local access; others need physical access.<p>As a sneak peek, here are a few words about the vulnerability itself:<p>1. The vulnerability is present in both hardware and the firmware of the boot ROM. Most of the IOMMU mechanisms of MISA (Minute IA System Agent) providing access to SRAM (static memory) of Intel CSME for external DMA agents are disabled by default. We discovered this mistake by simply reading the documentation, as unimpressive as that may sound.<p>2. Intel CSME firmware in the boot ROM first initializes the page directory and starts page translation. IOMMU activates only later. Therefore, there is a period when SRAM is susceptible to external DMA writes (from DMA to CSME, not to the processor main memory), and initialized page tables for Intel CSME are already in the SRAM.<p>3. MISA IOMMU parameters are reset when Intel CSME is reset. After Intel CSME is reset, it again starts execution with the boot ROM.<p>Therefore, any platform device capable of performing DMA to Intel CSME static memory and resetting Intel CSME (or simply waiting for Intel CSME to come out of sleep mode) can modify system tables for Intel CSME pages, thereby seizing execution flow.<p>------&gt;8------ quoting from the article ------&gt;8------"],"time":["2020-03-05 18:27:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dmitrygr"],"id":[22497561],"kids":[22497604,22498058,22501914,22516774],"parent":[22495251],"text":["It is telling that not a single comment here sees this as a bad thing.

Maybe this will be helpful to someone else:<p>Assumptions in CS complexity theory:<p>1. Turing showed that you can&#x27;t tell ahead of time if a program will run forever or eventually stop. This is the halting problem. It proves that some problems are impossible to solve with computers even with infinite memory and CPU.<p>2. But you can often verify if an answer to a problem is correct more easily than solving the problem itself.<p>3. But some problems are so difficult that even verifying if an answer is correct is seemingly impossible - like verifying some properties of an infinite graph of nodes. This is because the graph could be infinitely large, so you could never have enough memory in your computer to even number the nodes, let alone inspect them.<p>4. Sometimes if you can&#x27;t verify the solution with your own computer, you can use your computer to interrogate a more power computer to indirectly verify it. You ask inter-related questions that are easy to verify to the more power computer (called the &quot;prover&quot;) about it&#x27;s solution. If you get consistent answers back more frequently then chance, you can assume the entire solution is correct.<p>5. Going even further, you could have two &#x27;prover&#x27; computers and ask inter-related questions to both about the same solution. Since you can now cross-check their answers against each other, you are able to indirectly verify even more complex solutions. This is like a detective checking the stories if different witnesses against each other.<p>tl;dr - Some problems are unsolvable, but it may or may not be possible to verify a single solution. Computer scientists want to quantify the complexity of verifying these solutions.<p>Assumptions in Quantum Physics:<p>1. Particles can be &quot;entangled&quot;. This means that if you observe one particle, some other particle somewhere else will exhibit the exact same state change, as though they are connected by a mysterious communication channel.<p>2. This is super weird. Einstein thought it was so weird that he thought they must be missing something in their understanding.<p>3. Physicists created two separate mathematical models to describe how entanglement works: (A) the Tensor Product model, using finite dimension matrices and (B) the Commuting Operator mode, using infinite dimension matrices<p>tl;dr - Quantum Physics is so weird that they came up with two mathematical models for entanglement<p>Assumptions in Mathematics:<p>1. Because physicists said that the same physical property (entanglement) could be described either with infinite matrices or finite matrices, maybe you can approximate an infinite matrix using a finite matrix. This idea is the &#x27;Connes embedding conjecture&#x27;.<p>2. If finite and infinite matrices are actually interrelated by the Connes embedding conjecture, maybe it means that solving one means you solved the other.<p>tl;dr - The two quantum physics models inspired mathematicians to conjecture about the relationship between finite and infinite matrices<p>Back to Physics:<p>1. To prove that quantum entanglement exists in real life and isn&#x27;t just a math mistake, they came up with the idea of a &quot;nonlocal game&quot;. You set up a seemingly-random test where two &#x27;players&#x27; make guesses and the goal is to have them hit on the same guess more often than chance. If they win higher than chance, you can assume they are entangled.<p>2. Using those tests, they showed that quantum entanglement is real.<p>Back to Computer Science:<p>1. Computational complexity is not just a theory. &quot;The resources that computers need to solve and verify problems — time and memory — are fundamentally physical.&quot; If you change the rules physics, you can change the rules of computer science. Our understanding of quantum entanglement as a real thing thus changes the rules of what a computer can do.<p>2. If two entangled particles can behave in a correlated manner, you can (in theory) use that coordination to verify the solution to harder problems by using them as two &quot;provers&quot;. For example, you could have each particle randomly pick a node in your infinite graph and inspect a different edge. But since they are entangled, the two particles always pick the same node. That means you can use them to indirectly inspect an infinite graph and verify a previously unverifiable solution.<p>New CS discovery in the paper:<p>1. Entangled provers allow you to verify solutions to the unsolvable halting problem. That implies that you can also verify the solution to any problem easier than the halting problem using quantum particles.<p>2. This neat and re-writes the rules of CS complexity, but at a glance appears not very interesting to other fields.<p>New Implication for Physics:<p>1. Wait a sec! Since the problem you are verifying itself is unsolvable, this implies the two mathematical models of quantum entanglement are NOT equivalent (more details in article).<p>New Implication for Math:<p>1. This means the Connes embedding conjecture (which said we can estimate an infinite-dimension matrix from from a finite dimension matrix) is also definitely FALSE.<p>So in the process of computer scientists trying to clarify the bounds of computational complexity theory, they accidentally re-wrote the rules of quantum physics and invalidated a major mathematical assumption. But the CS researchers aren&#x27;t physicists or classical mathematicians, so they don&#x27;t even claim to fully understand the cross-discipline implications of what they discovered."],"time":["2020-03-05 12:32:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lacker"],"id":[22489467],"kids":[22489542],"parent":[22488927],"text":["I am impressed by Quanta&#x27;s dedication to trying to make cutting-edge theoretical mathematics comprehensible.

Kubernetes is very well designed, a pleasure to learn and a breeze to use. This article seems to be about setting up your own Kubernetes cluster.

Once you learn Docker you can take advantage of things like deploying an app as a Docker image to Azure, on-demand Azure Container Instances and so on.

Learn about Kubernetes&#x27; Pods (one or more Containers that <i>must<\/i> reside on the same machine to work), ReplicaSets (run multiple copies of a Pod), Services (exposes a microservice internally using DNS), Deployments (lets you reliably roll out new software versions without downtime, and restarts pods if they die) and Ingress (HTTP load balancing). You may also need to learn PersistentVolumes and StatefulSets.<p>The awesome parts of Kubernetes include the kubectl exec command which lets you log into any container without almost any setup or password, kubectl logs to view stdout from your process, kubectl cp to copy files in and out, kubectl port-forward to make remote services appear to be running on your dev box, and so on."],"time":["2020-03-05 16:39:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jblake"],"id":[22491696],"kids":[22495696,22491934],"parent":[22491170],"text":["I run a Saas business solo, for eight years now, netting six figures, and I&#x27;ve been on Heroku the entire time for just under $1,000 a month.

People choose it because they think there&#x27;s no other option (and they&#x27;re somewhat right). But there&#x27;s Nomad, DC&#x2F;OS, Docker Swarm (for a little bit anyway), ECS, GKE, etc. That&#x27;s still not a ton of options, but there are options.<p>That&#x27;s just microservice orchestration. That&#x27;s a small part of the totality of things needed to implement a full-out SDLC. You can&#x27;t just build Kubernetes and think you&#x27;re done; your code will need to integrate into a lot more stuff, and you&#x27;ll end up writing 10 layers of glue because that&#x27;s just how many use cases you have to support.<p>And it&#x27;s weird that all that glue doesn&#x27;t use standards. I mean, we have TCP&#x2F;IP &amp; RPC &amp; REST, we have pipes &amp; filehandles, we have the OCI specs. That gets us to a point where (at most) half of the stack of an architecture is portable and interoperable with any system following those standards. But then there&#x27;s every <i>other<\/i> component of the architecture that connects all the pieces together, meaning you&#x27;re writing glue that will only work for one implementation. Change your implementation, and you have to change your glue, and probably more stuff.<p>I think a lot of that non-reusable glue could be erased if it all followed standards, such that the configuration and operation of each part followed a standard interface, set of data types, etc. Tools and libraries could just &quot;talk container orchestrator&quot; or &quot;talk load balancer&quot; or &quot;talk object storage&quot; or &quot;talk secrets management&quot;, and virtually any component could be integrated into any other, by virtue of either a system-wide or application-specific configuration.<p>You could argue we have something like that now with a &quot;kubectl file&quot; or similar, but that&#x27;s not only still platform-specific, but other tools don&#x27;t speak it, so K8s has to do everything, because it&#x27;s the only thing that speaks its language (config file&#x2F;backend data store&#x2F;IAM&#x2F;secrets&#x2F;roles&#x2F;etc).<p>Rather than resign ourselves to those limitations, we could bundle everything in an implementation-agnostic standard way with standard interfaces. The exact same configuration (as code) could be used to run the same complete architecture on a dozen different platforms, because every component would speak the same language and handle all the other components in the same ways. The backend services could all translate the standard based on how they were configured, such that generic instructions are then translated into implementation-specific actions. You could really write your architecture once and run it anywhere, without the caveat of &quot;anywhere <i>on this platform only<\/i>&quot;.<p>I feel like we&#x27;re not talking about doing that because we keep getting caught up in &quot;Fuck, Kubernetes is pretty hard&quot; conversations. Yeah, it&#x27;s hard; building and operating an 18-wheeler is hard. But what about the roads? What about the gas stations? What about the containers we put on the trucks? All that stuff is standard, and so we don&#x27;t have to worry about what implementation of gas station or road we use.

It&#x27;s true, gitflow is not a silver bullet for every single situation, and if you&#x27;ve got a more complex situation than a single team working on a single project, you&#x27;re probably going to need something that takes the complexity of your situation into account. It&#x27;s also true that gitflow might be a bit too detailed and complex for simpler situations, but you can easily drop parts of it. It&#x27;s not a universal solution to everything, but it&#x27;s a decent basis to start from, particularly if you have no idea how else to organise your git workflow. Because everybody using their own approach without any coordination is definitely going to be worse.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Gitflow abandons rebasing&quot;<\/i><p>It doesn&#x27;t entirely do that, but it does abandon rebasing in situations where it should be abandoned. Rebasing is dangerous. Rebasing changes your history, and as any time-traveler knows, messing with history is risky. If you change history that you already shared, you can end up duplicating it and making a mess.<p>Rebasing is only ever fine for local changes, and you can still use it there in gitflow. But if you merge a feature that took some time to develop, into the develop branch, rebasing is a terrible idea, and it should really be done with a merge.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Gitflow violates the “Short-lived” branches rule&quot;<\/i><p>Is that a rule? Some features really do take time to develop. Any workflow has to account for longer lived branches. Also, if code has to be reviewed before it can be merged, that also extends the lifetime of branches. Fortunately big merge conflicts are easily prevented by regularly pulling the latest develop into the feature branch.<p>And any situation where you have multiple people potentially changing the same file, is going to lead to merge conflicts no matter what git workflow you use.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Gitflow makes Continuous Delivery Improbable<\/i>&quot;<p>Nonsense. Once code has been merged into develop, it&#x27;s ready to deploy. Well, I suppose this one is correct if you consider dropping even the tiniest part of gitflow as completely abandoning gitflow; all continuous delivery teams I&#x27;ve seen, don&#x27;t use explicit release branches; they just deploy develop (or merge to master and then auto-deploy that).<p>The only argument the article uses here is &quot;look at all those lines and dots! this can never work!&quot; Well, it can and does.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in teams that use short release cycles, up to daily, and use a workflow that&#x27;s pretty close to gitflow. It&#x27;s a decent default to start from, but if you&#x27;re working in a more complex environment, with multiple teams working on the same code base, parts of which need to be releasable independently from the rest, then yes, gitflow might not fit your need.

This post is the first announcement of our project apart from our thus-far non-populated subreddit. No one&#x27;s discovered us yet. We&#x27;ve only told one person in the world before right now. We&#x27;re new to developing and we&#x27;re very humble and willing to learn, so any suggestions and help is welcome.<p>What we aren&#x27;t as humble about is the potential we think this application has. HiddenVM allows full-scale anti-forensic use of any desktop OS. (No longer just Tails.) If you place your installed files inside good deniable encryption like VeraCrypt, it means that no digital trace of your chosen OS is left on your hard drive or can be forensically proven to exist. That is significant.<p>There are many reasons why you may want to use HiddenVM. Some use cases include:<p>- You&#x27;re a spy protecting national security and you need to leave no digital trace on the hard drive of the computer you just used.<p>- Law enforcement agents conducting sensitive investigations.<p>- Diplomats, politicians, and military personnel.<p>- Whistle-blowers needing to safely carry their information in any situation.<p>- Activists, dissidents, political asylum seekers, and journalists in need of stronger protection of their information from corrupt governments when their equipment is forcibly seized. (We know that the risk of the rubber hose remains a complex problem and limitation of encryption.) Now that you can use Windows once you set it up inside Tails, keeping your data private could become easier for you.<p>Border agents forcibly invade our privacy and potentially steal our secrets with no respect to who we are or what our rights are. We need tech solutions to protect our data. More use cases include:<p>- Lawyers carrying sensitive client information.<p>- People in business protecting their IP or trade secrets.<p>- Tactics in fighting against corporate espionage. It could be expensive or impossible to sue for someone&#x27;s unlawful intrusion into your data. Easier to technologically prevent them in the first place.<p>- Protect your basic privacy and dignity for any of the one thousand other reasons why privacy matters.<p>- You travel a lot and you want to use Windows&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;Linux in a way that prevents malware code from being forcibly installed inside your operating system simply because you entered a country.<p>- Digital currency: store a more private Bitcoin wallet. Secure your assets against unwanted and unwarranted access. When data literally is money you have a lot to lose.<p>- Domestic violence victims, and people in other dangerous situations in life.<p>Data privacy is a human right. If you don&#x27;t want someone searching your naked body and violating your dignity in that way, why should your data be any different? Airport border agents not only perform a full digital strip search, but they&#x27;re also potentially stealing your data or implanting spyware and malware without you knowing. It is a devastating act.<p>Using Tails should never be reason to suspect you are a criminal or a spy. It also protects basic data privacy and democracy. Tails should become a standard USB that anyone who values their digital safety carries around in their briefcase, bag, purse or wallet. We hope our application increases the size of the Tails user base.<p>Thank you for your interest.

Here are some anecdotes I&#x27;ve observed from parenting information asymmetry:<p>1. A lot of young parents (think: less than 20 years old) show up at the ER with healthy crying babies and little or no information.  When I was pre-med track and shadowed my father in the ER, I would see 3 or 4 of these parents in a 12 hour shift.  Watching my father &quot;bootstrap&quot; each of these parents into what normal clinical baby behavior is prior to any health diagnosis was interesting: It was essentially a 30 minute 101 session about babies that are super important but also non-obvious.  It was also obvious that the lessons really sunk in when it came from a third party clinician.  It also wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see the baby parents and the parent&#x27;s parents in the ER, all taking notes.<p>2. For my mother (the clinical psychologist), I&#x27;ve observed that even highly-educated, well-resourced parents still struggle with everything necessary to learn when having an autistic child.  These sessions would often range from immediate clinical needs, to year-by-year details of specific education needs for the rest of childhood, to the region and state-specific financial resources and saving accounts available for lifetime planning.  My mother works with schools and publishes papers on this stuff, but the parents always came back because ability to have a very direct Q-and-A session about specific issues was incredibly valuable.<p>Anyway, my father is retiring soon but I&#x27;ll tell my mother about your service.  She can&#x27;t travel as much but if it works via video chat, she may be up for taking sessions on it."],"time":["2020-03-05 20:15:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jawns"],"id":[22496459],"kids":[22496674],"parent":[22496163],"text":["I&#x27;m an author of child-development books and spend a lot of time keeping abreast of research-backed parenting advice, so this is really interesting to me.<p>It seems like you need to position this service very carefully, since there is likely not a bright line between some of the issues parents might come to you for, versus seeing a pediatrician, behavioral health provider, or other health care provider.<p>And indeed, traditionally that&#x27;s where parents would go with some of these issues (sleep issues, tantrums, etc.).<p>But your FAQs emphasize that you&#x27;re not a health care service -- yet I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if parents rely on you to at least bring up when a health care provider should be brought into the loop.<p>Just out of curiosity, what would you say this service is intended to replace?

My friend introduced a well kempt, multilingual man with an education, an admirable history and sincerity who had simply fallen off the society&#x27;s radar. The most of them seemed to be just getting by on little more than hope and memory, they were not just the aged, the mentally ill, desperados and addicts.
