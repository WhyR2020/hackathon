In other words, we tend to see<p><pre><code>    H(info || msg)\n<\/code><\/pre>\ninstead of<p><pre><code>    H(msg || info)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThere are some good reasons to prefer append to prepend. One practical reason is that---related to what&#x27;s discussed in the article---if we have to compute two values<p><pre><code>    H(msg || info_1)\n    H(msg || info_2)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nwe can do this with just one pass over msg (though admittedly in a non-blackbox way, namely, by saving an intermediate state of the hash computation). In contrast, for a well-designed hash function there should not be any way to save work when computing<p><pre><code>    H(info_1 || msg)\n    H(info_2 || msg)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nand this lack of work savings is one of the reasons we tend to get prehash modes.<p>In addition, prepending to msg comes with a range of subtle security issues. As an example, for Merkle-Damgaard hashes like SHA-2 a proper prefix design needs to pad the prefix to a multiple of H&#x27;s block length. This is to ensure that msg starts on a block boundary, which means that the hash digests as much of msg as possible in a single invocation of the compression function. Otherwise, if msg is short and it gets broken across a block boundary, this can make meet-in-the-middle--style attacks easier.<p>In contrast, appending the info string guarantees that msg starts at a block boundary, which is a small nicety. Moreover, one can easily guarantee in a black-box way (and independent of the value&#x2F;encoding&#x2F;&amp;c of the info string) that msg <i>ends<\/i> at a block boundary (just by padding msg). This can be useful as a defense against some kinds of power analysis in the case that msg is a secret [1].<p>To be sure: appending also requires care---and care is always required when a Merkle-Damgaard hash! (Sponges like SHA-3 are more resistant to misuse.) At the very least, whatever is appended to msg should be prefix-free, and you will likely want to stop length extension attacks and related issues (see [2] for further discussion of this).<p>But in general my take is that the set of footguns for append is a subset of the prepend ones, and I hope that more folks go towards appending in the future.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;985\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;985<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.nyu.edu&#x2F;~dodis&#x2F;ps&#x2F;merkle.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.nyu.edu&#x2F;~dodis&#x2F;ps&#x2F;merkle.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-13 22:09:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dathinab"],"id":[22572073],"kids":{},"parent":[22569716],"text":["Don&#x27;t confuse EdDSA with ECDSA, I was stumped for a moment until I realized my mistake ;=)"],"time":["2020-03-14 01:37:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jchook"],"id":[22573129],"kids":[22573588],"parent":[22569716],"text":["To be sure, none of these are quantum-ready."],"time":["2020-03-14 05:12:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chriswininger1"],"id":[22564103],"kids":{},"parent":[22556642],"text":["Did you ever come across the work of Johnathan w Mills and his extended analog computer.

The difference with this lens is that it doesn&#x27;t have a single point of focus, instead light is focused onto many planes, simultaneously with equal power of light focused onto each plane. In this paper the planes were chosen to be between 5 and 1200mm. A clever computer algorithm calculates the exact shape of the lens to get this distribution given a specific wavelength of light.<p>The end result is a lens which has amazing depth of field but the trade off of only operating well at a single frequency and poor efficiency. Most of the incoming light is being focused on a plane that the sensor isn&#x27;t on. Indeed at 1200mm it has an equivalent f-number of 555 requiring some insanely bright lighting and long exposure time to get a good image.<p>I can&#x27;t see many real world applications of this camera given the downsides but in a world of more computational photography this could be one part of a better imaging system."],"time":["2020-03-13 21:52:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kragen"],"id":[22568287],"kids":[22569318,22569136,22569833,22569733,22569235],"parent":[22566164],"text":["The abstract: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osapublishing.org&#x2F;optica&#x2F;abstract.cfm?uri=optica-7-3-214\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osapublishing.org&#x2F;optica&#x2F;abstract.cfm?uri=optica...<\/a><p>The paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osapublishing.org&#x2F;optica&#x2F;viewmedia.cfm?uri=optica-7-3-214&amp;seq=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osapublishing.org&#x2F;optica&#x2F;viewmedia.cfm?uri=optic...<\/a><p>I&#x27;ve only skimmed it, but it looks super interesting.<p>I was expecting some kind of computational holography wizardry, but no, it&#x27;s just a multilayer diffractive lens with circular symmetry which produces a beam with a really stretched-out waist.<p>Usually diffractive lenses are limited to a single wavelength — they&#x27;re using 850 nm.

Our underlying schema is fairly gnarly due to multiple rounds of regulation-driven changes to our data model so directly querying the Postgres DB isn’t really feasible for most of the team that does basic analysis.<p>Pricing is fine&#x2F;cheap for what it could make possible for business intelligence&#x2F;analytics."],"time":["2020-03-14 20:33:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["corry"],"id":[22568818],"kids":[22569026],"parent":[22567557],"text":["Cool idea guys, congrats on the launch especially given it was mid-batch.<p>I&#x27;m not in the market for something like this but it resonates with me since a few times now we&#x27;ve run into the need to jury-rig some scripts to pull data from a MySQL DB to populate a Google Sheet, which then does some simple calc&#x2F;re-packaging for display on a dashboard or other simple BI use-case.

However, much as I love it, for about 6 years now I&#x27;ve been drawn away to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup[1], which has in some ways evolved past Nethack.<p>One of the main draws to DCSS for me has been its autoexplore feature, which makes exploring the dungeon much less of a chore than it was in Nethack.  It also has much better use of color in text mode (the only mode I play both games in).  Then it has an enormous variety of gods, powers, races, classes, and spells.<p>Unfortunately, it does have some downsides compared to Nethack.  The interactions with gods, shops, and pets tends to be richer and more complex in Nethack.  The things you can do to and with items is as well.  The trend in DCSS has been to kind of dumb it down over the years, taking away friction points that made it more complex and thus (arguably) less fun for a certain kind of player.  My own taste is for more complexity and more options, so I&#x27;m not a huge fan of going in that direction, but I still stick with DCSS because it&#x27;s great despite that.<p>You can play and watch other people play the game by ssh&#x27;ing in to crawl.akrasiac.org, with a username and password of &quot;joshua&quot; (a reference to the classic 80&#x27;s hacking movie Wargames).<p>Another game, in some ways very different but in other ways very much in the spirit of both of these games that I&#x27;ve really enjoyed has been Path of Exile.[2]  It&#x27;s not minimalist like Nethack or DCSS, but it definitely has a lot of roguelike elements and is pretty complicated for a mainstream, modern game of this sort, and is a worthy successor of both of these games, in my eyes.

If you want to make an incredible difference in someone&#x27;s life, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!<p>There are cool computer science problems involved: imagine person A1 wants to donate their kidney to their partner A2 but they aren&#x27;t a match. Now imagine many such pairs exist (B1&#x2F;B2, C1&#x2F;C2, D1&#x2F;D2 etc.) and you start noticing that while A1 can&#x27;t donate to A2, they <i>can<\/i> donate to B2, and B1 can donate to C2, and so on! Thus the kidney chain is born. You get everyone together and have them agree that if their partner gets a kidney donation, they&#x27;ll pass on the favor to someone else. All that&#x27;s needed is a single purely-altruistic donor to start the fire. The longest such chain has reached over 100 people! [1]<p>Anyway, the surgery is laparoscopic and has an extremely low fatality rate: around 1&#x2F;10,000, which is an order of magnitude lower than the all-cause mortality rate for living a single year of your 20s. The kidney is a fairly isolated organ, basically only attached to you via the renal artery&#x2F;vein, the ureter (which carries urine to your bladder), and some fascia (internal connective tissue). You can see a full video of the surgery at [2] (if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing). I was walking within hours of the surgery, discharged within two days, and back in the gym within 5 weeks. My life is not any different than pre-donation, and if anything goes wrong with my remaining kidney I go to the top of the donation wait-list!

Our results indicated that the SL-CoV S protein is unable to use ACE2 proteins of different species for cell entry and that SARS-CoV S protein also failed to bind the ACE2 molecule of the horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus pearsonii. However, when the RBD of SL-CoV S was replaced with that from the SARS-CoV S, the hybrid S protein was able to use the huACE2 for cell entry, implying that the SL-CoV S proteins are structurally and functionally very similar to the SARS-CoV S. These results suggest that although the SL-CoVs discovered in bats so far are unlikely to infect humans using ACE2 as a receptor, it remains to be seen whether they are able to use other surface molecules of certain human cell types to gain entry. It is also conceivable that these viruses may become infectious to humans if they undergo N-terminal sequence variation, for example, through recombination with other CoVs, which in turn might lead to a productive interaction with ACE2 or other surface proteins on human cells.<\/i><p>Look at the authors:<p><i>Zhengli Shi<\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shi_Zhengli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shi_Zhengli<\/a><p><i>She is a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

All of these aspects are intertwined:<p>Work: More people will work more time from home and many firms will switch to virtually full time remote with limited physical gathering.  This will decrease the cost of office rents and alter the work&#x2F;life balance.  It will affect wages because people can live outside of city centers and still work so companies will pay less.

More and more business meetings will be replaced with voice and video conferencing.  There was no big driver other than some cost reduction here, but now safety and security will be the big drivers here.  Global pandemic concerns (prevention, containment) will complicate travel to varying degrees, and in a way that most US citizens aren&#x27;t used to - it will affect interstate travel, not just trans-national travel.<p>Entertainment: Many of the sports that have been deferred or canceled will likely be replaced with other forms of entertainment that can be viewed on television or the Internet.

Many wireless carriers have started doing &quot;deprioritization&quot; after a certain amount of usage which is a lot more consumer friendly.  If the network has capacity, heavy users see no difference in their connection.  If the network is capacity constrained, it favors lighter users so that they get their money&#x27;s worth.<p>My school did this when I was an undergrad.  The top 100 users on campus often used more than half the bandwidth.  That was fine and the school was more than happy for them to use the internet heavily - the connection had already been paid for, might as well have it used.  However, the school did put them at a lower priority when there was congestion.  Most of the heavy users didn&#x27;t even notice.<p>I&#x27;m really hopeful that wireless technologies will improve competition over the next decade.  If three wireless companies can provide home broadband competition in the future, we won&#x27;t be beholden to the single provider that most of us deal with now.  AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile all bought a bunch of millimeter wave spectrum in the latest auction (in addition to their current holdings).  T-Mobile is gearing up for a big home broadband push.  They&#x27;re hoping to have 9.5M home broadband customers in the next three years which would probably make them the third largest after Comcast and Charter who have around 26-27M I believe (and around double Fios&#x27; customer base).

Here goes:<p>The official number of cases in the US as reported by Campbell is 1084, with 33 dead. This number roughly tallied with what I see on the CDC site (they report 938 cases, 28 dead) [2].<p>The major of Seattle estimates there around 1100 infections in this city (source: Campbell&#x27;s video), a number which could grow to about 70.000 in 6 weeks (source: Campbell&#x27;s video, most likely based on the spread in Wuhan)<p>Seattle has a population of around 750.000 people, i.e. 0.146% of the population carries the infection.<p>The total population of the USA is around 328 million. 95% of the USA land mass consists of rural area with a total population of around 60 million (~20%), the other 80% of the population lives in metropolitan areas (source: Wikipedia).<p>If the infection rate of Seattle is used as a guide for the infection rate for the entire metropolitan population in the USA there are about  390.000 infected people in the country at the moment. While it is unlikely that this infection rate goes for the entire metropolitan population it is not out of the question given the high mobility of people in the USA.
