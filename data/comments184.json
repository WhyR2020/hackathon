With C, you risk old autoconf scripts breaking, depending on library versions that operating systems don&#x27;t include anymore, compilers learning how to exploit undefined behaviour they didn&#x27;t exploit before, programs breaking due to making incorrect assumptions (`char` is signed, right?). C++ also adds exciting issues in terms of backwards compatibility breaks (for instance, programs using `register` keyword won&#x27;t work since C++14) - refer to Annex C in C++ specification for a long list of BC breaks.<p>None of this is an issue in Rust. Cargo is a proper build system, not a weird combination of shell script and M4 using programs that are prone to breaking changes (like awk). Cargo requires defining program dependencies and prevents accidentally using a dependency that exists on an operating system. Rust in safe code avoids undefined behaviour, noticeably avoiding the risk of accidental undefined behaviour. Rust has much less implementation-defined behaviour than C (`i8` is a well defined type). Rust edition system means that breaking changes avoid affecting old code (even if Rust were to, say, remove `static mut` in edition 2024, this change wouldn&#x27;t affect programs that wouldn&#x27;t explicitly upgrade to edition 2014).<p>Rust is serious about backwards compatibility. Breaking changes are mostly unacceptable (other than in cases of soundness bugs, but even then there is typically a warning cycle before fixing a bug). In fact, you may take a look at &quot;Compatibility notes&quot; sections in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;RELEASES.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;RELEASES.md<\/a>. The compatibility breaks tend to be very minor, and unlikely to break stuff. For instance, in Rust 1.39, `asinh(-0.0)` was changed to return `-0.0` instead of `0.0`. Strictly speaking a breaking change, but a program depending on that is very very unlikely. Rust also has crater which prevents accidentally breaking backwards compatibility by testing whether every public GitHub repository and crates.io library still works the same way. Additionally, even in case program compilation breaks anyway, it&#x27;s possible to use an older version of a compiler with rustup.<p>Rust is here to stay. Even if Mozilla ended up supporting the project, some other company that uses Rust internally would continue to support it. It&#x27;s free software after all. Even if that wouldn&#x27;t happen, the old rustc releases would still work."],"time":["2020-02-14 13:36:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gameswithgo"],"id":[22323320],"kids":{},"parent":[22315788],"text":["usually the argument to keep using a bad language is “but we have all this stuff we built and we don’t have that in newer things so we can’t easily change”.  but this is a new take!  we can’t use new languages because we expect only these flawed ones to live FOREVER"],"time":["2020-02-14 02:54:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loopz"],"id":[22322214],"kids":{},"parent":[22315788],"text":["New programming languages should address this concern.

That isn&#x27;t to say that names are poor, it&#x27;s just that the principles and importance of names is often not understood. What&#x27;s the difference between a user-facing mass-market brand name versus package or component names? Why can I happily talk to my team about Drupal and everyone from the PM down to the intern are on board, but mention it to even the more savvy of end users and they glaze over? Why can&#x27;t I just give a list of packages from the apt repository to my father and expect him to crack on with it in the same way I would if I put him in front of the Apple App store or Play store?<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure this book is going to be about naming things <i>within<\/i> codebases or within the technical community, however I still find myself disagreeing with his list of principles in the next page over.<p>&gt; 1. Consistency - Each concept should be represented by a single, unique name.<p>Agree and disagree. I agree that the same concept in the same context with the same audience will need a consistent name so that there is no confusion, but names are used to convey extra bits of information. Consider &quot;headache tablet&quot; vs &quot;Paracetamol&quot; vs &quot;N-acetyl-para-aminophenol&quot;. Different audiences, different needs, different information being conveyed. Arguably the same component for a different concept, but even so it breaks the notion of consistency. In Mathematics we use different notation for the same concepts sometimes in order for our ideas to be expressed more succinctly or for our workings&#x2F;thinking to be clearer. The same is true in tech.<p>The secret isn&#x27;t to name sparingly, it is to name <i>well<\/i>.<p>&gt; 2. Understandability - A name should describe the concept it represents.<p>This is good in principle, but one concept could have many applications. I think sometimes we are limited in how we think about things merely by how they&#x27;re named. As noted above, names can have certain assumptions baked into them which, while subtle, can block other forms of thinking. Even taking something like &#x27;Object&#x27; from OOP can be misleading. You don&#x27;t always have an object for a solid thing, a well-defined business concept&#x2F;entity etc. The object itself only makes sense to those working at the same level of abstraction as the code which may only be the developers of that specific application. The term &#x27;object&#x27; itself, then, becomes only meaningful as a programming concept, it doesn&#x27;t actually describe what the thing is other than &quot;a collection of stuff with things you can do to it attached&quot;.<p>&gt; 3. Specificity - A name shouldn’t be overly vague or overly specific.<p>I&#x27;ve touched on this above, but in this specific case we&#x27;re aiming for a middle of the road please-everyone-but-no-one approach where the name is neither descriptive or catchy enough for people to remember, specific enough for people to find useful in practice or intuitive enough for people to build up mental models around.<p>&gt; 4. Brevity - A name should be neither overly short nor overly long.<p>If you make it too short then everyone will only be able to name your concept with qualifiers. If you make it too long then people will abbreviate so that it is no longer unique. If you have multiple names for multiple purposes you break the &#x27;single consistent&#x27; name principle above. Long names have uses. Short names have uses too.<p>&gt; 5. Searchability - A name should be easily found across code, documentation, and other resources.<p>I like this. I think every project&#x2F;concept needs to have at least one name that is specific and unique enough that you can use it to find exactly what you need to. I do, however, think that the name is only part of this. You also need unique combinations of names&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;verbs in order for you to find the specific thing that you need.<p>&gt; 6. Pronounceability - A name should be easy to use in common speech.<p>Again, depends on the purpose. (pentacyclo[4.4.0.02,5.03,8.04,7]decane) is technically pronounceable but cumbersome in casual conversation. It is also unique and descriptive. Everything has its place.<p>&gt; 7. Austerity - A name should not be clever or rely on temporary concepts.<p>Sometimes these are good, sometimes they turn sour. I agree that the Gnu Image Manipulation Program should have a more savoury name if it genuinely wants to serve the needs of a mass audience. I also like that `less` is `more` - a joke that means that the `less` command doesn&#x27;t really describe its function or give the user any clue about its place in the ecosystem without using it or looking it up.<p>So yes, I think ultimately some of these are &quot;no, that won&#x27;t work&quot; and others are &quot;it depends&quot;. A nice, albeit somewhat cryptic, explanation of names is discussed at various points in Patrick Rothfuss&#x27; <i>Kingkiller Chronicle<\/i>.

And Kordestani admitted his past job of building from within the company is atypical for a big CEO (typical of Facebook) who may need to shape the future of a business outside the core team. He may find out how much of the potential of AR is already in its top app Facebook, where developers can shoot 3D models of stuffed animals or preschool objects in front of anyone’s faces, and how deeply Google was disrupted when its failed to move fast enough on VR before Facebook entered it.<p>But what it’s possible for Facebook and Apple to do is to lead the charge to develop a hardware- and&#x2F;or software-independent AR ecosystem of platforms and apps. An Android-powered AR headset, which seems like it’s on its way, could eventually compete with Google Cardboard, and maybe provide its own open-source AR platform. Why not have Windows Embedded system OEMs build AR goggles and similar headsets, as they already sell hardware that can run augmented reality apps?<p>That could attract hardware companies like Dell, Asus, HP and Lenovo, as well as game consoles like Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation. If Microsoft can muscle AR technology directly into the living room, it could make Oculus Rift obsolete. It could also entice developers away from Google’s $99 Daydream View AR headset which depends on smartphone technology, by throwing its weight behind hardware based on Windows 10. Meanwhile, Apple could cut out the middleman by making a standalone AR headset, although it already has a separate ARKit platform to create AR-themed apps for the iPhone and iPad. That way it could create a high-end AR headset for hardcore users like the kind of top manufacturers like LG, Sony, Samsung and Asus produce for their televisions and other gear.<p>At the same time, we’ll probably be stuck with Google’s Cardboard and Facebook’s Cardboard for a while. Google Cardboard’s track record is decent, and the ability to use Cardboard makes it easy to download and use a few AR apps that show other content than just pictures or blocks of text. Cardboard also does an excellent job of getting the platform out to more people than any other headset, with 45.8 million devices activated. But that’s less than half the number of Android-powered phones in the world as Android was running in early 2017. And from a hardware perspective, Google has a big advantage over Facebook, with plenty of current smartphones on its Cardboard list, including phones from Chinese manufacturers Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Coolpad.<p>Then again, Google’s Cardboard headsets have started rolling out to more devices, and Google has been open about the likelihood of an Android-powered Cardboard headset, touting the dual displays and better cameras that now ship with the Pixel. While the hardware definitely isn’t there yet for it to take the lead in AR, Google seems to be confident it can make it happen and give users the compelling AR app experiences they want.<p>Meanwhile, neither Apple nor Facebook has the fragmentation problems with apps or hardware needed to dominate AR, which could be killer differentiators. Apple, by the way, has super serious ambitions to produce its own AR technology. The growing possibility that Apple is making such a headset may finally make it uncomfortable for Apple to cede this killer platform to Google.<p>When a platform war erupts like iPhone and Android, it’s going to take everyone’s best devices to achieve victory. There may be companies that switch allegiances, but that would only make it more possible for Apple, Facebook, and Google to enter it just as one platform would. But how long will that last, and will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the ones to seize the battlefield?<p>I don&#x27;t touch&#x2F;favor &quot;good&quot; articles.

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>162 page PDF [last updated: February|4|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

My coworkers and I work out of coffee shops quite a bit and almost everyone who goes to work in a coffee shop is doing so in order to break out of the loneliness of their home and be around other people (next time you&#x27;re in a coffee shop, take note of how many people have laptops out). The problem though is that no one really interacts with people at coffee shops because everyone is at their own table on their laptops.<p>We heard this feedback so much that we started holding Work Clubs[0] at coffee shops where people can sit down with us at the same table and work together for a few hours. It&#x27;s not networking but it&#x27;s a way to meet other people during the workday while getting your work done. We&#x27;ve had people from many different industries, ages, and walks of life working together and forming business connections. It&#x27;s beneficial to the coffee shops too because when we all sit at the same table, order food and drinks, and it frees up other tables for more customers.<p>Our communities are growing in Portland, San Diego, and the SF Bay Area right now, so come work with us if you&#x27;re ever feeling lonely and need some IRL human interaction in your day!

(Which is essentially what status bars <i>are<\/i>: a very underpowered terminal-emulator only capable of showing the last line of stdout.)<p>But click [or tab into, or Ctrl-` to activate] the thing, and it’d “pop down”, adding more height to the window, if there’s room; or “pop up”, resizing the rest of the window narrower; or just overlay translucently on top, like in games with consoles.<p>Opening this wouldn’t give you a login shell, exactly—it’d be the stdin of the program. But the toolkit would hook the stdin and turn it into a REPL, based on the CORBA&#x2F;DCOM&#x2F;DBUS service-objects available in the program; and the GUI toolkit would then enhance this REPL, by introspecting these service-objects, to enable both textual autocomplete&#x2F;auto-validate of commands, and the drawing of these sorts of graphical command-palettes. (But you’d be able to “shell out” to process these objects with commands, like you could in scripting languages.)<p>Or, to put that another way: Plan9’s Acme editor is a cool idea, making the whole editor into interface where you can just write magic runes on the walls and then activate them.

There are a couple of things about Bob I&#x27;d like to state, just so it&#x27;s here for future readers, as I had hoped to answer questions about the software.<p>1. Bob is an electron application that also is a Handshake resolver and full node - you can find these projects at:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;handshake-org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;handshake-org<\/a><p>2. We&#x27;re looking for contributors and help of all kinds!  Like any other open-source project, bug reports, suggestions, and contributions are very much welcome.  Personally, my concerns as an engineer are around the scalability of the UI (electron can be hard to work with) when many (possibly hundreds) of domains are being watched or bid on. This is behaviour I believe is possible to see, from observing early internet domainers.<p>3. Like many non-custodial &#x27;wallet&#x27; projects, it is meant to be a reasonable alternative to exchange custody, but we don&#x27;t provide any guarantees as the user is responsible for self-custody. We intend to add hardware wallet support in the future.  The goal is for the average person to have an easier time working with Handshake and Handshake names, by using Bob instead of a cli.<p>4. Bob is maintained by Kyokan, and I am the CEO there. It is not maintained by the Handshake team, and there is no Handshake foundation or business that runs the project.  Kyokan is a separate software engineering consultancy that is working on multiple projects - we are also not a part of the Handshake team.  Our contact info for security disclosures is in the repo.<p>5. Name Auctions and Airdrop claims on Handshake&#x27;s mainnet start today (in under 8 hours), so it felt appropriate to share this repo, which we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time and effort working on.  One can also find details about this in the repo, but we all hope you have a good time using the software!<p>Again, we&#x27;re looking for feedback and suggestions. Even in the process of making this post, I found a few bugs, filed them and made minor improvements to the documentation.

In the mid aughts I worked at the Sacramento Bee, which is also the HQ for McClatchy Corporate. Every financial quarter the CEO would go into the newsroom and break the news of how print ad revenue was falling, but digital ads were looking promising, with double digit percentage increases, and that someday soon would make up the shortfall (most everyone in the industry knew, without knowing the denominators, how unlikely that was).<p>What really screwed McClatchy over was that in 2006, it bought Knight-Ridder – then the 2nd biggest chain – for $4.5 billion [0]. Historically speaking, it wasn&#x27;t the worst deal on the face of it. But in retrospect, McClatchy bought when the price was highest, though it managed to quickly sell off a dozen papers shortly after for not terrible prices [1].<p>So along with the declining ad revenue, the CEO would also talk about the massive debt he had just acquired, and the amount of interest we were paying each quarter, but how, once this &quot;secular downturn&quot; got stabilized, the new acquisitions would start paying for themselves. I left the Bee before the first big layoffs hit, but I remember people being mostly &quot;whatever&quot; at the time and putting it out of sight and out of mind. As a regular rank-and-file person, not much you can do or fuss about when the CEO is making billion dollar deals.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;templates&#x2F;story&#x2F;story.php?storyId=5260417\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;templates&#x2F;story&#x2F;story.php?storyId=526041...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;mcclatchy-sells-5-papers-bought-from-knight-ridder.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;mcclatchy-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-13 19:01:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toomuchtodo"],"id":[22319169],"kids":[22319236],"parent":[22318609],"text":["Dig deep into the article to understand that, while this was caused by burdensome pension obligations, politics was heavily at play (and federal legislation [Secure Act] spared other journalistic publications with similar pension obligations)."],"time":["2020-02-13 17:49:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidw"],"id":[22319517],"kids":{},"parent":[22318609],"text":["There are financial costs to not having good local news:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citylab.com&#x2F;equity&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;study-when-local-newspaper-close-city-bond-finances-suffer&#x2F;561422&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citylab.com&#x2F;equity&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;study-when-local-news...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-13 18:26:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Shebanator"],"id":[22319985],"kids":{},"parent":[22318609],"text":["Love how they write an article about their own company&#x27;s bankruptcy, complaining about pensioners and discusses getting out from under pension obligations as a purely good thing, and never once mentions the economic impact on those pensioners."],"time":["2020-02-13 19:19:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cityzen"],"id":[22320060],"kids":{},"parent":[22318609],"text":["In 2017,  Forman’s take-home pay from McClatchy was $1.7 million, excluding restricted stock.

Instead of the old NEM1.0, where 1kWh of generation = 1kWh of usage credit, it&#x27;s bucketed by time of day. I actually thought NEM2.0 would be better for us than NEM1.0 -- we have generous peak hours (1pm-7pm) so we generate a TON of electricity off the roof at up to 38c&#x2F;kWh during the day, and consume most of our power at much lower rates overnight.

Personally, I do not see how they stay in business because their pricing is (in my opinion) egregious. $228&#x2F;mo for 10,000 monthly active users. However, they do have a free plan up to 7,000 monthly active users. The sheer volume of people who continually bring Auth0 up means that they either build products which never gain significant traction &amp; have never had to scale, or have money to blow. So there is the cost-factor argument.<p>B) While you can make the argument that the vast majority of people have accounts with SSO providers, I would play Devils Advocate and say that there also exist people who are uncomfortable either providing that identity regardless of the anonymity&#x2F;security meaures in place, or because they do not want to associate an identity from a primary authentication provider with your site&#x2F;service. So there is your please-the-people argument.<p>C) From a technical perspective it CAN be easier not to opt for SSO integration. What I mean by this is, for the past half-decade, the majority of the products I have built have used bcrypt-ed passwords. And that works just fine. For getting things off the ground you can go far with a solid password hash-and-compare implementation.<p>Something roughly like the following is free, super easy to implement, and covers a large percentage of usecases:<p>- Store password with an algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 on sign-up, compare on login<p>- Opt-in 2FA by using OTP via SMS or email<p>- Issue a SecureRandom session token each time a user logs, and use it as the identifying mechanism in a JWT or similar<p>- Make your auth logic verify the JWT and look the user up by the session token<p>- You can emulate the blacklisting&#x2F;all-token revoke functionality major auth providers have by clearing one&#x2F;all session tokens in the DB<p>I am sure someone who knows much, much more than me about security show up in the comments below this and tell me I am idiot, but this is my two-cents at least ¯\\_(<U+30C4>)_&#x2F;¯<p>(Side note edit: I think that there is a burgeoning problem in the developer community where new engineers reach for the easiest thing and wind up with a stack full of nothing but X-as-a-service, which in this case includes authentication. I am not sure how many junior devs could implement basic password-hash JWT authentication from scratch. The fact so many of them are readily paying $2,500&#x2F;yr per 10,000 users for JUST authentication is mildly terrifying)"],"time":["2020-02-13 03:00:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["omarish"],"id":[22314783],"kids":{},"parent":[22313973],"text":["&quot;A website written by someone who doesn&#x27;t understand enterprise pricing&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-13 03:18:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crmrc114"],"id":[22321486],"kids":{},"parent":[22320189],"text":["dupe; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22320289\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22320289<\/a><p>The above is a news article while this is the exact DOJ release.

The defendants’ activities, which included arranging for shipment of Huawei goods and services to end users in sanctioned countries, were typically conducted through local affiliates in the sanctioned countries.

For example, the code “A2” referred to Iran, and “A9” referred to North Korea.<p>edit from this superseding indictment itself:<p>&gt;For example, an official HUAWEI manual labeled “Top Secret” instructed certain individuals working for HUAWEI to conceal their employment with HUAWEI during encounters with foreign law enforcement officials.<p>&gt;Beginning in or about 2000, the defendants HUAWEI and FUTUREWEI misappropriated operating system source code for internet routers, command line interface (a structure of textual commands used to communicate with routers) and operating system manuals from a U.S. technology company headquartered in the Northern District of California (“Company 1”), an entity the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury, and incorporated the misappropriated source code into HUAWEI internet routers that FUTUREWEI sold in the United States from approximately April 2002 until December 2002.

Individual-3 wore a badge listing his employer as “Weihua,” HUAWEI spelled with its syllables reversed. In official correspondence with Company 3 shortly after this incident, HUAWEI claimed that Individual-3 attended the trade show in his personal capacity and that his attempted misappropriation occurred “without Huawei’s authorization.” According to a purported official statement published in Reuters, HUAWEI claimed, “This is a junior engineer who had never traveled to the United States before. His actions do not reflect the culture or values of Huawei.” Notably, a resume that Individual-3 submitted to the U.S. government in approximately 2012 stated that he had been a “senior R&amp;D Engineer” at HUAWEI from 1997 until July 2004, the time of the incident."],"time":["2020-02-13 20:17:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["use___net"],"id":[22324921],"kids":{},"parent":[22320189],"text":["what a sick joke"],"time":["2020-02-14 09:25:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["carlisle_"],"id":[22319166],"kids":[22339324,22319204],"parent":[22318130],"text":["This blog post seems more like a marketing grab with generic platitudes than it does genuinely helpful advice."],"time":["2020-02-13 17:49:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jagged-chisel"],"id":[22318719],"kids":[22318992],"parent":[22318130],"text":["&gt; In essence, bootstrapping your startup is the new cool thing.<p>I feel like this minimizes an important truth: that taking investment tends to mean losing control.

I said then and stand by it now that there is limited upside in Q&amp;A sites.<p>We saw this with ExpertSexChange years before. At first some quality content but ultimately the only growth is from low-value content, SEO, dark UX patterns (eg hiding answers, requiring logins, putting answers after a long set of ads) all for something that just isn&#x27;t that special.<p>Stackoverflow did an admirable job of organizing technical answers but ultimately Google remains their primary source of traffic (~90% was the last figure I heard) and by publishing their answers with a Creative Commons License (a move I applaud) they&#x27;ve insured the community against a later management change that would otherwise decide to enact those same dark patterns as the only viable growth path.<p>And yes I know there&#x27;s Stack Exchange but none of those sites has hit similar success to SO.<p>As for this post about Quora&#x27;s attempt to force binding individual arbitration on users, the first comment I have is of course I&#x27;m not surprised. The second is that IANAL but this this isn&#x27;t a contract, it&#x27;s an updated Terms of Service. That being said, I&#x27;m pretty sure this isn&#x27;t necessarily legal in all (any?) North American jurisdictions and even where that question is unknown it probably just hasn&#x27;t been tested in court yet.<p>I was going to say that Quora is based in California and CA has generally been pretty user-friendly here but that may not exactly be true. A couple of things I found:<p>- California law (specifically the California Arbitration Act or CAA) may be preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;). There&#x27;s a pending case in Federal Court where a stay has been issued against CAA pending that trial. It&#x27;s not clear to me (being NAL) if this is specific to certain areas (eg employment, construction) or general and whether it applies to updated ToS;<p>- A California court upheld an arbitration clause in clickwrap ToS on an app as of October 2019 [2]<p>My main takeaway however is I don&#x27;t care about Quora, I&#x27;ve never cared about Quora, I don&#x27;t understand why anyone cares about Quora, I&#x27;ve never posted to Quora and I&#x27;ve never understood why anyone else posted or continues to post to Quora so this has net zero effect on me.<p>Quora wasn&#x27;t (IMHO) relevant in 2012 and is less relevant now.

In that version of the world, shared warehouses (enabled by automation) will be even more cost-effective than Amazon&#x27;s proprietary warehouses.

We covered a wide range of methods for machining and shaping things, all out of metal.<p>Making gears was interesting, we had to first turn a rough blank of metal on a lathe to make a steel gear blank (about 12cm in diameter and 2cm thick) then drill out the center and broach a keyway for the axle that would go through the gear. This was all pretty straightforward, but the final piece of work was more difficult, it was cutting the teeth of the gear. The teeth of a properly made gear require complex shapes.<p>There are, as I recall, two ways to cut the teeth. Hobbing uses a helical cutting head turning on an axis that is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the gear. The cutting head and gear turn at the same time in a synchronized manner and the teeth are eventually cut out by the cutting head. See [1] for a video of a large complex gear being made this way.<p>The other method, broaching, uses a straight bar of tool steel that has thick straight across cutting teeth. The bar is pushed past the disk shaped gear blank. The cutting bar moves in a straight line parallel to the axis of the gear blank. Repeated passes over the gear blank cuts out the spaces between the gears teeth.<p>Master machinists taught us how to make these kinds of projects. They would produce a finished gear in about 15 minutes of instruction; then we would have something like two weeks to make the gear. They made everything look easy; it definitely wasn’t easy for me.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0rnTh6c19HM&amp;feature=share\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0rnTh6c19HM&amp;feature=share<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-13 06:42:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jvanderbot"],"id":[22312713],"kids":[22313526,22313800],"parent":[22310813],"text":["For me, nothing beats the mechanical calculator used to calculate torpedo firing solutions in WWII.

It is hard to replicate, and hard to compose with other elements. The illustrations are completely white when disabling JS, which is less than ideal graceful degradation. Some people would argue that executing custom scripts should not be required to show animated graphics, even if it includes basic interactivity.<p>For comparison, visit this page² and try to &#x27;inspect&#x27; animated graphics. Observe the SVG element in DOM and see how it changes when you scroll. Just by spending few minutes exploring you could probably recreate them, or at least reuse them somewhere else.

So ordering Rawls to decrypt the drives wouldn&#x27;t give the government any information it didn&#x27;t already have.

They&#x27;d have made millions by now.<p>Plus it&#x27;s not like you need to invest a shitton into up and coming artists. Most of them need a band, some recording studio hours, and some marketing. The marketing is probably the most expensive one, but SoundCloud has easy, free marketing: put the artist on the front page. If SC did this for maybe 25-50 artists a year, they could easily get a Billie Eilish or a mumble rapper or two. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s many other places to post music as a young artist.<p>Edit: Or even if SoundCloud can&#x27;t act as a record label for fear of stepping on actual record labels, they can still build a solid referral relationship. They have the ultimate first look deal."],"time":["2020-02-13 00:04:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m00dy"],"id":[22309168],"kids":[22309340],"parent":[22308211],"text":["Berlin Underground music scene appreciates this."],"time":["2020-02-12 15:46:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nojvek"],"id":[22315505],"kids":{},"parent":[22308211],"text":["SiriusXM has deals with a whole bunch of dealerships.
