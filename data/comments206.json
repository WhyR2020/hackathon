The top of the funnel however, looks a lot different, it consists of people who might be couch surfing with friends, sleeping in cars or moving between motels.

I run into a lot of little problems in my day job and have a lot of ideas for side-projects that I think would be served by having a better handle on it. So I&#x27;m creating toy languages and writing toy parsers for them.<p>One reason I&#x27;m targeting parsers in particular is because I&#x27;ve been finding a lot of modern programming language books are a bit anti-parsing these days. EOPL avoids parsing altogether by using a parser generator, effectively saying that it&#x27;s a hard problem. PLAI outright calls parsing a &quot;distraction&quot;. SICP (not strictly a compiler book, I know) and Lisp in Small Pieces just use the triviality of parsing () languages, which I feel doesn&#x27;t generalize well.<p>I emailed the author of PLAI (Shriram Krishnamurthi) about this. His response was effectively that modern books come off anti-parsing as a reaction to old books, which were parser heavy, and tools like YACC -- &quot;Yet Another Compiler Constructor&quot; -- even though it&#x27;s just a parser generator, not a compiler constructor! He went further to say that, given parsing is roughly trivial in () languages, it sort of seems parsing is only incidentally a compiler&#x2F;interpreter problem, and users of () languages view non-trivial parsing as signalling a design flaw. I found this to be an interesting take, but in my day job I generally don&#x27;t have much say in the design of &quot;languages&quot; of semi-structured text that gets thrown my way.<p>Anyway, I know the Dragon Book covers parsing in some detail but for some reason it&#x27;s been kind of impenetrable for me -- it feels a bit more abstract than I like.

What service you&#x27;re talking to on the host will be completely hidden from prying eyes, and unblockable.<p>You call an endpoint anywhere on the planet and give the name of the service you want, which then gives you access to that service&#x27;s published API (similar to how you&#x27;d use import and gain access to a library&#x27;s API).<p>To start, it will operate over port 80&#x2F;443 to allow seamless integration into the current world infrastructure, but I&#x27;m also hoping that in maybe 10 years it could replace HTTPS entirely, possibly even TCP.<p>The first step is an encoding mechanism that supports the most common data types natively, which I&#x27;ve defined here [1], and am currently writing implementations for in go. It&#x27;s a parallel text and binary encoding so that we don&#x27;t waste so much time generating bloated text that&#x27;s just going to be machine-parsed at the other end, but also allows converting on-demand to a text format that humans can read&#x2F;write. I ended up developing new encoding schemes for floating point values [2] and dates [3] to use in the binary format.<p>The next layer above that is a generic streaming protocol [4], which can operate on top of anything from i2c to full-on HTTP(S), and supports encryption. It&#x27;s designed to be as non-chatty as possible so that for many applications, you simply open the connection and start talking without even waiting for the other side&#x27;s acknowledgement. It supports bi-directional asynchronous message sending with chunking and optional acknowledgement on a per-message basis, with tuneable, negotiable message header size.<p>The final layer will be the RPC implementation itself. I want this as a thin layer on top of streamux because many of the projects I have in mind don&#x27;t need full-on RPC. This part is still only in my head, but if I&#x27;ve designed the lower layers correctly, it should be pretty thin.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;concise-encoding\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;concise-encoding<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;compact-float\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;compact-float<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;compact-time\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;compact-time<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;streamux\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;streamux<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-29 15:27:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gumby"],"id":[22177890],"kids":[22185979,22178724],"parent":[22174828],"text":["Symbolic AI with common sense and explanation built on top of NNs.

In the end it is solving ALLSAT, by converting cnf to dnf.<p>I&#x27;m happy that it works well for many small sized problems."],"time":["2020-01-30 01:27:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aberry273"],"id":[22175426],"kids":[22177601],"parent":[22174828],"text":["Automation of work.

I learned CAD four years ago just to do this - make fins based on new airfoil templates.\n This ‘new class’ is essentially high lift fins. Compared to the current surfboard fin standard (6mm thick fins), my 16mm thick fin designs provide radically more drive, traction and stability to surfing at the lower speeds. Making normal to pumping surf more accessible and enjoyable to novices and experts.<p>These fins are not only empowering for surfing ability, they’re also safer because of their thicker, more rounded edges, and when 3D printed the fact they break before your skin does.\n Also, if these fins could be fitted with an internal floatation during printing, they could be recovered and glued back into place using automotive plastic glue.<p>These are also literally the first high performance Wavestorm fins to be created as well. Anything else out there is a boring, simple fin design.<p>Some past feats I can be proud of that you all may appreciate:<p>• created BeelineReader.com’s first working app, helping them get off the ground. Helps you read much faster using a novel, internationally patented innovation.<p>• Created a web browser with T9Space.com that empowered 10s of thousands of Nokia phone users around the world to access the desktop only internet back in ‘07-‘10<p>Earned a bachelor’s in CE at UCSC 20 years ago.<p>My moniker thirdsurf is about a P2P ‘school of surfing’ project I want to get going next. There needs to be a more dynamic connection between those with the knowledge and those who’d like to learn.<p>If this fins thing gets off the ground, it’ll open up other possibilities.\n Nucleos.com is an example of a company that’s been developing a cheap school software server that can operate in developing world conditions. I want to see 3D printing fin labs sprouting that use a computer that can serve out edu apps to anyone nearby who has a wifi device.<p>I also aim to set up a P2P market for people who could fabricate the digitial fin designs I’ll be making available. This could open up a market of innovation, empowering people to tout novel materials and fabrication methods, helping advance greener, safer and more economical ways to make these fins, and other goods.<p>Also, in places where it may be difficult to obtain filament, the machines <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preciousplastic.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preciousplastic.com&#x2F;<\/a> and others are developing could turn plastic refuse in devloping world areas into a precious commodity."],"time":["2020-01-29 23:07:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stdsdl19"],"id":[22185645],"kids":{},"parent":[22174828],"text":["I recently launched Homematchx.com as an interactive way to connect future home and buyers at similar stages of the real estate process.

Everyone has a plan and a price! Why wait until you&#x27;re 30 days from buying or selling when you can find the perfect match to extend the closing date at your convenience.<p>According to bankrate.com over 60 percent of millennial home buyer regret their home purchase. SHOCKING! In our industry this stat is overlooked and it has made me wonder why. I was working with someone who&#x27;s lease was coming up and wanted to explore buying a home. They had two choices, rush into a home or wait another year. They decided to move and lease in the area they wanted to purchase. Being unfamiliar of the housing market after signing a 12-month lease there is no way to identify future homes that will come to the market when their lease is up. This story led us to a problem in our market. To avoid the traditional move-in ready market in less than 30 days, our users can match to homes that will be available for sale at their expected time to purchase.

As a real estate professional over 10 years I’ve noticed soon after buyers move into their new home better homes in the neighborhood were listed for sale around the same price. We often times think we purchased the best home at the right time, but everyone has a plan and a price,That’s real estate right!<p>Would you be willing to wait if you found the home worth waiting for or made the seller an offer they can’t refuse for your one of a kind? Homematchx assures you never miss out on wishing you could have purchased the home next door, the home across the street, or the home around the corner. Our platform allow consumers to see available homes for sale up to three years out giving you access to more inventory than today.<p>I think seller are at a serious disadvantage when they need to sell. Days on Market is a huge issue and its a growing concern in real estate. They are unsure how many buyers fit their home&#x27;s description and would be willing to purchase it at their desired time. To time selling your home perfectly is unpredictable. Our platform allows you to see all the buyers, their compatibility to your home, and if they have been qualified or not. Never will a seller list a home for sale without know who will actually purchase it.<p>We are heading into the new construction industry to help home builders better understand the real estate market and who&#x27;s available. There is so many missing things that buyers don&#x27;t have access to in order to time their new construction journey perfectly.<p>I&#x27;m excited about the many problems we can solve but I know we cannot be successful without the users knowing it exist.

I&#x27;ve re-written it using the lowest level possible stuf from WPF, and that took me a looot (roughly 3-4 months, to also make it easy to extend&#x2F;modify). That was an improvement of roughtly 3-4 times, but for non-trivial stuff, it was too slow (and especially saving the final video was insaaaanely slow). So, I did another rewrite in UWP, and this took another 4+ months.<p>Now, I&#x27;m really happy about the speed - it&#x27;s 3-4 times faster than before, and at saving, it&#x27;s 10-12 times faster.<p>In order to make it happen, I&#x27;ve worked insane hours (and still am) - but that&#x27;s that. Right now (the following 2 months) I&#x27;m focusing on stability and some improvements. Hope to have apretty cool new feature ready in roughly 3-4 months, and we&#x27;ll see.<p>Challenges: countless, probably I could write a book ;)<p>1. Parsing existing videos - in WPF that was insanely hard, and it took me a lot of time to come up with a viable solution (which when porting to UWP, I ended up throwing away)<p>2. Estimates - I was pretty good at estimating how long a task would take. But due to the fact that everything was new to me (basically, animating using low level APIs was close to undocumented), so pretty much everything took 4-5 times more than I expected. This was soooo exhausting and depressing, since at some point I just stopped estimating, because I knew it would take me longer.<p>3. Changing the UI due to user feedback - basically, I ended up redesigning 80% of the UI to make it easier to use. What I thought would take me 1 week, ended up taking me 1+ months.<p>4. Tackleing everything at once: trying to implement a new feature, while dealing with bugs people would find or dealing with issues that would come up when trying to implement the feature. And dealing with issues that came up from the photographers I collaborate with (those that create the app&#x27;s effects&#x2F;transitions).<p>5. Porting to a new technology (UWP&#x2F;WinRT). This is something that I hope I never have to do again - I was forced to do it, because of the speed gains. I had to reimplement &#x2F; retest every control I initially developed - that&#x27;s one thing. The other one is dealing with the idiocracy of WinRT - which loves async stuff &#x2F; and also loves limitations. Also, the UWP documentation is soooo bad compared to WPF - and there are very few resources, because most people are put off by it (not going to go into detail as to why, that&#x27;s another book I could write). Not for the faint of hearted.\n6. Compilation times - on the old technology (WPF), everything was insanely awesome. On UWP, compilation times are roughly 6 times slower. That is baaaaaaaaad. I&#x27;m doing all sorts of workarounds to make things faster."],"time":["2020-01-29 19:02:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lichtenberger"],"id":[22178943],"kids":{},"parent":[22174828],"text":["I&#x27;m working on a versioned, temporal DBMS[1] called SirixDB in my spare time, which is the most exciting thing :-)<p>It&#x27;s based on a university project on which I was working basically since day one in 2006.<p>I know it&#x27;s crazy to work on such a large project initially alone.

If you&#x27;re doing something complicated that requires a lot of system libs, like say machine learning or imagine manipulation - don&#x27;t use Alpine. It&#x27;s a pain. On the flip side if all you need is a small flask app, Alpine is a great solution.<p>Also, build times and sizes don&#x27;t matter too much in the grand scheme of things. Unless you&#x27;re changing the Dockerfile regularly, it won&#x27;t matter. Why? Because Docker caches each layer of the build. So if all you do is add your app code (which changes, and is added at the end of the Dockerfile) - sure the initial build might be 10 mn, but after that it&#x27;ll be a few seconds.  Docker pull caches just the same, so the initial pull might be large, but then after that it&#x27;s just the new layers."],"time":["2020-01-29 19:30:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rcarmo"],"id":[22185760],"kids":[22186504],"parent":[22182226],"text":["I disagree with the author on many counts, largely because I maintain two stable, multi-platform Python images:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;insightfulsystems&#x2F;alpine-python\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;insightfulsystems&#x2F;alpine-python<\/a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rcarmo&#x2F;ubuntu-python\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rcarmo&#x2F;ubuntu-python<\/a><p>The first uses stock Alpine packages, and the second builds Python from scratch (with some optimizations) atop Ubuntu LTS, and they serve two different use cases, but maintaining both made me learn a few things and there are a few factual errors in the article.<p>For starters, yes, you can run manylinux wheels on Alpine.

This was on photographs, where JPEGs are kind of a home-run and PNGs aren&#x27;t good no matter what you do to them.<p>This time they&#x27;re doing diagrams, which would probably be best as regular PNGs - The dithering requires you compress a pattern that&#x27;s almost noise, and a JPEG would add artifacts without being any smaller.<p>Here&#x27;s some other thoughts:<p>- WebP does exist, but of course you have to do some negotiation to avoid blank images on browsers that won&#x27;t decode it.<p>- The site is behind CloudFlare anyway, so if it&#x27;s a static site with no auth you can probably just put the whole thing on CF &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; whatever and it won&#x27;t use more energy in the cloud than proxying for your own server already does.<p>- CloudFlare probably has a button that re-compresses everything as WebP for you.<p>- Economies of scale always apply.<p>On scale: The transmission losses for the whole US grid is well under 10%. If solar is such a great idea, build a solar farm and run 1,000,000 websites. Or 1,000 houses. It&#x27;ll be more efficient than putting panels on individual houses or servers. There is no power source that gets more efficient when you have a bunch of individuals running it instead of a power company. Whether the power company is trustworthy is a question of politics, not technology.<p>This always gets to me when I see EV chargers with VAWTs at a grocery store. If VAWTS are so great, why isn&#x27;t the grid building them? The grid already has the big wind turbines which are presumably more efficient than a VAWT. So why not buy power from the grid? Because it&#x27;s a PR stunt.<p>In short, I wish they&#x27;d be more clear about it being a cool thing and not a practical thing. Solar is practical. Wind is practical.

In some ways it&#x27;s similar to what we were doing at Satellogic: a Satellogic satellite is solar-powered, runs on batteries, and contains computers running Linux.  (All of that is public; I&#x27;m not revealing anything unpublished here.)<p>They seem to be running on a Raspberry Pi that uses two watts, so they can run Linux.  But a website wouldn&#x27;t have to run Linux.  Contiki includes a webserver and can run on an STM32F103.  (I&#x27;m not sure if the Contiki webserver fits on an STM32F103, though; Contiki is pretty customizable.)  They say they have 865,000 yearly visitors, but unfortunately don&#x27;t explain how many hits that is; if we assume it&#x27;s 1000 hits per visitor, that&#x27;s 865 million hits a year, which is 27 hits a second, in the ballpark of what you could do on a 486.  So it ought to be within the capacity of a 72MHz 32-bit STM32F103, which uses 50 mA going full tilt — 165 mW if you&#x27;re running on 3.3 volts.  That&#x27;s better than an order of magnitude less power.<p>This is probably an interesting experiment to do for resiliency purposes, but I don&#x27;t think it makes a lot of sense for reducing resource usage in this case.  If we assume &quot;Kris De Decker&quot; is the name of a human body that dedicates most of its time to writing this magazine, well, that body dissipates about 100 watts.  You could run the magazine on 102 watts by using a 2-watt webserver, or 100.17 watts by using a 165 milliwatt webserver.  But if they eat beef once a week, well, beef wastes about 96% of its energy input, converting it to cow poop instead of food; that&#x27;s 4.8 watts of beef produced from 119 watts of soybeans and corn.  By replacing one of those beef meals per year with a vegetarian meal — eating beef 51 times a year instead of 52 — they could reduce their energy consumption by more than the entire web server power budget.<p>Or, to look at it another way, eating beef once a year uses as much power as the web server: 72 MJ&#x2F;year, 2.3 W.<p>(I&#x27;m ignoring the embodied-energy calculation because the article shows that it&#x27;s small compared to the ongoing power use.)<p>Average marketed energy consumption in the rich world is about 10 kilowatts per person, although typically that figure doesn&#x27;t include things like corn and beef.  Interestingly, in another article <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lowtechmagazine.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-to-go-off-grid-in-your-apartment.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lowtechmagazine.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-to-go-off-grid-i...<\/a> the author explains that their laptop uses 20 watts of power, and their external monitor uses 16.5 watts, together 18 times the power used by the web server.  If they could manage to do their writing with a USB keyboard plugged into an Android cellphone with an OTG cable, they could probably reduce that to 3 watts, a reduction of 11 times the web server&#x27;s entire power (although maybe they only write 8 hours a day, so maybe it&#x27;s only 4 times.)  If they could use an incrementally updated e-ink screen, an option I explored in some detail in Dercuano, they could use another order of magnitude less still.<p>I feel like <i>sustainability<\/i> is a bigger question than resource use, though.  I can&#x27;t sustain the laptop I&#x27;m writing this on because it contains parts I don&#x27;t know how to fix, even if I could supply it all the energy it needs with like a bicycle generator or something.  In fact, nobody in my country knows how to build a laptop like this; a lot of the knowhow only exists in China, and other parts only exist in Korea.  Exploiting its CPU backdoors requires knowledge that is presumably only available in certain companies in the US.  These seem like much bigger sustainability concerns to me than the really quite minimal power usage of the machine, which is a tiny fraction of the power usage of, for example, a candle (˜80 watts)."],"time":["2020-01-29 20:01:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unnouinceput"],"id":[22187079],"kids":[22187334,22187171],"parent":[22184052],"text":["Quote: &quot;The solar powered website bucks against these trends.

He actually told me that not only was this standard procedure, but that he didn&#x27;t actually know how to <i>get<\/i> a copy of the forms to show to customers so they could review before signing: the workflow State Farm designed didn&#x27;t actually produce forms until the signature was already in place.<p>I don&#x27;t fault my agent specifically for this; I fault State Farm&#x27;s training and workflow. My understanding from talking with state regulators is that I&#x27;d have to initiate a complaint specifically against my <i>agent<\/i>, which is less than ideal. I like him and I don&#x27;t want to fuck up his business, and he didn&#x27;t understand that contracts require a meeting of the minds. This is, IMO, a systemic problem requiring better training and software design, and those are both State Farm <i>corporate<\/i> issues."],"time":["2020-01-29 14:49:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["martin8412"],"id":[22183773],"kids":[22183841],"parent":[22177812],"text":["IANAL, but isn&#x27;t this straight up fraud?

But then you see how a lot of these categories may have come from Operation Chokepoint, chosen by unelected bureaucrats seemingly without any evidence.<p>Personally it disturbs me that so many legitimate businesses are severely hamstrung from collecting payments online because of extremely opaque decisions by an oligopoly of payment networks.<p>But about Dwolla - it’s not quite as smooth as Stripe; you have to build out your own customer onboarding screens, and production plans are priced through a sales rep rather than a SaaS-y paygo model.

One sacrifices performance for the other, effectively transmitting money. The trick, of course, is doing this in a manner so that you have plausible deniability with regulators and, more importantly, so that other market players don&#x27;t grab the money in flight, because that&#x27;s what an efficient market would do. Still, consistently creating and hiding complementary pairs of good&#x2F;bad opportunities is a much easier problem than consistently beating the market.<p>OK, so you&#x27;ve got a way to transmit money from a &quot;sucker fund&quot; to a &quot;winner&#x27;s fund&quot; with plausible deniability, what do you do with this ability? In reality you&#x27;d probably have many &quot;sucker funds,&quot; rotate the one that gets sucked, and limit the extent to which it gets sucked, but still, nobody&#x27;s going to just buy the sucker fund, not for long, anyway. That&#x27;s how efficient markets work. Well, one major, well-known, boring inefficiency is the principal agent problem: trusting others to invest your money. They can&#x27;t just steal it, because that&#x27;s illegal. They can&#x27;t just invest in a private fund that they just happen to oversee and which just happens to pay them an enormous salary, because that&#x27;s illegal. However, if they were to invest in one side of a money wormhole, which is designed to look like a perfectly reasonable investment on its own, in exchange for a cut of the proceeds from the other side of the money wormhole, who&#x27;s to say the theft even happened? Such an accusation would need to untangle the coordination behavior of the money wormhole to make its case, and those inner workings could be made very convoluted indeed, hidden deep inside complementary pseudorandom behavior.<p>So, in short, the conspiracy theory says it&#x27;s a heist -- but one that&#x27;s well hidden under the veil of statistics and plausible deniability. It provides investment managers looking to monetize the confidence placed in them a way to make that happen without getting caught.<p>It&#x27;s probably a dumb theory, but it&#x27;s enough to entertain someone who knows as little about finance as I do :)"],"time":["2020-01-29 15:30:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["leto_ii"],"id":[22182800],"kids":{},"parent":[22168822],"text":["&gt; The Medallion fund has been closed to external capital since 1993, and analysis of the flagship fund’s annual returns suggests that significant distributions are made each year to keep the fund about the same size.

This fits with Simons work that he did before he founded the fund. The fact that gauge theory is applicable to for example currency trading is folk knowledge in the Havard, Princeton, IAS circles (here is for example the lecture notes of a popular lecture by Maldacena that uses currency trading as an example of a gauge theory <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1410.6753.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1410.6753.pdf<\/a>).<p>In currency trading example the curvature $F$ of the gauge connection $A$ vanishes precisely, when there is no arbitrage opportunity.

In these equations time does not enter, however there are several ways in which on can incorporate time into the picture (for a naive example see also the lecture notes). Assets in this framework live in associated vector bundles of the principal bundle defining exchange rates.<p>My speculative assertion is that it is possible to identify &quot;topological invariants&quot; which can be computed by sequences of trades, i.e. parallel transport along the gauge connection and that those can have provably positive expected return.

But either their symptoms were less severe or they felt more energetic, so they were better able to push through the sickness and function anyway. The exact effect on the immune system is unclear, but we do have some knowledge of the pathway through which it works. Cold temperatures make you shiver — an autonomous response to keep your body temperature up. It involves a neuroendocrine effect and triggers our fight-or-flight response, causing hormones like cortisol to increase, shortly before we shift to a relaxation response. Moreover, cold temperatures activate the brown — or good — fat in the body.<p>Brown fat doesn’t have any proven connection to immunity, but it does affect the body’s thermoregulation. When activated, it keeps the body warm by burning calories. It may also increase your energy and metabolism and help control your blood sugar. That could reduce your risk of obesity and diabetes."],"time":["2020-01-29 10:13:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wensheng"],"id":[22183482],"kids":[22184272],"parent":[22167687],"text":["It says old showering reduced self-reported sick leaves but not illness days.

Spotify saves these under &quot;liked songs&quot; and &quot;liked from radio&quot;. going through these later at my leisure and adding them to relevant playlists is much nicer than making me add each song to a playlist as I listen to it.<p>* there&#x27;s no good web ui like spotify. beta.music.apple.com has existed for a while[0] but is buggy and randomly stops playing, forcing a refresh. I can&#x27;t edit playlists other than adding songs to them. I use linux so I would have to use wine, which is not preferable.<p>* spotify has 5 daily new mixes based on the genres&#x2F;artists I listened to. apple music has 3 weekly playlists, updated on friday, and one is just a rehash of what I listened to: &quot;Favorites Mix&quot;, &quot;Chill Mix&quot;, &quot;New Mix&quot;. If I can&#x27;t have daily updates, I&#x27;d rather have it update on mondays...<p>compare those to my spotify mixes: #1: japanese&#x2F;foreign music. #2: bill evans, cannonball adderly-esque jazz. #3: david bowie and rush. etc.. these are actually compelling based on my mood that day.<p>* on the music app homepage, the recently added music section takes up way too much space with only 2 album pictures per row.<p>* when I play a song, album, or playlist, it repeats forever instead of stopping or suggesting similar music like spotify.<p>* the radio tab is garbage, showing me genres and artists I never listen to. I don&#x27;t care about &quot;Top 100 songs&quot;, as should be evident from the songs I listen to and save. spotify&#x27;s homepage recommendations always felt they were kinda close or at least attempting to take my preferences into account. apple&#x27;s recommendations are just whatever is new in the (mainstream) music world, which is almost always irrelevant to me.<p>* the music app&#x27;s UX in general is bad, it&#x27;s quite clunky compared to spotify&#x27;s app.<p>* spotify&#x27;s app detects when you&#x27;re driving and shows a simplistic interface with huge buttons. all music apps should do this.<p>* translation of foreign song titles is very annoying when I can speak the language. I understand why apple and youtube do this, but please give us the option to disable it for specific languages or in general. My phone is in Korean anyway.<p>Positives of the apple music app:<p>* the lyrics viewer is much better in my opinion. I hardly used this in spotify&#x27;s app, but I often enable it in apple&#x27;s app.<p>* apple&#x27;s music selection is very good. I only had one instance of not being able to find a song that I had on spotify, and that was a relatively new japanese album.<p>I keep apple music because my family uses the homepod daily in the kitchen, and my mom is used to the app now on our shared plan. Plus it would be a pain to re-make my playlists again. But if I can find a way to have siri integration with spotify on the homepod, I would switch back in a heartbeat.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed because apple has the money and talent to pull off a really good music app, and they push out something mediocre, as if they don&#x27;t really care that much. I hate apple&#x27;s new UX choices in general as they seem to be made for older people with bad vision.

I understand that too many options can lead to a basic user configuring an application in a way that would cause them to call tech support because it makes the program unusable, but I find most software for day-to-day purposes (playing music being a perfect example) infuriating. Here are some examples:<p>1. The Pandora app (at least on Android) will pop up the bright white &quot;today&quot; screen about a minute after I get in my car - with no way to disable it.<p>2. The Youtube music app doesn&#x27;t play landscape, and if you full screen it it removes all relevant information and just shows a photo.<p>3. This is a big one: the Android share functionality is terrible. It tries to give you recent suggestions, but they&#x27;re always not working. I would prefer to choose a list of share targets and have it just show me them. It&#x27;s almost never relevant. Most of the time the first result is to text a person I&#x27;ve never talked to in years. I feel like this is a case of &quot;If all you have is a hammer&quot; since it&#x27;s Google and they&#x27;re using search to show the result instead of just letting you set the list.<p>4. Every new OS forgets that people may have more than one monitor - it drives me nuts how we can&#x27;t get Windows to work on Windows in general. Why can&#x27;t I save the position I want an app to open at? Why can&#x27;t I see where it&#x27;s going to open in a properties window and manually set the position? Why can&#x27;t I choose what will load on the focused monitor vs. the default, vs. a specific place?<p>5. Dark mode, dark mode, dark mode (this has been way better lately)<p>6. Music programs (and in-car systems) seem to handle &quot;random&quot; in different ways - and there&#x27;s no indication of what type it is. In my current car (a Chevy Sonic) I cannot play all albums random  - I can play all songs random, but if I turn off random it will just play the songs in random order. I want to have my music on random, and when I turn it off - I want it to play by Artist, Album Year, Track. Songs in alphabetical order is never what&#x27;s wanted.<p>7. Android took away the ability to search for apps directly, you have to go to the search page and scroll down and hope &quot;apps&quot; is there.<p>8. A lot of mobile apps do not allow you to modify the search you&#x27;ve done. You have to start over. And sometimes you start typing the first word and none of the suggestions are that word alone, you can only select a phrase, but if you do, there&#x27;s no changing it to what you want.

Btrfs has extent back references. Given a location on disk btrfs has an efficient data structure that gets from the disk location to the items using that disk location. E.g. if a sector on disk gets corrupted it has a command that lets you list all the the files using that sector. With ZFS you&#x27;d have to iterate through all files, list block locations and check if one of them is affected. Of course such an additional index comes with a performance cost for managing that index (any kind of write or delete operation plus more metadata space used). On the top of my head this is used for rebalance, quota groups, device removal, send&#x2F;receive (finding reflinks) and file system shrinking.<p>For a similar trade off compare hard links on Windows vs. ext4 and co. on Linux. On Linux there is no command to list all hard links to a file while Windows (NTFS) has one (FindFirstFileName etc.). This is why creating hard links on Windows is much slower and there is a limit of 1024 hard links to a file. To find all hard links to a file on Linux one would need to iterate over all files and check if they have the same inode number, however."],"time":["2020-01-29 18:57:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sliken"],"id":[22183330],"kids":[22187136,22186167,22183680,22185674,22183598,22187812],"parent":[22182619],"text":["One thing I like about btrfs is offline deduplication.

Not trivial because of snapshots and dedup: you can find a singular pointer to any data block in the absence of snapshots and dedup, and rewrite the physical address stored nearby, but you can&#x27;t easily find duplicate pointers, so to relocate blocks in CAS w&#x2F; snapshots and dedup you have to leave behind forwardings, or have a database of relocations (which is costly).<p>&gt; (In the grand tradition of computer science we can sort of solve this problem with a layer of indirection, where the top layer stays immutable but the bottom layer mutates.

So if you use maildir delivery like me, you weren&#x27;t exposed to this security hole. This is the sound of the world&#x27;s quietest sigh of relief. I have some questions:<p>Is Qualys getting paid for this excellent work, and if so, by who?<p>Is there a plan to do a serious audit of execle related code in OpenBSD?<p>As a longtime OpenBSD user, I gotta say that OpenSMTPD is the part of the system I&#x27;m least comfortable with from a security standpoint. Too many rewrites, mulligans, CVEs. Very little of the web howtos match the official documentation because there&#x27;s so much churn, which by itself is a red flag. And even without a logic bug, I&#x27;m surprised execle was used at all here. It was unnecessary and naive. I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m in the middle of transitioning from qmail to OpenSMTPD, and this bug is making me consider notqmail.<p>This RCE is trivial and super bad."],"time":["2020-01-29 04:08:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
