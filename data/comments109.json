This SFU is basically a middleman - it decrypts the stream, and reincrypts it as it forwards - meaning that there is no e2e encryption. This is a current limitation of webrtc mediastreams. There is discussion underway to fix this with &quot;Insertable Streams&quot;, allowing you to transform streams (e.g. insert an additional encryption layer).<p>MY THOUGHTS:<p>Zoom already bypass the usual webrtc mediastreams - instead they use wasm ffmpeg to record from a canvas and send that data over a data-channel to their SFU. It seems to me that they could instead encrypt this data before sending it over the stream, and distribute keys directly between peers via a full mesh - this would give them full e2e.<p>As an aside, the ability to implement something like this is SEVERELY hampered by apples decision not to support webm. I simply do not understand why they refuse to do so. If they supported webm (and the MediaRecorder API) then there would be no need to perform unaccelerated wasm-based patent-encumbered video encoding in the browser in order to provide e2e encrypted media streams via sfu.<p>DISCLAIMER:<p>I don&#x27;t work for zoom, but I do work on a product that handles e2e webrtc via SFU using similar mechanisms to that I explained above."],"time":["2020-04-02 09:43:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Arathorn"],"id":[22757053],"kids":[22757312],"parent":[22756713],"text":["fwiw 1:1 calls in Matrix are e2e encrypted if you do them in an encrypted DM.<p>for conferences, they can be e2ee too if you do them full mesh (like wire), but for scalability we use jitsi currently in Riot.<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2359\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2359<\/a> is worth a read."],"time":["2020-04-02 09:59:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mproud"],"id":[22757061],"kids":[22757318],"parent":[22756713],"text":["Maybe not many people get to use it for work, but FaceTime video calls are."],"time":["2020-04-02 10:02:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["woile"],"id":[22756903],"kids":[22756972,22756958,22757195],"parent":[22756713],"text":["What about jitsi[1]?

We got a couple of different checkbox ones for status updates, with a question mark inside the box, an exclamation mark, crossed out, checked, which makes it really easy to convey different nuances of &quot;done&quot; and &quot;not done&quot;. We have lots of product icons (AWS, GCP etc.) as emoji, so alerts can have the appropriate service logo in them, so people can scan and filter them much easier, plus consistent emoji for different urgency levels. And a lot of fun ones, too, which add some lightheartedness to overly serious conversations. There&#x27;s a kind of meta-level communication and inside jokes going on in our team via Emoji reactions that otherwise would only work in person. Might not be for everyone, but it works tremendously well for us. Custom emoji give us a really neat way of making such a clean virtual space ours, of making it a bit more human; something that feels sorely needed in a world of cleanly UXed platforms and tools and walled gardens where people get data-driven into funnels.<p>Human-ness is also something that I feel state-of-the-art AI routinely takes away from things and spaces where it is a dominant feature. What AI we have is quite useful to blur the background of a video call; after all, that requires an understanding of what a human form looks like on video and not much more. After herculean efforts and gazillions of metric tons of training data, that works quite well nowadays. But getting human communication to a degree that would allow for any meaningful assistance in a chat app? Color me very sceptic. If my social ads are any measure for this, there&#x27;s still a long way to go, and that should be orders of magnitude easier – I interact with a lot of content that isn&#x27;t that hard to categorize, just show me photography equipment ads already! You don&#x27;t even necessarily need to deep-mine my natural language content for that. And yet I get shown all those smart toilet ads, no idea why. That&#x27;s not just unhelpful – it ensures the whole social media experience won&#x27;t ever feel human and welcoming in the way random threads on low-tech PHP forums did back in the day, or the way a Slack convo can feel nowadays. Not while that stupid robot ant-brain is constantly breathing down my neck and interjecting smart toilet content; it&#x27;s weird and uncanny, please stop.<p>I really don&#x27;t understand why AI would be required to make people convert to premium in an app like Slack, or stay beyond the lockdown. Whatever happened to just making a great tool that&#x27;s helpful and useful and a joy to use? If anything, it might be the opposite: Annoying, unhelpful, obnoxious AI assistance would drive people off quickly – think Clippy, but in a product that isn&#x27;t remotely as entrenched and without alternative as MS Office back in the day. The way modern software tends to replace user choice with data-driven fits-for-most defaults, there might not even be a proper &quot;off&quot; setting for such a thing.

This is more or less merely a vehicle for Coville to work into the book his argument that humanity is fundamentally inhumane. Duncan&#x27;s previous behavior, bullying and crude, is contrasted with his nicer, more thoughtful behavior after he has been made smarter. Duncan is also alerted to the fact that the Interplanetary Council (an organization all the alien races of the galaxy belong to) is concerned by the violence and nastiness of humans and is considering what steps to take to neutralize the threat humans pose.<p>&gt;Coville&#x27;s thesis may be true, but I have some serious problems with some of the elements of the book. The most glaring is the idea that when Duncan becomes smarter, he also becomes nicer and more humane. One only has to think back on human history to realize that being more intelligent does not seem to correlate in any significant way with being nice. I also think that the way the alien treats Duncan - performing experiments on him without his knowledge, kidnapping and then imprisoning him to use his brain as a communications device - seems to pretty much destroy any claim the Interplanetary Council may have to the moral high ground. Coville&#x27;s theme, that humans are bad and the aliens are more moral and kind, seems to depend on the idea that whatever bad things the aliens do is justified by circumstance (this is not the first time in the series that an ostensibly non-evil alien has kidnapped and imprisoned an innocent human to further their goals). This sort of moral inconsistency simply saps away some of the message that the books are trying to convey.<p>&gt;In the end, some dubious assumptions about human nature and some plot inconsistencies regarding the moral nature of the aliens mar an otherwise fun little book about kids dealing with alien teachers. While My Teacher Fried My Brains has flaws that undermine the message of the story, it remains at the very least a decent book for younger readers."],"time":["2020-04-03 08:10:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Roritharr"],"id":[22763595],"kids":{},"parent":[22762053],"text":["Slack needs to buy hopin.to or a competitor. now."],"time":["2020-04-02 22:46:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["csb6"],"id":[22763128],"kids":[22763154,22763155,22763543,22763159,22763297],"parent":[22762053],"text":["&gt; The ‘stuck at home’ economy is gangbusters.

From wikipedia[1]:<p>&gt; End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s <i>possible<\/i> to decrypt is what makes this not &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;.<p>Personally, I am totally fine with their implementation, I just wish they&#x27;d stop misusing the term.

This doesn&#x27;t happen to even trillion dollar companies that are known by almost everybody so certainly this can&#x27;t happen for a company of 5 people that was started only last year and hardly known by anybody. Nothing can get to HN&#x27;s frontpage at a hit rate of 100% especially when you know this has been happening on almost a weekly basis since last December not to mention the daily promotion in comments on literally everything that has anything to do with WireGuard or even VPNs.<p>HN simply favors some founders who have good network over the rest of us.

With Teams, you can:<p>- Run flows in your own cloud VPC so that you can automate processes against your internal databases and services without opening your firewall<p>- Collaborate on automation scripts within a team<p>- Share tools you’ve built with co-workers as an easy-to-use form which tracks run history and results<p>We have full docs at docs.cloudwright.io, but we&#x27;re also happy to answer questions here.

After more than 7 years in R&amp;D we&#x27;ve just released the second major release of our visual live programming environment vvvv, titled &quot;vvvv gamma&quot;. It uses our language &quot;VL&quot; which compiles to C# using roslyn and it is using state hot-reload to allow you to modify programs while they are running.<p>It combines metaphors known from dataflow programming with others known from OOP and functional programming, but all visual.

No matter what, I couldn&#x27;t get people to listen to my ideas, and it actually felt like I wasn&#x27;t part of the in-group (similar to certain high school experiences).<p>My solution took a few things.  First, like you, I was part of a layoff.  I eventually came to realize that the company culture was a big part of it, as I really didn&#x27;t have that issue at previous employers (although I wasn&#x27;t in, or expect to be in, a leadership position at that point in my career).<p>Secondly, I had to shake off imposter syndrome.  Part of the feeling was that I was constantly working with newer technologies, and therefore always felt like a beginner.  So I took a step back, and went for a position that was purely Linux based.  Then, I approached the position as if I was a consultant who&#x27;s job was to go in, identify trouble spots, and provide solutions.  Getting into that mindset helped immensely, and combined with shaking the impostor syndrome feeling, allowed me to nail the interview.<p>Finally the last part was taking ownership over several key areas, things that I identified as having lacking skills in the organization that I could fill in for.  This involved lots of cross training -- initially one on one, then building up to group training sessions (effectively meeting where I was the leader).  That, combined with working with other key individuals in the organization helped me to understand what problems they needed solving, and from there delivering on those solutions (and not just writing code -- but starting off with the base documentation, such as functional requirements documents, system design documents, risk assessments, making pretty infographs, elevator pitches, the works).<p>Oh, and being the go to resource when other team members run into issues helped to build up a reputation that brings with it respect from various levels of the company.<p>Here&#x27;s an idea -- many C-suite execs have customers that they handle personally -- these are long term customers that the particular exec handled from early on in the company.  Find one, that has a nagging problem that you can solve.  Make them happy, they tell the C-suite about how pleased they were to work with you, and you have a high level person that will go to bat for you in the future.

High Output Management, Andy Grove\n- Explains management from first principles in a very engineering mindset. You&#x27;ll understand the value of meetings, one-on-one&#x27;s and so on.<p>2. Mastering the Rockefeller Habits, Verne Harnish\n- Explains the structure of a business, and the priorities and trade-offs of rapid growth. A bit more holistic and pragmatic than #1, and assumes you&#x27;re stepping up into new roles and responsibilities relatively frequently<p>3. Critical Conversations, Grenny&#x2F;Switzler\n- Talks about the need for (and differences between) discussion&#x2F;conflict&#x2F;control&#x2F;coordination in communication in an org. Reading this should help you recognise when and how to speak up.<p>These are more management than leadership, but I found that a strong basis in management made it easier for me to step into leadership when necessary - I knew the why&#x2F;what&#x2F;how of the technical and organisational sides of the matter, and built trust and respect on that competence&#x2F;understanding.<p>Ping me by DM if you want more customised recommendations - There&#x27;s books like Pat Lencioni&#x27;s &#x27;7 dysfunctions of a team&#x27; which are excellent for helping you recognise and address the most obvious flaws in a team, and it&#x27;s a great starting point for becoming a good leader.<p>I&#x27;d also recommend things like therapy or the Landmark Forum as a way of working through your feelings about leadership and the way you relate to people. Leading people will bring out a bunch of positive and negative stereotypes in you and the people around you, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better way than doing the emotional labour of recognising and working through those issues - you start getting into territoriality and survival-mode mechanisms when you are in charge of teams, and so much of it is kept below conscious awareness because the emotions involved tend to be overwhelming and imprinted at a very young age."],"time":["2020-04-03 02:49:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m33k44"],"id":[22757159],"kids":{},"parent":[22744644],"text":["&gt; &quot;I believe I was expected to perform as a leader on top of solving problems, writing applications and my lack of leadership skills made me not worth my paycheck.

(I’d guess that will take about a year — that’s how long it took for the dot com crash to spread to the rest of the economy.)<p>The question is whether it will be worse than the Great Depression, when there were two follow on crashes of similar magnitude.  The stimulus is trying to prevent the last crash from growing into a second crash.<p>The main thing governments can do to overcome the economic crisis is to admit defeat and get it over with.  Delaying gives time to build hospital space and improve treatment regimes, but, at best, that halves the death toll.  (Unless we find a cure for the common cold this year.)<p>Putting it in perspective, getting COVID-19 roughly doubles your chance of dying this year, regardless of your age (except kids, which are much better off).  If 100% of the population catches it tomorrow, it will reduce average life expectancy in the US by about a month (at most).  If we rationally allocated the $10T’s the COVID-19 response is costing, we could end global warming and also increase life expectancies by way more than a month.  Doing that would be political suicide.<p>Speaking of which, the lockdown does have one other benefit: it lets politicians time the collapse of the hospital system until after the next election.  This seems to be exactly what the US is planning to do (the second peak of deaths is scheduled for late November &#x2F; December).  Also, making big sacrifices gives people an impression of strong leadership.<p>So far this strategy is working well for the politicians.  Trump’s approval ratings are at an all time high, despite the fact that he repeatedly mismanaged the crisis.  So are Cuomo’s, even though Newsom’s (California’s) handling of the crisis was much more decisive and successful so far.<p>It reminds me of the effect where you have an incompetent “firefighter” software developer that causes a string of crises, and then heroically “saves” the company over and over, gets promoted for it, and then promotes more fire fighters."],"time":["2020-04-02 17:33:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cdiamand"],"id":[22759688],"kids":[22759820],"parent":[22759320],"text":["Guesses:<p>1) This will be a function of how long the average person has to be out of work.<p>2) Honestly they seem like different beasts.

I think the best guess can be on the immediate trend, which indicates deep depression and inflation graduating to hyperinflation, but it is important to revisit should government actions change. The scale will be record-breaking in the time frame of all civilizations that have ever existed.<p>2) It will be far worse.<p>3) Initially, it will be massive job losses, massive spending, and massive regulations. There will be an apparent bump whenever the lockdowns are relaxed. The bump will likely be smaller than expected, but any bump may initiate a strong market response. Since this is an election year, there will be no stop to the handing out of money to nearly every sector of the economy. This will be followed by increases in CPI, which will further accelerate.<p>4) Institutional investors and then governments around the world will begin to sell their USD reserves as CPI rate of increase goes up. When they see that there is no counter-response to selling of USD reserves, the rate of liquidation will increase, yet further increasing the rate of CPI increase, though this may be a few years out. The onset of hyperinflation in Wiemar Republic Germany was preceded by a few years of high inflation, but the actual hyper-inflationary period was less than one year and set in within a month or two. This isn&#x27;t to suggest that conditions in the U.S. are identical or even similar to conditions in Germany, but to demonstrate that hyperinflation onset is far more rapid than most realize.<p>As a side note, many people are not aware of the concept of Cantillon effects (including most of the popular Austrians and monetarists), which economists use to describe how money flows through an economy. In effect, newly created money does not instantly flow throughout the economy, and in many cases may only flow in very narrow sectors. For example, the bulk of money created over the last decade remained in non-consumer sectors and thus minimally impacted CPI. Further, even within something such as CPI, things may fall precipitously in price, such as airline tickets and gasoline, while other things experience dramatic increases, such as eggs and bread.<p>I observe there to be a handwavey treatment of anyone discussing inflation. I find across popular personalities, social media, and various forum comments that inflation is some relic of the past, but the only evidence provided is the lack of CPI increase in recent years, which cannot be held up as relevant given the current government activity is very different as it includes creation of money likely to flow directly into the consumer sectors while there is a forced reduction in production (i.e., yet more dollars chasing yet fewer products). Also, I&#x27;m not that great on the technical explanations, but I know that the way the QE was performed it created a very high demand for dollars, sending the USD very high. But the velocity of M2 was also very high, and that is largely what has been fueling the apparent boom, but I admit I&#x27;m a poor source for these more technical aspects."],"time":["2020-04-02 18:02:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bluedays"],"id":[22759621],"kids":{},"parent":[22759320],"text":["Yes."],"time":["2020-04-02 16:50:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sleepysysadmin"],"id":[22760916],"kids":{},"parent":[22759320],"text":["Recession was here long before the virus.

Mind you also, this great depression number is France&#x27;s status quo numbers.<p>There&#x27;s also an analysis to be done, one of the unique things about depressions vs recessions is social tensions.

How much quantitative easing is happening? How much money is being printed to stem the crash. Unprecedented amounts of money is coming to the markets.
