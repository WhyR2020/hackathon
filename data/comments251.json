I guess this is all well-known but maybe some people find it interesting:<p>One thing I noticed was that the seemingly chaotic directed graph can be ordered if you arrange the integers in a two dimensional grid where the x axis is the uneven numbers and each row doubles the previous one. So like:<p><pre><code>    1   3   5   7   9 ...\n    2   6  10  14  18\n    4  12  20  28  36 \n   ..\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt&#x27;s clear to see that if n = 0 (mod 2) we&#x27;ll be on some row other than the first so we&#x27;d just move all the way to the top. For integers on the first row there&#x27;s some interesting &quot;orbits&quot; forming[1].<p>You can categorize them by which 2^n row the 3n+1 rule will jump to and each of those will attract to some specific position the 2^1 and 2^2 ones seem to be the only ones with an integer center point (at 1 and -1 respectively, so that&#x27;s where you have cycles). Another interesting pattern I&#x27;ve noticed (not really shown) is that &quot;combined&quot; jumps like &quot;first a jump into the 2^1 row followed by a jump into the 2^2 row&quot; also follow these fixed intervals.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;gist&#x2F;ginkgo&#x2F;7120618db058d6280d7bf9ea0b8db4e1&#x2F;raw&#x2F;27bba3b9ba409375ce1b7819849762e29647ae1e&#x2F;collatz_grid.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;gist&#x2F;ginkgo&#x2F;7120618db058d6...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 11:05:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kkylin"],"id":[24301327],"kids":[24301465],"parent":[24288963],"text":["Another relatively recent article on this topic:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;mathematician-terence-tao-and...<\/a><p>HN discussion at the time: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21780068\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21780068<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 06:20:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brundolf"],"id":[24290179],"kids":[24301375,24298022,24301516,24297059],"parent":[24288963],"text":["I&#x27;m curious, can anyone shed light on the particular significance of this problem?<p>I know that many mathematical problems are more about &quot;charting the terrain&quot; and don&#x27;t have a particular use until long after they&#x27;re discovered.

And the unemployment rate captures only part of the story. Having declined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation rate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that it should keep falling.<p>The entire press release is worth a read, but I want to specifically call out the above quote.  I think looking into these two statistics can form the basis for useful discussion.<p>Unemployment rate being &quot;below estimated sustainable levels&quot; has multiple interpretations, some charitable, some less so.  One is that the current economy is better at allocating people to their jobs.  This isn&#x27;t a theory, just a hypothesis. Gig economy work, increases in highly skilled workers (Who traditionally have had lower unemployment than less-educated cohorts [0]) might be drivers that could reduce the friction of getting a job for contemporary workers.<p>To add another possible hypothesis, it could be that people are just hedging.  If a large enough cohort of people feel unsafe or want to adjust their job risk profile, they might choose to commit to employment prior to a downturn.  If people are hedging, we might even see a decrease in real wage as people value the (weak, but albeit better than nothing) insurance they get instead of being valued entirely by their market rate wage.<p>The labor force participation component, frankly, I&#x27;m confused on. The Bureau of Labor statics release clearly shows labor participation has been and is still falling (Covid blip aside, 5 year time window irrespective) [1].  Their footnote calls out the 25-54 year old bracket, which is apparently participating more.  I can see why they say that the labor force participation rising is unexpected, I certainly don&#x27;t see it.<p>To advance a different thesis, it is entirely possible that as people retire, a less than whole percent of their roles are being filled by people in this younger cohort, who can now more easily participate due to less labor being available for existing companies.  This would align more with the BLS and Federal Reserve numbers, as we have, by percentage, more aged individuals (Who are the primary non-participants) in addition to growth in a cohort who we would expect to fill those rolls moving forward.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;unemployment-rates-for-persons-25-years-and-older-by-educational-attainment.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;unemployment...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;charts&#x2F;employment-situation&#x2F;civilian-lab...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 03:33:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["viburnum"],"id":[24300794],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["This article explains the Volcker era and subsequent events in plain language<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nplusonemag.com&#x2F;issue-34&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;other-peoples-blood-2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nplusonemag.com&#x2F;issue-34&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;other-peoples-blood...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 04:22:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["viig99"],"id":[24301580],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["Winter is here, ah damn."],"time":["2020-08-28 07:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justanotheranon"],"id":[24301971],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["after hyperinflation finally hits, as the Ron Paulite fringe has been predicting for over 20 years, i hope they put Trump&#x27;s big beautiful tremendous mug on the $1 trillion dollar bill.<p>i look forward to 2035 and warming myself up by burning trash bags full of trumpbux in an oil drum underneath an empty freeway overpass."],"time":["2020-08-28 08:35:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FriendlyNormie"],"id":[24302411],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["Jews rock!"],"time":["2020-08-28 09:53:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[24300469],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-28 03:20:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["codecamper"],"id":[24302006],"kids":{},"parent":[24300305],"text":["free money for the billionaires and inflation for the rest.  lovely."],"time":["2020-08-28 08:44:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["theptip"],"id":[24306111],"kids":[24308584],"parent":[24303322],"text":["This covers one possible deadlock, but there are so many more ways to do this.

My objection to IPOs is not so much financial, but more about what it does to a company’s internal culture. Having been at a company that went through an IPO, I saw how that culture shifted - almost overnight. You had employees that once cared about doing their best at their jobs to ones that focused only on how their contributions would affect the public stock performance (which can overlap, but often doesn’t). Every time the stock price took a (short-term) hit, employee morale suffered. It was as if a large LED stock ticker were installed on every desk, constantly reminding employees that <i>this<\/i> is the new key indicator that matters above all. It was obvious even among upper management; discussion went from big picture, somewhat ambitious ideas to short-term thinking, centered on how to show good numbers in the next quarter with obvious, incremental adjustments (like pushing more ads rather than developing more interesting products and features).<p>The funny thing is, the company didn’t actually <i>need<\/i> the funds raised in the IPO. They had an almost endless supply of interested private investors pouring in money regularly, and the company’s CEO (in private) admitted that they never wanted to do an IPO. It was only necessary in order to appease the expectations of early employees who had been promised a big payday for the shares they were offered instead of competitive salaries. I understand why that was done in the company’s early days, but there ought to be a better way to reward&#x2F;incentivize early employees that doesn’t rely on the fickle and myopic nature of publicly-traded stock."],"time":["2020-08-29 17:19:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fossuser"],"id":[24313416],"kids":[24313583],"parent":[24311260],"text":["The counter argument in favor of direct listing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;invest-like-the-best&#x2F;id1154105909?i=1000451016956\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;invest-like-the-best&#x2F;i...<\/a><p>I’m not sure anyone is arguing SPACs are a better idea for the private company?<p>SPACs can offer some certainty in what may be an uncertain market, but their entire point is that the SPAC creator is selling this certainty by finding an undervalued company they can take over on the cheap.

Do that.<p>Now get the system to check the password. If your page fault handler gets called, you know that the password comparison got past the first &quot;a&quot; and tried to check the second &quot;a&quot;. If you get a &quot;wrong password&quot; error, you know that the first &quot;a&quot; was wrong.<p>In the latter case, bump the first character and try again. You can discover the first character this way in at most N tries, where N is the number of characters in the character set used for passwords.<p>One you have the first character, repeat, this time with the page boundary between the second and third characters. Similar for the rest of the characters.<p>TOP-10 had lots of interesting security oversights. For example, the login system call, which was used by the login program to actually log you in once it verified your credentials, did not actually require any privileges. Its only restriction was that it only worked when executed by a process that was not logged in.<p>It turned out the login program was not the only program that could be run without logging in. You could also run the program to show the print queue. That program had a command to run other programs. Thus, you could walk up to any terminal that no one was logged in on, run the queue program telling it to run the debugger, and then from the debugger execute a login system call to login to any account you wanted. Oops.<p>TOP-10 also had some security things it did way better than Windows or Unix do today, such as access control lists. It used a totally different model than the &quot;ACL as part of the file metadata for the file the ACL controls&quot; model.<p>Instead, the way ACLs worked is that first the system checked the normal file permissions. If they allowed the access, it was allowed. If they denied the access, it then checked a flag that said the caller wanted to check ACLs. If that flag was not set, the access failed. If the flag was set, the kernel sent a message to a user-mode daemon, FILDAE, describing the desired access. FILDAE then got to decide if the access should be allowed or not.<p>The way FILDAE worked is that a user could have a file, ACCESS.USR, which FILDAE consulted. I don&#x27;t remember if it looked for ACCESS.USR in the same directory as the file someone was trying to access, or the home directory of the file owner, or something else.<p>ACCESS.USR contained access rules, one per line. An access rule could specify a file or files (wildcards were allowed), a user (wildcards allowed), a group (wildcards allowed), an accessing program (wildcards allowed), type of access, and whether it was allowed or not.<p>So for example, if you wrote a game and wanted to maintain a high score file, you could put rules in ACCESS.USR that specified that anyone could write to that specific file if and only if they were running your game.<p>You could develop simple naming conventions that fit your security model, such as files whose name started with &quot;pub&quot; in a directory were publicly readable, and files whose names started with &quot;prv&quot; were not, and you could easily make exceptions for particular files or people or programs.<p>I think this fits in a lot better with the way most people naturally thing about access rules, making it a lot easier to avoid ACL mistakes.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a FILDAE for current systems. (Although to be fair, it does add some complexity that ACLs in metadata do not have. Because it was a separate daemon, there was the issue of communication between it and the kernel. People found some bugs that let them get FILDAE and the kernel confused about which FILDAE replies went with which requests)."],"time":["2020-08-28 18:14:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["luizfelberti"],"id":[24305944],"kids":[24306374,24306101,24308294,24306350,24306462,24306004],"parent":[24305247],"text":["Step 1) Use Scrypt instead<p>Step 2) There is no step 2"],"time":["2020-08-28 17:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SQueeeeeL"],"id":[24308626],"kids":[24308756,24309022],"parent":[24308061],"text":["Seems like another one of those, pay 2,000 for <i>access<\/i> groups that entirely expects to rent seek on what is essentially a really good irc group (which are FREE to start and join).

That you’d be able to remove any application from your phone and reinstall it, including things like Camera, Notes, Messages, Calendar, Wallet, etc, etc. I realize that this is probably not feasible, because these included apps might be integrating with the system in a deep way. But it’d be really nice if it was possible. As it stands, Photos on my phone is consuming a lot of storage space from photos that were removed months ago. The only path forward in order to reclaim my storage is to do a factory reset – I just haven’t gotten around to it yet because I have some device-only data that I need to save elsewhere first.<p>And furthermore, in this way, if I could replace some of the built-in apps along with their integrations, with custom alternate apps of my own.

The hardware, operating system, and applications were designed with everything a security professional loves in mind. Even so, modern systems are too large and too complex to be bullet-proof.&quot;<p>That statement, and many others like it in the article, leads you to believe that the systems are good, but provides no actionable information other than a hedge saying that the system is imperfect. How imperfect is it? What is a viable threat? What quantitative effect do the mitigations have? Without this type of information it is just parroting content-free marketing speak.<p>Here is actionable information. Bug bounties correlate strongly to the cost of discovery for a class of attack. Therefore, Apple thinks it takes less than $1M to create a remote no-install zero-click kernel arbitrary code execution [1]. If you need one click, then $250K. If you need an install, then $150K. Given the nature of software, after such an attack is discovered it can be deployed in bulk with minimal extra effort, so you really need to divide the cost over the number of targets that can feasibly be attacked to evaluate the &quot;marginal cost per attack&quot;. How widely you think a remote no-install zero-click attack can be distributed will tell you what that number is.<p>To provide an example of such an attack here is a post-mortem done by Google Project Zero of 5 exploit chains being exploited for 2.5 years before discovery [2]. They mention that the sites received thousands of visitors per week, so a conservative estimate would be 130k visitors&#x2F;5 exploits for an average of 26k targets per exploit. Assuming this falls under the first category of attack, that means the marginal cost to fully compromise an iPhone is ~$40.<p>So, the total effect of every mitigation they do is raising the cost of exploiting to $40&#x2F;iPhone which is not secure by any objective metric.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;security-bounty&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;security-bounty&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;a-very-deep-d...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 23:55:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lapcatsoftware"],"id":[24310756],"kids":[24312075],"parent":[24309390],"text":["&quot;In the battle over the security and privacy of my phone, I am happy to pay a premium knowing that my information is safe and sound, and that it is not going to be sold to the highest bidder.&quot;<p>Meanwhile, &quot;Secret Service Bought Phone Location Data from Apps, Contract Confirms&quot;. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgxk3g&#x2F;secret-service-phone-location-data-babel-street\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgxk3g&#x2F;secret-service-pho...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 00:12:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["emsy"],"id":[24310190],"kids":[24310346,24312009],"parent":[24309390],"text":["This article does not answer the question how Apple‘s privacy and security model would be impacted by 3rd party stores.

Normally when you transmit to an amateur radio repeater, the repeater re-transmits your audio on a different frequency so that it can be heard by a wider coverage area than your radio could be.<p>Echolink has (at least) four main functions:<p>1. It allows repeater owners to link two or more repeaters together over the Internet so that a transmission into one repeater results in a transmission _out_ of multiple repeaters, effectively giving your transmission wider coverage, or coverage in multiple geographical locations.<p>2. The Echolink clients allow licensed amateur radio operators to receive and transmit on VHF&#x2F;UHF repeaters around the world from their desktop or mobile devices.<p>3. The Echolink server allows amateur radio operators to turn their own radios into internet-connected nodes so that they can access them away from home, or allow others to use their radios over the Echolink network.<p>4. The Echolink network has topic-specific conference rooms that hams can join with their client. Or, repeater owners can temporarily have their repeater join a conference room. For example, there is almost certainly one or more dedicated to the hurricane events happening in the southern US right now.<p>The &quot;official&quot; Echolink client and server software is closed-source, this is an open source implementation.<p>You need to have an amateur radio license to sign up for an account on the Echolink network, because anything you transmit into the network might go out over the airwaves somewhere and you need a license and call sign to do that."],"time":["2020-08-28 17:24:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["whitehouse3"],"id":[24303559],"kids":[24303616],"parent":[24302735],"text":["I wonder how common is EchoLink among other newer protocols like C4FM?

There won&#x27;t be a single new 4th gen Supra produced. I would argue vintage cars are the most similar asset to bitcoin. Since like cars, some bitcoin is continually lost and destroyed every day. Like bitcoin, cars are simply worth whatever someone is willing to pay. The market for  cars is not logical, it is purely emotional. Yes, toyota supra prices will likely not collapse anytime soon, since they look cool and there are less and less examples every day.

However, for other categories it is not as clear; for example, what category does a &quot;Ride Pass&quot; fall under (which lowers the cost of Uber and Lyft rides, but is a monthly, purely-digital subscription)?<p>Ads as a whole probably gets bucketed into goods and services outside the app (because it doesn&#x27;t improve <i>your<\/i> app experience).

However, this raises a really interesting question towards the category of lighter-weight personal ads (i.e. &quot;Promote this post&quot;).

Certainly, you&#x27;re not aiming to remove features or break workflows, but there exists a world in which some percentage N of users who are affected negatively by a change are not worth the effort of maintaining something. I think this viewpoint ignores that often as software gets more use and grows, our understanding of the problem-space and relevant abstraction grows as well. Black &amp; white statements about what is or isn&#x27;t allowed by developers in their products regarding updates completely ignores this aspect of development. Granted, if you can choose when to upgrade and to what version to upgrade this is less of an issue. Modern app stores do not function for the user in this respect.<p>As for the interface being updated: it happens. Sometimes it is worse, but then many times people only complain about things being &quot;worse&quot; because of assimilation bias.

Sometimes a breaking bug is abused by a third party for bad reasons as much as they can be for good reasons (e.g. banning add-ons that use exploits to mine bitcoin or data from users, even if the add-on was offering up a useful feature as well).<p>Now, relating to Firefox&#x27;s recent Android update that breaks a lot of things, and even their behaviour for deprecating XUL in the past (I&#x27;m not referring to how long they gave people to upgrade, which was fair, but rather that some XUL features were never duplicated in webextensions thereby rendering some extensions impossible to reproduce), I would argue that yeah, maybe there is some sense of truth or some imperative that we need heed in the article. However, I think most of this would be mitigated by being able to pin versions, ask for a specific version from a specific date, or rollback.

In theory.<p>But that&#x27;s one app model. Does Apple still allow for models like that?<p>The model currently used by a number of apps - webapps, Electron apps, browsers, operating systems - is that of the &quot;evergreen&quot; model, where they continuously update. But this is where Firefox is dropping a bollock; they do BIG updates, rebrand it with things like Quantum, and push MAJOR UI updates.<p>Contrast this with Chrome which, from a user (i.e. my) perspective has only done incremental updates. UI changes have been small and subtle. This page [1] has a number of screenshots from the old version of Chrome. I have a dark theme going on now but it&#x27;s not changed that much at all. Chrome has never been a brand, hardly a product, as opposed to Firefox which is still stuck in the 90&#x27;s &#x2F; 2000&#x27;s where they only get interest if they do a new version.<p>That was the old model for Windows, Office, Adobe products, etc for a long time as well - they HAD to make a new &quot;big&quot; version to keep sales going. But customers did not HAVE to update, so they would often stick with older versions - things that worked - and e.g. Adobe HAD to come up with new features to convince people to upgrade.<p>But it&#x27;s all gone to subscription services now, which come with &quot;evergreen&quot; updates.<p>One more anecdote I&#x27;d like to do: I&#x27;ve been using 1password for years now, because for me it worked best as a crossplatform password manager (Windows, Mac &amp; iOS, synchronization via Dropbox). They switched to a subscription model a while ago, but the versions I have were all paid for in single purchases. On Windows I&#x27;m still on 1password 4 while on Mac it&#x27;s 1password 7, and thankfully the two are still fully compatible when it comes to their data. I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t last, but as long as I don&#x27;t HAVE to update (and as long as their encryption is solid), it&#x27;ll be fine to just keep the version I have now - That is one company &#x2F; product that cannot afford to be flippant about their customer data, data format.
