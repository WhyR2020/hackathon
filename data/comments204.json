Google uses FooProject in delivering one GoogleApi, but does not opensource GoogleApi with AGPL.<p>1b. Facebook uses FooProject in an internal project, FacebookInternal, that&#x27;s not exposed to the internet, but does not open source FacebookInternal with AGPL.<p>1c. Microsoft uses FooProject in a special version of Office, which is only distributed via BluRay and does not open source Office under AGPL.<p>1d. Netflix uses FooProject in AlienNetflixViewer, which is used over the internet, and makes some modifications to FooProject as its used in AlienNetflixViewer. They open source ModifiedFooProject under AGPL, but not AlienNetflixViewer<p>2. If you have FooProject, and you have 3 libarires, LibraryOne, LibraryTwo, and LibraryThree included in FooProject that are under the MIT license, can someone take Library[Number] and use it under the MIT license? Let&#x27;s assume these are not actually separate projects, and for all intents and purposes it&#x27;s the same project as FooProject, but for whatever reason the folders associated with each library has its own license.<p>3. Assuming someone uses an AGPL project and does not follow the license, what&#x27;s the penalty? What if its so incorporated into its project its effectively impossible to remove?<p>4. How do you enforce someone using the AGPL?<p>5.

Fortunately, nothing so dramatic is happening here; their FOIA requests having been stonewalled, and they&#x27;re taking to the courts to try to force compliance with FOIA. Good on them. I hope they succeed.<p>I could do without some of the phrasing of the press release though, it comes across as needlessly inflammatory, deliberately written to paint ICE and CBP as some sort of anti-immigration evil league of evil. As an example, take the scare quotes around the term &quot;unlawful-reentry&quot;. Here, I use the quotes to mark the word as a word under discussion, apart from the meaning the sentence would have were it not quoted. There, the only common use of quotes that makes sense to me is to mark the use as sarcastic. Sarcasm isn&#x27;t helpful. If you enter a country without going through a port of entry, that&#x27;s unlawful entry. If you go back to a country without going through a port of entry, that&#x27;s unlawfully reentry. That holds true at every national border on this planet, and isn&#x27;t some anti-immigrant invention of ICE or CBP.<p>This sort of thing makes me sad, because that kind of sarcasm and disingenuousness makes it easier for people and groups who actually <i>are<\/i> actively opposed to rights for various other groups to paint the ACLU as acting in bad faith.

In particular there is a lot of advice about information technology startups that say spend fast and get big and successful fast or fail.<p>But (1)-(3) and that advice about startups has high promise of &quot;The Struggle&quot; he describes.<p>And maybe there is a <i>good<\/i> aspect to &quot;The Struggle&quot;:  Without all the pressure, crises, desperation, the staff won&#x27;t form the productive team, do the hard work, etc. needed for success.<p>Yes, I saw a lot of such struggle in the early days at FedEx:  Several times the bank account was so low the company was about to go out of business.  Closer to me at FedEx:<p>(1) At one point some Members of the BoD had an idea bubble up from their upset stomach to between their ears and conclude that it would be impossible to schedule the fleet.  E.g., these Members had backgrounds in the airlines and remembered the <i>struggle<\/i> getting schedules that would have &quot;connecting flights&quot; work and looked at the FedEx central hub sort -- no plane can leave the sort before all the incoming planes have arrived -- as the world&#x27;s worst <i>connecting flight<\/i> challenge.  Some crucial funding was waiting on a solution -- no solution and then no funding and no company.<p>So, long story short, I looked at the problem, said I&#x27;d solve it, and furiously designed and wrote some software.  Soon one evening a Senior VP and I used my software and developed a schedule for all the planned fleet serving all the planned cities.  The next day two guys from Board Member General Dynamics (GD) said &quot;It&#x27;s a little tight in a few places, but it&#x27;s flyable.&quot;  The founder, COB, CEO Smith said &quot;Solved the most important problem facing the start of Federal Express.&quot;.  Then all the BoD was happy and the funding came.<p>Ah, this whole dust up, &quot;struggle&quot;, was more emotional and political than technical.  E.g., my schedule didn&#x27;t do more on the &quot;connecting flight&quot; problem than the airlines were doing; what really happened was that the BoD Members with the tummy problems saw the really good looking schedule and the remarks of the two GD guys, apparently more than they expected, and just shut up.<p>(2) A few months later, some more BoD Members had more tummy upsets  that got between their ears and wanted &quot;revenue projections&quot;.  So around the C-level offices, there were hopes, intentions, etc. but nothing very convincing.  So, I said, let t be time in days with t = 0 the present.  Let y(t) be the number of customers (proportional to revenue) at time t.  Let b be the number of customers when the planned company is fully busy.  Then assume that the growth will be from <i>word of mouth advertising<\/i> of the y(t) current customers influencing (b - y(t)) target customers not yet customers, influencing them via just talking or maybe actually receiving packages &quot;overnight before 10 AM&quot; from existing customers.  Then for a constant of proportionality k, we have with calculus<p>d&#x2F;dt y(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))<p>The closed form solution is just<p>y(t) = y(0) b e^(bkt) &#x2F; ( y(0) ( e^(bkt) - 1 ) )<p>So on a Friday a Senior VP and I,  for each of several values of k,  drew a graph of the revenue projections.  Then we picked a graph that looked reasonable and submitted that.<p>Right, the solution is the famous <i>logistic curve<\/i>.  So, I&#x27;d stumbled onto a rediscovery of the logistic curve and, also, found some assumptions about <i>viral growth<\/i> that yielded a little differential equation whose solution was the logistic curve.  So, it&#x27;s a simple, first-cut from 50,000 feet up viral growth model.<p>At noon the next day, Saturday, I was in my office thinking about actual good ways to schedule the fleet via 0-1 integer linear programming set partitioning and got a call to come over to the C-level suite.  Turns out that Saturday was a BoD meeting; it had started at 8 AM; first thing my graph was presented; right away our two guys from GD asked how the projections were calculated; all the FedEx people there tried to figure it out without success; by noon the GD guys gave up on FedEx, got airline tickets back to Texas, packed up in their rented rooms, and as a last chance returned to the BoD meeting.  When I got there, the GD guys were in the hall with their bags packed, and there were no smiles.  The SVP I&#x27;d worked with on Friday was traveling, and the SVP I&#x27;d worked with on the fleet schedule was taking charge, gave me the graph, selected a point on the time axis, and asked me to calculate the graph value -- my trusty HP calculator.  I did that.  He picked a few more points, and I reproduced those, too.  There were big smiles.  The GD guys stayed and chipped in their equity funding and saved the company.<p>No one asked for my rationality of the viral growth, the little differential equation, my closed form solution, etc.  So, somehow much of &quot;the struggle&quot; was more political and a test hoop to jump through than a serious technical or financial problem.<p>A guess is that the GD guys were concerned about the management of FedEx:  The graph was there, but no one at the meeting knew how it was developed -- bad management.  Sure, I should have been asked to be at or available for the meeting but was not.  So, I was deliberately kept out of the meeting until the company was about to die.  So, bad management.  I have to suspect that the GD guys -- that I got to know well from the scheduling software -- guessed I&#x27;d done the projections and wanted to see how long the company would take to let me explain the projections.<p>I got thanks for the scheduling work but not a word of thanks for the revenue projections.  A guess is that my little calculus exercise -- apparently I was the only one around who still understood first calculus -- intimidated and torqued everyone else.  Gee, guys, I did the projections; no one else actually did anything; there was at least a little rationality behind the projections; the projections were what was wanted, right?  Maybe not!!!!  Politics?<p>FedEx and Opsware both seem to have come close to violating two old pieces of advice:  (1) Don&#x27;t count the chickens before they hatch.  (2) Don&#x27;t try to put 10 pounds into a five pound sack.<p>Later many of us learned about the Canadian romantic match making Web site Plenty of Fish, long one guy, 100% owner, two old Dell servers, .NET, ASP.NET (for Web pages), and SQL Server, and $10 million a year in revenue all from Google&#x27;s ads, grew the staff, and sold out for, IIRC $575 million.  My guess:  No VC funding.  <i>Burn rate<\/i>, both Capex and Opex, so low the founder could keep going with $0 revenue.<p>Don&#x27;t spend more money before the revenue is in the bank.  Yes, that approach would not have worked with FedEx with its many very expensive airplanes, very expensive jet fuel, very professional pilots, many trucks, etc.  And maybe similarly for Opsware.<p>So, some startups can work like FedEx and Opsware, and others can work like Plenty of Fish.<p>For my startup, I&#x27;m going the Plenty of Fish way!  My Capex and Opex are both tiny!  My checkbook has plenty of funds to let me keep going a long time with $0 revenue.<p>And I&#x27;ve had hit lots of unexpected obstacles, all from other than the actual work.  All the actual work has been fast, fun, and easy; I guessed the project would be doable to live and ready for revenue as just a one person effort, and it has been.<p>But with all the obstacles, I have not had &quot;the struggle&quot; of frowns from some VC equity holders, meeting a payroll of employees, or going out of business.<p>So, my main lesson would be:  Try to pick a project that can do as a sole, solo, self-funded founder and 100% owner.  Then don&#x27;t start the big spending -- e.g., don&#x27;t try to cram 10 pounds of spending into a five pound checkbook, wait until the chickens have hatched -- before the revenue is in the bank.  Else, accept that will encounter &quot;The Struggle&quot;."],"time":["2020-01-31 13:38:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yters"],"id":[22201129],"kids":[22201554,22201218,22201690,22201450,22201162,22201152,22201159,22201498,22201146,22201601,22201616,22201599,22201679,22201403,22201415],"parent":[22200886],"text":["Rights used to mean human capabilities that government should not obstruct, because the government was not the source of said capability, and therefore had no authority to control the capability.<p>Now rights seems to mean things the government is responsible for giving to the citizen, which turns the formulation on its head to imply that the government is the source of human rights.<p>Seems to be a dangerous trend, however humanitarian its portrayal may be."],"time":["2020-01-31 13:39:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["newfeatureok"],"id":[22201169],"kids":[22201196,22201884],"parent":[22200886],"text":["Housing is the perfect example to illustrate the flaws of how democracy is put into practice in many (but not all) Western societies.

Regardless of whether income was included in the logistic model, disagreeable men and conscientious people in general were particularly likely to drive high-status cars. The results regarding agreeableness are consistent with prior work that has argued for the role of narcissism in status consumption. Regarding conscientiousness, the results can be interpreted from the perspective of self-congruity theory, according to which consumers purchase brands that best reflect their actual or ideal personalities. An important implication is that the association between driving a high-status car and unethical driving behaviour may not, as is commonly argued, be due to the corruptive effects of wealth.

A monolith can only scale in its entirity and often only vertically. That means that even if just one component cannot be locally optimised the whole application has to scale up.<p>If you only have a single application or task to build software for (i.e. a CRUD system for a CMS) then it makes no sense to split that out.

Deploys are safer, again because you&#x27;re deploying small changes often. And if something bad does go out, you can &quot;roll forward&quot; instead of rolling back, by reverting the bad commit. This is less harmful to velocity, because it doesn&#x27;t require rolling back the other good commits in the deploy along with the bad ones.<p>I have less experience with microservices than with continuous deployment, but they seem to bring a lot of problems. Microservices take the fixed costs of deploying an application and multiply them by the number of services. Instead of centralizing one team to update dependencies and infrastructure for the whole application, every team has to spend 10-20% of their time doing that work. In the monolith case, everyone on the engineering team is familiar with the single codebase and architecture. But in microservices land, there are often more microservices than engineers. So when an engineer leaves, they pass off a whole pile of code, infrastructure, and architecture patterns that almost no one has any familiarity with. I do think you could avoid these problems, but overall microservices seem very high risk for little reward.<p>The one case I really see for services is when you have tasks with different load characteristics.

Either way, let&#x27;s focus in two items:<p>&gt; We’re gonna break it up and somehow find the engineering discipline we never had in the first place.<p>Indeed. I worked in a company that had a monolith, but the project was structured in modules. Every module had a Facade, which was the official way of communicating. Although in practice you could access other modules&#x27; entities, you weren&#x27;t allowed to do that. As you can imagine, this rule was broke many, many times. Developers would look at the entity and see the data they want was there and ignore the facade right way, plain and simple.<p>If you split your project into separate services, and those services aren&#x27;t in the same runtime application, there is no way to break this rule anymore. The team that didn&#x27;t follow the rules has no other choice, it has to go through the APIs. Even better, they won&#x27;t design the API themselves most of the time. Whoever maintain the service will want it to be cohesive, and will not care that much about the other team need to an urgent fix. Putting workaround becomes way harder, and this change alone improves design a lot.<p>The second point is that anyone that shared the same service&#x2F;application with another team probably faced the situation where you couldn&#x27;t deploy (or was too afraid to do so) because the other team pushed a lot of new code to master. You suddenly don&#x27;t know if the deploy will break everything or not. When you see, you&#x27;re spending a lot of time coordinating with many people about whether you can deploy it or not. Something that should be in production if a few minutes sometimes get delayed for days.<p>Of course that microservices are not a silver bullet, and there are teams that will benefit a lot from a monolith.

I recently had an opportunity to try some of these first hand.<p>Honestly the new language features are all terrible with few exceptions. In general, anything that was added to a language to support generics or to hide pointers and memory management from the developers on a language that isn&#x27;t a lisp has only produced more harm than good.<p>I grew up as a programmer always thinking about the underlying CPU and the underlying memory and how my code would interact with both of them. It requires greater care as a programmer and tools like static analysers, code reviews and rigorous testing are extremely important. Improving these tools and coming up with new ones is far more useful (in my opinion) than trying to update C.<p>Yes C has it&#x27;s flaws. Sometimes, those flaws are important and a replacement language is useful. I find that Go is a very interesting replacement for C at sufficiently higher up the stack. Something like Haskell probably will best fill in the gaps between C and Go.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that fixing C with something like C++ was a good idea. Similarly, anything that&#x27;s trying to fix C++&#x27;s problems is unlikely to come up with a decent way to have generics and hide memory and pointers from developers.<p>If I was going to create my own language, I&#x27;d keep it like C, remove some of the undefined behaviors, add support for Posits, 128 bit and arbitrarily wide signed and unsigned integers, features for explicit cache management (!!!), container classes as part of a standard library, Go-lang style interfaces and bake in something like cppcheck into the compiler.<p>&#x2F;rant"],"time":["2020-01-30 17:47:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["taneq"],"id":[22190498],"kids":{},"parent":[22188704],"text":["Didn&#x27;t one version of the &quot;Ten Commandments of C&quot; have a rule stating &quot;Thou shalt  not use the preprocessor to turn C into a different language&quot;? :P"],"time":["2020-01-30 11:59:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kccqzy"],"id":[22189354],"kids":[22189653,22190536],"parent":[22188704],"text":["GNU lambdas are incredibly evil.

I think this is unfair.<p>Yes, the program is worth $1.5TN, the most expensive procurement program in history. But that&#x27;s for its entire lifetime, of about 60 years. Per unit, an F-35 will cost about $100MM (even less than $80MM for the main version, F-35A [0]). A few days ago we&#x27;ve seen the first Boeing 777X taking a test flight. That&#x27;s a commercial aircraft with a list price of $400MM per unit. It&#x27;s essentially a big long tube with wings and engines. Yes, the tube is carbon fiber, the wings are foldable, the engines are the newest crown jewels of GE, but it&#x27;s not a fighter aircraft designed to withstand 10G acceleration, be subject to catapulted take-off and arrested landing on an aircraft carrier, be able to go supersonic, and well, obviously it&#x27;s not stealthy. So, given all that, the cost of an F-35 is not exorbitant.<p>Oh, and you bet the F-35 is a huge jobs program as well. But it&#x27;s not minimum wage jobs we are talking about. It&#x27;s high end jobs. And the F-35 is a profitable export as well. An export that will benefit the US, but will benefit the buyers too. Poland will buy F-35. Poland is looking nervously at Ukraine, and how Russian troops and tanks are occupying big chunks of it. The day they get some F-35s in their hangars is the day they&#x27;ll start sleeping a bit easier at night. Japan has some nice naval ships that are aircraft carriers in all but name [1]. But to be meaningful, they need aircraft, and F-35B will do the job. UK&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier will also use F-35B. No other fighter jet will fit the bill, either for the Japanese or for the British aircraft carriers, as they are somewhat on the short side and F-35B can take off on short runways. Israel is already using F-35s for combat missions.<p>For those who think manned military aircraft are a thing of the past, take a moment to remember the drone that Iran captured a few years ago [2]. Drones can be hijacked, or rendered ineffective via electronic warfare. Manned aircraft less so. The US is not shying away from heavily investing in drones, but manned aircraft will have a place in the military picture for decades to come.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Izumo-class_destroyer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Izumo-class_destroyer<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incid...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-31 04:21:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[22195423],"kids":{},"parent":[22190468],"text":["<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;S8WAg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;S8WAg<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-30 21:50:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22197727],"kids":{},"parent":[22190468],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-31 01:41:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["Gunax"],"id":[22192637],"kids":{},"parent":[22190468],"text":["The Bradley fighting airplane."],"time":["2020-01-30 17:33:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m1gu3l"],"id":[22193150],"kids":{},"parent":[22190468],"text":["at what point will we be willing to accept that this is a failed project?"],"time":["2020-01-30 18:19:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alopex_plenus"],"id":[22192639],"kids":{},"parent":[22190468],"text":["good news for people all over the world, i guess"],"time":["2020-01-30 17:33:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Pfhreak"],"id":[22192237],"kids":[22192493,22192326,22193536,22196023,22192385,22198629],"parent":[22190468],"text":["Right now, there is a post on the front page about an American community that is flooded with sewage every time it rains.
