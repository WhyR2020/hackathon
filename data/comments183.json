It describes protocols that X clients must use to communicate with each other via the X server, including diverse topics like window management, selections, keyboard and colormap focus, and session management. In short, it tries to cover everything the X designers forgot and tries to fix everything they got wrong. But it was too late — by the time ICCCM was published, people were already writing window managers and toolkits, so each new version of the ICCCM was forced to bend over backwards to be backward compatible with the mistakes of the past.<p>&gt;The ICCCM is unbelievably dense, it must be followed to the last letter, and it still doesn’t work. ICCCM compliance is one of the most complex ordeals of implementing X toolkits, window managers, and even simple applications. It’s so difficult, that many of the benefits just aren’t worth the hassle of compliance. And when one program doesn’t comply, it screws up other programs. This is the reason cut-and-paste never works properly with X (unless you are cutting and pasting straight ASCII text), drag-and-drop locks up the system, colormaps flash wildly and are never installed at the right time, keyboard focus lags behind the cursor, keys go to the wrong window, and deleting a popup window can quit the whole application. If you want to write an interoperable ICCCM compliant application, you have to crossbar test it with every other application, and with all possible window managers, and then plead with the vendors to fix their problems in the next release.<p>&gt;In summary, ICCCM is a technological disaster: a toxic waste dump of broken protocols, backward compatibility nightmares, complex nonsolutions to obsolete nonproblems, a twisted mass of scabs and scar tissue intended to cover up the moral and intellectual depravity of the industry’s standard naked emperor.<p>&gt;Using these toolkits is like trying to make a bookshelf out of mashed potatoes. - Jamie Zawinski<p>[...]<p>&gt;The color situation is a total flying circus. The X approach to device independence is to treat everything like a MicroVAX framebuffer on acid. A truly portable X application is required to act like the persistent customer in Monty Python’s “Cheese Shop” sketch, or a grail seeker in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” Even the simplest applications must answer many difficult questions:<p>&gt;WHAT IS YOUR DISPLAY?<p><pre><code>    display = XOpenDisplay(&quot;unix:0&quot;);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt;WHAT IS YOUR ROOT?<p><pre><code>    root = RootWindow(display, DefaultScreen(display));\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt;AND WHAT IS YOUR WINDOW?<p><pre><code>    win = XCreateSimpleWindow(display, root, 0, 0, 256, 256, 1,\n                              BlackPixel(\n                                  display,\n                                  DefaultScreen(display)),\n                              WhitePixel(\n                                  display,\n                                  DefaultScreen(display)));\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt;OH ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN GO ON.<p>&gt;(the next client tries to connect to the server)<p>&gt;WHAT IS YOUR DISPLAY?<p><pre><code>    display = XOpenDisplay(&quot;unix:0&quot;);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt;WHAT IS YOUR COLORMAP?<p><pre><code>    cmap = DefaultColormap(display, DefaultScreen(display));\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt;AND WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?<p><pre><code>    favorite_color = 0; &#x2F;* Black. *&#x2F;\n    &#x2F;* Whoops!

So this has obviously coloured my perspective in a way that may be strange to people in all tech teams in all tech businesses. We operate more than 500 applications from contractors, we’ve build around 200 ourselves and we utilise around 25 co-municipality open source solutions where we project lead but buy code from small local shops. We also track and benchmark everything.<p>I think the biggest issue with project management, and, the agile toolkit is one that this article and a lot like it pass over a little too quickly. I don’t think there is a right answer, because every situation is different.<p>We have a lot of smaller projects where less than five people build a piece of software that will either be left mostly alone for 25 years, or get completely replaced after five. On those cases utilising the whole agile toolkit is silly, because the only benefit it has is controlling how we learn together, and you can do that with simple light code-reviews. If complexity is really low, building extensive testing may even be a waste of time, and you genuinely rarely need a project manager for just 3 smart co-workers.<p>On other projects we’re building extremely complex applications for thousands of end-users. That will have a direct impact on citizen lives. In these cases the “NASA engineering approach” is the way to go, and here project managers play a critical role connecting engineering and business. A lot of programmers can do what project managers do, but the interpersonal relationships, the historical knowledge of how to play corporate politics to get things done, and the time to do it, is not something you or your programmers really want.<p>We really want that assembly line process, but there is just no perfect fit for everything in the world we operate."],"time":["2020-02-14 10:56:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crispyambulance"],"id":[22325907],"kids":{},"parent":[22324647],"text":["My opinion of professional project managers has been ruined by an experience 10 years ago where I was in a &quot;matrix&quot; structured organization.<p>I had been warned about PM&#x27;s in this company, but I didn&#x27;t believe it because the PM I was working with was cool, approachable and seemed reasonable. Basically, he set insanely short deadlines always citing critical business imperatives. It was frequently impossible to actually meet the deadlines. We accepted it as a reality of the situation and didn&#x27;t push back.<p>One day, near the end of a project, I happened to be in on a &quot;status update&quot; call with upper management. The call was about a dozen people, all but a few in bullshit management&#x2F;coordinator roles, including the PM (BTW, high PM-to-contributor ratio in meetings in itself should be a red flag). Throughout this whole project the technical side had been always under a timeline fire. We cut corners, poured on the technical debt like there was no tomorrow, abandoned long-going efforts at cleaning up our codebase, fought bitterly with design engineering for access to extremely limited hardware-prototype resources, frequently came in on weekends. We were always late. I had expected to be chewed out by the VP. Instead, the VP graciously addressed my PM and told him &quot;Wow, thank you &lt;PM-name&gt;, we&#x27;re really impressed that you guys were able to bring this in so early!&quot;. I was so pissed off, it didn&#x27;t even occur to me to say anything. I found out later that not only was this behavior true, it was routine and encouraged by program managers. The PM&#x27;s had been scoring huge bonuses for &quot;performance&quot; while the teams were always led to believe they were falling behind and always assumed our modest bonuses were just largess bestowed upon us even though we were &quot;unworthy&quot;.<p>I am not going to say we &quot;don&#x27;t need&quot; project managers, but I think everyone working with them should be skeptical of whatever they say. Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten aggressive about making demands of project managers. If their primary concern is meeting deadlines, then it follows that you can &quot;put them to work&quot; for your team by making demands for resources, access, or information from other parts of the organization.

I&#x27;d say at least 80% of devs are productive assets -- i.e. their work moves the project forward. Maybe 20% of PMs are.  In well over half the cases, the team would be more productive, happier, and effective if you simply fired the PM. Others might scrape by with a break even.<p>As far as flat hierarchy goes: that&#x27;s anarchy, and anarchy is conflated with chaos for a good reason. You can read a codebase and detect within 5 minutes if it was written by a flat hierarchy team.

I changed my game account’s email to that yahoo account, confirmed the email change, changed my game account’s password to something long I would never remember, changed all the game account’s personal and contact information to nonsense, logged out of the yahoo account, logged out of the game account, and closed the incognito tab.<p>I tried, but I never figured out a way to recover that account.<p>So I created a new account. Several times, but always repeatedly sabotaged myself during moments of clarity. Eventually, after a few weeks, I completely lost interest in trying and could finally do other things with my life.<p>I’ve used this same tactic with every game since. Total gameplay hours over the last 10 years have been maybe 50 hours or so for Fallout 3, and that’s it.<p>I don’t play anything anymore. Life has turned out unreasonably good since then, too. Career in software exploded.<p>Maybe because of redirected compulsivity.<p>Now I’m having a similar problem with workaholism.<p>I guess the real-world implementation of my prior solution would be to give all my money away, burn all my bridges, and go meditate in a forest somewhere.

Deactivation reduced (political) polarization:<p>&quot;The Treatment group was less likely to say they follow news about politics or the President, and less able to correctly answer factual questions about recent news events. Our overall index of news knowledge fell by 0.19 standard deviations. There is no detectable effect on political\nengagement, as measured by voter turnout in the midterm election and the likelihood of clicking on email links to support political causes. Deactivation significantly reduced polarization of views on policy issues and a measure of exposure to polarizing news. Deactivation did not statistically significantly reduce affective polarization (i.e. negative feelings about the other political party) or\npolarization in factual beliefs about current events, although the coefficient estimates also point in\nthat direction. Our overall index of political polarization fell by 0.16 standard deviations. As a point of comparison, prior work has found that a different index of political polarization rose by 0.38 standard deviations between 1996 and 2018 (Boxell 2018).&quot;<p>2. Deactivation increased &quot;well-being&quot;, by about 20-40% the amount you&#x27;d expect for someone getting therapy:<p>&quot;Deactivation caused small but significant improvements in well-being, and in particular in self-reported happiness, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety. Effects on subjective well-being as measured by responses to brief daily text messages are positive but not significant. Our overall index of subjective well-being improved by 0.09 standard deviations. As a point of comparison, this is about 25-40 percent of the effect of psychological interventions including self-help therapy, group training, and individual therapy, as reported in a meta-analysis by Bolier et al. (2013). These results are consistent with prior studies.&quot;<p>3. After the experiment ended, people in the treatment group didn&#x27;t feel like they needed to go back:<p>&quot;As the experiment ended, participants reported planning to use Facebook much less in the future.&quot;<p>&quot;About 80 percent of the Treatment group agreed\n that the deactivation was good for them.&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-13 20:41:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cryptozeus"],"id":[22322158],"kids":[22322179],"parent":[22320114],"text":["My problem is these are my escapes.

Not wanting to see that crap I started to put people on 30 day holds.  I eventually decided that if I had to put someone on 30 day hold three times in a row I should unfriend them.  And that is exactly what happened with a number of people.<p>After several of those cycles I asked myself a very simple question:  Why?<p>That&#x27;s when I unfriended everyone except close family (a little over a dozen people). I can now derive some value from FB.<p>I have a long list of things FB should do to actually be more useful.  One of the things that always bothered me was that they force you to toss everyone into one big pile and everyone on that pile is exposed to everything you say and do.  Yes, sure, you can group friends and explicitly post to a limited subset.  Frankly, the implementation absolutely sucks and is a pain in the ass to use.<p>The model needs to change to everything being absolutely private and not farmed or captured by FB unless the user chooses to open doors beyond that.<p>There is no reason for my friends from the gym should have any visibility into my family and my conversations with my family.  The same applies to work friends or neighborhood friends.  You can accomplish this today but the UX&#x2F;UI are absolute garbage.  A user needs to be able to put people into silos and the software needs to enforce privacy between silos by default.  It should take work to pierce silo boundaries.  Again, no reason for someone&#x27;s bowling club members to ever see conversations with family.<p>I had a case with a friend of a friend who would snap tons of pictures whenever he got invited to a gathering at my house.  He would proceed to post all of these pictures publicly on FB --as in anyone in the world could see them.  I am not paranoid, but I don&#x27;t want pictures of my kids, home and family all over the internet for everyone to see.  If you are not a parent (and, in particular, if you don&#x27;t have daughters, you might not get this).  I asked this guy twice, politely, not to do that.  I explained that taking pictures of people in a private residence does not entitle him to post them for the world to see without permission.  I eventually had to pay an attorney to give him a call and get it sorted.<p>Another interesting issue with FB happens when your friends post stuff from publications you do not care to see on your timeline.  They offer the ability to block some people and pages, but there are a few holes in that.  I don&#x27;t remember the details.  All I know is that I kept being exposed to garbage from a couple of people and the only way to not see it was to suspend them for 30 days or unfriends them.  I eventually just unfriended them.  I reached out to FB with the issue.  They could not care less.<p>On the business side, they angered a lot of people with their approach to your audience in groups or pages.  I have personally invested tens of thousands of dollars in the past aggregating people behind pages only to be slapped in the face by having to buy advertising to reach my entire audience.  Imagine having a page with 100K people you spent money to aggregate and only being able to reach a few percent of them with your updates (unless you pay).<p>I remember when brands used to advertise their FB pages in TV ads.  I never understood why they subverted their amazing brands to FB.  Well, eventually they all stopped.  You don&#x27;t see that kind of thing any more.  Businesses want to own their audience not have to rent it every time they need to reach to them.<p>For all the good FB does or can do it also has some dark patterns that they should address."],"time":["2020-02-13 21:36:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tibbydudeza"],"id":[22320432],"kids":{},"parent":[22320114],"text":["It was the best thing I ever did."],"time":["2020-02-13 20:09:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["manicdee"],"id":[22323390],"kids":[22323406,22323588],"parent":[22320114],"text":["I, too, find my life is much less stressful when I bury my head in the sand and pay no attention to the corruption of government and progress of society towards capitalist fascism.<p>Limit your social media feed to only people posting positive news.

But the premise seems to be the same premise that kept me away from a fun and practical hobby for decades.<p>I got a Radio Shack 50-in-1 electronics kit for Christmas when I was a little kit. I thought it was the coolest thing ever, but when I tried to go further with my interest, all I got was equations and theory. For years I just wanted to understand how a transistor, with only 3 connections, could be like a relay, which had two pairs of connections and made logical sense to me. Keep in mind this was pre-Internet, so resources were somewhat limited. In any case, I eventually gave up on hardware and focused my attention on programming.<p>It wasn’t until the advent of the Arduino that the spark was rekindled and I found a new on ramp to electronics. Start with a breadboard and cookie-cutter circuits that you don’t really have to understand at first, and control everything with software, because you know software. Gradually phrases like “current-limiting resistor” and “bias voltage” start making sense. Watch people like Dave Jones and Big Clive take things apart on YouTube and reverse engineer them. The circuits get bigger and more complex. The next project needs an op-amp, and to your surprise, you can understand the theory now. The data sheet parameters make sense. You can pick out which 4 of the 5 answers on the electronics Stack Exchange are wrong, and adapt the right one to your needs.<p>I’m having a lot of fun making things, and to answer the question in the book’s introduction, “have you considered how electron collisions lead to Ohm’s Law‘s linearity”, the answer is a resounding “no”. And if people hadn’t told me I needed to consider that to play with electronics, I might not have missed out on many more years of fun."],"time":["2020-02-13 13:24:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["OnACoffeeBreak"],"id":[22316930],"kids":[22318271],"parent":[22315899],"text":["I was wondering about the authors of this book.

I was introduced to Ohm&#x27;s law around age 10 or so but having no Algebra knowledge it made practically no sense. The way current flowed (or didn&#x27;t flow) was quite mysterious.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I learned current and voltage laws that the way current flowed actually made sense.<p>Analogies were super helpful too. A capacitor is like a rubber membrane that pressure can build up on. Voltage is pressure. Current is rate of flow. An inductor is a wheel in the pipe with inertia. A transformer is two mechanically linked inductors. A Mosfet is a pressure-activated switch. A BJT is a current-activated switch. A diode is a check valve.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I took Physics in high school&#x2F;college though, that it all finally &quot;clicked&quot;. All of electronics could be described quite well by those finicky electrons that repel each other. How a capacitor actually works. How a charged pointy surface draws the electrons to the point, sometimes enough to escape. How magnetic fields are actually produced.<p>Digital electronics was actually much easier especially coming from a background in computing. It&#x27;s all logic, you don&#x27;t really need algebra or calculus.<p>Anyways I would like to offer this as a counterpoint and say that learning the fundamentals and physics made the world of electronics way more satisfying than to always be tinkering but not really understanding.<p>I do think though that these topics are really quite difficult to understand and internalize. Even most practicing EE&#x27;s I think struggle with really able to internally translate the physics, and Maxwell&#x27;s laws into the day to day work. It is just quite abstract. I know I still struggle with it.<p>The truth is most EE work is not so different from software where you can get by most of the time by reading datasheets, basic laws, following working circuit examples, and relying on what&#x27;s worked in the past. You don&#x27;t have to derive everything from first principles all the time. There is just a wealth of well understood designs out there to pick from.

The main difference while getting started is that one does not lay out schematics while working with nspice, rather one just describes the circuits as graphs where the edges are electronic components.

Mostly they simply don&#x27;t, and scaling will kill what little that actually does form.<p>The article cites a couple of pieces addressing why Usenet died.  I&#x27;m fairly familiar with one of those as I wrote it about four years ago:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3c3xyu&#x2F;why_usenet_died&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3c3xyu&#x2F;why_use...<\/a><p>My thinking&#x27;s evolved somewhat.<p>First, as noted, Usenet was <i>small<\/i> by today&#x27;s standards, with Brian Reid and others&#x27; reports putting total active users at 140k (posting) from 880k with access, as of 1988, and just shy a million in 1995.  Total worldwide Internet usage in 1996 was about 16 millions (through growing rapidly).<p>Those would be failed-social-media-site numbers today.<p>Usenet, like Facebook, formed on and around academic communities, and specifically <i>highly selective<\/i> institutions.  This created several barriers to entry &#x2F; points of control, which were both highly discriminatory <i>and<\/i> highly effective at helping dissuade some of the worst forms of misbehaviour.  For a while.<p>The type of organisation of a discussion ... matters a lot.  Usenet&#x27;s fixed groups kind of worked and kind of didn&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ve seen a few additional models come up since.  Ad hoc structures (which Usenet didn&#x27;t support at all), personal &quot;salons&quot; (think a typical blog -- Charlie Stross&#x27;s comes to mind, also some social media hosts, Yonatan Zunger at G+ for those who were there).  Location, time-centred, event&#x2F;project based, and others.  Clay Shirkey&#x27;s concept of fluid organisations (something that can be dated back at least to Alvin Toffler&#x27;s <i>Future Shock<\/i>, 1970, and &quot;ad-hocracies&quot;) captures some of this.<p>The liability and business-model problems (both upside and risk) are really huge, and cannot be overstated.  I suspect a number of social media &#x2F; user-generated-content site&#x2F;service closures, including quite probably Google+ and Yahoo Groups, have much to do with this.<p>Factors-promoting-growth and factors-promoting-continued-survival differ hugely.  The elements which create a viable and attractive social network are almost entirely <i>nontechnical<\/i>.  The elements which are required for a social network to <i>continue<\/i> once it&#x27;s attained (or exceeded) critical mass are <i>highly technical<\/i> (though also call on a complex mix of other factors, business, social, legal, and more).  Critically:  the lessons and methods that <i>get<\/i> you successful won&#x27;t <i>keep<\/i> you successful.<p>Founding cohort is a huge factor for initial success and growth.<p>Starting a new social network with the express goal of becoming the next Usenet, or Facebook-killer, or whatever, is almost certainly doomed to failure.  Even more than starting <i>any<\/i> social network is.  Probably better is to address the needs of a specific, paying, interested, and motivated community, from which there may be a future growth path.<p>Tim Ferris&#x27;s downsides of fame article posted a few days back makes some really good points about bad actors and scale -- you only need a few dimwits at a million to a billion followers &#x2F; fans before negative encounters start becoming really common.  Human brains simply aren&#x27;t built for mass social network interactions, whether as one of the many or one of the few.<p>Any concept in which nominal success criteria are principally predicated on scale means winner-take-all dynamics, and that there can be at most only one winner.  Maybe a winner and an also-ran or two.  Given numerous factors including several mentioned above, the winner will likely be determined based on starting conditions and a lot of raw luck.  Possibly exchangable for ruthlessness.<p>We&#x27;ve existed in a technically-mediated world in which the winners have tended to be US or Wester-based private corporations.  The next decade or several may see changes to that.  US hegemony of the Internet has been strongly criticised.  Several of the possible alternative hegemons don&#x27;t strike me as notable improvements.<p>Given inherent monopolisation of technical communications, questions of closed vs. open protocols, and of private vs. public ownership and control, should be asked.<p>Changing open standards is extraordinarily difficult.  I&#x27;m inclined to say impossible.  More typically, they&#x27;re supersceded.  Sometimes by other open standards, increasingly of late, not.  The reasons for all of this would make for some extraoridinarily interesting academic research across numerous fields.<p>Agreeing on how to do things is the most underrated technological innovation of the past 200 years.<p>Usenet&#x27;s client-independence is often stated as a benefit.  I&#x27;ve argued that myself.  Given variations in message formats and posting behaviours encouraged by highly different client mechanics, I&#x27;m not so sure of that.  The Web is the worst possible applications development environment, but it does impose, not infrequently by force of law, a consistent UI&#x2F;UX and format.  Supporting <i>both<\/i> a useful level of behavioural consistency <i>and<\/i> a diversity of access tools would be a good but challenging goal.<p>In my earlier Usenet piece I talked about the obvious advantages of decentralisation.  I&#x27;ve been using several decentralised networks of late (Mastodon and Diaspora principally).  I&#x27;m not so certain the advantages are entirely obvious any more.  I think the questions &quot;what problems is decentralisation supposed to solve, and what new problems is it creating?&quot; need to be asked.<p>I&#x27;d <i>like<\/i> to believe decentralisation is a positive.  I&#x27;m not sure I can.<p>And I was wrong about Ellen Pao and Reddit.  She was doing well under an extraordinarily challenging environment, in which communicating basic facts was all but impossible.

Toward this end, HUAWEI and FUTUREWEI hired or attempted to hire Company 1 employees and directed these employees to misappropriate Company 1 source code on behalf of the defendants.<p>&gt;In or about July 2004, at a trade show in Chicago, Illinois, a HUAWEI employee (“Individual-3”), an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was discovered in the middle of the night after the show had closed for the day in the booth of a technology company (“Company 3”), an entity the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury, removing the cover from a networking device and taking photographs of the circuitry inside. Individual-3 wore a badge listing his employer as “Weihua,” HUAWEI spelled with its syllables reversed. In official correspondence with Company 3 shortly after this incident, HUAWEI claimed that Individual-3 attended the trade show in his personal capacity and that his attempted misappropriation occurred “without Huawei’s authorization.” According to a purported official statement published in Reuters, HUAWEI claimed, “This is a junior engineer who had never traveled to the United States before. His actions do not reflect the culture or values of Huawei.” Notably, a resume that Individual-3 submitted to the U.S. government in approximately 2012 stated that he had been a “senior R&amp;D Engineer” at HUAWEI from 1997 until July 2004, the time of the incident.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22320499\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22320499<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-14 00:19:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rickety-gherkin"],"id":[22322183],"kids":[22324640],"parent":[22320289],"text":["US political and militarized forces protecting corporate interest for the sake of...what again?

That combination also lowers the bar for what qualifies as &quot;a goal,&quot; providing a much larger universe of possible actions available for those who are establishing the goals.<p>With the lowered bar of what constitutes a goal, given that the overall costs are perceived to be so very low, the decision maker feels unburdened enough to choose goals without vetting the decision and its consequences against the standards that would be applied to &quot;hire a bunch of people to do that.&quot;  You&#x27;ve taken what used to be a decision that carried with it all the forethought and examination that one would usually apply to purchasing an automobile or home and replaced it with a decision that has no more consequential cost than to decide whether one wants fries or carrot sticks with a sandwich.<p>As with the choice of fries, it&#x27;s not the single instance of such a choice that lays you out on a cardiac surgeon&#x27;s table but instead the repeated accumulation of what seemed to be inconsequential decisions to get fries.

They only made one little decision whose importance was as fleeting as a single meal.

Facebook only gives you the option if your profile is set to single but that&#x27;s just a toggle.<p>That first week it was also already full of blatantly fake profiles. You&#x27;re telling me there are three women that look identical to Kevin Smith&#x27;s daughter and just happened to be at the same red carpet event, with the same dress, in the exact same pose? And then despite me having it set to female it showed me several men that I&#x27;m 99% certain were not trans and were either idiots and set their Facebook profile up wrong, or intentionally input things wrong to try and obfuscate their data profile.<p>It also made the promise (I think they did anyway) of not showing you people you were friends with. It didn&#x27;t, but it did show me a bunch of my graduating class from 16 years prior and gobs of friends of friends. I saw considerably more people on it that I knew&#x2F;knew of than I ever did with Tinder&#x2F;OkCupid&#x2F;Bumble."],"time":["2020-02-13 14:03:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pmlnr"],"id":[22317724],"kids":[22318204,22317824,22319374,22319543],"parent":[22316980],"text":["Only one week and regulatory forces managed to push back?!<p>I wonder when someone from the same regulatory forces will help Ruben out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruben.verborgh.org&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruben.verborgh.org&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;<\/a><p>He&#x27;s been waiting for over a year now for his actual dataset - fighting for us all."],"time":["2020-02-13 14:56:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Zenst"],"id":[22317116],"kids":[22317521],"parent":[22316980],"text":["Just in time for Valentines day, you just know somebody in marketing will be emoting over this.."],"time":["2020-02-13 13:14:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bilekas"],"id":[22317173],"kids":[22317393],"parent":[22316980],"text":["Ireland has a lot of strange relationships with large tech companies, but I can say for sure, we have some great data protection laws.<p>Genuinely delighted that some people pay attention to these things and know what they&#x27;re talking about."],"time":["2020-02-13 13:25:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jmnicolas"],"id":[22319831],"kids":[22320187,22337073,22335364],"parent":[22316980],"text":["What&#x27;s up with the F word being liberally used in the article ? oO"],"time":["2020-02-13 19:02:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["classified"],"id":[22317135],"kids":[22317445],"parent":[22316980],"text":["Comments from FB are boatloads of bullshit, as expected.

I would even argue extremely trivial.  Here is a video demo of one I built in the not too distant past (github link at the end): <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailmarkup.org&#x2F;sharefile&#x2F;demo1.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailmarkup.org&#x2F;sharefile&#x2F;demo1.mp4<\/a><p>It took me a little more than 2 weeks to write and test the GUI in that video.  From this experience I have learned the following:<p>* If you are comfortable working with the DOM and vanilla JS you should be spending more effort writing the content and services that populates the GUI rather than the GUI itself.  I would say this ratio of time should be something like 20% GUI and 80% content starting out and scaling towards greater content effort as the requirements upon the GUI increase.<p>* A JavaScript based GUI can be extremely fast and responsive.  The video demo was captured on a 4k resolution and it performs, at least to human interaction speed, just as responsively as the OS&#x27;s GUI even in VMs.  That high resolution also explains why the video text is hard to read on a small mobile device.  I intentionally wrote this to be fast though using vanilla JS and the standard imperative DOM methods, because that is the fastest way to execute things in the browser.  It stands to reason if you go about things in a much slower way it will likely perform slower, possibly slow enough that the user notices a huge difference.<p>* A JavaScript GUI can be extremely lightweight with tiny code.  This is only true if you are comfortable working with the DOM without a bunch of code decoration and abstraction nonsense.<p>* If the code is organized well it will scale well even in the face of numerous competing enhancements.  I solved the problem of scale with TypeScript interfaces and constant refactoring.<p>* There is one aspect that does not scale well, which any feature that requires complex algebra.  One example is dragging a highlight rectangle over some elements for a mass selection and ensuring that highlight rectangle is confined to the containing element and that it knows which elements of the parent element are visually occupying the same space and which ones aren&#x27;t.  Another example is that the CSS property text-overflow only works if dimensions are statically available to the current element or its parent node.  That means calculating a dimension for an element in order to set the value upon the element, which requires some calculation written by you instead of relying upon something like <i>display:block;width:auto<\/i>.<p>* All presentation, and I do mean absolutely everything except dynamically modified <i>display<\/i>, <i>opacity<\/i>, <i>position<\/i>, and specified dimensions should be in CSS.

The hierarchy is visualized by a path between the visited menus.

I wish I had the slides to show, but it appeared to be something out of a pop science article, and lacked much scientific background other than a sort of &#x27;drugs are harsh and non-specified, but I have a personalized treatment that works much better.&#x27;<p>This set off the crank alarm for me, which got even louder when he made claims about it being a sort of cure-all for psychiatric and even non-psychiatric problems (depression, PTSD, anxiety, concussion recovery, and even cognitive performance). Furthermore, he appeared to lack a technical or mathematical understanding of the technology itself, using only vague analogies about aligning the frequencies of different parts of the brain and whatnot. However, I&#x27;m not the one with titles and prestigious academic positions, so my complaints about his lack of evidence weren&#x27;t taken too seriously.<p>I asked him direct questions, but he didn&#x27;t answer much other than that his brother, a chiropractor, had helped him write the software for prTMS and designed the protocol (which I thought was very odd). Furthermore, he described prTMS as TMS-like treatment that was based on EEG readings and supposedly personalized, but given at a fraction of the intensity of usual TMS treatment (which made me skeptical that it would work).<p>I&#x27;m surprised that he was able to attract so many big-name patients and supporters - which included the Notre Dame University football team too. And, given that his lofty claims about prTMS are completely unsupported by research, I&#x27;m not surprised that it has reached the public eye.<p>Some of what was discussed in the article was news to me ($10 million in funds he said was for him, claims about Newport&#x27;s surveillance, etc) However, none of it was surprising.

I&#x27;m generally not into author-chiding, but TBH the post was written in a very inflammatory and ignorant fashion that I&#x27;d encourage the author to be more thoughtful in the future so that we can all get out of the muck.<p>1. False choice between &quot;unsafe&quot; and &quot;new&quot; languages. No, just no. Safe languages have been around since the 1960s (e.g. LISP). While it&#x27;s not really &quot;C versus the world&quot;, C&#x2F;C++ are in the vast minority when it comes to safety across all programming languages. Throw a stick, hit a safe programming language. Java, C#, Rust, Go, Python, Ruby, R, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, ML, Modula 3, TCL, JavaScript: the list goes on and on and on.<p>2. C programs don&#x27;t break. Just plain <i>false<\/i>. C and C++ are underspecified languages, meaning they have undefined behavior in some situations--actually, most situations. Undefined behavior is silent and there are poor diagnostics. It&#x27;s almost always a program bug. Undefined behavior and even nonportable behavior is absolutely rife in the C and C++ world. Programs aren&#x27;t necessarily portable across platforms, compilers, language versions, and even compiler bugs. Well-specified languages give programs a much better chance of being portable. Which leads to:<p>3. Portability is mostly a language issue. This is only partially true. The fact is that portability and forward compatibility (time safety as this person calls it) is a function of dependencies--on the language version, compiler, external libraries, and general environment around the program too. Fewer dependencies generally means better forward compatibility. It&#x27;s also good if those dependencies are maintained by teams who care a lot about backward compatibility. Some languages do more than others.<p>4. &quot;Time safety&quot; is a term. I have never heard of this term before, which just speaks to the uninformed nature of this post. I think the author means forward compatibility.<p>Anyway, if you feel like the core message of this post is that unsafe=future-proof, feel free to choose another unsafe language to do your next program. Hint: there aren&#x27;t many.<p>PS: Java 1.0 is now 25 years old.

Thus no core dumps should ever be necessary. It was logically impossible for any source language program to cause the computer to run wild, either at compile time or at run time. A consequence of this principle is that every occurrence of every subscript of every subscripted variable was on every occasion checked at run time against both the upper and the lower declared bounds of the array. Many years later we asked our customers whether they wished us to provide an option to switch off these checks in the interests of efficiency on production runs. Unanimously, they urged us not to--they already knew how frequently subscript errors occur on production runs where failure to detect them could be disastrous. I note with fear and horror that even in 1980, language designers and users have not learned this lesson. In any respectable branch of engineering, failure to observe such elementary pre- cautions would have long been against the law.&quot;<p>&quot;Hoare&#x27;s The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture&quot;, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.fsu.edu&#x2F;~engelen&#x2F;courses&#x2F;COP4610&#x2F;hoare.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.fsu.edu&#x2F;~engelen&#x2F;courses&#x2F;COP4610&#x2F;hoare.pdf<\/a><p>Still disappointed how Azure Sphere can sell its security story, while offering only C as programming language, so...<p>Even C++, with its copy-paste C89 compatibility, is already better than writing plain old C.
