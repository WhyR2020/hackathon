Feel free to copy and modify for your own use.<p>Hello Senator _________.<p>I&#x27;m writing you today to ask you to oppose the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2020. I have written in the past to ask you to oppose other extraordinary security measures that have been maintained since the aftermath of Sept. 11 2001. I repeatedly write and request this because it is my opinion that these programs are contrary to the 4th amendment protections that are unalienable to all Americans. And these programs are administered in secret. Any program maintained in secret runs the risk of operating contrary to the public interest. This is because a citizen&#x27;s most significant recourse is to vote for or against representatives who authorize government action. Any secret government action is therefore unable to be valued by a voter and therefor operates entirely outside public opinion.<p>I understand that some programs need to be shielded from public opinion for security reasons. But that need for security must be weighed against the need for a republican form of government to be transparent with its citizens. With each passing year that the public entrusts that government with secrecy the burden to justify it should become heavier.<p>So I ask you to oppose this measure. At the very least I would ask that as our representatives to government you will require that these programs justify their need by releasing some specific information to the public about the benefit they have had. I know that our intelligence agencies have opposed giving specifics examples of benefit. They claim to do so would reveal important sources or techniques. But with all due respect, we have given them the benefit of the doubt for nearly two decades now. Surely there is something significant they can share from years gone by that will not be too damaging to their operations.<p>Thank you."],"time":["2020-03-17 21:42:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anoplus"],"id":[22609861],"kids":[22610539,22613814,22609942,22609972],"parent":[22609462],"text":["The Coronavirus crisis is a perfect opportunity for governments to take totalitarian leaps forward.<p>Look what happened this week in Israel.

Is this code bug-free?  Is it robust and stable?  I tend toward the &quot;computer science as mathematics&quot; epistemology of Dijkstra and Hoare.  Invariants; inductive reasoning; temporal logic.  At least at the level of individual functions, I find that it is feasible to express with rigor and clarity what the function is intended to do, and to reason with precision through to a conclusion that the implementation fulfills the intent.  And, there is a test for every line of code.  A favorite quote from Knuth:  &quot;Don&#x27;t trust the following code.  I have only proven it correct, I have not tested it!&quot;<p>The moral questions concern the uses for which the code is designed, and the uses to which it will be put.  I work on medical device embedded software these days, and the moral dimension of this work is a very meaningful and concrete benefit of this choice.  I used to work on software development tools to support avionics development for the B-2 bomber.  While I don&#x27;t dismiss the latter as unambiguously immoral, it certainly was more problematic for me, an ongoing source of angst and struggle.<p>The aesthetic issues seem to me to be two-fold:  how beautiful is the software from the standpoint of the user?  And, how beautiful is the source code?  I have seen (and written) much code that is frankly an ugly mess.  I have also upon occasion had an inspiration about how to re-write a piece of code.  Tons of code gets deleted, and the new code is simple, clean, elegant, and inevitable.  I would go so far as to claim that at times I have been graced to write code that turned out to be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.  It seems to me that the &quot;Clean Code&quot; movement encourages creation of code that is elegant and beautiful.<p>I find that this triad of concerns inter-relate.  Beautiful code is more likely to be correct, and conversely.  Mindfully written code that is done with clarity and integrity tends to be both more beautiful and correct."],"time":["2020-03-17 21:31:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dredmorbius"],"id":[22609255],"kids":{},"parent":[22607568],"text":["See also William J.

My corrections:\n- DynamoDb allows for a lot of filtering, and Lambda + DDB Streams can do aggregations that are written as state changes and provide incredible read speeds. Use it if its a good fit, and its only a good fit if you&#x27;re ready to learn its query language and quirks. When it is a good fit, its a world-class database.<p>- SQS pricing is $0.0000004 per request [1] with 1 Million monthly messages free.<p>- SQS + SNS is far more flexible and reliable than Kinesis, plus you&#x27;re paying for and managing shards by the hour. Its great for streaming analytics data processing and distribution (within the Kinesis suite there is stream processing ala Spark and streaming ingest to Elastic, S3, and Redshift). If you&#x27;re not doing data engineering on a streaming set of events that can&#x27;t fit in a spreadsheet, its just not the right fit.<p>- Lambda is not expensive to use with DynamoDB at all, the pipes are so fast that that 50-100ms is typical for a call and response. Lambda does get gnarly with SQL databases that require connection management and pooling, but they have improved that situation on multiple fronts in the past 6-9 months.<p>- Also, Lambda ought to be considered the first choice for runtimes for greenfield apps, not just for AWS plumbing. This is strictly opinion and definitely depends on your team and existing codebase, but it makes sense from a cost and scaling standpoint for all kinds of projects.<p>- NLB should be the first choice only for specialized use cases like UDP services or those that require extraordinary throughput. ALB gives you an incredible feature set with things like HTTPS, Auth, access logging, routing requests to different machines or Lambdas based on url path, canary deployments, and more. Use as much or little as you like. The cost difference between ALB and NLB is negligible for most use cases.<p>If you&#x27;re new to AWS and cloud stuff: welcome, the water&#x27;s fine. Sure its hard at first to grok all the breadth and depth of the offerings, but you get to build with the same tools the largest services on the web depend on. Start small and pick a service, learn it from the console, then cli. Hit up the docs a lot and ask questions, there are lots of people that can help. Do NOT get lead astray by this article or opinion pieces on Medium.<p>Something like 75% of AWS services are geared at serving enterprises with on-premise data centers that want to move some or all of their workloads to the cloud. Stick with the basics like S3, Lambda, SNS, SQS, and whatever servers you need. Pick a managed service vs servers when you can unless you have solid sysadmin resources and a good reason. Avoid hourly billed services whenever you can until you can get cost management figured out. VPC is daunting unless you&#x27;re good with networking, but you can avoid it entirely by using the primitives mentioned above. IAM takes some real grokking, but there is almost nothing you can&#x27;t do with it to scope permissions both internally and externally.<p>AWS YouTube Channel is full of quality material for all levels.

Precisely. Most &quot;bicycle for the mind&quot; or &quot;tool for thought&quot; approaches go the completely opposite direction accidentally. Many programming languages and communities nowadays too.<p>In reality, if you wanna teach, you have to unveil the guts of the system. Sure, it&#x27;s &quot;scary&quot; and all, but still, initial hand-holding &amp; letting newcomers see the internals, rather than presenting an overly polished surface at the expensive of everything else, is a much better designed learning process. Design is &quot;how it works&quot; after all. *<p>Related: a common misconception when folks defend abstractions &amp; encapsulation is to raise the issue that letting newcomers explore the internals causes too much trouble. That&#x27;s an obvious strawman; these methods are not championing everyone writing anything everywhere. They can stay read-only, but public. E.g. an interface can expose its internal data types, without allowing consumers to actually leverage that (enforced through types or something else). This is easily doable, and you don&#x27;t sacrifice learnability in the service of team programming sanity.<p>* This point seems to get dismissed quickly by folks who only care about visual polish nowadays. Imo this is naive. I care about visuals a _lot_, and we should definitely aiming for both learning polish and surface polish. But you can&#x27;t let the latter calcify the former.<p>My advice for all the &quot;tool for thought&quot;&#x2F;&quot;bicycle for the mind&quot; projects: all your opaque designs and small interface flourishes  falter in the face of a properly exposed and clean-ed up paradigm, in the long run. This applies on a smaller scope to modern libraries too. That boilerplate generator you mega-fine-tuned to the point you delight yourself in guessing the user&#x27;s mind, ultimately is a roadblock in the learner&#x27;s thought process. Expose the boilerplate and document how you&#x27;re automating it instead. You&#x27;re trying to teach fishing, not to show off your own fish.<p>Another good analogy I&#x27;ve heard elsewhere is to ask whether you&#x27;re teaching people how to cook, or just building a microwave.

For that reason, I personally prefer designs that are transparent, rather than one that attempts to paint a pretty exterior on top of internal complexity. (Obviously correct, rather than not obviously wrong)<p>This leads to a subtle but crucial distinction between software “automating processes” without needing any humans in the loop -vs- amplifying the (expert) humans in the loop to do more stuff.<p>Another subtle (but arguably more important) effect comes from  McLuhan’s insight that the medium strongly influences the message.

My experience was that the tighter the feedback loop the less the bots would get stuck in weird places. So when I first was exposed to the concept of OODA, it was very clear to me that the concept mapped very neatly to the work I&#x27;d done. All the bots I&#x27;ve written got better essentially the more frequently I applied the OODA loop.<p>You&#x27;ll also find if you read the literature on situated agents, that robots got much better much faster once scientists started building them to react to the world, as opposed to the early days where it was assumed they&#x27;d need to build these massive models of the world for the robots who would then need to spend massive amounts of CPU time trying to decide what to do next.<p>What I think the article may be missing, when it talks about half-beats, is that ideally you really want to iterate over your OODA loop as fast as possible, so that you can make <i>more<\/i> decisions than your opponent. The first step is often to define your Action in the smallest timestep that you can. So if your opponent thinks one step is their smallest action. You should really be trying to define the smallest action as a half step. Now you can potentially make 2 decisions in the same amount of time. Then do this for each stage of the OODA loop. Find a way to Observe faster. Find a way to Orient faster. Find a way to Decide faster (even deciding to defer deciding until the next OODA loop).<p>At the end of the day, your sample rate and your real time deadlines dictate a lot about how an agent can act. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, a good algorithm will always trump a high sample rate, but don&#x27;t underestimate just how important a high sample rate is when talking about an OODA loop."],"time":["2020-03-17 20:53:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["akrumel"],"id":[22611535],"kids":{},"parent":[22601681],"text":["Boyd describes the OODA loop as an analogue process, not digital.

I find this theory difficult to employ in the technology&#x2F;startup arena in most cases. That said, the elements which make for an effective and efficient OODA loop are invaluable when building an effective organization.

What I need to\n&gt; &gt;decide is if we should use UIL or not.  Or maybe WINTERP?  Are there\n&gt; &gt;any strong oppinions out there one way or another?<p>&gt; One advantage of using UIL, is that it&#x27;s portable and is part of Motif\n&gt; from OSF (though for some reason, HP&#x27;s &quot;Motif&quot; release doesn&#x27;t include\n&gt; it).<p>I don&#x27;t work for the product division responsible for HP&#x27;s X products, and\nI don&#x27;t claim to speak for them. However, the rumor I heard is that UIL\nwasn&#x27;t included in HP&#x27;s product because &quot;it didn&#x27;t meet HP&#x27;s quality\nstandards for a supported software product.&quot; This is only a rumor, talk to\nsomeone in charge for the official poop.<p>The unofficial poop, which is my personal opinion (and reflects the\nopinions of others older, more experienced, and more learned than I) is\nthat UIL SUCKS. The idea itself is somewhat silly, the implementation is\nbuggy; and it is an inelegant solution to application customization.\nFinally, UIL doesn&#x27;t make life as an application programmer any easier --\nIt requires that you learn yet another programming language that is\ncompletely nonstandard, UIL, alongside a number of Motif resource manager\ncalls. You have to master all that while trying to understand the\ninteractions of the large number of features in the Motif toolkit. The\nrecent questions we&#x27;ve seen on this group about getting back the widgetID\nfor a widget created in UIL is a good example of the kinds of cruft that\nyou can expect when doing any sort of serious programming with UIL. And I\nwouldn&#x27;t expect to see any example-laden books like Doug Young&#x27;s excellent\nXt&#x2F;Motif text for UIL application programming in the near future.<p>In sum, if I didn&#x27;t have WINTERP around, I would prefer to program in\nstraight C rather than use UIL.<p>It still escapes me why UIL was ever built the way it is. The Motif widgets\nare essentially &quot;interpretive&quot; in that you can give programmatic commands\nto the Motif library to create new widgets, and the Xt intrinsics will\ncreate the new widget on-the-fly.  You can also send messages to created\nwidget objects via the &quot;methods&quot; in the Xt intrinsics, and especially via\nXtSetValues() -- these changes are also interpreted by the intrinsics and\nresult in an eventual updating of the visuals associated with the widget.\nThe only thing that is &quot;compiled&quot; about widgets is the order that they\nappear inside their &quot;manager&quot; and that ultimately depends on the\nimplementation of the manager widget.<p>UIL is thus a compiler for an interpreter. UIL compiles a widget layout\n(specified in a UIL text file) into a UID (user interface definition) file.\nA UIL-based application then uses the built in Motif resource manager to\nread in the compiled description of the layout in order to produce a user\ninterface. UIL then makes the claim that this can be used to drastically\nalter the look of an application independent of the program&#x27;s semantics\n(e.g. what the CHI community would call a &quot;UIMS&quot;). I seriously wonder how\ndrastic an alteration is possible without providing deeper hooks into the\nsemantics of the application itself. Alas, UIL is not a programming\nlanguage, so that is impossible.<p>Imagine, for example, what would be required to turn a &quot;pushbutton-based&quot;\napplication, such as the X11r3 xmh into a Mac-style &quot;pulldown-menu based&quot;\napplication?  How are you going to describe the semantics of the way the\ncurrent-selected message in the browser interacts with the current-selected\nfolder (selected via pulldown menu or dialog box) and the actions\nmove&#x2F;copy&#x2F;delete (also selected via menu)? Are you really going to be able\nto describe both styles of interface with UIL?? Or are you going to have to\nprovide two different styles of hooks in the application itself -- one UI\nhook for the pushbutton-based UIL interface, and another for a menu-based\nUIL interface. If you have to enumerate and hard-code every conceivable\ndialogue style in the application, is UIL really a useful UIMS??<p>No, really all that UIL gives you is an extension of the old &quot;Xdefaults&quot;\nscheme of customizing an application. Yes, UIL&#x27;s syntax makes it clearer\nwhich Xdefault resources will affect which widgets. Yes, UIL does allow you\nto specify the widget hierarchy and callbacks in an interface. However,\ncustomizing a UIL application will continue to be as tedious, if not more\ntedious than it is to currently customize an application via resource\nsettings. The current state of X applications is that you set X resources\n(via editing .Xdefaults or twiddling with xrdb) and then run an appliction\nto &quot;interpret&quot; the resource settings. If things don&#x27;t turn out right, you\nquit the application, edit your resourcre file again, and rerun the\napplication. Anybody that has tried this knows it is tedious, especially if\nthe application does alot of startup processing.  UIL gives you the same\ntedium, with an additional compilation step thrown in.  Sounds like a great\nidea, no?<p>And to make things worse, it is quite difficult to extend UIL to handle new\nwidgets. While the Motif toolkit does provide a broad coverage of UI needs,\nserious applications may end up using at least one new widget not contained\nin the existing Motif widget set....<p><pre><code>                                --------\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWINTERP attempts to solve some of the problems that UIL claims to solve,\nbut it takes a completely different tack. WINTERP gives you access to the\n&quot;interpretive&quot; nature of the Motif widgets through its built in mini-lisp\ninterpreter (XLISP). The lisp interpreter and the interactive interface to\nwidgets are useful both in prototyping an application, as well as allowing\nan end-user to customize a delivered application.<p>For prototyping, WINTERP allows you to incremetally build up a user\ninterface, piece by piece. It also means that you can &quot;play&quot; with the\ninterface, modifying both the look and feel of the application\ninteractively. WINTERP even includes a &quot;direct manipulation&quot; primitive that\nallows you to change widget resources, callbacks and eventhandlers by\ndesignating a widget with the mouse. With WINTERP, one need not suffer the\ntedium required in rerunning or recompiling the application in order to\nmake a change to a UIL or X resource -- incremental changes to an\napplication can be tested interactively.<p>Unkike UIL, WINTERP&#x27;s widget-description language is based on a REAL\nPROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, which enables you to use the language to represent\nand manipulate the state of the application and the UI. UIL is not a\nprogramming language, so you can only describe a widget layout, only mock\nup prototype a static interface; you have to go through alot of trouble in\norder to link up the functionality of your application with the dynamic\ndialog-style of display that makes up a real application.  WINTERP, on the\nother hand, will allow you to prototype the dynamics of the interface. In\nfact, WINTERP makes an excellent applications prototyping environment\nbecause you can use an interactive, high-level programing language to build\nthe user interface AND also prototype the &quot;dialogue&quot; aspects of the working\napplication.<p>For customizing a delivered application, WINTERP&#x27;s language interpreter\nallows users to interactively modify the interface and customize\napplication functionality.  WINTERP-based applications that are designed\nfor customizability will contain C-implemented lisp primitives to\naccomplish core functionality which the customizer can &quot;tie together&quot; via\ninterpreted lisp. Applications might come with a set of predefined\ninterface libraries that enable different interface styles, such as the\npulldown- versus button-based style mentioned above. Users may use\n&quot;programming by example&quot; to mix and match features and functionality\navailable in example interface profiles in order to come up with an\napplication better tailored to their needs. Often repeated commands can be\nincluded in new menu or pushbutton entries, and commands themselves can be\nmodified to suit the user&#x27;s needs.<p>WINTERP helps promote an &quot;open&quot;, tailorable architecture for applications\nbecause designers recognize that they cannot foresee all the possible needs\nof the end-user. Applications like gnuemacs and autocad have shown that\nsuch architectures are very poweful indeed. In addition to being &quot;open&quot; to\nthe application customizer, WINTERP is also &quot;open&quot; to other applications\nbecause WINTERP&#x27;s lisp interpreter is a SERVER (using TCP sockets). Other\napplications, possibly running non-locally, can send lisp commands to a\nWINTERP-based application in order to execute functionality internal to the\napplication. Such an architecture allows applications to talk to each\nother, share data, etc. You might think of such functionality as\n&quot;client-side NeWS without the postscript imaging model&quot;....<p>The choice of Lisp as the widget layout and prototyping language in WINTERP\nprovides numerous advantages. Lisp programs are in the same form as lisp\ndata. That means that lisp programs can easily perform computations to\ncreate&#x2F;alter data structures representing lisp programs. This sort of\nmeta-programming is especially useful in WINTERP because a user interface\ndescription in winterp-lisp can be treated both as data as well as a\nprogrammatic description of a user interface. That means you can use\nwinterp-lisp to create all sorts of dynamic widget layouts through lisp\ncomputations that create and mutate data strucures representing\nuser-interfaces. We are using this feature in our groupware toolkit to\nallow active user interfaces (akin to &quot;forms&quot;) to be created, filled out,\nprogram-transformed, shipped around via e-mail, and then interpreted on the\nreceiver&#x27;s workstation to pop up an active form.<p><pre><code>                        --------------------\n<\/code><\/pre>\nUIL could be useful however -- rather than being a &quot;compiler for an\ninterpreter&quot;, UIL could become a real compiler that took a structured\ndescription of an interface&#x27;s widget hierarchy, the resources used, the\ncallbacks, eventhandlers, etc. All that information could then be compiled\ninto straight Xlib + C code that would be much more efficient in size and\nserver resource usage than the equivalent Motif&#x2F;Xtoolkit calls.

I think they&#x27;d have a lot of fun with it once they got into it, but being an older DOS-based game, ASCII art and all, might be particularly strange to some. A lot of modern games, Minecraft being one that immediately comes to mind, invoke the creativity and that ZZT did in my generation. Still, I&#x27;d love to see what people would make in ZZT today.<p>Tangent: I can&#x27;t believe it was this long ago now, but about 10 years ago I started working on reverse-engineering ZZT with the goal of putting together a web-based implementation that was compatible.

I have used ZZT, and it is still used even now. One of my ZZT games includes a note that although the world itself is Free software, it is &quot;trapped&quot; because ZZT isn&#x27;t. That was written before ZZT source code has been reconstructed in this way, and now ZZT is Free software, although it is itself &quot;trapped&quot; because the compiler isn&#x27;t. There are many tricks and stuff involved in ZZT and I have figured out some things just by trying and then make the hypothesis how they worked, and now I can check the source code to see if it matches what I expected, too. But I can see in there also many things I did not know ZZT does, so this is helpful. Other people have also independently figured out many kind of tricks with ZZT (see [0] and [1] for some details). I also wrote my own external editor for ZZT (although unfortunately it is slow, and confusing, but I like it, and prefer that kind of user interface, which is why I wrote it, of course).<p>There are now other ZZT-likes, the most popular of which is probably MegaZeux (which is now Free software, and continues to be maintained), although there is also ZIG, and a few others, including my own ZZ Zero. Each of them has different set of features. Although, most of them aren&#x27;t used much other than ZZT and MegaZeux, I think.<p>The GitHub mentions to fix 5 annoying bugs in ZZT. I thought of fixing some bugs in ZZT (although not those that affect the behaviour of the game), and removing the editor (you can use an external editor instead, such as KevEdit or ZZTQED) and any stuff that is in there because it is only used by the editor, and probably also removing mouse and joystick mode and monochrome mode and VideoWriteTextCO40 (I don&#x27;t know why that is in there, since ZZT doesn&#x27;t use the forty column mode), and removing the initial prompt (to make it faster to load and further reduce the file size), and possibly adding an additional optional header in the world file which controls some new features and bug fixes, and allows customizing the contents of the ElementDefs array (the first number in the file would be different, so you can tell apart from standard ZZT worlds).

Food, cheap medicines like tylenol &amp; antibiotics, most facets of human life are dirt cheap from a production perspective, and this trend will continue from automation.<p>This means someone who is currently unproductive can be subsidized to survive for 10 full years, and if there&#x27;s even a small chance they become a high-productivity individual afterwards then society comes out ahead on net value. The actual numbers depend on how low we can push production costs with automation, but in the limit as human survival cost approaches zero relative to the economy, the only rational decision is to subsidize all human survival and work within that framework to encourage citizens to be even more productive. After all, if someone dies of lack of healthcare, or starves, or lives in the streets and doesn&#x27;t know how to get back off the streets, that&#x27;s a net loss to humanity in opportunity cost. If that person had just been subsidized through their hard times, there&#x27;s a non-zero chance they become high value to society.<p>UBI allows us to reap these benefits in an efficient manner: using the free market. But, speaking today not in the long term, there are exceptions to the low cost of human survival which would hamper UBI from being effective.<p>In our (American) society, there are a few base needs that we <i>haven&#x27;t<\/i> adequately driven down costs. Shelter mostly, also any healthcare that is more involved than taking a pill a day (notably: seeing a doctor). Humankind in general CAN make these costs low for the most part, but American society in particular has NOT made these costs low.<p>We need to address the housing &amp; urban development crisis, and we need to address the healthcare crisis.<p>The housing &amp; urban development crisis is a system of regulations and inaction that have simultaneously limited the amount of housing near desirable locations, while failing to provide efficient transportation to bring people in from less desirable locations. In other words, housing costs are dominated not by the cost to build a house, but the cost of land. This can be addressed by reforming our awful &amp; piecemeal zoning, construction, and transportation systems and their respective regulations. Optionally, some might suggest that we try to fight against the ongoing trends of urban consolidation; if people have a reason to move to upstate new york or the midwest, instead of to NYC, then housing costs aren&#x27;t a problem. But right now all economic incentives point to moving to NYC metro, given the choices, and personally I don&#x27;t like to wage war against the tide of the free market.<p>The healthcare crisis is one of rent seeking by insurance companies upon our awful half-assed nearly-free-market approach to healthcare. Quite simply, people don&#x27;t have choices (your healthcare options are restricted by your insurance, which is restricted by your employer), and no prices on anything are known ahead of time. This adds up to an ultra-inefficient system. By doing just about anything that stops the rent seeking of the insurance system upon the healthcare system so we can more efficiently treat a healthy society (there are free market solutions, but personally I would put my weight behind medicare-for-all).<p>In conclusion, if we give everyone $1000&#x2F;mo, that&#x27;s going to get funneled into bidding up rent in big cities or surprise healthcare bills. We need to solve these issues with our free market before we take a free market approach to the common welfare; until then I would advocate more targeted approaches that are less likely to invite rent seeking behavior (foodstamps and such)."],"time":["2020-03-17 15:26:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bluedino"],"id":[22600550],"kids":[22602055,22601519,22602202,22602509],"parent":[22599838],"text":["&gt;&gt; Seventy-eight percent of Americans are already living paycheck to paycheck; almost half can’t afford an unexpected $400 bill<p>On big part of this is Americans a whole need to get better with their money.<p>I know many people can&#x27;t save because of low income (or lack thereof), but 78%?

It took me a while before I got to the point where I think I can be productive in both querying the data from the front-end and getting back the shape that I wanted. Couple of lessons learned:<p>- Start with separating your API models and DB models out early, you&#x27;ll be thankful later. You can also help yourself out by implementing From&#x2F;Into for your database models to your API models. Obvious lesson from CQRS but since rust doesn&#x27;t allow easily for ad-hoc structs this is a must, especially since there are a lot of examples out there that put a Serialize&#x2F;Deserialize onto the database object.<p>- If you have deeply nested objects, look into JSON:API or Juniper. There are a couple of crates that implement the jsonapi spec and I&#x27;m hacking on one of them to make it a bit more usable for my personal pet project, but Juniper will make your life easier especially if you&#x27;re starting with a React frontend.<p>- Understand that there&#x27;s still a tracking issue for a few items such as multipart data, although there&#x27;s a third party crate that integrates the multipart crate into rocket. However if you need an upload you could probably get away with just returning a signed S3 endpoint to the user, which is what I ended up doing<p>- If integrating with redis or some other database that&#x27;s not application critical, there is no (as far as I&#x27;m aware) graceful degredation that comes out of the box with rocket_contrib, unless there was some config value I was missing. This is usually fine, since you can easily declare an ad-hoc fairing that connects to redis and falls back to an Option::None in the case where it couldn&#x27;t connect.<p>And finally, if you want to support different error status codes yourself based off of mappings from internal errors (such as 409 conflict when inserting the same data), your best bet is an enum that&#x27;s wrapped by a responder derive like so:<p><pre><code>    #[derive(Responder, Debug)]\n    pub enum UserApiError {\n        #[response(status = 500, content_type = &quot;json&quot;)]\n        Unavailable(Json&lt;UserApiErrorMessage&gt;),\n    }\n\n    impl UserApiError {\n        fn wrap_body(message: &amp;str) -&gt; Json&lt;UserApiErrorMessage&gt; {\n            Json(UserApiErrorMessage {\n                status: &quot;error&quot;.to_string(),\n                message: message.to_string(),\n            })\n        }\n\n        pub fn unavailable(message: &amp;str) -&gt; Self {\n            Self::Unavailable(Self::wrap_body(message))\n        }\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhich can be called like:<p><pre><code>    Err(UserApiError::unavailable(&quot;The database is gone!&quot;))\n<\/code><\/pre>\nMost of my other lessons learned come from diesel, both are an absolute pleasure to work with and have given me incredible confidence while coding."],"time":["2020-03-17 18:16:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saagarjha"],"id":[22606534],"kids":[22606852,22607600,22607289,22607552],"parent":[22591544],"text":["&gt; Adding the --vcs git flag also has cargo create a gitignore file so that the target folder isn’t tracked by git.<p>Doesn’t cargo make a git repository by default, anyways?

What I take from them is:<p>- Chinese doctors initially tested chloroquine in-vitro on SARS-Cov-2 and it reduced the viral load significantly. Similar results were observed with other viruses including SARS-Cov.<p>- They then tested it in-vivo (on patients) and it showed promising results<p>- The speaker explains then that they had 3 cohorts of infected patients on which they tested daily for SARS-Cov-2. First cohort was the control (no treatment), second one received Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), third one received Plaquenil and azithromycin (an antibiotic). After 7 days 1st cohort had approximately 85% testing positive, 2nd 40%, 3rd 5%. One could be surprised by the use of an antibiotic but it apparently helps with fight opportunistic bacterial infection resulting from a viral pneumonia. He adds that for every recorded death, the patient tested positive for the virus before their death and concludes that if the double treatment of azythromicin + Plaquenil reduces the viral load, then it would improve patient prognosis.<p>In conclusion, I think it&#x27;s quite a big deal if it is confirmed that chloroquine can reduce contagiosity and improve outcomes. It&#x27;s widely available, cheap and safe. Give it to everyone showing symptoms, individuals who were in contact with confirmed cases, medical professionals, and you&#x27;ll surely reduce R0 significantly.<p>video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n4J8kydOvbc&amp;feature=emb_title\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n4J8kydOvbc&amp;feature=emb_titl...<\/a><p>pre-pub paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0924857920300820?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S092485792...<\/a><p>ppt (last page is result of experiment mentioned above): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediterranee-infection.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;COVID-19.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediterranee-infection.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;20...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-18 00:27:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tim333"],"id":[22612910],"kids":{},"parent":[22609207],"text":["Good to see some progress.

Elon told his workers to stay home even if they feel &quot;slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable&quot; [0]. Yet, according to the CDC, symptoms may not appear until 2-14 days after exposure [1].
