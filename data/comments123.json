What they don’t realize is that the credibility premium historically enjoyed by professional institutions is plummeting toward zero. This fact is so obvious to younger Millenials and Zoomers that it goes unremarked, undebated, because it is already baked-in to their reading&#x2F;watching behaviors.<p>The idea that traditional news media is losing credibility to blogs has been around since at least the 2004 US Presidential Election, which is when regular people starting discovering blogs.<p>The web was a lot less populated then, and large sites did not attempt to crowd out smaller sites by generating SEO-optimized content by the metric ton. Bots didn&#x27;t pollute commment sections to the point where organic communities left out of exasperation. You could create a blog and be reasonably certain of developing an audience. The idea of AOL-style walled gardens seemed deeply outdated.<p>FFWD 10 years, and now the vast majority of internet activity occurs in walled gardens, be it FB, IG, Twitter, Reddit, Spotify, YouTube, Twitch, you name it. People don&#x27;t even bookmark sites anymore, their muscle memory causes them to open Reddit or FB and just mindlessly browse.<p>So you start a self-owned blog in 2020.

It was on the man who assaulted me.<p>As long as women can be shamed and blackmailed and no amount of trying to &quot;be good&quot; is ever adequate protection, you will see things in this vein. No woman should ever be characterized as a &quot;whore.&quot; We don&#x27;t do that to men. Men who get around have bragging rights for &quot;being a stud&quot; or whatever.<p>I understand some of the reasons it gets treated differently. In a nutshell, men can walk away from a one-night-stand and never know a pregnancy resulted. In contrast, a woman can end up a single parent and not know the father&#x27;s name and it can trap her and her child in poverty for life.<p>But doubling down on saying it&#x27;s the woman&#x27;s responsibility to &quot;be moral&quot; and high fiving men for being able to get away with it just deepens the problem.<p>Prudish cultures, where &quot;good girls don&#x27;t,&quot; see a lot more prostitution. Studies show that availability of porn tends to drive down the incidence of rape.<p>Human sexual need -- both physical and emotional -- is very powerful. It really doesn&#x27;t work to insist everyone just say no to sex. Without socially acceptable outlets that help keep all parties safe and help mitigate the inherent risks (such as disease and unexpected pregnancy), you just compound problems and actively create problems.<p>I have mixed feelings about seeing this on HN.

This can deepen these problems.<p>We must, collectively, find ways to build bridges and foster healthy and safe avenues for sexual expression and sexual satisfaction.

Linux goes to such incredible lengths to be bug-for-bug backwards compatible, but then the complexities of all of our layers of libcs, shared libraries, libsystemd, dbus, etc cause unnecessary pain and breakage at every level. Furthermore, cross-compiling C code across different architectures on Linux is far harder than it needs to be. I have a feeling that there wouldn&#x27;t be as much interest in the steady stream of sandboxes and virtual machines (JVM, NaCl, PNaCl, flatpak, docker, WebAssembly) if we could just simplify the layers and layers of cruft and abstractions in compiler toolchains, libc implementations, and shared libraries. Practically every laptop and server processor use the exact same amd64 architecture, but we have squandered this opportunity by adding leaky abstractions at so many levels. I can&#x27;t wait until installing a program on linux is as simple as downloading a static executable and just running it and I hope zig brings this future.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2u2lEJv7Ukw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2u2lEJv7Ukw<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5S2YArCx6vU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5S2YArCx6vU<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-24 23:15:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["airstrike"],"id":[22680303],"kids":[22681433,22680879,22680577,22681579],"parent":[22679138],"text":["&gt; Take a moment to appreciate what just happened here - I downloaded a Windows build of Zig, ran it in Wine, using it to cross compile for Linux, and then ran the binary natively.

Why not just plain keywords? And cleanup some of it: `@cos`, `@sin`, also feel like too much when they are already in the stdlib I believe.<p>-  |x| for&#x2F;while list bind var, why not just for(x in y)? Surrounding pipes are really annoying to type in some foreign keyboards and feel totally needless in 99% of the places.<p>- inconsistent required parenthesis predicates in block statements in &quot;test STR {}&quot; vs. &quot;if() {}&quot;. Either require parenthesis or don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t really care which one.<p>- prefixed type signatures, `?[]u32` feels a little off &#x2F; harder to read.<p>- comment-looking, noisy prefixed multi-line slashes `\\\\`.<p>- the need to dig deep into &quot;std&quot; to get your everyday lib functions out &quot;std.io.getStdOut().outStream().print()&quot;. `@import(&quot;std&quot;)` repeated many times.<p>- consider implementing destructuring syntax early-on to deal with so much struct member depth ie `const { x, y } = p` or `const { math: { add, mul } } = @import(&quot;std&quot;)`.<p>- anonymous list syntax with `.{}` is eye catching as the dot implies &quot;struct member&quot; in Zig, but then the dot is everywhere, specially when you do anonymous structs `.{.x=123}`, maybe consider `[1,2,3]` and `[x=123]` given brackets are being used for array length annotation anyways ie `array[]`.<p>- `.<i>` suffix for lvalue and rvalue pointer deref. Also `&quot;str&quot;.<\/i>` is a byte array unroll if I understood correctly. Here `f.* = Foo{ .float = 12.34 };` looks like it&#x27;s doing something with `.` to get to the struct members but it&#x27;s actually just a pointer deref.

AMA! Fun to see this on HN.<p>A few replies to some good questions:<p>1. Per @JdeBD, that was the Wikipedia edit that started everything. After 30+ hrs of online research, all roads lead back to this edit. I read 3 books on the island and found no mention of the boulder.<p>2. I took a bunch of photos that didn&#x27;t make the article. Happy to share them offline with interested parties, but given that I could not find MB, they don&#x27;t prove much.<p>3. The article does focus on us getting lost but that happened well after we left Ryan Island. This confused the NPR reporter too. Ryan Island is pretty easy to get to from Malone bay which is just a water taxi away from Rock Harbor. We had a working GPS with us the whole time which made certain legs of the trip a lot easier. How did we get lost with a GPS? The island is a mix of clearly marked dirt trails and large rock fields with no trail markings. You need to have a great sense of direction and some luck to pick up the trail again after traversing each rock field. We got lost after what must have been a quarter-mile rock field at 1am and the GPS didn&#x27;t have the hiking trail marked in that area.<p>4. We made 2 landings at different points on Ryan Island, one southern and the other west &#x2F; north-western. I did a lot of bushwacking from both points but there was no evidence of any water on the island or even mud where there could have been a &quot;seasonal&quot; pool. I was looking for a clearing or any kind of large flat-ish area but couldn&#x27;t find anything like that larger than a few feet in diameter. The (small) island is extremely rocky and densely wooded.<p>5. Re the route, as many have noted it was very convoluted. We originally planned to go 18 miles in a day - the first half mostly paddles and portages, the second half is an 11-mile coastal trail back to Rock Harbor. The plan was to abandon the canoe at the halfway point and come back and get it via water taxi the next morning. After getting lost we gave up at the halfway point around 4am and camped for the night there."],"time":["2020-03-24 21:15:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["skat20phys"],"id":[22675437],"kids":[22676858,22675655,22675497,22677144],"parent":[22674342],"text":["I&#x27;ve been there and have mixed feelings about this.<p>On the one hand, the boulder has always seemed fishy to me. It&#x27;s a remote location and I doubt many people would track something that small, or care enough about it to know about the seasonal changes at that boulder. It also doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me geologically, although it&#x27;s possible. I also years ago remember people familiar with the site jokingly talking about how &quot;<i>if<\/i> there were a boulder there...&quot; which lent the whole thing a sense of fiction when I started reading about it. It was easy to see how a humorous fantasy could change into folk legend and then into documentation.<p>On the other hand, where are the photos? Where&#x27;s the meticulous documentation? To trek all the way there to address this and then not take copious photos to share with the media?<p>They also got lost, which adds to my skepticism they even made it there, or were sure they did. Can you get lost there? I suppose -- there are a ton of islands and things there so I can see that -- but the area is blanketed with topo map coverage, and you&#x27;ve got GPS now. If someone were to get lost there, I&#x27;d question whether or not they even got to where they wanted to begin with. Siskiwit Lake is a fairly large feature on Isle Royale, and the nesting doll nature of the goal makes your target hard to miss.<p>In short, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the boulder isn&#x27;t there (or isn&#x27;t surrounded by water).

It has the lowest screen sharing latency\nof any product we’ve tested: 30-50ms best-case end-to-end latency\nbetween screen capture and render, vs. 100ms-150ms in regular WebRTC.\nThis means it’s great for remote pair programming, which was\nScreenhero’s biggest use case.<p>We have voice, video, multiplayer drawing and control, and ephemeral\nmessaging, and we integrate with GCal and Slack.<p>We have native apps for Mac, Windows, and Linux (Screenhero’s\ntop-requested feature was Linux support). We use custom native code to\nmake multiplayer control work, and a heavily-modified custom fork of\nElectron to minimize latency. It&#x27;s WebRTC-compliant, so you can share\nmeeting links that anyone can join with a WebRTC-compliant desktop or\nmobile browser — no download required.

We&#x27;re hoping to have a spacy-nightly up soon that\n    builds on the new version of Thinc.\n\n    The main thing we want to do differently is having \n    shared encoding layers across the pipeline, with several\n    components backproping to at least some shared layers of\n    that. So that took a fair bit of redesign, especially to\n    make sure that people could customize it well.\n\n    We never released models that were built on wide and \n    deep BiLSTM architectures because we see that as an \n    unappealing speed&#x2F;accuracy trade-off. It also makes the\n    architecture hard to train on few examples, it&#x27;s very \n    hyper-parameter intensive which is bad for Prodigy.\n\n    Their experiments do undercount us a bit, especially \n    since they didn&#x27;t use pretrained vectors, while they \n    did use pretrained vectors for their own and Flair&#x27;s \n    models. We also perform really poorly on the CoNLL-03 \n    task. I&#x27;ve never understood why --- I hate that dataset.\n    I looked at it and it&#x27;s like, these soccer match \n    reports, and the dev and test sets don&#x27;t correlate well.\n    So I&#x27;ve never wanted to figure out why we do poorly on \n    that data specifically.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAs an example of what I mean by &quot;under counting&quot;, we can get to 78% on the GermEval data, while their table has as on 68%, while FLAIR and Stanza are on 85%. So we&#x27;re still behind, but by less. The thing is, the difference between 85 and 78 is actually quite a lot -- probably more than most people would intuit.<p>I hope we can get back to them with some updates for specific figures, or perhaps some datasets can be shown as missing values for spaCy. Running experiments with a bunch of different software and making sure it&#x27;s all 100% compatible is pretty tedious, and it won&#x27;t add much information. The bottom-line anyone should care about is, &quot;Am I likely to see a difference in accuracy between Stanza and spaCy on my problem&quot;. At the moment I think the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. (Although spaCy&#x27;s default models are still cheaper to run on large datasets).<p>We&#x27;re a bit behind the current research atm, and the improvements from that research are definitely real. We&#x27;re looking forward to releasing new models, but in the meantime you can also use the Stanza models with very little change to your spaCy code, to see if they help on your problem."],"time":["2020-03-25 10:49:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justlexi93"],"id":[22682462],"kids":{},"parent":[22663322],"text":["I&#x27;d like to know:<p>How the language model-based tokenizers fare on domain-specific documents, since language models don&#x27;t have context for unknown tokens.<p>Are language model-based tokenizers any better at identifying abbreviations than rule-based ones?"],"time":["2020-03-25 07:35:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["StreamBright"],"id":[22678706],"kids":[22679824,22679699],"parent":[22663297],"text":["&quot;Remember that whatever works best for you, it’s still better than having to malloc and free by hand.

I&#x27;m an industrial engineer, so production issues and supply&#x2F;demand issues are always of interest to me.  A few possibilities:<p>* Adding shifts at overtime pay to meet demand (lower profit&#x2F;unit, but more equipment utilization and total profit)<p>* Potentially higher freight charges (entirely unsure how freight rates are going these days compared to normal)<p>* Calloffs from employees from illness, exposure, or fear<p>* Lacking supply if they&#x27;re working on a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system - where the supplier owns inventory until pulled by a customer, at which time the supplier gets paid.  These agreements often have parameters about stocking and forecast levels, which are typically fine, but then Sales talks about the &quot;customer relationship&quot; and wants to make drastic changes to how the factory runs (sub-optimizing production) to keep $bigCustomer happy.<p>Per the manager, the grocery store near me averages 10 units&#x2F;day of toilet paper sold (good size town in the Midwest, with many grocery stores).  One day about 2 weeks ago they sold 3,000 units.  They have ~75 feet of shelf space (4 shelves high) dedicated to toilet paper.  Literal semi&#x27;s full of toilet paper flying off the shelves.  They now have a limit if 1 unit per trip.<p>I&#x27;ve been to the store twice since then and always check the toilet paper aisle as a gauge of how they&#x27;re doing.

I see a lot of comments around Raspberry Pi, performance and VM. I just want to shed a light on some things here. Turing Pi is not about performance, it&#x27;s about cluster architecture. If you look at Turing Pi as a homelab project, then yes, you can get more performance with some used cheap servers. Of course, if you get approval from your homies to occupy a closet. You can even run apps in containers with Kubernetes orchestration using VM and so on.<p>The main idea behind Turing Pi is to deliver compute to the edge. If we look at cases where some compute will run low latency, highly available and internet independent apps to automate processes, and often in a hard to reach places, then the classic servers, not a solution. Turing Pi is an early version of edge computers with cloud-native architecture. Why it&#x27;s important? Because if you are a business with some services running in the cloud and you want your edge computing organically to coexist with your cloud stack, then edge clusters could be a great choice. The speed to innovate and deploy your code into production to both cloud and the edge environment could be a critical component.<p>The existing Turing Pi model more oriented at forward-thinking developers who want to learn and push cloud-native to the edge. Why Raspberry Pi computers? They are not the most powerful computers, but they definitely can lower the entry point for developers by offering a huge and well-documented software ecosystem."],"time":["2020-03-25 21:07:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moondev"],"id":[22678096],"kids":[22679541,22678811,22678480,22678675,22680662,22678254],"parent":[22677965],"text":["Looking at the specs, it seems almost dishonest to promote this for kubernetes.<p>&gt; The nodes interconnected with the onboard 1 Gbps switch.

Nothing can clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old crufty comment that propagates lies and misinformation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Comments are not like Schindler&#x27;s List. They are not &quot;pure good.&quot; Indeed, comments are, at best, a necessary evil. If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need comments very much -- perhaps not at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration.\n&gt; \n&gt; So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it through and see whether there isn&#x27;t some way to turn the tables and express yourself in code. Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression.<p>Previous related Discussions on NH:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073230\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073230<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073620\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073620<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;285787&#x2F;clean-code-comments-vs-class-documentation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2857...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-25 02:07:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["turbinerneiter"],"id":[22675900],"kids":{},"parent":[22675165],"text":["Pandoc solves most of the shortcomings of markdown.

I&#x27;m writing a little site generator for my blog and after exploring a a lot of different options I decided to come up with my own format!<p>XML is a great way to write structured documentation. It is the best option for &quot;mixed content&quot;, that is, content that has character data, optionally interspersed with structured elements. The problem is that most standard XML documentation formats (docbook, dita, etc.) are heavy and most times overkill. I&#x27;m using RelaxNG [2] to create a schema of my custom format document [2], and a bit of XSLT3 [3] to generate HTML5.<p>RelaxNG is great, and pretty easy to use. You can think of it as a &quot;regular expression over trees&quot;. The syntax is pretty intuitive, specially the compact form (there&#x27;s an XML form too). For instance:<p><pre><code>    start = element doc {\n      attribute title { text } ?,\n      element p { text } *\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n... defines the schema for a document that should have a &quot;doc&quot; root tag, an optional title attribute, and 0 or more &quot;p&quot; elements, that should contain only text.<p>The way I went about it, I&#x27;m just inspiring my format in a small subset of HTML5, plus some tags that I want to use to provide more structured information.<p>XSLT 3.0 came a long way since the version 1.0 that everybody remembers and loathes. Now, XSLT3 has maps, arrays, functions, higher order functions, and all sort of other goodies that people have come to expect from a modern programming language. Yeah, you still need to get pass the XML syntax, but it is not a big deal once you get the hang of it.<p>Finally, writing XML &quot;by hand&quot; is not a big deal neither. I&#x27;m using Emacs with the nxml and emmet [4] package, and I just needed to learn a few keystrokes for doing things like automatically closing tags. Emmet is amazing and fun to use to create small chunks of content at a time.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RELAX_NG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RELAX_NG<\/a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;EmmanuelOga&#x2F;39ddb345c2a499690e728e5908e942f2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;EmmanuelOga&#x2F;39ddb345c2a499690e728e59...<\/a><p>3: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;tags&#x2F;xslt-3.0&#x2F;info\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;tags&#x2F;xslt-3.0&#x2F;info<\/a><p>4: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emmet.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emmet.io&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-25 00:15:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Skunkleton"],"id":[22679540],"kids":{},"parent":[22675165],"text":["I would rather have markup free documentation than no documentation at all.

I wrote a paper in college that argued a very similar line of reasoning. I based this largely around the conversation that was had about aerial bombing during the inter-war period.<p>During WWI a biplane or two was able to fly over Paris and drop a grenade. It caused quite a scandal with some Navy high ups condemning the concept of aerial bombardment altogether. By the end of the inter-war period there was a strong stigma against it. The concept of using bombs on civilian centers was pretty much unthinkable. Until of course the war began and it wasn&#x27;t. Throughout the war taboos were approach and broken one after another.<p>When the U.S. joined the war, there was a major row between U.S. and British airforce commanders about using bombers at night. The U.S. thought it unethical, especially since they had invested in a supposedly superior bomb sight which was rendered essentially useless at night. The British, facing an existential threat were not so scrupulous. Of course the night raids soon began.<p>So by war&#x27;s end there was virtually no size of bomb nor target that was much unacceptable even though the idea of aerial bombing of even soldiers had been distasteful at its start.<p>Give this, the only reason I could think that chemical weapons had not followed the same slippery slope was that they were far less useful.<p>I got an A- on the paper, my teacher said it was good but too fringey.

Most hospitals had their own supply of this component and could have substituted it in, but the way the FDA approved the CDC test banned them from doing this.<p>The CDC tried as hard as it could to fix their broken tests quickly, but they weren’t able to do it fast enough to satisfy demand. In order to ration the scarce tests, they mandated that hospitals only test people who had recently been to China, or been in close contact with someone who had.<p>This was a disaster. For example, here’s a story from a person who traveled to Japan, where the coronavirus is active. He came back to the US, started developing symptoms, and went to a hospital. The hospital said since he hadn’t been to China, they couldn’t test him, and <i>sent him home<\/i> (he voluntarily quarantined after discharge, so thanks).<p>But even worse, the policy ruled out by fiat ever being able to detect when the epidemic spread to the US. So in mid-February, when a patient with no history of travel to China came to a hospital in California with coronavirus symptoms, the doctors had to ask the CDC for special permission to test. The CDC dithered for four days before granting the permission, during which nobody put any work into containing the disease. Finally the test came back positive – after some health workers had already been infected.<p>There were many points where this could have been avoided. A better CDC could have made tests that worked from the beginning, or ramped up production of working tests faster, or come up with smarter criteria for rationing tests. But it would have been even better to have a system where things don’t have to go perfectly, and where a few mistakes don’t choke up the entire response to an epidemic for weeks. If we hadn’t let our culture reach the point where governments ban things by default and review at leisure, and where individual iniative is frowned upon in favor of waiting for official permission to do the right thing, we could have recovered from all of these mistakes. Hospitals would have used their existing tests which they already have more than enough of, doctors would have had permission to test suspicious cases at their discretion, and we would have had a chance to catch infections early before they could spread. If the government didn’t already regulate adrenaline, buspirone, insulin, and genetic testing to the point of near-unavailability, maybe people would have thought it was weirder, or raised more of a fuss, when they started doing it for coronavirus tests.<p>If you don’t trust me, trust former FDA director Scott Gottleib, who explains the situation here in an unusually candid communication from an ex-government official talking about his former agency. His Twitter feed is a great source of information in general.<p>And here’s a more careful analysis of some of the laws around diagnostic testing and how they contributed to the current crisis. And by more careful, I mean it ends with “Bottom line: the FDA is going to kill us all”.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;coronavirus-links-spec...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-25 00:46:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["omgJustTest"],"id":[22679598],"kids":[22679624,22679985,22679886,22679744],"parent":[22678169],"text":["This article does not mention the WHO offered tests to the US before the CDC decided it should make its own[1].

I already do remote work from home and hardly go anywhere other than to get groceries or takeout.<p>I began doing remote work about 8 years ago while homeless. It was a good solution for my circumstances and it was a good solution for my health issues that were the actual root cause of my financial problems and homelessness.<p>Doing remote work has helped me protect my health and grow gradually healthier when that&#x27;s not supposed to be possible. So I can&#x27;t help but wonder how many people with serious health issues could be healthier if they lived more or less under quarantine.<p>I also homeschooled my special-needs sons for years. One if them has the same medical condition I have. They also have other issues.<p>As a homeschooling mom, I was a remote volunteer worker for an education related organization. They helped me get to a related conference on the other side of the continent where I was a very low level presenter.<p>I feel strongly that people with &quot;quirks&quot; -- health issues, ADHD, etc -- are the ones at the most risk of homelessness because they just can&#x27;t make a &quot;normal&quot; life work and we do a generally poor job of telling people that there are lots of other ways to live and work, you just have to find the ones that work for you.<p>I&#x27;ve spent some years trying to develop websites and the like to help homeless people and people at risk of homelessness to find ways to make their lives work. I think remote work and other &quot;irregular&quot; work options are key to that.<p>I&#x27;ve never gotten much traction and the past decade has cured me of childhood brainwashing where I was always at the top of my class and the world around me kept saying I mattered and all. At this point, I&#x27;m quite convinced that I shall always be perpetually ignored.<p>I think I can make my own life work, so I sort of don&#x27;t care anymore. But it seems like a missed opportunity because I already know so very much about germ control, working remotely, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what my point is. I&#x27;m not sure I have a point or that there is any point to trying to talk to with people about this. Recent years have painted me as some kind of clown that no one should take seriously.<p>I think a lot of these decisions are going to de facto be made by the usual suspects for whom &quot;normal&quot; life works well, which is how and why they got into power. And I think that fact will help insure that people conclude that this doesn&#x27;t really work and it needs to be temporary and it&#x27;s imperative we return to &quot;normal&quot; as soon as possible.<p>But working from home was the historic norm. Family farms and craftspeople with a shop in one part of the building and their home in the same building and even retail establishments with the owners living upstairs was the norm for much of human history. Separating our living and working spaces is relatively recent. It&#x27;s the weird and new thing.<p>My father was old enough to be my grandfather and I grew up with a garden in the backyard and a father who hunted and am mother who sewed a lot of my clothes. It was, in some ways, like a throwback to a prior century.<p>So those &quot;old ways&quot; are kind of living memory for me. And I never know how to effectively talk to people and say &quot;No, seriously, it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. We don&#x27;t have to accept these kinds of problems as the price for having a paycheck or something.&quot;<p>I hope we embrace a philosophy that gives people more options, not fewer. I hope we can find the opportunities and the upside in this situation.<p>But most people don&#x27;t really want that. People don&#x27;t like change.

A typical file for a whole human genome is in the 50-100GB range. These files are heavily indexed and streaming-friendly, but still rather unwieldy to work with.<p>Our most common flow involves files stored on S3. The app will download the index, then use sampling and streaming techniques to pull from the full file. This works well because S3 supports range requests.<p>Where S3 falls down for us is sharing. I&#x27;m not aware of any easy way to share S3 files with email. You either have to create a signed URL (which has a max expiration), make the file public, or use IAM, which I&#x27;m pretty sure requires all users to have AWS accounts. That&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>Google Drive is the opposite. It&#x27;s better for sharing. Just drop in an email address, or share a permanent link.
