In my case, I joined because I wanted to become involved in some conversations - now open to me as a potential participant rather than as a clueless but interested observer.

My background is as a production-side journalist (sub-editor, deputy editor etc) who became fascinated by tech when, in 1994, I took an online role in a pioneering news project in the UK. After that, I combined news roles with informing the design of CMSs and other newsroom tools; I have worked with many developers. Now, I am more in project&#x2F;product management of, mainly, media tools.<p>For me, at any rate, HN has shifted from an interesting source of tech news - what are the latest frameworks, what&#x27;s happening with search&#x2F;tracking&#x2F;social technologies - to discussions of how these things impinge on or affect my work and life.

If you do not need those, analyzing the source (with for example beautiful soup) draws less of the server&#x27;s resources and might be much faster.<p>* Keep track of your requests. A specific file might be linked from a dozen pages of the site you crawl. Download it just once. This can be tricky if a site uses A&#x2F;B testing for headlines and changes the URL.<p>* If you provide contact information read your emails. This sounds silly, but at my previous work we had problems with a friendly crawler with known owners. It tried to crawl our sites once a quarter and was blocked each time, because they did not react to our friendly requests to change their crawling rate.<p>Side note: I happen to work on a python library for a polite crawler.

A SMS modem can send SMS in under 5 seconds.  They say 200,000 a day max, so lets say you want to cope with sending 200,000 in 4 hours.<p>That&#x27;s a little under 14 per second, so lets say 15 per second.  You need 75 modems[0] to do that, or about AUD$4,000 worth of modems.  Sorry for the AUD$ - I&#x27;m Australian.  You will also need SIM&#x27;s - or about AUD$1,500 worth.  Don&#x27;t worry about having 75 modems in one spot, the mobile phone network is designed to cope with a stadium of people all sending at the same time.<p>Perhaps you want to shard it for reliability - maybe 5 machines, so add another AUD$5000 for a NUC or similar all with a minimal Debian install + a web server or whatever for whatever delivery mechanism you are going to use to get the SMS&#x27;s to the servers.  That&#x27;s AUD$10.5K total.  Write some glue code - which is a week tops and job done.<p>The one question I&#x27;d be asking is how does that compare to using the cloud.  Third party providers charge around AUD$0.05 per SMS.  They say a minimum of 100,000 SMS&#x27;s per day - or AUD$150K &#x2F; month.  The cost for the non cloud solution is AUD$10.5K for the first month, then $1,500 &#x2F; month after that for the pre-paid SIMS.<p>Downsides: when it breaks (and it will), you will have to diagnose what&#x27;s going on.  That can be hard if the cause is a welding shop starting up next door.  You are also going have to deal with the telco&#x27;s screwing up their SMS infrastructure which seems to happen in Australia every 12 months or so.  But you can fight that to some extent by geographically distributing your NUC&#x27;s and using several different telco&#x27;s servicing each NUC.  That way it becomes more obvious what failed.

That said, the critiques in this piece do not make a lot of sense to me.<p>Take transparency. The claim this article makes is that commercial bounty programs work against transparency by paying researchers only when they agree to NDAs. But transparency isn&#x27;t a norm in software security to begin with; most vulnerability researchers work for labs and consultancies that rarely if ever disclose vulnerabilities. Disclosure of findings is not a norm on commercial software security assessments. Meanwhile, for any target an independent researcher can lawfully assess, the researcher retains the ability to ignore the bounty program and publish straight to Twitter.<p>My sense of it is that HackerOne has probably increased transparency, in the sense that I&#x27;ve read a lot of published reports on H1 that I don&#x27;t expect I would have seen if the platform didn&#x27;t exist, and, in my commercial work, haven&#x27;t seen a lot of private reports that cut the other way.<p>Or this &quot;Safe Harbor&quot; argument, that commercial bounties force researchers to sign NDAs to be immunized from CFAA suits and prosecutions. Sure, but in the absence of H1, most of those CFAA immunizations weren&#x27;t available on any terms. H1 doesn&#x27;t enforce CFAA liability; CFAA liability is a natural default under US law.

But knowing what I know about how bug bounty people work: there is <i>no way<\/i> the median bug bounty &quot;participant&quot; would qualify for minimum wage and benefits at the various companies they interact with. The modal bounty participant has a grab bag of a couple dozen scripts they spam against hundreds of different companies with bounties. Is the claim here that H1 owes them a wage? Is the argument here simply that H1 needs to move out of California?<p>The minimum wage thing doesn&#x27;t ring true either, since it implies that all project-based consulting --- that is, non-T&amp;M consulting where clients pay an agreed-upon rate for an outcome regardless of the time a project takes to complete --- is susceptible to the &quot;ABC&quot; test as well. But project contracts are very common in California. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a subtlety I&#x27;m missing.<p>The &quot;ISO compliance&quot; thing is just silly. By the logic in this article, practically none of the thousands of commercial application pentests performed in 2020 to date will be &quot;ISO compliant&quot;.<p>Ultimately: I think if you have to ask, you shouldn&#x27;t run a bounty program. But that&#x27;s mostly because I think bounty programs don&#x27;t work very well, and generate an avalanche of noise.

Plenty of companies get owned due to pretty trivial vulnerabilities.<p>&gt; Moussouris, now founder and CEO of bug bounty consultancy Luta Security, questions how much of HackerOne is real.<p>Again, could be motivated.<p>&gt; The bug bounty platforms&#x27; NDAs prohibit even mentioning the existence of a private bug bounty. Tweeting something like &quot;Company X has a private bounty program over at Bugcrowd&quot; would be enough to get a hacker kicked off their platform.<p>Sure. How many traditional pentesters are signing NDAs?<p>&gt; Consider a finder who spends weeks or months of unpaid work to discover and document a security flaw. Someone else independently discovers, documents and submits that same bug five minutes before the first finder. Under the rules of most HackerOne and Bugcrowd bounty programs, the first submitter gets all the money, the second finder gets nothing.<p>How are we proposing this alternately works in a way that isn&#x27;t gameable by having control of multiple accounts?<p>&gt; The lack of vetting of bug bounty hunters, where anyone, including this reporter, can sign up for a HackerOne or Bugcrowd account with any email address, is the key sticking point, Antokol says.<p>&gt; Bugcrowd declined to elaborate on what the process of pre-vetting researchers actually looks like. So, this reporter signed up for an account and had immediate access to all public programs without any additional steps.<p>What is really the point of this so-called journalism?  In the preceding paragraphs we were complaining about NDAs stopping people talking about private programs, then complaining about the lack of vetting, then saying we gain access to the PUBLIC programs when we sign up, then saying the bug bounty companies refuse to talk about their vetting methods??? What is this?  I can see why Bugcrowd and Project Zero refused to talk to this person.<p>&gt; Mature organizations can and should run their own VDP in house. If they are ready for an avalanche of dubious bug reports, they might optionally choose to run a bug bounty.<p>I have a feeling that this journalist is pretty in bed with the traditional pen-testing industry. His history of articles is pretty focused.  Bug bounty programs use a customer&#x27;s real money to pay out bugs.  Bugcrowd, at least, triages those bugs before any payment is made.  It is in the interest of nobody involved to submit &quot;dubious&quot; bug bounty reports.

If I want to have a log of what I was interested in, I privately journal about it(Which I am happily using Penzu[1] for).<p>The trick to all personal information management, which recurringly appears in HN threads on the topic, is to focus on your filters, not your collection. You collect hastily, in anger; you are not a professional archivist with respect to your own collection. You will misspell and missort. But it is easy to punch &quot;Save As&quot; and get it in a file somewhere with a few words to search by. And so the filter, the post-hoc, is the greater necessity.<p>Fortunately, when it&#x27;s in the form of files, you can apply a mix of hierarchy, tag and search methods. There&#x27;s software for this. I currently use TagSpaces[0]. I don&#x27;t spend a great deal of effort manually tagging, I just organize a little bit of hierarchy and throw some keywords in the filename.<p>As well, I expect to lose a little bit of the paper trail at times. Precise origins and authorship are not always accessible. Redundancies may occur.  The point of the curation is to make a useful product for yourself, one that accommodates many informational needs - to collect ideas, create a course of study, or put yourself in a particular mindspace. You have many years to keep developing it.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tagspaces.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tagspaces.org&#x2F;<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;penzu.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;penzu.com&#x2F;<\/a> (Why this and not plaintext?

As such, I got used to work with Zotero [1], first as a simple reference manager, but over time as a more robust platform to keep track &quot;of things like bookmarks, snippets of code or text&quot;, and even associated files.<p>The why: Zotero is open source, respects privacy, and it allows you to keep a local repository of your things, disconnected from its cloud. And yeah, it also offers you a cloud storage solution if you need it. Plus, I love how it ingrates so seamlessly with my browsing experience.<p>The how: Zotero works like a three stage tool.<p>The first stage concerns its browser connector, the plugin that lets you store the references you want to keep. You can think of bookmarks as references too.<p>The second stage corresponds to the when the work within Zotero itself. Here is where you add your notes, snippets, crosslimks, tags, etc. Since it&#x27;s your references database, you should invest some time to find a good workflow as to find in the future whatever you need in as little steps possible. It&#x27;s worth the effort to get used to Zotero&#x27;s possibilities (you can even manipulate its database directly through sql commands if you&#x27;re into it).<p>The third stage is the integration tool that works with your text processor. This step mostly applies to writers only, the folks who really need to keep close attention between what they say and where they took it from. This is where Zotero shines, for it allows you to keep a close tie between the things you actually quote on your text and the works&#x2F;data you reference in its appropriate section.<p>In any case, what starts as a simple reference manager can, with some imagination, become a very elegant solution to gather bookmarks, notes, snippets, etc in just one place.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-05 09:17:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["haasted"],"id":[22780297],"kids":[22787450],"parent":[22778123],"text":["I use <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinboard.in\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinboard.in<\/a> for bookmarks.

The major difference of the platform is that you take notes in the form of &quot;cards&quot; rather than documents, which makes everything a bit more portable and easy to share &#x2F; structure.<p>Flexibility is provided by having three different ways to structure your notes:<p>- graph hierarchy: cards nest inside of each other instead of using any kind of &quot;folder&quot; system, and children can have multiple parents.<p>- hyperlinked graph (notes are markdown, and you can easily make links to other notes in the body of your notes)<p>- flat structure using tags<p>Of course, you can mix-and-match those systems as much as you want.<p>And then sharing (which is still quite nascent at the moment, but kinda works) is somewhat complex given the level of control we wanted to give users over how they share, but the gist is – you can share any card with anyone, or &quot;publish&quot; a card under a parent that you share with someone else, and they will automatically be given access to that card.<p>I&#x27;d really love to hear any feedback people from the HN community have.

This has downsides, in particular it&#x27;s only ok on mobile and lacks integrations. But I find the upside is more important: You can build your own features with shell scripts (that can then be integrated into your editing environment), and you can use your notes in many different applications. E.g., you can use a file manager like the Finder to organize your notes, and you can use tools like grep and diff to search and compare them. You can edit them with multiple text editors, for somethings vim is better for others I like iA Writer.<p>Over time I’ve built a ton of my own features into the system, for example I&#x27;ve built my own documentation system.

I.e., these scriptable text editors become a custom note taking environment built to my requirements. Since most things are written in bash, it’s easy to use any text editor on top. All you need to do is call the shell scripts from the editor and a light layer of text-editor specific GUI details on top.)<p>All of this stuff emerged organically over time based on my needs and the growing complexity of managing more and more information and more complicated tasks. The problem all single app solutions run into is they just don&#x27;t scale and grow with you.<p>To solve the mobile issue, my process is very simple: I use OmniFocus which allows me to instantly save a URL, text note, or anything else to my inbox, and then I just process (categorize and save) the new notes each morning before I start working. If I really need a note on my phone, Spotlight works surprisingly well for looking up a note by name in iCloud Drive (just turn off Spotlight for every app you don&#x27;t want to search), and I can use Working Copy for notes in git, finally if I have to, I can ssh to a remote server with Blink Shell and use shell tools from iOS (for any note that&#x27;s in git, those are also on the server).<p>The specifics of my system aren’t important, what I like is having a system that grows with me, and that I can customize to my needs."],"time":["2020-04-04 20:08:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mkbkn"],"id":[22791540],"kids":{},"parent":[22778123],"text":["I use Zim Wiki and Joplin.

And I&#x27;m really happy with how it works. I use Google Docs, but Word or whatever would work too.<p>One of the key things is I <i>don&#x27;t<\/i> try to create some kind of central repository of every link I care about. In fact, I explicitly avoid this. (So I don&#x27;t have a huge document with all my links. Nor do I have or want any kind of single, comprehensive database of all my links.)<p>If I&#x27;m dealing with a particular topic, I want those links together in one place. Eventually when I move on and forget about that topic, the links are pretty irrelevant, and since they are organized together in that document, there&#x27;s basically O(1) cleanup to get that clutter out of my life: just stop looking at that one document.<p>Usually how a new document forms is that I&#x27;m working on or researching some topic, and I start getting that feeling that I have a lot of browser tabs that I don&#x27;t want to lose. At that point, I create a new document, the title is whatever topic I&#x27;m working on, I create some headings to categorize things by type, and then in outline format I add links along with a very brief word or two about what is useful about that link.<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking that copy&#x2F;pasting links and typing stuff is a lot of overhead compared to just hitting a hotkey to bookmark something. It is more work, but it&#x27;s easily worth it. Every time I make one of these documents, I&#x27;m glad I did because it becomes a lot easier to find stuff and remember which stuff is important. Sometimes the process of organizing it into categories even helps me understand the topic better. Sort of an exercise in getting everything in one place and seeing the 30,000 foot view.<p>So for example, my most recent one is called &quot;COVID-19 resources&quot;. The top-level headings are &quot;Practical Advice&quot; (info on DIY masks, links to charts of symptoms compared to flu and allergies, a video on hand washing technique), &quot;News and Info&quot; (the John Hopkins map, other maps, graphs and charts, links to online discussion forums, CDC and WHO articles, wikipedia articles), and &quot;Local Info&quot; (state and local government status and announcement, health department twitter account, local guide to restaurants with takeout), and &quot;Volunteer Info&quot; (opportunities to help).<p>Come to think of it, I really need to add a section called &quot;Science and Research&quot;. I&#x27;ve run across several interesting papers and articles about the disease, and I keep digging to re-find these links when I want to refer to it again. They belong in this document.<p>Anyway, hopefully at some point COVID-19 won&#x27;t be front of mind for all of us, and I will stop opening this document every day to check the latest stats.

If you use “5.”, it’ll give you a five. If you want auto-numbering, use “#.” as your prefix. (While I’m thinking of it: I hate that using actual Unicode bullets like “•” doesn’t work in Markdown, and that in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.commonmark.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;unicode-character-bullet-u-2022&#x2F;397\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.commonmark.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;unicode-character-bullet-u-202...<\/a> it’s been actively rejected for CommonMark.)<p>2. Code blocks are by indentation only, no fencing, but avoids confusion about indentation levels by defining all of that stuff <i>properly<\/i> and having it match visual usage, rather than Markdown’s crazy “four spaces, but in certain situations we’ll let you get by with 3, 2, 1 or even 0—but if you then seek to nest, remember to bump it up to eight rather than just N+4”. Code blocks are indicated by `::` at the end of or as the entire previous paragraph, which is esoteric, but also fits in very well with its directive syntax, which is how you can attach extra metadata to code blocks. It’s definitely not as simple as the newer Markdown fencing approach, though it fits into the rest of reStructuredText in a sane and principled way so that it’s not at all hard. Still, I think that a new version of reStructuredText would quite possibly include fencing in some form—or maybe directives would be resyntaxed to be able to be fenced rather than indented, though achieving that while still allowing nesting would take care.<p>3. Markdown in HTML in Markdown? That Markdown extends HTML is the real problem here, and is both its greatest strength and help in adoption, and its <i>catastrophic<\/i> weakness. reStructuredText is a language of its own that doesn’t extend anything, so that style of HTML output is typically done by defining new directives, which can then contain reStructuredText. It’s strictly less powerful, but it composes <i>way<\/i> better. As a workaround, the `raw` directive lets you put in arbitrary HTML (or LaTeX, &amp;c.).<p>4. By deliberately not being HTML, reStructuredText handles this sort of thing much better. Each node in the document can have classes (which will end up as class=&quot;…&quot; in HTML, something else in LaTeX, &amp;c.). You can do things like `.. class:: …` to apply a class to the next block (heading, paragraph, list, &amp;c.). Most directives support a :class: option. You can define new roles so that :classname:`…` will do what you desire. And none of this is then tied to HTML.<p>5. reStructuredText lets you define anchors at any place in the document (which can also be used for index entries when writing books or things like that). `.. _anchor-name:` above the heading will do it thus. This protects you against the anchor changing (and thus breaking links) if you change the text of the heading. Any form of automatic heading ID generation is left to the software to decide, e.g. Sphinx generates IDs by default.<p>6. Field lists. A field list at the start of the document is treated as document bibliographic data, and you can put anything in there you like.<p>I myself prefer reStructuredText in almost all regards, but I scarcely use it any more other than for a couple of types of personal documents, because of the ubiquity of Markdown.

For example, your complaint about indentation for code blocks makes no sense if you&#x27;re using Markdown appropriately.<p>The original idea was to take emergent syntax used by text file authors as cues for humans reading text files, and use that as a syntax for generating HTML, so you could use text files as the source of truth for generating HTML.<p>Backticks aren&#x27;t an emergent syntax used by text file authors as cues for humans reading text files--that&#x27;s a syntax directly intended for generating code blocks in HTML, with little semantic value if the markdown is going to be consumed as text.<p>If your goal is to have something consumable as both text and HTML, then some sacrifices have to be made, because text simply can&#x27;t do everything that HTML can. The error-prone indentation syntax is just a compromise, but there were features that were left out completely. The original markdown didn&#x27;t contain underline or strikethrough, for example, because text can&#x27;t do those things.<p>The problem is that for a few years, this idea turned out to be useful as a way of allowing users rich text editing capability on websites. So people wanted Markdown to do everything that HTML could do, hence we get underline, strikethrough, code fences, etc. This hurts use cases where markdown is used for its original purpose, because modern markdown isn&#x27;t as nicely consumable as text files, but users didn&#x27;t care because they weren&#x27;t using Markdown to be consumable as text files. And this made sense for a while.<p>And where this becomes stupid is that if you don&#x27;t care about it looking nice as text, then you shouldn&#x27;t be using Markdown. There are a wealth tools for rich text editing on the web (TinyMCE being the most obvious choice, but not the only one available) and they&#x27;re FAR superior in user-friendliness to Markdown. Many actually support Markdown, but there&#x27;s less and less reason to even expose that functionality to your users. If you don&#x27;t care about how your Markdown looks as text, then just use HTML and edit it with a rich text editor.<p>There&#x27;s another use case where you want to compose HTML content without the overhead of actually writing HTML, but you want to &quot;do it like a coder&quot;, so using a rich text editor isn&#x27;t appropriate because you want to be able to diff and whatnot. But in that case, there&#x27;s <i>still<\/i> no reason to be using markdown, because if you&#x27;re &quot;doing it like a coder&quot; than you can <i>just write code<\/i> which makes what you&#x27;re doing much clearer, and give you a lot more power. Textile, Org-Mode, LaTeX are all better options.<p>GitHub has persisted in using Markdown well past the advent of mature web text editors, because they still seem to be operating under the illusion that nontechnical users will become a significant part of their user base. Slack and Reddit are both moving toward fully rich text, and the fact that they are still trying to expose their Markdown roots just makes their rich text painful to use. MediaWiki using their markup language still, probably because they are blocked by the enormously difficult task of migrating an <i>enormous<\/i> amount of content, but if you&#x27;re starting a new project, you don&#x27;t have any of the tradeoffs that these organizations do, so you shouldn&#x27;t make the mistake of following in their footsteps."],"time":["2020-04-04 18:14:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RMPR"],"id":[22779976],"kids":{},"parent":[22776108],"text":["Typo<p>&gt; differnt types of content."],"time":["2020-04-04 19:46:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimmaswell"],"id":[22776427],"kids":[22776663,22779955,22776621],"parent":[22776108],"text":["What was even the motivation in the first place to not respect newlines?"],"time":["2020-04-04 07:40:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jakear"],"id":[22776323],"kids":[22776385,22776394,22779054],"parent":[22776108],"text":["Hot take (maybe): GitHub flavored markdown is the ideal markup language.

With Tresspasser, if they had gone with the initial vision of it being a survival-horror dinosaur game, but they had designed it more like a contemporary like say Half-Life, it&#x27;s an idea that totally could have worked. Remember how scripted Half-Life was, especially some of those early levels that were almost like standing in a movie? (A new experience back then). I could totally imagine a dinosaur game working with that kind of model and tech. You can imagine showing a JP-style scene where the dinosaurs do something very clever in a controlled environment, and maybe having player&#x27;s project more into the AI based on that; which would have been a much better investment than a state machine they ended up just having to mostly disable. (I remember people were very complementary of Half Life&#x27;s AI, but I think it really boiled down to clever level design more than anything). The problem was that while the physics were really interesting, there just wasn&#x27;t enough there to actually build a game on, and a lot of things that were interesting were awful gameplay wise (the weird floppy arm for instance).<p>I do have a lot of nostalgia for it though.

Read page 33 of Weiner&#x27;s Cybernetics. The real insight, where in what I will now explain in brevity is at the expense of the insight&#x27;s resolution, is that in the nature of microscopic phenomena there are an exorbitant quantity of fickle components (&quot;equal particles&quot;) whose positions, accelerations, velocities are all impossible to record because of that sheer quantity by the nature of this sphere of study. More so, there are then at least second-order coupling effects between all these fickle components due to their constant interaction. As a resolve, we have developed terms of statistical understanding. Weiner cites &quot;cloud, temperature, turbulence, etc.&quot; all being concepts which are specifically defined in a statistical context.<p>Where as in the macroscopic sphere there are far fewer particles much further apart from each other with near certain initial masses, positions, and velocities.<p>The result? In the microscopic systems, because their properties are precisely defined statistically the distribution which predicts the future nor past for a given system isn&#x27;t unique. That is, the future state (predicted by the distribution provided by some initial system) could have also been predicted by other distributions describing many other initial systems unless by &quot;some miracle&quot; there is a &quot;tightly defined statistical range&quot;.<p>So are microscopic physics condemned to this paradox? Not necessarily, there may be some way to construct scientific objects from systems phenomena which don&#x27;t require a statistical conception because they can be precisely defined from a microscopic systems point of view temporally &amp; spatially.

That story, however, is not exactly true. Ralph Anspach, an economist and refugee of Hitler’s Danzig, unearthed the real story and it traces back to Abraham Lincoln, the Quakers, and to a forgotten feminist named Lizzie Magie. The Monopolists is in part Anspach’s David-versus-Goliath tale of his 1970s battle against Parker Brothers, one of the most beloved companies of all time. Anspach was a professor fighting to sell his Anti-Monopoly board game, which hailed those who busted up trusts and monopolies instead of those who took control of all the properties. While he and his lawyers researched previous Parker Brothers lawsuits, he accidentally discovered the true history of the game, which began with Magie’s Landlord’s Game. That game was invented more than thirty years before Parker Brothers sold their version of Monopoly and she waged her own war with Parker Brothers to be credited as the real originator of the game. Ironically, the Landlord’s Game, like Anti-Monopoly, was underpinned by morals that were the exact opposite of what Monopoly represents today. It isn&#x27;t surprising that Magie&#x27;s game was embraced by a constellation of left-wingers from the Progressive Era through the Great Depression, including members of Franklin Roosevelt’s famed Brain Trust....<\/i>"],"time":["2020-04-04 07:23:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jonp"],"id":[22777497],"kids":{},"parent":[22776130],"text":["Here&#x27;s a collection of the shortest finish in many games: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.stetson.edu&#x2F;~efriedma&#x2F;mathmagic&#x2F;1112.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.stetson.edu&#x2F;~efriedma&#x2F;mathmagic&#x2F;1112.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-04 12:48:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dr_dshiv"],"id":[22778026],"kids":{},"parent":[22776130],"text":["May I point out that &quot;fortnite monopoly&quot; is actually a delight to play -- it&#x27;s not just a surface redesign, but actually a far better game than monopoly."],"time":["2020-04-04 15:09:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RickJWagner"],"id":[22778301],"kids":{},"parent":[22776130],"text":["Monopoly is fast, compared to RISK."],"time":["2020-04-04 16:10:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["malkia"],"id":[22776287],"kids":{},"parent":[22776130],"text":["Love Monopoly still!"],"time":["2020-04-04 06:56:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dangus"],"id":[22776280],"kids":[22777048],"parent":[22776130],"text":["This is a really tired subject on the Internet by now."],"time":["2020-04-04 06:55:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tptacek"],"id":[22779712],"kids":[22779800,22779806,22779808,22780507,22779747],"parent":[22776658],"text":["Short answer: like Zoom, multiparty Jitsi meetings are encrypted point-to-point, not end-to-end, and Jitsi can monitor and record your multiparty meetings."],"time":["2020-04-04 19:18:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["twic"],"id":[22780315],"kids":[22781768,22780762],"parent":[22776658],"text":["Are there any cryptographic and&#x2F;or network designs which allow end-to-end encryption of a group video chat without full meshing?"],"time":["2020-04-04 20:28:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Clamydo"],"id":[22788625],"kids":{},"parent":[22776658],"text":["Wouldn&#x27;t IP multicast (if it were routed by ISPs) be a perfect fit for a scalable p2p video conference solution?
