I assume transferring the object into JS land would kill all the speed gains?<p>I wrote my own JSON parser just last week, to see if I could improve the NodeJS situation.

There are (were?) still enough people in the world willing to buy high quality software at that price point to sustain the company.<p>I think the other point missed is that, unlike what I feel like a lot of SV memes portray, Omni was designed to be an infinite game, &quot;A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play&quot;[1].

It probably cost them a hell of a lot, but to them it was the right thing to do and they take care of their employees (even though they had just hired us).

If a handler returns normally, then next ones are executed; if all matching handlers are exhausted, `SIGNAL` returns, and code execution continues.<p><pre><code>    CL-USER&gt; (handler-bind ((condition (lambda (c) (format t &quot;;; Foo: ~A~%&quot; c)))\n                            (condition (lambda (c) (format t &quot;;; Bar: ~A~%&quot; c)))\n                            (condition (lambda (c) (format t &quot;;; Baz: ~A~%&quot; c))))\n               (signal &#x27;condition)\n               42)\n    ;; Foo: Condition CONDITION was signalled.\n    ;; Bar: Condition CONDITION was signalled.\n    ;; Baz: Condition CONDITION was signalled.\n    42\n<\/code><\/pre>\nOf course, a handler can perform a non-local transfer of control elsewhere, e.g. by using `GO` or `THROW`. In such a case, control is transferred out of `SIGNAL`, so next handlers are - naturally - not invoked.<p>While I understand that this post is trying to appeal to language newcomers, simplifying the whole condition system to an &quot;error try-catch&quot; is a drastic misrepresentation of the condition system that will leave the newbies with the impression that that&#x27;s all that is possible with that feature. Since it seems that the author is a Lisp newcomer as well (which I wholeheartedly admire! :), I&#x27;d advise him to use the original notation of &quot;condition&quot;, instead for the one of &quot;error&quot;."],"time":["2020-04-01 17:20:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aidenn0"],"id":[22748642],"kids":[22749295,22749148,22750851,22753820],"parent":[22747932],"text":["Aside from restarts, the core difference between the Common Lisp condition system and exceptions in most other languages is that the exception handler can run before the stack is unwound.<p>Having the call-stack available at the time the handler runs can be very useful; many modern dynamic languages will save some of that information in the exception object.

Even React’s syntax really isn’t that different from a template as you need to enclose JS expressions in curly braces right?<p>My favorite HTML server language is Elixir which has a Ruby flavored template engine called using `&lt;%= some_func(@val) %&gt;`. It’s only 4 “tags” [1]. Well maybe since it’s a functional language and everything is an expression the semantics are simpler, mainly limited to whether or not to return a value. Jinja probably is more difficult since Python control flow isn&#x27;t an expression so you add another layer (probably same in Ruby, Java, etc). Calling functions is as easy as ensuring they’re in the scope of where it’s loaded (or just the current scope when using the ~E sigil. So in the first example encapsulating a sub-lists is just creating a function that returns a template. When compiled it’ll create functions that return IO lists so it’s pretty efficient too [2].<p>Given that, I prefer having HTML look like HTML.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;eex&#x2F;EEx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;eex&#x2F;EEx.html<\/a> \n2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edmz.org&#x2F;personal&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;06&#x2F;phoenix_templates-_yup,_they_are_just_functions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edmz.org&#x2F;personal&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;06&#x2F;phoenix_templates-_yup,...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-01 07:50:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["didibus"],"id":[22751001],"kids":[22752074,22757453],"parent":[22745503],"text":["Can someone explain the difference between an S-expression and an X-expression?

For engineers, this is rather straightforward. We&#x27;ll basically just ask what their desired hourly or day rate is, and we&#x27;ll put them on a modular project for them to work on.

If a company isn&#x27;t willing to hire full time I think one of the following: 1. You don&#x27;t have enough funding to do this right. 2. You don&#x27;t know how to properly interview people. or 3. You think this is being generous but in reality don&#x27;t fully understand the implications.<p>Remote work is about trust.

A friend of mine who runs his own business rents a small office (these can be inexpensive).

It mainly depends on the organization you work for.  If the work is physical, then working remotely is obviously an impediment.  If your organization is focused on creating non-physical things without much need for physical proximity to other coworkers, then remote work is ideal.<p>There are just as many distractions involved with a physical work place, if not more (excluding things like watching your kids) than there are at home.  Myself, personally, a large part of my day in the office involves walking to the restroom, waiting for the elevator, walking to meeting rooms (up to 4-5 different spaces, some on different floors), walking to the break room (lunch, coffee, etc), being polite and diplomatic by engaging in very casual office conversations whenever one starts, handling very low priority interruptions by coworkers, and not the least of which is preparing for, and performing a commute, of which I am not paid for.  Pile on a few unnecessary meetings that could easily be e-mails and you&#x27;ve just lowered my productivity considerably.<p>So in my experience, the effort involved with physical presence around others is real and takes up a considerable amount of time.  I&#x27;m not saying these activities are useless, face time is important, and it&#x27;s great to be social with your coworkers, and is invaluable for improving your team skills, but am I working on a deliverable during these activities?<p>At home, I can use the restroom, prepare lunch while watching a long-running program run on my laptop, read and send an e-mail, all in the space of 10 or 15 minutes.  Consider doing the same tasks at your office.  Would they take more or less time than at home?<p>Also noteworthy is the idea that remote work forces a person to collaborate through written word, which is not always necessary when you&#x27;re physically present.  Writing down your ideas has the side effect of compacting your ideas into their essential components.

My partner wasn&#x27;t comfortable with me saying this stuff in a public way. They work in the emergency department of a hospital in North America.<p>It&#x27;s not just that they&#x27;ll be fired if they speak out...<p>The hospitals are also threatening to withhold worker&#x27;s compensation payouts if a staff member is caught using anything brought from home, even if it&#x27;s real, name brand equipment. Got some N95s leftover from that home improvement project? Leave them at home and use this surgical mask instead (still better than nothing, to be fair). They are asking staff members to inform on other staff. To be clear: these policies were in effect for an area with coughing COVID patients. They do put surgical masks on the patients, which is very helpful, but I&#x27;m livid that they then ask the nurses to NOT use N95s in this scenario.<p>They are also undertaking dubious re-use and cleaning procedures that are not scientifically proven. For example, masks (both surgical and N95s, which are only for workers doing things like intubation) are being used for an entire day (also not correct usage) and then placed in paper folders for a week. At the end of the week, the masks are deemed &#x27;clean&#x27; and reused by the same staff member. Kind of like a mask for each day of the week. There is not strong scientific evidence this is an effective or safe procedure. These procedures might work, but there isn&#x27;t testing proving that fact.<p>I understand hospitals are in a bind here. There are simply not enough masks available (both surgical and N95) in the world. If the hospitals admit their ad-hoc procedures are ineffective they risk short term mutiny in their staff ranks. They also risk long term litigation by admitting they can&#x27;t protect staff. Unfortunately their approach of &#x27;clamp down hard on dissent&#x27; is preventing the real message from being broadcast loudly enough: It should be blindingly clear we need a crash program to ramp domestic PPE manufacturing by an order of magnitude (or two).<p>As an aside, please call your senators and representatives and ask them to force the Trump administration to use the DPA to bring more PPE capacity online.

Your income suddenly balloons and you have a choice.<p>Some people will expand their living standards to match their increased income. Others won&#x27;t and will simply reap the extra rewards later. Some will know that winter is coming. Others just will know what they need and are not controlled by unconstrained wants.<p>Whenever the boom inevitable ends the first group is always the group that&#x27;s in trouble.<p>In the 2000s in Australia was a massive construction boom. Tradesmen made huge money. Some bought expensive cars and houses and holidays. Post-GFC those days were over. Suddenly living on the big country estate was a problem because the $300&#x2F;week you were spending on petrol was suddenly an issue.<p>Bringing this back to oil, on the one hand we have Norway who used their resource riches to create a sovereign wealth fund that last I heard was around $1T. On the other you have Venezuela, Russia and Saudi Arabia, where huge profits were pocketed by oligarchs, monarchs and kleptocrats.<p>At the same time, they needed the oil revenue to placate their people. Breakeven was once $10&#x2F;barrel, then $20, then $30, then $50. Higher prices of course encouraged companies to invest in more expensive oil fields where the cost of extraction might well be $60+&#x2F;barrel.<p>Saudi Arabia once tried to manipulate the market to wipe out the frackers (as the US became a huge net oil exporter). That was never going to work. They&#x27;d simply re-emerge when prices inevitable returned.<p>But now in a market where demand has fallen off a cliff, Saudi Arabia need to sell oil, pretty much at any price, to <i>survive<\/i>. A protracted price war does not bode well for either country but that&#x27;s the predicament they&#x27;re in.<p>This is another example of the delusion some people are in regarding this pandemic. When it&#x27;s under control (or, more likely, run its course killing potentially millions), the world won&#x27;t suddenly go back to the way it was. Capacity might be there but demand will take a long time to recover. You&#x27;ll see this through the travel industry (particular cruises) and, with things like this, the oil and gas industry too.
