And depending where you die, maybe you would be counted as a COVID-19 death, and maybe not.

So I recommend you follow these guidelines:<p>* Build your software as if it is a house where you can add more rooms as it grows. Ensure that software architecture is modular, each module should be capable of working independently from each other. You will further atomise modules through classes. So basically composition goes like this: Software -&gt; Module -&gt; Classes -&gt; Methods.\nYou absolutely need to get modules right. Mistakes made at class level can be easily corrected but it is harder to separate module level entanglement.<p>* Variable&#x2F;function names should be self explanatory.  Don’t name them too short or too long, they shouldn’t confuse&#x2F;waste the time of other people working on the project.<p>* Code clarity is extremely important. Don’t write hard to understand code unless it is an absolute necessity. Premature optimisation is bad but you can do premature optimisation so long as it doesn’t affect code clarity. Otherwise leave optimising code to last stage.<p>* DevOp tools like docker incredibly increase the production speeds and overall software quality. So try to keep up with these but don’t go 100% on them as they might also increase the complexity. Gradually add devops tools to your project as it grows. You probably don’t need to implement every single DevOps tools.

There&#x27;s no substitute for bash, especially in robotics when you&#x27;re working with embedded Linux systems all the time. You&#x27;ll quickly pick up commands you like, and from that scripting things will really help build some experience and give you a good &quot;sandbox&quot; to play in.<p>2) Most robotics systems end up either being <i>immensely<\/i> complex, or simpler than you think. Most of the complex systems aren&#x27;t the same ones used in the rest of the world, since with the exception of self-driving cars and now the NVIDIA Jetson computers, you don&#x27;t have enough compute to run the complicated stuff. Raw C++ code will probably run fast enough. As a result, a lot of the stuff-you-use-for-web-apps-that-you-might-have-to-scale-to-millions-of-people won&#x27;t come into play. Instead, doing things like setting static IP addresses or debugging a serial port connection pop up a lot more.<p>3) Software has a nasty habit of getting complicated sooner than you&#x27;d like. As others have mentioned, testing is really, really important. Whatever your preferred language is, I&#x27;d suggest you spend a lot of time figuring out your preference for how to easily and repeatedly ask &quot;does this do what I think it does&quot;. Unit tests help a lot, as do. Without trying to shove it down your throat, this is one of the reasons why I do a lot of coding in Rust--the package manager and its unit test tooling is all built in and makes checking my assumptions much easier.<p>4) Probably avoid a bunch of posts written on either LinkedIn, and to a lesser degree, Medium. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen it in other areas, but coding in particular seems really prone to have pieces written by people whose main goal is to show that they did something, not teach other people how or explain the nitty-gritty you&#x27;ll need. On the other hand, some people&#x27;s personal blogs are <i>gold<\/i>, and I suggest you figure out a way of saving good content in a way that lets you find it again.<p>5) And finally, try to find some places where you&#x27;ll feel comfortable asking questions. Some languages or frameworks have forums, other have sub-reddits, others still have Discord&#x2F;Zulip&#x2F;etc. chats.

A few ideas:<p>~ Pair programming with an experienced programmer, if possible. If not, try to work on a project (even an open source one) with someone who is an experienced software developer and who does comprehensive code reviews. Code reviews from articulate, experienced developers are an excellent way to learn.<p>~ Write lots of code. Write code in new areas unrelated to your job. Try to find some small project or projects to do. Once you&#x27;re done, reflect on what you&#x27;ve done and what you could do better next time.<p>~ Read books like Clean Code. It might also be wise to pick up a book on design patterns, particularly if you&#x27;ll be working much in object-oriented languages like Java, C#, or C++.<p>~ Always read source code when possible. Using a new tool at work? If it&#x27;s open source, go check out the code. Starting a new project? Go find similar projects on Github and browse the code. You could also find some well-known open source projects and read through their code. A good book for ideas on which open source projects to focus on is called The Architecure of Open Source Projects (there are two volumes, shown at the bottom of this page: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aosabook.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aosabook.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.html<\/a>)<p>~ Learn other programming paradigms, such as functional programming (maybe learn Haskell, or Scheme) or logic programming (learn Prolog). You may never use such languages in your work, but languages in other paradigms will provide you with both a better understanding of computation, and a bag full of useful techniques and ideas for your working language(s).<p>The next component is how to improve your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and other topics rooted in theoretical computer science.<p>~ Consider doing problems from sites like leetcode.com and hackerrank.com.<p>~ The book _Algorithms_ by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne is very good, as is their free two-part course algorithms and data structures offered on Coursera (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;algorithms-part1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;algorithms-part1<\/a>).<p>~ Work all the way through the online book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;sicp&#x2F;full-text&#x2F;book&#x2F;book.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;sicp&#x2F;full-text&#x2F;...<\/a>). It will not only touch on a number of important theoretical computer science topics, but you&#x27;ll \nalso get some good exposure to functional programming.<p>Finally, to learn commonly used technologies you see on HN, such as Docker or Kubernetes, you&#x27;ll just need to get your hands dirty:<p>~ Rent a $5 server on Digital Ocean, or set up a home server, running a Linux distro like Debian or Ubuntu (which often makes installation easier), and start experimenting with them.<p>~ Continue following HN and reading about new technologies and programming languages.<p>~ Realize that it&#x27;s critical for software developers to constantly learn new technologies. Otherwise, they very often become unemployable after a decade or two. HOWEVER, it&#x27;s also critical that devs exercise restraint and good judgment when selecting technologies for important projects. For such projects, it&#x27;s usually better to choose languages and technologies that have a proven record and that you personally have a good understanding of, over some new technology that&#x27;s getting a lot of attention on HN.<p>With respect to all three of these components, it&#x27;s a very good idea to maintain a blog and write about your experiences and projects. A blog will serve to not only consolidate your new knowledge, but also to improve your writing and help your career (a good technical blog will be a strong positive signal toward potential employers).<p>Don&#x27;t worry about not having a traditional education in computer science. Lots of excellent senior devs I&#x27;ve worked with have no formal training in computer science. As long as you&#x27;re motivated to constantly learn new languages, technologies, and techniques, and master the ones you already know, then few people will care (or even know) whether or not you have a CS degree."],"time":["2020-09-22 16:49:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m3kw9"],"id":[24557215],"kids":{},"parent":[24551229],"text":["“Better” depends on who and what you work for.

They solve specific problems that teams encounter in one part of the software industry. Engineers writing device drivers at Apple will have a different set of tools, practices and coding standards for example - if they optimize for running tests in the factory and reducing the drain on the battery, it will be a different set of complications that will create the gap between textbook code and what’s deployed. Apple’s production quality code will look extremely different from Facebook’s because the complexities are different.<p>There is a small part of the gap between textbook and real world code that is not caused by domain specific nuances. It’s pretty easy to pick up those skills:<p>1. Use a code formatter like clang-format and&#x2F;or a linter. Pick a coding style and stay consistent with it.<p>2. Write code to communicate intent. Name your variables and your methods so that the resulting code reads as close to prose as possible.  Write your code in a way that someone you’ve never spoken to can easily figure out what’s going on and modify your code.<p>3. Design your APIs first. Think long and hard about your API, how it will be used, how it can be tested against, how it can be extended in the future. Read “The design of every day things” by Don Norman and pick up on what is good design.<p>4. Related to 3, design your API (and implement) them in a way that’ll allow as much of your code to be unit tested as possible. Have an algorithm that will run when your robot hits a wall? Pull your algorithm into a separate file, with its own API in such a way that you can compile that algorithm into a second “test” program that’ll feed it some inputs and check if it produced the expected output. Use a code coverage tool (google gcov) to see how much of your code is covered by unit tests. Aim for 98% or higher. The “should I move these lines of code to a new function” is then easily answered with “will a new function (in maybe a new file) help me increase my code coverage in unit tests?”<p>5. Write your code so that tiny errors blow up into catastrophic failures as quickly and as loudly as possible. Add error messages everywhere. Add asserts and static_assets everywhere. You are going to spend a lot of time tweaking and testing your code - if any change triggers a failure anywhere else - you want it to fail with a really really loud bang so that you are more likely to notice (and debug) it.<p>6. Avoid creating skews&#x2F;variants in your code. don’t have a debug version and a release version - write code that you can test, deploy code that you have tested (exactly the same code, with no changes)<p>This will get you over that gap between text books and real world.

The fact that a significant portion of HN is engaged in modern web backend development doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only significant area of engineering.<p>&gt; So, how do I write better code?<p>Short answer: be lazy and hate work.<p>Fixing bugs is work. Instead of just fixing it, find out how you could&#x27;ve used the type system or API design to prevent yourself from making this bug in the first place. Fixing this bug is work. Preventing yourself from making the bug in the first place is saving yourself of doing the work.<p>Rewriting your old code when you get new requirements is work — learn how to build an app architecture that would make this amount of work minimal.<p>Writing code is work. Maintaining code is work. If you manage to complete your tasks using less code, you&#x27;ll have less work.<p>Manual testing is work. Writing unit tests is saving your time. Learning how to write tests so you won&#x27;t have to rewrite them when your requirements change reduces the amount of work you have to do even more. And leveraging the type system to maintain some invariants about your code saves you even more work.<p>Communicating with your colleagues and answering their questions is work. So, learn how to write code that is easy to understand. Writing comments is work too, so if you manage to write a code that is so clear that it doesn&#x27;t need comments, you&#x27;ll save yourself from even more work. Writing great documentation will save you time on work chats.<p>Of course a big difference between being lazy and being irresponsible.

Think of it as a way to package and deliver value without the fuss.<p>How to write better code:<p>- Read good code: clone repositories of proven software that you use, and read from it from time to time.<p>- Curiosity: when you use software, you may encounter functionality and wonder about it. If you have the code for that software, you can look how it was implemented and architected. Doing a git blame and finding the first commit where something was introduced is educational. You can then advance commit by commit to see how it played out.<p>- Vocabulary: sometimes you don&#x27;t know something and you can&#x27;t even look it up because you don&#x27;t know the word for it. For example, there are concepts like &#x27;message passing&#x27; or &#x27;multiple dispatch&#x27; that I have pondered on for quite some time before knowing what they were called. I was trying to formulate a search query to find what that way of coding was. The same thing happened to me when I wanted to learn how to think better and improve my cognition. I had tormented myself thinking &#x27;is there a field from which I can learn to think about my own thinking. Cognition on my cognition&#x27;. I felt stupid when I stumbled upon it and found it was simply called &#x27;metacognition&#x27;. Sometimes I was luckier. For instance, after observing how some software can add new functionality from pieces created by third parties, I knew I wanted to learn how to do that. When I was a child, I found it really cool that you could make a Winamp skin, and Winamp would transform to that skin even though the Winamp folks ignore everything about your existence. They didn&#x27;t need to integrate your skin. I found that to be really powerful. I had the docs for win32api, and found it amazing I could use it to access system functionality, etc. When I wanted to transform a Doc to PDF, I installed an extension and Microsoft Word knew where to display it and what to do with it. Same with applications. The underlying themes are APIs, extensibility. The materializations are plugins, extensions and applications. The supporting principles are good abstractions, and open&#x2F;closed principle, dynamic loading, and interfaces.<p>It helps to structure the thought into &#x27;themes&#x27;. Extensibility theme, for example. And then categories, like a plugin architecture. Keep those and link new things you learn to those themes. These compound and find their way in your new software.<p>- Write the documentation or the use guide first. A description of how your <i>yet<\/i> to exist software is used. You write &#x27;X does this, here is how you use it&#x27;. If everything were possible, what would the usage be ? How would a user interact with it. Write it, then code the simplest version that does the job.<p>- Don&#x27;t be unproductively hard on yourself. Pick any amazingly successful software and do a &#x27;git log --reverse&#x27; to see the first commits on top.

It&#x27;s the process by which the PWA specs were designed in the first place.<p>There are more than a handful of cases across the past decade where a new &quot;web standard&quot; didn&#x27;t emerge through the usual standardization process — proposal, discussion, experimental implementations, feedback, etc. Instead, these &quot;standards&quot; were developed directly in one of the browsers, shipped, and then promoted as a feature that developers should begin targeting, totally bypassing the usual process, with the tacit expectation that other browsers would be forced to follow. Apple did this with &lt;canvas&gt; and some aspects of CSS3 to help with their push away from Flash. Google did this with many the PWA APIs.<p>All along, as the PWA APIs have been released from the Chrome lab, there&#x27;s been a certain contingent of developers who heap scorn upon the Safari team for not implementing these APIs too — as though the existence in Chrome (and, in some cases, Firefox, who tend to follow-fast as a survival instinct), plus the Chrome team dropping specs off at the W3C working groups, were cause enough for these APIs to be regarded as &quot;standard&quot;. The error of these devs is confusing ubiquity and standard.<p>Most PWA features are, at current, about as standard as ActiveX was. They were designed by Google in private, to suit their own ecosystem goals. They might be good for the web, by providing an alternative to native apps — but they might also be bad for the web, by forcing browsers to serve as an app platform instead of a hypermedia user agent.<p>Sadly, we don&#x27;t get to have that very important, very nuanced discussion.

Apple have won similar battles with other &quot;standards&quot; (for instance, there&#x27;s a similar split in opinion around Flash, but until recently the &quot;Flash deserved to die&quot; contingent have been dominant, which suits Apple just fine).<p>So why did PWAs fail to take off? I would argue that it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re a significant alteration of what the web is meant to be. They&#x27;re a big step toward defining the web as a full-throated application runtime. I don&#x27;t know that the rest of the web ecosystem is on board with that redefinition. At least not yet, and not merely because Google tried to will it into being.

In my final year however, I had a full-time position doing research with CSIRO, which is a leading research organisation in Australia.

If I had wanted to, I could have stayed on and continued down that path. But I didn&#x27;t.<p>What ultimately pushed me away was everyone I bumped in to in academia was so unhappy. There was constant bickering and frustration around getting funding (a common sentiment in the division I worked in was that you had pander to big mining&#x2F;oil companies and propose research topics with clear financial gain for them). It was not a happy place to be, and at the end of my time there I jumped head first in to a software job instead.<p>I later found time to still do mathematics on my own, and have written about that journey and shared it previously on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;mathematics-self-learner\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;mathematics-self-learner<\/a> and have had some other little successes in my life that make me feel like I made the right choice: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;how-i-built-bbsmart\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilwithdata.com&#x2F;how-i-built-bbsmart<\/a><p>Tangentially, this I think is also why I&#x27;m more open to hearing ideas from organisations like Numenta, and seeing research done outside of academia by folks like Stephen Wolfram.

It also holds us in competition against rather than cooperation with.  It focuses us on transaction creation, not on life improvement.

Deliberately and consciously. In recent decades, there has been a push to evaluate public services in private sector terms, i.e., basically, economic profitability (and in particular, short-term profitability). At least in my country, this is quite explicit, but I suppose it happens everywhere to a greater or lesser extent. There is a lot of public discourse that academia cannot be an ivory tower, it has to constantly be evaluated and provide proof that what it&#x27;s doing is useful. It&#x27;s difficult to obtain funding for basic science, you need to promise immediate practical applications to obtain grants. Papers are increasingly shunned in favor of patents, the academic that &quot;only publishes papers that other academics read&quot; is now a figure of parody or derision. There are even research grants whose main or sole evaluation criterion is &quot;amount of research income generated in the last X months&quot;.<p>So to sum up, the capitalistic mindset of looking at everything in terms of short-term profitability has harmed, and continues harming, academia.

I never expected it to get any traction or follow-up. At the time I posted it, I was working as a contractor for my former full time employer. I had left full-time work there in early 2017 to attend the full-time program at the (sadly now-defunct) Furniture Institute of Massachusetts[0].<p>I finished that program in early 2019, and split my time between commission work and part time work for other woodworkers. Like software, in woodworking there are things you learn at school and things you learn doing it for money.<p>In early 2020 (which now feels like a million years ago), my partner and I left the Boston area for her to take a job in the northern hinterlands of NH.<p>It&#x27;s been an interesting year to say the least: A lot of the opportunities I was hoping to have to publicize my business have been canceled (craft shows and fairs, open studios, etc) due to the pandemic. I&#x27;m fortunate to have brought a couple of paid commissions with me when we moved. Owing to the pandemic, the schedule on them has been protracted. I was going back and forth to Boston to fulfill a teaching obligation until early March. Then the pandemic hit, and all of my suppliers and my shared shop space[1] closed down for a couple months.<p>Just before the shared shop closed, I grabbed my workbench and set it up in my living room. The place we&#x27;re renting doesn&#x27;t have a basement, garage, or anything resembling shop space, so that was the least bad option. I bought wood for a couple of house projects, and got going working <i>entirely<\/i> by hand. The first project was a desk for my partner. I built it following the design for a staked work table from the Anarchist&#x27;s Design Book[2]. She&#x27;s been working at it since, and we&#x27;ve been doing our best to manage my noise and her Zoom calls separated by perhaps as much as 20 feet.<p>Sometime in late May or early June things started opening up slowly. I bought wood for those projects, and the shared shop space began operating with extremely limited hours. I&#x27;ve wrapped up those couple of projects, and honestly, the next thing on my TODO list is to spend some time doing some business planning, re-shooting some of my earlier work, and updating my website[3]. Bad timing on the pithy github comment on my part; had I known it&#x27;d hit the top of HN, I&#x27;d have made it <i>after<\/i> I updated the website!<p>If you&#x27;re in the Boston area and would like to see some of my work, the Cabinet on Stand shown on my website is on display at the Fuller Craft Museum[4] in Brockton, MA through November 8th. It feels a bit weird to mention it, but that piece is also for sale through the museum. Purchasing it supports not only me, but also the museum. They were closed for a long time this year as a result of the pandemic, and like a great many of our cultural institutions, they&#x27;re hurting. They laid off the curator for the exhibit my piece is in due to budget issues.<p>If I can offer everybody only one thing to get out of this, it&#x27;s that our cultural institutions live a fairly fragile and perilous existence, particularly the smaller ones.

It&#x27;s a line by the Joe MacMillan character (portrayed by Lee Pace) from <i>Halt and Catch Fire<\/i>:<p>&quot;The computer isn&#x27;t thing.  The computer&#x27;s the thing that gets us to the thing.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s how programming felt when I got into it back in the 80&#x27;s and was still there when I started doing it professionally in the 90&#x27;s.  It felt like we were using computers as tools for creativity and exploration.  For making the world a better place.  Increasingly, as the valuations skyrocketed, that feeling has diminished to the point where I don&#x27;t see it anywhere anymore.  It&#x27;s not about &quot;getting us to the thing&quot;, it&#x27;s not about making the world better.  It is about making a buck.<p>Now, look; I don&#x27;t have a problem with people earning a living or even with Apple having a $2T valuation.  My problem is the influence that has had on the industry.  One might suggest that such a thing is unavoidable and they are probably right, but can&#x27;t we at least try to be better?  Can&#x27;t we at least try to keep in focus the goal of making lives better and less about showing yet another ad?  People are genuinely suffering right now all over the world.  I challenge anyone to suggest that health and economic hardships are less important than Facebook.<p>On a more practical, day-to-day matter: my job as a programmer is, well... my GOD the amount of tooling!  When I got started web programming I had a text editor, and FTP client, a server, and a browser.  I made a change, uploaded the files, and refreshed my browser.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  Having a debugger built into the browser is great.  Having a proper version control system is fantastic.  I think, however, we&#x27;re missing the forrest for the trees where tooling is concerned.<p>Here&#x27;s a case in point that a good friend pointed out to me recently:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thecreation&#x2F;jquery-wizard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thecreation&#x2F;jquery-wizard<\/a>    It&#x27;s a simple jQuery plugin (please let&#x27;s not get sidetracked with &quot;jQuery is so old|bad|blah blah blah&quot;!) for building wizards.  Just look at all the files needed for the various tooling in relation to actual source code. Babel, Bower, ESLint, NPM, Travis, Gulp, Karma. You have to ask yourself, how much time does the developer get to spend on making his&#x2F;her product better versus maintaining tooling support?!<p>And _that_ is what programming is like right now.

It was clear Google wasn&#x27;t interested in supporting the payments feature for a while.

Despite the gut renovation, the company didn&#x27;t change much in practice because our core business model was the only thing that couldn&#x27;t change. We just became more effective.<p>I worked at Google from 2010-2015. When I looked for another job, I wanted to avoid the thing that bothered me about working at a FAANG. I didn&#x27;t have a clear understanding of how my contributions affected the bottom line. In fact, when I left, I asked a bunch of current employees the same question: &quot;Did Google make money on my employment?&quot; I got every answer you can imagine.<p>&quot;Of course they did, you helped grow an ecosystem with network effects, so the value you added was intangible but incalculably large.&quot;<p>&quot;Of course they didn&#x27;t. You grew the output of a product that people can use for free, so your work was mostly a loss leader.&quot;<p>Anyways, when I looked for a new job, I had a simple requirement. I wanted to work for a business model that I wanted to improve. Etsy fit the bill. A marketplace for small businesses to sell unique goods. I could feel good about improving this business model: improving our top line meant that more small businesses got sales. I can live with that.<p>Flash forward a year, and Etsy was in serious trouble. Growth was decelerating. Our core product was neglected in favor of newer offerings that had a long way to go to get traction. So we had some major gut renovation: new CEO. New CTO. New CFO. Two rounds of layoffs. A bunch of people left because the culture was gone. You think to yourself, &quot;OK, that&#x27;s it, the foxes are in the henhouse. What&#x27;s going to change?&quot; And it turns out that you can&#x27;t change that much! Our core business was to connect small businesses making special items to a global audience. So that&#x27;s what the foxes had to work with: A two-sided marketplace where they needed to please both the existing sellers (so that they didn&#x27;t just shut down their shop in favor of all of the other marketplaces they were using) and improve the site for our buyers. So they brushed the dust off of the core marketplace, assigned a bunch of people to focus on improving sales, and the results speak for themselves. Even ignoring Covid-related effects, our marketplace was healthier, growth was accelerating, and morale was up. And some of the people that left because it wasn&#x27;t the same anymore? They came back. We have a lot of &quot;boomerangs&quot; from that era.<p>I like point of incentives that OP brought up, you can also see that in some things that Etsy sellers hate. For example, the people who made Etsy set the fees way too low. It&#x27;s hard to walk that back. So you can see the executives try to find ways to bring the fees more in line with what Ebay or Amazon might get. The best they&#x27;ve come up with is improving an offering and restructuring the fees at the same time. &quot;New: off-site ads are new and improved, and if you get a sale, we charge %12&quot; type stuff. If you&#x27;re a seller that&#x27;s mad at Etsy, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that you&#x27;re going to complain about  - us following our own incentives."],"time":["2020-09-21 18:35:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HugoDaniel"],"id":[24544457],"kids":[24544810],"parent":[24543510],"text":["This is a trick question, author seems to be vouching for blending the culture into the business model (&quot;...the better a product is, the better off the company is and its users are&quot;).<p>I do wonder how well can it fit the Betteridge Law of Headlines ?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_Law_of_Headlines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_Law_of_Headline...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 17:20:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["naringas"],"id":[24544415],"kids":[24545238,24551493,24544459],"parent":[24543510],"text":["this breaks <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_law_of_headline...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 17:17:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ponker"],"id":[24544840],"kids":{},"parent":[24543510],"text":["Perhaps this is why, to everyone’s astonishment, Google and Facebook have moved well ahead of Microsoft in the generally accepted “evil” rankings."],"time":["2020-09-21 17:54:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hardwaresofton"],"id":[24540922],"kids":[24543430,24542182,24545436],"parent":[24538531],"text":["For those that want to see what it actually looks like:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;0282-record-dot-syntax.rst#examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;p...<\/a><p><pre><code>    data Grade = A | B | C | D | E | F\n    data Quarter = Fall | Winter | Spring\n    data Status = Passed | Failed | Incomplete | Withdrawn\n\n    data Taken =\n      Taken { year :: Int\n            , term :: Quarter\n            }\n\n    data Class =\n      Class { hours :: Int\n            , units :: Int\n            , grade :: Grade\n            , result :: Status\n            , taken :: Taken\n            }\n\n    getResult :: Class -&gt; Status\n    getResult c = c.result -- get\n\n    setResult :: Class -&gt; Status -&gt; Class\n    setResult c r = c{result = r} -- update\n\n    setYearTaken :: Class -&gt; Int -&gt; Class\n    setYearTaken c y = c{taken.year = y} -- nested update\n\n    getResults :: [Class] -&gt; [Status]\n    getResults = map (.result) -- selector\n\n    getTerms :: [Class]  -&gt; [Quarter]\n    getTerms = map (.taken.term) -- nested selector<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-09-21 10:05:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregwebs"],"id":[24539291],"kids":[24539669,24539609],"parent":[24538531],"text":["Simon Peyton Jones: &quot;One possible reaction to a diversity of opinion is to do nothing and wait for clarity to emerge.

There is a pretty long list of theoretical trade offs and hard design problems that do not have practical solutions today, which makes it an interesting research area.<p>Some of the more interesting open questions for systems that want to strongly enforce the sovereignty of logical nodes:<p>How do you design inter-node protocol strategies that exhibit optimal, robust Nash equilibria in non-trivial real-world environments i.e. uses resources efficiently in all plausible configurations absent centralized control? This is fiendishly difficult because relevant properties of nodes scale in complex, interacting ways and game theory is not sufficiently developed to solve some of these cases in practical systems. In any sufficiently complex and real-time federated environment, you want these mechanics to be almost completely automagic. Currently, there is a bias toward restricting the number of logical nodes in federated systems because that means humans can plausibly deal with the brittleness, which implies centralization.<p>How do you prevent nodes from being attacked&#x2F;exploited from both the outside and inside, including malware, DDOS, fraudulent data, exfiltration of private data, etc? This is a separate question from the intrinsic theoretical robustness of the protocol design in terms of resource and scaling efficiency. Also, how do you make a policy easy to describe and enforceable with strong guarantees? The state-of-the-art in high-assurance internetworking (which considers these kinds of problems) is quite far from where it needs to be address these issues convincingly.<p>How do you audit user behavior that spans multiple sovereign federation domains to limit abuse and misuse of the system while leaking minimal private state?<p>Some of these are just Hard Problems, unless you have a very simple&#x2F;restricted system, that we will need to carefully design around to minimize human involvement; most federated system designs just ignore these issues. For others we have plausible approaches theoretically but no real technical implementations with sufficient generality or functionality.

As they worked with clients, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, the two realized the need for businesses to leverage COBOL systems while ramping up to do work on the Internet.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>COBOL, a language designed in 1959 at the Conference of Data Systems Languages, is why Y2K fever has gone on for the last several years. Because programmers condensed dates down to two digits, computers interpret the year 2000 as 1900.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>According to Dean, there are 700,000 COBOL programmers in the United States, and many businesses still have key databases running in the old language. Because of Y2K, these companies have had to invest vast amounts capital in their systems, which run on COBOL.
