Oracle believes those two officials influenced the JEDI strategy to be tailor-fit for an AWS win.<p>The interesting thing here is that both Oracle and IBM had an initial strategy of painting the JEDI requirements as exceeding DOD&#x27;s needs, an interesting tactic given their relative lack of scale -- they are in capex terms also-rans in the cloud market.<p>After a review, in April 2019, the Pentagon said that the employee&#x27;s actions did not affect the process and further ruled IBM and Oracle out of the process[2019], while retaining Amazon&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s bids.<p>Microsoft was finally awarded the contract in late October, which prompted Amazon to claim &quot;political influence&quot; because of Trump&#x27;s statements re the contract, and led to a further legal challenge[2020].<p>[2018] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedscoop.com&#x2F;ibms-protest-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-dismissed&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedscoop.com&#x2F;ibms-protest-10b-jedi-cloud-contrac...<\/a><p>[2019] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextgov.com&#x2F;it-modernization&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;after-two-years-jedi-finally-underway&#x2F;162005&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextgov.com&#x2F;it-modernization&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;after-two-y...<\/a><p>[2020] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.newstatesman.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;amazon-pentagon-contract-appeal-us-judge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.newstatesman.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;amazon-pentagon-contract...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-07 19:54:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Cheyana"],"id":[24400961],"kids":{},"parent":[24400474],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n-86ax7TYNM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n-86ax7TYNM<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-07 19:27:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ykevinator"],"id":[24402768],"kids":{},"parent":[24400474],"text":["Still can&#x27;t believe people think the us can&#x27;t build their own cloud with $10b"],"time":["2020-09-07 22:54:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["blhack"],"id":[24400719],"kids":[24400939,24400853],"parent":[24400474],"text":["What an unbelievably transparent appeal to peoples&#x27; emotions.<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot; to use somebody other than AWS?

A few months down the road they said I wasn&#x27;t meeting expectations because of my &quot;time management&quot; which had too many meetings and lacked focus time for IC work - which definitely was not my 50%+ focus. I&#x27;m &quot;winning&quot; the resulting political war (my last 1:1 left my lead in tears), but only in the limited sense that I&#x27;m not getting fired; it&#x27;s been a bit of a disaster for everyone.<p>The unclear expectations of what gets someone an EM role and what is expected of that role is the root of my problem, some of the author&#x27;s, and a lot of the industry&#x27;s as a whole.<p>Leaders are picked from those that are truly focused on tech and truly excel at it... and then told not to do that. How can somebody be &quot;intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome&quot; of tech work and then suddenly be expected to stop doing it?<p>I should have been that rare counter-example in that I got picked for this role because of my very visible leadership in other areas. However, when it came time to give me the position formally they fell back on code output and found it somewhat lacking (specifically, the number of commits I made while onboarding was less than those of my established teammates).<p>There&#x27;s a school of thought that switching back and forth between IC and EM tracks lets you build a lot of knowledge and be both better manager and IC (the author evidently did). While I do think experience with each helps you do the other, there is a cost to that focus shifting. This isn&#x27;t like the cost of only being able to code in 45 minute blocks.  It&#x27;s the cost of shifting the things you care most about entirely.<p>Most managers fail to ever make that shift. Even if they manage to hold themselves back from coding (not all do), their heads remain in the code. One sign is when, in response to impossible expectations from above, they try to come up with technical solutions (e.g., if only we redesigned this module we could meet these impossible deadlines). If your mind is focused on tech, it&#x27;s the tool you use to solve every problem. Another example is when team members have no idea how to move their careers forward and don&#x27;t know expectations. A tech focused lead won&#x27;t be thinking about how a new project is actually the perfect challenge for a more junior employee; their head will be figuring out the best way to solve the task technically.<p>An EM is not a tech lead.

Most computers use this to get their IP and the DNS servers. For example, for as long as I can remember the default Debian way to handle the network was <i>ifupdown<\/i>, where a hook called `dhcp` after an interface is connected, and by doing so the file resolv.conf is updated. If resolv.conf is manually controlled, there is no DHCP to update it, and then you have to declare your DNS servers. But the DNS that you can query from home may not be reachable from a public wifi. And at work, you won&#x27;t have access to the intranet unless you add some private DNS servers at the top of your resolv.conf. So a totally manual handling of resolv.conf is a bad idea, at least for a laptop.<p>The article also never wonder why do all these programs try to &quot;take control&quot; of resolv.conf. Some of them just try to update it when they receive DHCP data about DNS. Other, like resolvconf, try to separate the manual part from the dhcp-generated part (which is what &quot;manual control&quot; should aim to).

This ended up working for her (and for me) because it is apparently easier to replace one habit with another (i.e. lip-biting with tickmark-writing) than to eliminate a habit completely.

I&#x27;ve tried many different things to motivate myself to either abstain from behavior like smoking or to keep up healthy streaks.<p>An example would be a promise I made last Christmas to my fiancée. I&#x27;ve had a hard time quitting smoking because it&#x27;s my go-to solution when life is stressful and feels like the walls are coming down. I gave her 500€ and told her that money is for a small holiday for us next summer if I don&#x27;t smoke. If I smoke she can keep it all and use it for whatever she wants.<p>Now when I wanted to smoke, I&#x27;d have to weigh the decision against that promise. The downside was, I had a clear price that I could decide to pay if I wanted a cigarette. Needless to say, I failed in two months and now she has a new sewing machine.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve now managed to keep a 45 day streak on duolingo. It&#x27;s a way smaller thing and there&#x27;s nothing externally motivating me except that damn little owl and a little lit flame icon displaying my streak. There&#x27;s no penalty for failing nor is there any way to wiggle out of failing if I choose not to do my daily exercises. My main motivation is just to learn Welsh for the sake of it and I find it much easier to keep this up than any other habit which comes with internal or external pressure.<p>Making your friends hold you accountable to something just sounds like the recipe for getting unmotivated and losing the actual goal and swapping the enjoyment of doing something into fear of some sort of penalty which one could decide was worth facing.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that talking too much of your ideas and goals will decrease motivation as you gain some feeling of success which should be rewarded to you after you&#x27;ve actually done the deed.

There’s a certain amount of heat a knob and tube wiring install is designed to allow due to an over current; but this was contingent upon being installed properly, and never modified. The issue  today (and in the 1950s)  is that many DIYers spliced their safety into a black hole of junction boxes.<p>Even If it’s a shiny new Siemens Load Center, none of that matters if it connects to wire made during the Ottoman Empire, and illegally spliced into the old breaker panel during the 1970s.<p>- The breaker box, fuse box, load center....

Higher-order interactive theorem provers enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present an interesting, open-ended challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning. We also present a deep reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, with strong initial results on this benchmark.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-09-06 18:31:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thomasahle"],"id":[24390125],"kids":[24390786,24390656,24390349],"parent":[24389058],"text":["I wonder why they don&#x27;t mention any work based on transformer architectures?

You just have logging function which works in a\nfire-and-forget fashion.<p>&gt; Asynchronous reads and writes would require all new APIs with different coloring. You’d need an aprint() to complement print(), and so on, each returning an awaitable to be awaited.<p>&gt; This is one of the unfortunate downsides of async&#x2F;await. I strongly prefer conventional, preemptive concurrency, but we don’t always have that luxury.<p>I was sceptical about Golang for a long time, but recently I&#x27;ve started practicing it. It&#x27;s designed with concurrency in mind from very beginning and goroutines have advantages of both cooperative and preemptive multitasking. And also it doesn&#x27;t have GIL, so your goroutines will use all available CPUs without any additional effort from your side.<p>From programmers point of view, coding with goroutines looks exactly like coding with use of pthreads (even simpler, in fact). So, there are no function &quot;coloring&quot;, no need in sync&#x2F;async library flavors and so on. But these &quot;threads&quot; also have cost close to cost of python coroutines. It sounds too good to be true, but I&#x27;ve rewritten bunch of my Python&#x2F;asyncio code in Go and I can say it&#x27;s true.

Whenever one lets the mask slip or shows her hands or hair, it&#x27;s a young white person. These are night time riots, plain and simple. Surveillance footage released by law enforcement shows that Mike Reinoehl loaded and cocked his weapon lying in wait before he murdered Aaron Danielson.

I couldn&#x27;t put it into those terms, but it&#x27;s the same sentiment from my first exposure at age 12. When a billionaire self-described hacker uses his authority as the creator of the largest online social network on earth to censor any evidence that goes against a certain narrative, even to the point of blacklisting, he has ceased to be a hacker, as have any employees who continue to be accomplices in this increasingly absurd information warfare operation.<p>I have no doubt that many of these people believe they are doing the right thing, but they themselves have been cracked and don&#x27;t even know it or are too fragile to resist. Anytime anyone says &quot;you can&#x27;t say &lt;X&gt; and you can&#x27;t look at the evidence we don&#x27;t endorse,&quot; I&#x27;m suspicious. Yet that is what we see right now.<p>The largest social networking site in the world will ban posts and even accounts for saying a certain narrative. The largest video platform in the world boosts the &quot;reliable sources&quot; mentioned in the article, and only puts less curated information after it.

Increasingly, FUD is how Apple&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Brave are selling their anti-feature policy. &quot;Trust us, we won&#x27;t let the web work with midi&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound that great, but is much more honest than what we get, which is &quot;these engineers &amp; standards groups working on these specs are secretly trying to undermine this treasured web which we must protect &amp; keep as is at all costs&quot;. the involved engineer&#x27;s histories indicates they obviously care enormously about bettering the web, &amp; in this case are combatting sizable transpiling tool bloat for devs, &amp; enabling offline sharing &amp; offline capable web, and literally fighting censorship, which are truly worthy goals all that will vastly help the web.<p>This is all super hard to work through. Yes, google used the web to reap enormous profit by means of enormous information control &amp; inventory systems for ads &amp; eyeballs. But Google also would not exist without the web, &amp; historically the web was a small toy that couldn&#x27;t do much compared to apps. The tables have turned, &amp; the web is clearly ascendant, much safer, &amp; increasingly we understand that the limitations of ux were largely from lack of will to explore &amp; test what limits there really were, so the situation is no longer so obviously tense. But Google Chrome &amp; Chromium &amp; the spec work Google does are, imo, designed to improve a communal shared resource for all humanity, designed to greaten the web, not subvert it.  We can see that here, as the engineers working on webbundle have shown a thousand times over their commitment to honest above board clear integrity as they have tried &amp; tried &amp; tried to work with Peter Snyder as he fumbled &amp; plodded his way to a scenario where WebBundles pose any real danger, &amp; Peter has imo failed at presenting anything. We can see the engineers take Peter seriously, try to work with him. And so I feel it is in general. It is intimating as hell that the web is so big, has so many capabilities, that so much keeps getting added, and so much of that comes from gigantic unimaginably huge pools of capital derived from eyeballs-on-screen. But somehow it has been working out, the engineers have genuinely cared about doing the right thing, &amp; usually the standards bodies &amp; TAG can eventually come to harmony &amp; agree, &amp; the web improves.<p>Peters dissent thread:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;webpackage&#x2F;issues&#x2F;551\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;webpackage&#x2F;issues&#x2F;551<\/a><p>Personally I greatly look forward to WebBundles.

I was throwing a lot of rapid Emacs window management, isearch, ad hoc keyboard macros, etc. at it, and the task didn&#x27;t require much second-guessing, which I suppose resulted in a lot of almost Hollywood-like &quot;programming&#x2F;hacking&quot; rapidly changing windows of computer-y text on my screen, extend highlights flashing, syntax coloring updating, etc.  At some point, some of the people who were arriving for a pickup soccer game in the park gathered round, and were just watching, and when I got to a stopping point, were kinda cheering and congratulating me (I think I didn&#x27;t speak any of their languages), and one gave me a high-five.

But the point is, my Emacs workflow is reflective of the fact that I don&#x27;t use Emacs because it gives me some huge needed leverage over the <i>act of writing code<\/i>. That is relatively straightforward, and the plain Emacs bindings, once learned, are more than suitable to the task.<p>Rather, I use Emacs because of a combination of pain points that it simply handles better than other editors, that add up to a significant advantage:<p>* Emacs does electric indent &quot;right&quot;. Other editors will attempt to indent automatically, but the tab key always means &quot;insert tab&quot;, not &quot;indent this line to its computed indent level&quot;. This alone makes it more pleasant to use than most &quot;modern&quot; code editors.<p>* By default, Emacs will help you match paired delimiters (parens, brackets, quotes, etc.) but will not insert closing delimiters. This saves me that awkward experience of typing out a code block, parameter list, or string constant, only to find that I now have mismatched delimiters because I didn&#x27;t realize I was supposed to cursor over the closing delimiter my editor oh-so-helpfully provided rather than type it myself. Except some editors just cursor over the closing delimiter if it senses that you&#x27;re typing the delimiter at point. Some don&#x27;t, though, and it&#x27;s hard to remember which is which!<p>* I work a lot in Lisp, and Emacs is better suited to handling Lisp code than most other editors.<p>* Emacs is an immensely useful <i>programming environment<\/i>. There are <i>applications<\/i> like Magit and Org-mode built on top of Emacs that are just stupid useful workflow grease. On top of that, if there are pain points in my workflow, coding something up in Emacs Lisp to handle them is incredibly easy and straightforward, and I can evaluate and test my code right in my running Emacs session. Contrary to popular belief, Emacs integrates well with Unix tooling; Unix tools can be easily plumbed together with Emacs buffers, enabling you to use Emacs as a kind of &quot;super-shell&quot; to capture, move, examine, and massage data."],"time":["2020-09-07 10:13:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["melling"],"id":[24394098],"kids":[24394224,24395851],"parent":[24393987],"text":["I just signed up for <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;<\/a><p>I’d like to kick back on my couch and code for an hour using my iPad and Apple Pencil.<p>I’m anxiously awaiting for someone to image a better mobile experience rather than attaching a hardware keyboard."],"time":["2020-09-06 21:45:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Const-me"],"id":[24394228],"kids":[24394244],"parent":[24393987],"text":["Not sure I agree.
