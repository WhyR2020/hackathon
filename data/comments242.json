A good author can completely encode an entire world full of people on 300 pages of black and white text.  And when they do it well, it literally never expires.  I read mostly books from the last 50 years but I think the best example of a book as magic is Don Quixote. It was published in 1605.  You can pick it up today and relate to the characters, enjoy the plot, and laugh at their jokes.  Most other forms of popular media go stale in a year or maybe a decade.<p>You will also find that reading great writers improves your ability to think and speak. The true masters, someone like John Steinbeck or Gabriel Garcia Marquez, construct sentences so beautifully that they can stop up in your tracks.  After reading enough some of this will rub off on you and you&#x27;ll be shocked at small bursts of eloquence in your thoughts and speech.<p>So I strongly advise everyone to read at least a few good novels a year.

A reader can learn everything I know about a subject in 4-6 hours. Want to learn about the Cold War? Read Gaddis&#x27; seminal book on it. Want to learn about WWII? Read Winston Churchill&#x27;s five book series that won the Nobel prize for literature? Civil War? Shelby Foote. If history is not your thing what about biography? There are biographies of practically every founder of great tech companies. (Jobs, Gates, Musk). How about ideas? Malcolm Gladwell (Tippingpoint), Michael Lewis (Mondeyball). Or maybe break into reading with fiction. Give yourself a present of the complete Lord of the Rings. If you liked the movies be prepared to love the books. If you hated the movies, no problem, the books are far better. OR science fiction. Read all of Heinlein&#x27;s books for young adults. Start with Double Star then read Have Space Suit Will Travel.

That way I get the reward book after a harder book and the cycle keeps me coming back for more. To many textbooks sorts in a row and I get bored.<p>Another way to remember what you read better is to take notes while you read. These can be annotations in the margins or on a separate piece of paper&#x2F;computer. I read that just the act of writing those things down helps you remember even if you don&#x27;t look at it again. `Mind Maps` might also be useful to you in understanding what you learn.<p>One last thing you probably already know but telling someone else about what your reading can help you practice recall and find out what parts of it your missing like a mini oral test."],"time":["2020-01-05 03:03:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sharmi"],"id":[21959901],"kids":{},"parent":[21955258],"text":["An observation from a book lover who has lately fallen into the self improvement subject, most of the books are not worth it.

Around when I turned 15 I pretty much stopped reading altogether. I was (and still am) very into CSGO and kind of just dropped reading literature for playing CS with my friends. While that was&#x2F;is fun, dropping literature as a pastime left a hole in me that couldn&#x27;t be filled by any video game, podcast, blog post, or even eBook. I only got back into reading fiction because my best friend here at uni was talking about how much she loved Agatha Christie, and I happened to have a compendium of 5 Hercule Poirot books that had been sitting on my bookshelf (and taken with me when I moved) for about 4 years. Now I can&#x27;t stop reading (again).<p>Reading books (for me, fiction; for others, non-fiction) widens your understanding of the world around you, the perspectives of those around you, and most importantly your own imagination. Reading literature helps me creatively solve problems and come up with inspired ideas that would&#x27;ve been very difficult for me to come up with otherwise. It is something I would be incomplete without.<p>P.S. For me paper books are 100% superior to ebooks. The feel of holding, seeing, and smelling a paper book, especially an old paper book, is so comforting and impossible to replicate with an ebook.

The automated information control that occurs online today, means that things are there one day, gone the next. This happens accross the information continuum.\n2. The Pareto principle: 20% of things provide 80% of the value. Online, where new content can be created for nearly free, good information about anything can be hard to find, drowned in a sea of advertisement and distraction. In a physical bookstore or library, the cost of printing and stocking means that only things that are worth printing, are kept around.\n3. Inheritance of relevancy: I enjoy getting my books from the used bookstores, because time after time I pick up some volume on history that someone has written incredible things in the margins! Of course, we have comment sections and such online, but the Pareto principle applies again here.\n4. Impression and discernment of value: You can tell just from looking at the design of a book, what the intended audience is. If the authors name is bigger than the title, for example, that tells you a whole lot. If like me, you look for more uncommon, less known things, you learn to disregard anything with flashy marketing or a bestseller claim. Head straight for the plain and boring: the value is what gets it sold, whats written inside. \n5. Obscure, out-of-print, actually supressed and allegedly supressed works.

Even considering the limitation of  knowledge that is digitized, there are plenty of sources that are not accessible and searchable (papers, talks, radio programs, conversations, personal anecdotes etc.).

And the best way to start is for now is put aside your &quot;must read&quot; list.

Don&#x27;t limit yourself to nonfiction, if you&#x27;re interested in memory maybe you could pick up Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s Thinking Fast and Slow or maybe you could choose Tom McCarthy&#x27;s amazing novel Remainder.

Pick another book, maybe the first book you read pushes you towards selecting another. You want more from the same author or topic. And don&#x27;t be shy about not finishing things, sometimes a book doesn&#x27;t pay off on the curiosity that led you to it. I often start reading a handful or more of books at a time until I find one that really grips me. Or just keep alternating between reading lots of different things for weeks. Kindle &amp; the kindle app are actually very good for this because you can send yourself samples of books so you can try them before investing in them.<p>I would also say in general, the depth of knowledge shared, and the quality of work put into a book tends to be much greater than 99% of what you find online. It is a lot of work to publish a book, the authors, editors and everyone else involved want to make it worth it.

Then <i>power move<\/i> find the option to look for &quot;Skip the Line&quot; or equivalent to get a list of books other people are waiting months to read in a queue. Thank me later.<p>Step two: start listening to audiobooks. You&#x27;ll start at 1x speed and then gradually move up to 2x, depending on the type of book you&#x27;re listening to and whether the narrator has an accent. I get through a book every two days by listening during my morning prep, when I&#x27;m walking or biking. You will find yourself slowing down to finish chapters in no time. Audiobooks are incredible. There are haters; they are wrong.<p>I recommend switching up between fiction and non-fiction, otherwise I get exhausted. I like business books (Shoedog by Phil Knight, or The Hard Thing About Hard Things) and books about behavioural psychology; Thinking, Fast and Slow is excellent, so is anything by Malcolm Gladwell. Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker, Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari are both great. Authors like Dan Ariely and the Steves that wrote Freakonomics.<p>Lots of audiobooks are pleasurable in a special way because they are read by the author. For example, literally every book by David Sedaris is best enjoyed when read by David Sedaris. This is also true of good biographies; Failure Is An Option by H. Jon Benjamin will get you kicked out of a restaurant because you&#x27;ll be laughing so hard.<p>Fiction is a really personal realm, but I prefer sci-fi and some fantasy.

Both of these criteria are subjective.<p>- How you search and filter is also highly personal. It might be that your needs are such that the content you find in those mediums you listed are ideal for you.<p>- For me, people who write books and people who do videos&#x2F;articles&#x2F;podcasts are often not the same people, and I tend to be more interested in what the book writing people have to say.<p>- Videos&#x2F;articles&#x2F;podcasts present first-hand ideas far less often. The opposite is true: authors of interesting and original ideas often elect to convey them through books. Again, subjective.<p>- If an idea is novel enough, short-form mediums like those you listed are not enough to convey it. A book (or rather its length compared to e.g. article) allows the author to explore and swim around in his ideas. You need that for innovative ideas. Noam Chomsky said that at the time (1960s or 70s) how much time you got to present your idea on TV -- 5 minutes -- was not enough to change a person&#x27;s opinion, so the medium itself framed the discourse. Same applies to all mediums. It pays to be mindful of that.<p>- A good book is much better than a good series or film. HBO&#x27;s Game of Thrones versus GRRM&#x27;s A Song of Ice and Fire. Umberto Eco&#x27;s The Name of the Rose versus the recent series. Richard K. Morgan&#x27;s Takeshi Kovacs series versus Netflix&#x27;s Altered Carbon. Same goes for non-fiction.<p>- I&#x27;m a lover of film, but I turned to books because there&#x27;s only so many good movies, but there&#x27;s orders of magnitude more good books. Same goes for fiction and non-fiction.<p>- If you&#x27;re looking for stimulation, rather than technical information, a book lasts much longer. I&#x27;ve stretched out reading some book series for years and it was awesome.<p>- If you don&#x27;t enjoy a book, don&#x27;t read it. Don&#x27;t hope that it will get better or that it will have been worth it. Odds are stacked against it. I regret that when I started getting into books way back when I forced myself to read even those I didn&#x27;t immediately like; I now know to give a book a serious 30-60 minutes and if my gut says no that&#x27;s that.

Anybody that&#x27;s done any academic reading (a.k.a. reading through dense academic journals and papers) will tell you it&#x27;s a learned skill that is vastly different from either non-fiction or fiction reading.  I can easily pound my way through a 1000 page book from Neal Stephenson in a few nights, but I need weeks to dig into a single paper in Category Theory, Non-linear Systems, or Control Theory; and it&#x27;s because reading those academically isn&#x27;t a skill I&#x27;ve built up yet.<p>And while it&#x27;s true that much of the synopsis information on a topic can be found online, and you can get the details on Grapes of Wrath from piles of YouTube&#x27;ers and CliffsNotes; there is detail and meaning that you may take away from that book that you wouldn&#x27;t find in those short reviews (they&#x27;re great for school reports in a pinch, but not great for actual contextualization).  So, in all, it also depends on what you&#x27;re reading for.<p>And that brings me to my last and probably most important point, &quot;What you&#x27;re reading for.&quot;  I read something like Stephen King for enjoyment, plain and simple, there isn&#x27;t some meaning of life that will probably be gleaned from it.  I have a friend that reads piles of &quot;bodice rippers&quot; for enjoyment, they read a lot of other things, but that&#x27;s their junk food reading.  I read various pop-science or pop-psychology or pop-history type books for a mix of enjoyment and seeing if I want to dig deeper on the subjects they&#x27;re covering; and they can be better (and sometimes way worse) at conveying interesting points on a topic than a quick few articles online.  I read academic journals to further my education and keep up with new things coming out in my fields of interest.  And like most of us, of course I plow through online content, news, the Twittersphere, and bloggers I follow for many of these same reasons.<p>So it&#x27;s honestly up to, and on you, for the reason you read books (or don&#x27;t).

They annex every age to their own; all the years that have gone before them are an addition to their store. Unless we are most ungrateful, all those men, glorious fashioners of holy thoughts, were born for us; for us they have prepared a way of life. By other men&#x27;s labours we are led to the sight of things most beautiful that have been wrested from darkness and brought into light; from no age are we shut out, we have access to all ages, and if it is our wish, by greatness of mind, to pass beyond the narrow limits of human weakness, there is a great stretch of time through which we may roam. We may argue with Socrates, we may doubt with Carneades, find peace with Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, exceed it with the Cynics. Since Nature allows us to enter into fellowship with every age, why should we not turn from this paltry and fleeting span of time and surrender ourselves with all our soul to the past, which is boundless, which is eternal, which we share with our betters?<p>But we may fairly say that they alone are engaged in the true duties of life who shall wish to have Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus, and all the other high priests of liberal studies, and Aristotle and Theophrastus, as their most intimate friends every day. No one of these will be &quot;not at home,&quot; no one of these will fail to have his visitor leave more happy and more devoted to himself than when he came, no one of these will allow anyone to leave him with empty hands; all mortals can meet with them by night or by day.<p>No one of these will force you to die, but all will teach you how to die; no one of these will wear out your years, but each will add his own years to yours; conversations with no one of these will bring you peril, the friendship of none will endanger your life, the courting of none will tax your purse. From them you will take whatever you wish; it will be no fault of theirs if you do not draw the utmost that you can desire. What happiness, what a fair old age awaits him who has offered himself as a client to these! He will have friends from whom he may seek counsel on matters great and small, whom he may consult every day about himself, from whom he may hear truth without insult, praise without flattery, and after whose likeness he may fashion himself.<p>We are wont to say that it was not in our power to choose the parents who fell to our lot, that they have been given to men by chance; yet we may be the sons of whomsoever we will. Households there are of noblest intellects; choose the one into which you wish to be adopted; you will inherit not merely their name, but even their property, which there will be no need to guard in a mean or niggardly spirit; the more persons you share it with, the greater it will become. These will open to you the path to immortality, and will raise you to a height from which no one is cast down. This is the only way of prolonging mortality—nay, of turning it into immortality. Honours, monuments, all that ambition has commanded by decrees or reared in works of stone, quickly sink to ruin; there is nothing that the lapse of time does not tear down and remove. But the works which philosophy has consecrated cannot be harmed; no age will destroy them, no age reduce them; the following and each succeeding age will but increase the reverence for them, since envy works upon what is close at hand, and things that are far off we are more free to admire. The life of the philosopher, therefore, has wide range, and he is not confined by the same bounds that shut others in.

Not every hour is the same. There are active hours when I&#x27;m creating something, having conversations, actively learning. There are passive hours when I&#x27;m consuming content - watching movies or YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, reading books. An hour spent reading a book is not an hour not spent learning a new ML technique. It&#x27;s an hour not spent watching TV. Once you realize that, you stop feeling guilty.<p>Now back to the main subject. Reading Cliff&#x27;s notes and comments will give you some idea of what&#x27;s in a book, but it will be by definition incomplete, and likely biased. A good example is George Orwell&#x27;s 1984. You need to read the entire book to understand the very last sentence. It is very powerful, but if you skip the book and just read it out of context it won&#x27;t have the same effect. You may think you understand what the book is about, but that understanding will be rather shallow.<p>The biggest problem with books is that, like everywhere else, 90+% is crap and it&#x27;s not easy to tell which books you&#x27;ll like. Recommendations don&#x27;t work well because they depend on people. You won&#x27;t necessarily like a book I liked.

Books are worth it.<p>For the vast majority of my life, I didn’t read any books. Reading for me is a painfully boring experience. I simply lack the ability to read and comprehend at a speed that keeps me engaged.<p>Then, I realized I assimilate information very differently based on the medium. For me, math is a very visual thing. Graphs and plots make mathematical concepts immediately understandable. For general learning, hearing someone talk about a topic is most effective for me. This is when I decided to give audiobooks a go. This has been transformational for me.<p>Any good audiobook app will allow for faster playback. I’ve trained myself to listen to books at 2x speed (or faster). This is easily 5x the speed I would comprehend the material if I physically read it. So it’s super effective for me. I listen to these books in my car during my commute. Audiobooks convert my commute from a time waster into probably the most valuable time I have in my day.<p>So why are books worth it? For me, books end up performing like the repetitive learning system of Anki (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.ankiweb.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.ankiweb.net&#x2F;<\/a>). A good book is somewhat repetitive as it goes deep on a focus area. Spending 10+ hours over the period of a week or so consuming a topic and having time for my brain to stew on it is incredible. I can’t get this from pod casts or blog posts and other online content.<p>I only listen to non-fiction books, typically on topics around human psychology, business, and topics I hope to give me new insights.<p>Bottom line: books are worth it because they offer depth that I can’t get anywhere else.

You said &quot;I read slowly and I don&#x27;t remember everything I read either.&quot;<p>In my experience most people don&#x27;t remember <i>everything<\/i> they read, but they do remember the &quot;big points&quot; that a book was trying to make. I say this to reassure you to not get hung up on how much you retain, you can always re-read the book and get more out of it. But the other part was you said you &quot;Read slowly.&quot;<p>Reading is a skill, like bicycle riding or playing the piano, or shooting baskets in basketball. The more you practice it the better it gets. A strategy I used with my kids and with folks who are new to reading is to find books that are not too challenging to read, and are <i>engaging<\/i> which means you want to read them. Science fiction stories, mysteries, any of a number of categories of fiction meet the bill. Go to your nearest library and ask a librarian for some suggestions on things to read that have good stories. Ask for skill ranges from early reader to college level. Check them out, read them all, and make notes of the ones that were interesting, the ones that weren&#x27;t, the easy ones to read and the hard ones to read. No need to write a book report just write down &quot;Read &#x27;1001 Arabian Nights&#x27;, found it entertaining but kind of boring.&quot; or what ever your take was on the book. Since you aren&#x27;t &quot;learning&quot; from these books, just practicing your reading skill, you should not be anxious if don&#x27;t remember all of the details or even who the main characters were. Go back to the library and give your take on the books to them and ask them to help with picking out 5 or 6 more. Rinse and repeat.<p>What this does is it hones your sense of what you find &quot;fun&quot; to read. And when it&#x27;s fun, just like video games, there isn&#x27;t really a question of where does the time come from. But let&#x27;s talk about time for a minute.<p>You called out that books were a &quot;big time investment.&quot; Which is true, it is one way to invest your time. What are your other time investments? Have you done the experiment where you journal how you spend time every day for a week? Doing that will give you insight into what you are spending your time on now and give you an idea of what you are &quot;investing&quot; in. Reading will develop your vocabulary, sense of humor, conversation skills, knowledge, and mental acuity. That is what you get by investing in reading books, compare that to what you are getting out of your current investments and perhaps that will inform your choice on how much time you might spend. Also it is useful to remember that you can start and stop reading easily, carrying a book on your commute (if you aren&#x27;t driving) is an easy way to get extra value out of your time, you are both going or coming from work <i>and<\/i> you are improving your reading skills! bonus!<p>Then there is this: &quot;I always assumed that everything could be found for free online.&quot; This isn&#x27;t ever going to be true. Not the &#x27;free&#x27; or &#x27;online&#x27; part, the <i>found<\/i> part. While most information ends up online, either legally, quasi-legally, or illegally, finding it is becoming exponentially harder as various forces work to monetize, hide, or discredit it. Having worked at a search engine that indexed billions of nominally &quot;good&quot; web sites I can tell you that our experience was that 99.999% of it was crap. Finding the good stuff is really really hard and getting harder. And it moves so finding it a second time can be just as hard.<p>The bulk of the things you want to know can be found already written, in books, by someone who spent time collecting the information, verifying its veracity, writing it up, having an editor help them rewrite it for clarity and having a reference department check it for accuracy. You can check those things out at a library for free. You can buy them for small change at rummage sales and yard sales, and you can share them with others by swapping books.<p>What I&#x27;ve found as I&#x27;ve gotten older is that books for me fall into three categories, entertainment, working knowledge, and reference knowledge. I found the &quot;Dune&quot; series by Frank Herbert very entertaining and keep a copy on my book shelf. I have a copy of &quot;The Art of Electronics&quot; with post-it &quot;flags&quot; at sections I often refer to as part of my working knowledge set. And I&#x27;ve digitized (scanned into OCR&#x27;d PDF files) dozens of text books which I think of as my &quot;reference&quot; set. I use a simple search engine to look up specific things in those books.<p>Bottom line: Work with a librarian at your local library to beef up your reading skills and ability to use a library. Then use those skills to read books that make you feel happy or more useful or more knowledgeable. You may find, like I did, that reading is more fun that watching television or playing video games. Or you may not.

If you&#x27;re looking there for wisdom you&#x27;re combing the desert for a pearl.<p>&gt; Is it more true for older books?<p>The filter is that if a book is still considered good decades, centuries, or millennia after it was written, it very probably is good. Good books somtimes don&#x27;t pass this filter (these are periodically rediscovered) for various reasons. But almost no bad or low-value books pass it.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t most of the information from books freely available online?<p>Not at all. Start studying any topic past the surface level and the only way you&#x27;ll get any further &quot;online&quot; is buying or pirating ebooks. Keep digging—not even that far—and you&#x27;ll find some that do not exist in digital form, not even on Library Genesis. If you want to seriously learn about a topic, pick up a good academic book on it, then follow up on all the books they (very probably) mention in their introduction as other major works on the topic, and maybe also the books that book directly credits as references. Often this is a faster and more accurate way to learn what the expert consensus of &quot;foundational&quot; works in a topic is than trying to find that out online, let alone trying to learn the information contained in those works purely online, without books (usually impossible).<p>&gt; Am I missing out?<p>What is &quot;it&quot;?<p>&gt; One issue for me is that books are a very big time investment. I read very slowly and I don&#x27;t remember everything I read either.<p>Take notes.<p>&gt; Even if I wanted to read books, I just don&#x27;t know which ones I should start with, out of the 1000 &quot;must-read&quot; books in my reading list.<p>Stop. Pick, like, five that seem really important or that you just most want to read. Aim for variety, don&#x27;t pick five all on the same topic. Ignore the rest until you&#x27;re done. Don&#x27;t even think about them. If you&#x27;re not going to finish five there&#x27;s no damn point in maintaining and stressing out over a list of 1,000. They&#x27;ll still be there when you&#x27;ve finished your five.<p>One further note: as hinted at by the movie comparison above, reading a book is a <i>process<\/i> and that process is part of the effect of the book. The time it takes, the curation or generation of material by one author or editor or a team of same working together, the focus and intention of the creators, these matter. Reading 200 blog posts is not the same experience as reading a book, even if they mostly cover the same territory.

I grew up with books and they&#x27;ve been a constant presence in my life regardless of what I was doing. It is my personal belief that there is no substitute for good books. By books I don&#x27;t mean the paper medium, I mean long form narrative that you can absorb and revisit on your own time, it could be eBooks, paper books, audio books are a bit trickier for me but they do fit my own personal criteria mentioned above.<p>What I think you&#x27;ve been missing the most is the experience of immersing yourself in a book. The way you&#x27;ve been consuming content which is with small nuggets of information is very common today. Most people these days (regardless of age) don&#x27;t want to invest too much time into content &quot;reading&quot;, everyone want the TL;DR, the bullet lists, the KPIs, and in my opinion that this prevents many people to actually discover what is enjoyable about books.<p>You&#x27;ll seldom read a book in a single reading session (unless it is very small). If the book is good, it will resurface in your mind, you&#x27;ll ponder about it between reading sessions. You&#x27;ll not be engaged with it only when you&#x27;re reading it, you&#x27;ll be with it through the whole experience and also after it as it makes an impression in you. By being able to control how the content flows (which is not the same with a movie) you can stop to think about stuff without losing content (this is trickier with audiobooks). You can come back again over paragraphs that made an impact on you and study them to understand why. You an take notes to help you reason about stuff. Lets imagine that take you two weeks to read a book in a casual pace, all that knowledge and content will be with you. The curiosity to know more about it, to get back reading, to learn what happens. That lasts longer, it is a more involved process than consuming video. A good lenghty book might change how you think as you spend a long time with it.<p>Humans are moulded by the stories they tell and by those they&#x27;ve been told. Books in one form or another have been with us through millennia. They&#x27;ve formed us and will keep doing that in the future in whatever form they evolve to. For me, it is the different of diving deep into something and how wetting your feet in some shallow puddle.<p>Another important aspect in favour of consuming more books is that there is a chance of reading content by the original author in the original form (or something close to it), which makes it for a more intimate conversation between you and the author. Just stop and think with me for a second, a book is a conversation between you and the author across time and space. You might be reading a long gone author in their original words, getting to know their style, how they thought, what they valued. This is different than absorbing content via a third party which is telling you what they&#x27;ve thought about it, which is the case of podcasts (which I love too, they are awesome but I prefer books). Getting your content from &quot;primary sources&quot; is very different than via third, fourth or even fifth parties.<p>Even though we produce a lot of audiovisual content on the internet, it doesn&#x27;t encompasses the whole spectrum offered by books. Yes there are a gazillion videos about Sun Tzu Art of War but there is a lot of longform content that is not popular or clickbaity which doesn&#x27;t surface through the algorithms used by those social networks we tend to use to discover new stuff. Content from books trickle very slowly to the digital realm. It is like an iceberg, you get a lot of content above the water but unless you&#x27;re prepared to dive into it, you be missing a ton of stuff. Only very popular information is moved to the internet in a way that it appears easily to people browsing social networks or searching. There are many good stuff that is very hard to find online unless you really know what you&#x27;re looking for, which makes discovery of such content a bit hard.<p>I&#x27;d urge you to engage with books not because millionaires do it, but because you want to do it.

Background research\n3. Test of time\n4. Focus and grounding<p>Let me explain.<p>1. Most of the online content is &quot;designed&quot; to be consumed in &lt; 10 minutes. So, it assumes fundamentals or ignores details otherwise are critical to the topic. This is useful for quickly grasping a concept, but if you want to go deeper, books will give you better context<p>2. &quot;92% of the online content is designed to prove a point&quot;\n(Above statement is a made-up one, and I have no idea what percentage of the online content is made up)<p>A lot of content available online are valuable and accurate. At the same time, the credibility of online content is questionable, while books tend to be more research-oriented. A person has spent at least 6 months to put together a book, and multiple people spend hours to get it out.  Books tend to be more linked to the credibility of the author. Paul Graham&#x27;s essays (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;articles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;articles.html<\/a>), for example, are gems and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it is consumed as a book or a blog - it does contain valuable content.<p>3. Books age well than online content - some of the timeless classics still stay relevant in the current decade or century. More people review them, so more crowdsourced opinions. This might sound contrary to the belief, but this is something I&#x27;ve observed over time.<p>4. Most importantly, you may devour the internet for a whole day, and learn a bunch of things but the very next day, because everything was so unstructured, you&#x27;d tend to lose clarity and only a few things stick. This is more pertinent to some people than others. So, consuming or learning about new concepts systematically through a book will improve the stickiness of the ideas and be more structured while thinking about it. Books, also tend to be more detailed with more examples to put things in context, to which you can relate to. It gives you time to think and organize. Think about it as taking a structured course, rather than learning bits and pieces from here and there.<p>Now, the Pareto Principle (80&#x2F;20) does apply and reading 20% will give you general context on 80%. But more often than not, on most subjects, 20% does contain in-depth information you&#x27;ll miss out on.<p>Listing a few books I recommend, which I believe are worth reading<p>[1] The Science of the Artificial by Herbert A.

I do not believe you can learn an advanced field, say quantum physics, by just watching youtube videos or reading online articles. The reason is that many in depth knowledge are only presented in books.<p>For programming, I think yes you can definitely become a programmer by learning online.

This is still a bad scenario for spinlocks since they will still have bad interactions with scheduler (they will use a large amount of cpu time when and get evicted from the run queue and need to be rescheduled).<p>* Also, I didn&#x27;t see him pin any of the threads, so all those threads will start sharing some cpus since the OS does need to be doing some work on a them too.<p>* And Rust can be a little hard to read, but it seem he packed his locks on the same cache line? I don&#x27;t see any padding in his AmdSpinlock struct. That would be a huge blow for the spinlock because of the false sharing issues.

My stripped down compile of that library--which admittedly is dropping most of the audio&#x2F;video functionality as I only care about DataChannels, so maybe if I were doing video I&#x27;d be freaking out at the size of the stack (though I would imagine the video codecs would dominate the size, no?)--is clocking in at about 7MB, which is much larger than 200kB but nowhere near the point where I start to care: I mean, the default buffer size per channel in the library is a crazy large 16MB buffer, so I find myself not caring much about the size of my text segment ;P. (Are embedded systems really that constrained these days?)<p>One thing I have enjoyed about the C++ build is that it has tons and tons of knobs for me to mess with in the binding API... I have to reimplement the network detection and am using two separate socket implementations (which is all pretty trivial as just about everything can be subclassed and replaced), I mess with the offers and answers before handing them back&#x2F;forth through the stack (which is easy as there is an object-oriented model for all of the data structures; I mean, it isn&#x27;t a great model, but it is at least a model), I am able to easily assign work to occur on specific threads (and have been able to share a signaling thread while splitting networking threads across backends), and I at times reach into the heart of the system (without any code modifications, though with a really hilarious template trick to help me access private C++ class members) to pull up the SCTP stack internals. (Note that with only one arguable-exception we do everything we do currently without any modifications to WebRTC&#x27;s code.)<p>Is this implementation going to be better for me, in maybe having fewer layers of abstraction between me and the underlying state machines, or worse, due to trying to target &quot;embedded systems&quot; in a programming language that tends to be less flexible (and so between those two considerations maybe leading me to have less ability to customize it without having to rewrite or hack on it directly)? I ask because I know a lot of other people see C and think &quot;ah, finally this is simple&quot;, but I have not had any issues with the C++ codebase (the secret is to not even try to use Google&#x27;s build system: just take all the .cc files you need--and only the ones you need--and link them together).

Machine learning is a set of techniques to make inferences from data automatically, but there is no implicit restriction on what the inferences should be. So machine learning is not &quot;conservative&quot; — almost all popular applications of it are. There is no inherent reason why an ML-algorithm should suggest the most similar videos to the ones you watched recently. The same way you can use (say) association learning to find most common item sets, you can use it to find the least common item sets with the given item, and recommend them instead. Or anything in between. But application designers usually choose the less creative option to recommend (understandably so) stuff similar to what you already got.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s ok: if the most popular thing to ask somebody to sit on nowadays is &quot;my face&quot; it&#x27;s only logical to advice that, I see nothing wrong with this application. But many internet shops indeed could benefit from considering what a user has already bought (from this very shop), because it isn&#x27;t likely he will want to buy a second similar, but different TV anytime soon. Or, when recommending a movie, you could try to optimize for something different than &quot;the most popular stuff watched by people that watched a lot of stuff you did watch&quot; — which is a &quot;safe&quot; thing to recommend, but at the same time not really interesting. Of course, finding another sensible approach is a lot of work, but it doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one: maybe it could be &quot;a movie with unusually high score given by somebody, who also highly rated a number of movies you rated higher than the average&quot;."],"time":["2020-01-04 12:25:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ramraj07"],"id":[21953779],"kids":[21953852,21953824,21964438],"parent":[21952944],"text":["While Cory is talking about a slightly different facet of conservatism, I found it quite ironic that he made a rather conservative statement himself:<p>&gt;Nor is machine learning likely to produce a reliable method of inferring intention: it’s a bedrock of anthropology that intention is unknowable without dialogue.

They’re also good at identifying faces that are similar to the faces they know about, which is why faces that are white and male are more reliably recognized by these systems — the systems are trained by the people who made them and the people in their circles.<p>But this seems like an absurd claim. Surely it&#x27;s more likely that darker skin reflects less light than paler skin and so features are harder to detect on darker skin people. This explains why facial recognition works better on white people than on black people. Likewise women are more likely to wear makeup than men are and therefore are more likely to have a visually different face which could cause problems for facial recognition.<p>To assume that dark skinned people aren&#x27;t involved in creating or testing facial recognition, or that women aren&#x27;t, seems bizarre and vaguely racist&#x2F;sexist.

Imagine you value that at $500, so including the $55 ticket, that&#x27;s a $555 experience, the reason you wouldn&#x27;t have bought a $500 ticket is that it would have made it a $1000+ experience.<p>And here you see why refusing the $500 proposal is not necessarily a mistake. The guy is offering you $500 for a $555 experience.<p>So yeah, good to know about the sunk costs fallacy, but I believe it is also important to understand why that &quot;fallacy&quot; exists, and how to properly evaluate costs, even those without a clear price tag attached to it."],"time":["2020-01-04 22:22:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["egypturnash"],"id":[21962770],"kids":{},"parent":[21956321],"text":["&quot;Spend $250 on dinner and go buy better tickets for tomorrow night’s show.&quot;<p>Which you would probably have to spend another four hours looking for, <i>if<\/i> you could find any at all; Bruce is probably in town for a couple of days at most and tomorrow&#x27;s show is most likely sold out.

Speaking as a black man in Africa which is somewhat different to the US I do agree with the title. Africa is different because the first educated generation is my parents generation who are 70+. Off course they are exceptions. My parents who were teachers coming from pure village setup didn&#x27;t have any mentors. No one explained mortgage to them, they learnt that in school but no uncle, grandparent, cousin or anyone in their circle had ever had a mortgage. It was a new world to them. That generation did well. They lived the village principles, spent a lot of money educating whole villages and taking care of everyone because they the ones who worked. My parents couldn&#x27;t teach me about money, they don&#x27;t understand that debt is okay as long as you have a plan to pay it back. In their mind it is a bad idea. I have thus grown up risk averse and it took a long long time to understand how the business world works. Its fine though because you cannot learn these things in one generation.

Rhodes tells of Oppenheimer completely dominating meetings in early efforts that resulted in the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission (which became the US Department of Energy), essentially writing national policy recommendations on his own.<p>Oppenheimer realized the dangers of nuclear proliferation and detente early on, and wanted the world to own atomic energy as a force for good. He wanted an international organization (what became the IAEA) to control atomic energy and not let the US and UK have a monopoly on it. Oppenheimer also recommended against developing the hydrogen bomb, which he thought would dangerously escalate the destructive power of nuclear arms. This opposition ultimately led to Oppeheimer&#x27;s trial that cost him his security clearance.<p>But it was his extensive writings on what the future of atomic energy could be that I think set him apart in this years.

The signal from the antenna was then sent through an amplifier and cable down a tunnel into the Soviet sector. The transmission from the typewriter consisted of a compressed burst-mode signal hidden in the side-bands of near-by television transmissions, making it virtually impossible to detect using normal bug detecting equipment.

We’ll need computer scientists working with cancer scientists, for example, to identify specific genetic markers that could lead to a cure. To do this, we’ll need to learn how to go slower to have a greater impact.<p>This &quot;working with, across domains&quot; mantra underlies the entire article. It&#x27;s called transdisciplinarity — if not of individuals, of teams.<p>Guess what. That&#x27;s how we&#x27;ve done <i>any sector<\/i> for the longest of times. You start with self-made specialists, they grow the field, which then touches other fields, and before you know it, a &quot;normal&quot; business has several functions: accounting, sales, legal, marketing, production, etc.<p>Tech is new, and tech is geeky — the greatest among us estimate that no more than 1~5% of the population has enough interest to enter and remain in the field.<p>Transdisciplinarity is usually a major key to unlock hard problems, indeed. As more and more engineers enter the tech field coming from previous careers, armed with domain knowledge, the quality and &quot;relevance&quot; of tech features improves, no doubt about it — I think music and the arts in general, observed over the last 50 years or so, is a strong illustration of that.<p>&gt; These new technologies are far too complex for anyone to develop on their own. That’s why we can expect the basis of competition to shift away from design sprints, iterating, and pivoting to building meaningful relationships in order to solve grand challenges.<p>This literally confuses goals with methods. Agile never told you what to do or why you do it, it&#x27;s just a &quot;small method for small teams to work better&#x2F;faster, to manage complexity&quot;. Grand challenges don&#x27;t get automagically solved because they&#x27;re big and involve many people from many fields.<p>The &quot;far too complex for anyone to develop on their own&quot; part is more telling of a philosophical bias: we tend to either see the world as &quot;too complicated to be explained&quot; (as the HR author) or &quot;too simple to be worth wasting time to intellectualize it&quot; (this is the general entrepreunarial mindset, to go at things from action even if it&#x27;s not entirely clear mentally; the opposite mindset, which is mine, is more of a research ethos, an observer &#x2F; thinker.)<p>Transdisciplinarity is also not a new thing. It&#x27;s just the latest trend to kick in on the road to progress, it&#x27;s a pendulum from hyper-specialization (high verticals) to holistic solutions (big horizontals).<p>Consider philosophy, human beings sprouting ideas, software engineering for the mind. An idea appears somewhere, in a group, in some space-time. It starts localized, vertical.

However, those keyswitches are quite heavy by modern standards and you may find your fingers getting tired.  The layout is also not amazing, and the controller doesn&#x27;t lend itself to much customizability.<p>If you work in an environment where loud keys are acceptable, you should try the Kailh&#x2F;Novelkeys &quot;thick clicks&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;novelkeys.xyz&#x2F;products&#x2F;novelkeys-x-kailh-box-thick-clicks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;novelkeys.xyz&#x2F;products&#x2F;novelkeys-x-kailh-box-thick-c...<\/a>  The sound and tactility on these switches is incredible.<p>I think a lot of people that are interested in mechanical keyboards think the only options available are Cherry Browns, Cherry Blues, Topre, and buckling springs... but the reality is that that is the tip of the iceberg.  The new designs in the Cherry form factor are much better than anything Cherry makes or has ever made; so if you&#x27;ve tried those and didn&#x27;t like them (I found them distractingly scratchy and not very tactile; apparently a common complaint), there are a lot of other options before you have to go to a finger-killing model M.<p>I currently use an Ergodox EZ with Thick Clicks (Jade on the pinky keys, Navy on everything else) and love it.  It is the most tactile keyboard I have ever used, and the sound is amazing.  I also have an Ergodox EZ with Healios (silent linear) switches and love those too.  They are the smoothest and quietest switches I have ever touched; it is almost distracting how smooth and silent they are.<p>Anyway, there is a lot of good stuff out there and a lot of keyboards support swapping switches without soldering now, so you can try them all.  I think most people will like a non-model-M board, simply because we can do so much better now.  If you&#x27;ve ever used Cherry switches and said &quot;this is terrible&quot; and though that a model M was your only option for tactility; that&#x27;s just not the case anymore.  There are hundreds of switches between Cherry Brown and buckling spring now; one of them is likely to be &quot;your thing&quot;.<p>Some switches I&#x27;ve used recently:<p>- Hako True - these were designed to feel like Topre switches, but they don&#x27;t feel like Topre switches.  They feel linear and get very heavy before activation, so they don&#x27;t feel good to type on to me.  It just feels like compressing a spring and maybe your key will be typed if you&#x27;re lucky.<p>- Novelkeys Box Royal - these are very tactile, but you can very strongly feel the activation point and they feel like they want to get stuck there on the way up.  I used these as pinky keys for about a year and they just got scratchier and scratchier until I felt the need to replace them.  (Lube is probably the correct fix, but I am too lazy to lube keyswitches.)  They are quite tactile, though.  Interesting design, worth a try.<p>- Hako Royal Clear - these are heavier Box Royals, I think, and I used them for about a year as the non-pinky keys on the board with Box Royals.  Pretty tactile, but you can definitely feel some clickiness at the activation point on the way up.  They are not particularly quiet, but are a good switch to try out.<p>- Novelkeys Thick Clicks - very very very tactile, maybe the most tactile switch I&#x27;ve ever used.  Super loud.  The Jades really do require you to remove all force from the key to come back up; I notice this but it doesn&#x27;t bother me in any way.  My favorite switch family by far, if you can live with the noise.  It&#x27;s not &quot;oh I can hear someone typing&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;there is an earthquake nearby we&#x27;re all going to die&quot; loud.  Similar to buckling springs, but not as heavy.  Still on the heavy side, though, so if you like really light switches, they are not for you.  (If you like light switches, I think you are basically dead with respect to tactile or clickiness, though; the tactile bump is always going to be heavy.)<p>- Healios - smoothest mechanism ever.  Touching them makes you think they are exuding quality.  Silent on bottom-out and upstroke.  Nobody will know you&#x27;re using a mechanical keyboard.  They are perfect for gaming, and pretty good for typing.  (I&#x27;m using them right now.)  They are very very light even though they are sold as 67g switches.  I had avoided linear switches because I thought I needed the tactility to avoid bottoming out, but I was wrong.  Worth a look.<p>There are also some good switches I haven&#x27;t personally used; namely the Zilents.<p>Anyway, my point is that you don&#x27;t need to go full model M to get good keyswitches.  There are better boards and good switches around.  Get a board with &quot;hot-swappable&quot; switches and try some out, it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ll be able to build the perfect keyboard.  You won&#x27;t be stuck with a standard layout as you are with Realforce or Model M boards, and you&#x27;ll be able to use a firmware like QMK to get a perfect layout.

I used one of these for years at my first &quot;real job&quot; and loved it, but <i>wow<\/i> is it noisy.<p>In the 90s, my dad and I built custom (higher-end) PCs for small businesses and individuals.  We carefully weeded out parts that we didn&#x27;t like and put a high priority on excellent displays[1], good keyboards and mice[2].  To this day, I&#x27;m surprised at how little thought is paid to such a critical input device.  And it&#x27;s not that users don&#x27;t care about it, it&#x27;s almost like it was forgotten.<p>My personal preference, in this category, though was the Northgate Omnikey[0].  It was a multi-platform keyboard that was able to be plugged in to an AT&#x2F;XT, Amiga and a few others.  The model I had was left-oriented F-keys (I miss that!) and included extra keys and tools so that you could put the CTRL where &quot;Caps Lock&quot; was, and &quot;alt&quot; where the left CTRL was, which was how we configured them ... no more accidental CAPS LOCK hits when aiming for &quot;A&quot;.  Unfortunately, my parents sold it in an estate sale a while back.  I doubt they got anywhere near the $100-$200 that these sell for when functional (depending on condition ... most are <i>very<\/i> yellow due to the plastic oxidizing but you can still find some that maintain their gray-white&#x2F;blue color).  Pretty rare to find a keyboard that resells for about the price they were new (sans inflation).<p>I&#x27;d put the IBM at a very close second.  The Northgate was easily on par as far as &quot;feel&quot; was concerned, but the IBM keyboards had this <i>loud<\/i> &quot;ping&quot; sound that sort-of rang after a key was pressed (springs), which the Omnikey lacked.  I couldn&#x27;t own a keyboard like that if I wanted to continue programming since, at the time, most of my programming[4] was done between midnight and 3:00 AM with fleeting parental approval (fleeting ... if I woke them up).<p>I feel that keyboard quality is something that manufacturers have missed the ball on -- especially on notebooks.  This Christmas I picked out a Thinkpad for my parents.  They love it.  My Dad now wants a new desktop keyboard, though, because he <i>really likes<\/i> the Thinkpad keyboard.  I was a little puzzled -- his current board feels <i>exactly the same<\/i> to my fingers.  After thinking about it for a bit, I&#x27;m fairly certain I know where the problem is: despite the same feel, his desktop keyboard weighs almost nothing.  Every time you touch a key, or even reach out for it, it slides a little.  So every few sentences, you&#x27;re re-positioning the keyboard.  At my typing speed, this means repositioning the keyboard <i>constantly<\/i>.<p>It makes me wonder if in all of this effort to make things lighter and more portable, the industry miscalculated by applying that logic to peripheral keyboards.  I&#x27;d prefer my keyboard to weight twice as much as my current laptop.  To me, I&#x27;d rather have a keyboard heavier than a notebook PC.  Between the two I use most regularly, one is wired, the other is wireless, both would move with a reasonable gust of wind.  Why do I care if it&#x27;s convenient to carry when it <i>never leaves my desktop<\/i>?  There&#x27;s much greater value is in it staying put while I use it.  At my office, several developers I work with have purchased their own keyboards.  Some of it is &quot;cool factor&quot;, but one thing I found consistently about the boards they&#x27;ve chosen -- <i>All<\/i> of them weigh in at 3 times the weight of the typical $15 board and most have sticky rubber feet.  About half hadn&#x27;t realized the difference until I pointed it out.  I even had one co-worker that got upset at the realization -- he&#x27;d narrowed the choice down to 2 keyboards and opted for the lighter one.  I made him unhappy with his decision.

A steerable mirror on a mount with a camera for targeting. The idea was to place one on the ground outside a north facing window. The device would then busy itself reflecting the sun up into the room making a nice sunny patch on the ceiling to light the room. They could also be used to deliver extra light to windows with plants in them to grow plants which require more light than is available or to modulate the daily light to fake a different season.<p>Sitting in 2020 the technology is near trivial. The problem is that some knucklehead would point a bunch of them at the same window and set curtains and pigeons on fire. (You’d do this because you had a large room with few windows, so dispersed mirrors would give you multiple dispersed lighting spots in the room… and incinerated pigeons.)<p>I was unable to make the leap to what happens if you are a deliberate and well reasoned knucklehead! In a controlled situation a megawatt of light might be just the thing.<p>Addendum: The mass field of mirrors introduces a <i>lot<\/i> more work. Some of the immediately interesting problems:<p>• you need a “everyone stop shining at the target” mode for emergency stop, but the mirrors need to move away from the target in such a way that they don’t create convergences elsewhere. Obviously sweeping your portal to hell down the tower would be a bad idea. So you have a collection of autonomous, free thinking mirrors, but when commanded to stop hitting the target they need to not make the same decisions.<p>• your camera probably needs to be able to stare into the heart of a thousand suns (literally). But it also needs to see in ordinary daylight.
