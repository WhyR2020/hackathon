When you write out a mathematical equation, you don&#x27;t explicitly specify if the variable is a float or an integer or a set or a vector or a matrix as part of the equation, the reader will infer the type of each variable from the problem domain. So in fact, math is much more like dynamically typed languages.<p>&gt;&gt; We know types help us eliminate certain classes of errors from programs.<p>Yes and in my experience they often also introduce new kinds of errors, architectural errors (which are much worse). If you have a system which makes it easier for developers to pass around complex instances across multiple source files, they will use that feature and it will often lead to modules which have lower cohesion and tighter coupling which adds complexity and makes it harder to modify and maintain the logic in the long run. Rigid type systems also add complexity when integrating with third party modules which may use different type names for similar concepts.<p>The wisdom of dynamically typed languages is precisely that it is difficult to know what the type of each variable is so it forces you to follow the logic around (which is unpleasant but necessary). What is almost always overlooked is the human psychological effect; this unpleasantness involved in trying to keep a mental picture of the logic creates a strong incentive for developers to keep the logic as simple, modular&#x2F;encapsulated as possible. This results in better software design&#x2F;architecture overall.<p>I&#x27;m saying this based on decades of experience having gone back and forth between dynamically and statically typed languages. Programming is as much about human psychology as it is about logic. Dynamically typed languages force developers to be more disciplined and this mindset is extremely valuable.<p>Statically typed languages tend to put developers on auto-pilot. You get so caught up on types and catering to the compiler&#x27;s warnings that you lose some common sense. Coding in a statically typed language feels a bit like having a boss who micromanages you and tells you every little detail that you need to implement. Coding in a dynamically typed language is more like having a boss which tells you the general picture of what is required and lets you figure out the details.<p>I think the mindset of self-reliance which comes with dynamically typed languages is very important when it comes to producing high quality code."],"time":["2019-12-28 20:40:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["azhenley"],"id":[21900114],"kids":[21900531],"parent":[21898309],"text":["Anyone know who wrote this?"],"time":["2019-12-28 18:16:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wellpast"],"id":[21901309],"kids":[21901851,21901692,21901632,21902733,21901572],"parent":[21898309],"text":["I&#x27;m forever baffled by the complete inability of our industry to see time or care about seeing that our most precious resource is time.<p>One thing is true: if you&#x27;re not proving correctness of your code -- formally or informally -- then you are living in entropy and at very high risk of inefficiently delivering value through software. Knowing how to call &quot;correct&quot; on code is paramount.<p>And also -- yes, static type systems allow for (partial) machine verification of these proofs.<p>The missing piece is the innate -- and immense -- cost in having to express these proofs formally in a machine-checkable way.<p>Static type enthusiasts typically downplay these costs but they are simply wrong. I am not talking about the cost of <i>learning<\/i> how to code in a statically typed system--that should never be factored in. I am talking about the innate costs of formal verification (and strong static typing) that even the expert static typers pay. I have seen these guys work and they are delivering sub-optimally in time compared to the alternatives. Period.<p>I have been around the block with both static and dynamic typing systems and the latter by far optimizes for delivery throughput over time.<p>Formally proving correctness of your program has the upfront cost of formalizing the proof (to the degree required by the verification system) as well has having the effect of crystallizing your code in its current representation which makes it more difficult to (re-)factor for future uses.<p>Some of the (more reasonable) strong static type enthusiasts will concede that this kind of machine&#x2F;type-proving is better done when the domain and code stabilizes. My hats off to these people for at least being honest about things.<p>However the next realization is that once code and domain stabilize the need&#x2F;value for machine proving correctness (in typical business&#x2F;data applications) drops substantially (for obvious reasons).<p>So the pragmatic value of strong type systems and formal verification is far lower than the proponents will have you believe.

Haskell and variants are on the rise in popularity; but make no mistake, if you are optimizing for overall delivery throughput over time -- even experts are swimming upstream with these languages.<p>Of course every time I point this out on HN I get downvoted -- but it kills me to think that a next generation of programmers are being misled down a path of formal purity with misrepresentative claims about the cost of using these tools in real business applications.<p>Just to dispel any idea that what I&#x27;m saying is philistinic, I am a mathematician&#x2F;academic first, enjoy category theory, have written more than my share of academic proofs (including novel results), and think these tools are immensely fascinating.<p>But having been in industry now for 20+ years shipping web-scale and distributed data systems for business industries (what 90+% of us are doing, I imagine), where time is the most precious resource, I know with certainty that leaning on formal verification techniques  (including strong static type systems) is an enormous tax compared to the alternative. That these tools work against fast-paced, iterative development.<p>It has also become evident to me that there is a vanguard of static type enthusiast who are not admitting (or perhaps do not understand) the relative cost of the pursuit. Who will point to a few null pointer errors  (that, mind you, could be eliminated or reduced by other defensive coding techniques besides formal proofs) and use these to justify the herculean cost of their formal system.<p>If you&#x27;re a junior or on the fence about static type systems - at least code in a weakly typed PL in which you can lean in one way or the other. If business outcome&#x2F;throughput is what you value first and foremost, I guarantee you will gravitate more and more toward dynamic evaluation - especially as you realize the world of real business delivery produces constantly changing requirements and carrying out delivery in the face of purist formal modeling and proofs will be a substantial drag on what you can do for little relative benefit downtream."],"time":["2019-12-28 20:56:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fny"],"id":[21901378],"kids":{},"parent":[21898309],"text":["Isn&#x27;t there a Turing reduction that violates any guarantees?<p><pre><code>    def square(x):\n      maybe_terminate()\n      x*x<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2019-12-28 21:04:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21901358],"kids":{},"parent":[21898309],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-28 21:02:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["Koshkin"],"id":[21901221],"kids":{},"parent":[21898309],"text":["The thing is, the modern notion of what constitutes a type is &#x27;class&#x27;.

In the end, it was considered too complex and expensive to produce. The design never went beyond mock-up test.<p>The Silbervogel was intended to fly long distances in a series of short hops. The aircraft was to have begun its mission propelled along a 3 km (2 mi) long rail track by a large rocket-powered sled to about 1,930 km&#x2F;h (1,200 mph). Once airborne, it was to fire its own rocket engine and continue to climb to an altitude of 145 km (90 mi), at which point it would be travelling at about 21,800 km&#x2F;h (13,500 mph). It would then gradually descend into the stratosphere, where the increasing air density would generate lift against the flat underside of the aircraft, eventually causing it to &quot;bounce&quot; and gain altitude again, where this pattern would be repeated. Because of aerodynamic drag, each bounce would be shallower than the preceding one, but it was still calculated that the Silbervogel would be able to cross the Atlantic, deliver a 4,000 kg (8,800 lb) bomb to the continental United States&quot;"],"time":["2019-12-28 19:08:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chriselles"],"id":[21901197],"kids":{},"parent":[21898876],"text":["I tend to think the likely explanation of Russian hypersonic weapons is akin to commercial sector marketing of AI, all too often hype over substance.<p>Russia is simply unable to conventionally compete economically and militarily with the US.<p>So in order to buttress domestic and international support for Russia’s Putin regime, the result is hypersonic information operations.<p>Unlike conventional precision guided weapons for tactical use, hypersonic missiles are strategic and nuclear in focus.<p>So not as likely to be exposed as vapourware in operational use.<p>So a likely area for empty chest puffing and peacocking.<p>Empty theatrics is a real possibility.<p>Russia is not likely to share hypersonic missile telemetry.<p>Nor is the US DOD and industry, as keeping quiet allows for opportunity to seek addition funding to counter hollow capability."],"time":["2019-12-28 20:40:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevespang"],"id":[21901289],"kids":{},"parent":[21898876],"text":["This sort of development is what will encourage the US military industrial empire to shake us down for a new Star Wars satellite laser system and to continue to expand nuclear submarines, perhaps not as a first strike, but as a viable counterstrike weapon."],"time":["2019-12-28 20:54:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["qwerty456127"],"id":[21899729],"kids":[21899910,21900292],"parent":[21898876],"text":["I wouldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s anything close to operational and reliable.

Gasoline is taxed at ~70%, cars are taxed at 68% (50% + 18% VAT). A domestic car will probably avoid the 50% on purchase and a domestic electric car will entirely avoid taxes on gas. Taxes make this a good deal at almost any price the average Turkish consumer can buy.<p>- With the current very low, out of whack exchange rate (1USD:6TRY) this will also become competitive in at least Southern European markets fairly fast as well.<p>- Since this is government sponsored they can also do a fairly fast rollout of electric charging stations by offering generous incentives. If that doesn’t work, they have the eminent domain hammer, and they will definitely just build it themselves as part of the electric service.<p>- This also avoids the heavy industry required to build ICE cars, which has environmental costs. That cause is becoming popular with the electorate as well, exemplified in the stiff backlash against the country’s first nuclear reactor.<p>- Lastly, Turkey has been building cars for the past 35 years and it’s gotten pretty good at it - many of the entry to mid level marques of European conglomerates are built in Turkish factories.

Modern displays have different contrast ratios from CRTs. Generally, fine details used to look softer on CRTs. So, when flat displays were introduced, bevels didn&#x27;t look right, Apple got rid of realistic icons (formerly introduced in OS X), etc. On the other hand, extensive regions of flat color where always a bit of a problem on CRTs (too bright, maybe there were some artefacts from some interference – who remembers the stripes caused by a cell phone placed next to a CRT?), but rendered impressively on flat screens. Meaning, the old UIs didn&#x27;t work like they used to be on the new technology, while the new displays provided for a few things which had always been a bit problematic on the old ones. Enter double resolution displays and the necessity to render the same content on varying resolutions. Flat design and parametric scaling seems to be the answer. However, there&#x27;s now a limited range of ways to add unobtrusive visual clues and of compartmentalisation&#x2F;grouping as compared to the old visual vocabulary. Moreover, with the old vocabulary, a single element could have multiple visual clues attached to it (e.g., a bevel indicated a button, the icon and its color a task and a category, an underline in the associated text a shortcut key, etc), while now a single element can have just a single clue added to it for the most.

(I remember a conversation with Seymour Cray about the difficulty of handling machine state during an interrupt on such an architecture.) The C programming language didn’t come along until almost 10 years later.<p>As the article says, C is a good fit to the architecture of the PDP-11, mini-computer very different that the mainframes of the time. There were many competing visions for what a “high-level” programming language ought to look like back then, Pascal (1970), LISP (pre-1960), Prolog (1972), FORTRAN (pre-1960), COBOL (pre-1960), Smalltalk (1972), Forth (1970), APL (1966), Algol (pre-1960), Jovial (pre-1960), PL&#x2F;1 (1964), CLU (1974). As a professional developer and CS grad student during this period we were well aware of these alternatives. Many of these had escape hatches to gain low level access to the machines that they ran on and libraries were customarily written in assembly language. C came along during this period. It wasn’t my favorite—the whole pointer&#x2F;array punning seemed unnecessary to me.<p>Why did C prevail? Was it because it was low-level? No, there were other well established languages capable of low level work. I recall, a few reasons: Unix, DEC’s PDP-11, and Yourdon.<p>First Unix was amazing and C was the favored language on Unix. Just being able to type man on a TTY or VDT and see the man page for a command was so novel. Unix OS and commands were written in C.<p>Second, the PDP-11 was a very popular good machine and Unix ran on the PDP-11. Unix on a PDP-11 was a lot more fun than dropping off decks of punch cards to run on an IBM 360 or CDC mainframe.<p>Edward Yourdon was an influential American software consultant, author and lecturer. He had picked C over Pascal and other languages as a “practical” general purpose high level language to recommend.<p>Meanwhile, hardware was was not at all a monoculture; even though the PDP-11 was a comercial success, it was a simple machine and just a mini-computer. There were many attempts at alternative architectures. Harvard memory architecture machines, capability based addressing, programmable wide-microcode, LISP machines, RISC systems. I’ve programmed or designed systems for most of these.<p>So why did the x86 become one of the dominant architectures? \nIt was because of the power of mass production of integrated circuits.

The actual point of the article is to push the view that the x86 ISA, which according to him, is structured the way it is due purely to the desire to make the massive amount of existing C code run faster. His argument is essentially that ‘low-level’ programmers are not delusional, but are purposely being deluded by chip manufacturers. C, and x86 assembly, according to The article are not low level because they have only a passing relevance to the actual architecture of modern CPUs. Chisnall then goes on to argue that a low level language would require an ISA that presents a clearer picture of the actual architecture and would be geared for performance given the actual functionality of the CPU. He then bats around several features that could be a part of an ISA for a multi core, hierarchical memory, pipelined chip. His references to alternate memory models, changes in register structure and amount, a push for immutability and other features to adapt the ISA to reflect what would constitute actual performant code.<p>I’m all for his vision, it seems like there could be an x86 ISA translation layer or a portion of cores dedicated to maintaining X86 compatibility l, while transitioning to a new ISA.

It works tremendously well in the short-term, but it’s deceptive. The tissue loss is mostly fat, which looks great, but there is definitely some muscle loss, which is an order of magnitude harder to gain back, so the long-term effect is muscle wasting and fat rebound as caloric demands drop. It’s easy to see in my photos. Later I did OMAD several times for stretches of about a year with roughly similar short and long-term effects. Recently I completed a 100-hour fast.<p>There are a few basic issues. First, with IF you’re not really fasting as long as you think you are. Small intestines take about 6 hours, and the colon turns fIber into MCTs for days. Second, the insulin surge becomes preferential to fatty acid storage over muscle glycogen. Third, you lose the ghrelin-induced GH that releases fatty acids throughout the day to feed the muscles. There may be autophagy benefits, but that may be as true for satellite cells as it is for cancer, and maybe more so because cancer usually originates in fatty tissues with lots of energy nearby.<p>At this point, by experience and by science, I don’t think IF is the best diet protocol if you have the discipline for a more continuous protocol.

We hypothesized that ITAD feeding will provide two intervals of intermeal fasting per circadian period and induce autophagy. We show that ITAD feeding modifies circadian autophagy and glucose&#x2F;lipid metabolism that correlate with feeding-driven changes in circulating insulin. ITAD feeding decreases adiposity and, unlike CR, enhances muscle mass. ITAD feeding drives energy expenditure, lowers lipid levels, suppresses gluconeogenesis, and prevents age&#x2F;obesity-associated metabolic defects.

Let&#x27;s take Germany as I&#x27;m most familiar with its rules and because that&#x27;s where Common Voice is headquartered. Minimum wage here will be €9.35 &#x2F; hr starting on Jan 1st. Let&#x27;s say you pay them €11. There are various Arbeitgeberanteile which you have to pay as well. Let&#x27;s say your per-employee expense would amount to €15&#x2F;hour. Let&#x27;s assume you can verify and record at 70% efficiency and you use two people to verify. Then you need to expend 4.29 employee-hours per final result hour.<p>You couldn&#x27;t just get German at this rate: Berlin is one of the towns with the largest language diversities in Germany.<p>This would give you a price of €64.35 per result hour. You&#x27;d have to pay €64k for 1000 hours of validated training data, and 128k for the 2 thousand hour figure of currently achieved data.<p>These €128k are probably on the same order of magnitude that Mozilla pays for the project (employee time to design, build, and run it), and if the project scales it will look even better. From a business POV, going open source was thus a great idea.<p>To put the 2000 hours into comparison, the deepspeech 2 paper [1] used 10k hour datasets (per language, while the 2k hours are distributed amongst multiple languages) [1]. Record holder is probably Amazon with 1 million hours (although it&#x27;s unlabeled) [2].<p>It&#x27;s possible though that future breakthroughs will remove the need for tons of training data.

The idea was to compile a vaguely C-like toy language to WASM without any external dependencies.<p>Part of the motivation was that while I&#x27;ve written many simple parsers, I mostly used parser generators with BNF grammars and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a good sense of how the code I ended up generating actually worked for something with complex syntax and semantics. I felt like I was writing specs for a parser, rather than writing a parser. And I didn&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience with code generation.<p>My toy language has vaguely C-like syntax with block scope and infix operators with various precedences, so it was a bit more complicated than JSON, but I ended up using something like Pratt parsing&#x2F;Precedence Climbing (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;31.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;31.html<\/a>) and wrote the whole thing in a way that&#x27;s - hopefully - pretty easy to read for folks interested in wrapping their head around parsing complex syntax (e.g. with scope and name resolution). The lexer, parser and language definition ended up being about 1000 lines of JS (counting some pretty extensive comments).<p>Code generation is pretty straightforward once you have an AST.<p>Any JS programmers that are interested in really getting into the nitty-gritty of writing your own parser&#x2F;compiler should check it out.

My ideal would have the following:<p>1. Even line thickness within each character (this matches the icon style).<p>2. This is a tough one: looks good with the same line thickness at different font sizes (i.e. if you increase font size, you decrease font weight). This allows you to match the line thickness of your icons with the same font at different font sizes. I&#x27;m not opposed to using a variety of fonts for different sizes, but that of course means I have to find different fonts that fit my criteria.<p>3. Serif. This significantly improves character differentiation in my experience.

I picked my travel destinations based on the wind and availability of equipment at the destination. My friends had sprinter vans and dedicated trailers for all their boards&#x2F;sails&#x2F;masts&#x2F;booms. The downside was the equipment was heavy and all dead weight. It was extremely difficult to travel (boards wouldnt fit in rental car) and even getting equipment to the waters edge sucked.<p>And then I started to see guys show up in priuses with  tiny boards and kites in backpacks.  They could rig up in about 10 minutes and it was so easy to carry everything to the water. The boards&#x2F;kites were so small they could fly as checked baggage at no extra charge, this opened up all the destinations with wind, but no equipment at the destination.<p>I was in the philippines on a windsurfing vacation, but the wind was too light for the size sails they had. The kitesurfers were all out on huge kites, so I took a lesson and was blown away by how comfortable it was. Instead of a giant unwieldy sail, the kite flew itself and weighed nothing.

I hate it. At its worst, it is painful and unpleasant. At its best, it is boring. I am fortunate to be able to eat anything I want and not gain weight (even when I don&#x27;t exercise). It seems to be the case that I can eat any amount of carbs and not gain weight. But I don&#x27;t eat crap, and I gave up soft drinks completely a long time ago (before I started exercising).<p>The secret for me was to recognize a few things:<p>- I do hate exercise. I don&#x27;t have the willpower to exercise hard for an hour a day. It works best for me if I have someone telling me what to do. So over the years, I have tried various forms of group exercise. I am currently doing crossfit, (minus the cult aspects, thanks but no thanks) 3 days a week, and working with a personal trainer 2 days a week (basically an exhausting form of physical therapy to address problems with the ways that I move, and my lack of mobility).<p>- Making exercise a priority doesn&#x27;t work for someone like me, because  I hate it so much. No, I made it a habit, which is different. It&#x27;s a regular thing on my schedule.<p>- It does make me feel better. Not when I do it. Immediately after exercising, all I feel is relief that it&#x27;s over for the day. But if I stick to my 5x&#x2F;week schedule, 1 hour&#x2F;day, then my aches and pains -- charateristic for my age -- disappear. No more aching knees or frequent upper back pain. If I stop for a couple of weeks, these problems return and I generally feel less energetic.<p>- The battle is psychological. The worst thing is getting myself to the gym. I wait until the very last minute, and dread it for the whole short drive. The anticipation before the workout sucks. The warmup is the absolute worst, because I am transitioning from my normal lazy, comfortable mode, to a far more active mode, doing completely unnatural (for me) things. Doing the workout is mostly boring, often exhausting, but mentally easier that the buildup.<p>Figure out what works for you and make it a habit."],"time":["2019-12-27 02:40:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["exabrial"],"id":[21888069],"kids":[21888127,21888211,21889084,21888199,21888908,21888241,21888289,21889688,21890870,21889604,21888885],"parent":[21887538],"text":["I used to not enjoy it too until I found something I genuinely was good at and was competitive: an indoor rowing studio.

And exhausting. And not enjoyable. I did biking for awhile, and it was fine until life happened and I fell off the wagon. Same with lifting. Same with running. The only thing I&#x27;ve truly enjoyed was rock climbing, but the nearest gym is 45mim away in low traffic - it&#x27;s a 3 hour commitment to get a good session.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the advice from this thread before, to find excercise you enjoy or excercise you can integrate into your life (ie: run to work). I work from home. Everything out of the house is inconvenient, and everything in the house is boring.<p>I make plenty of money and would be exceptionally happy if I could just throw money at this problem. There&#x27;s not really a price I wouldn&#x27;t pay for a more durable and comfortable body.<p>Mostly in the past Ive been told I need to... just do it. Have the willpower to do it.

Alas, he is still suffering under the misconception that cardio works for weight loss&#x2F;fat loss.  All the published research shows this never happens.  Here is a summary of that research[0].  The research always shows that humans who expend extra calories during one activity will, over the course of the rest of the day, expend fewer calories to, on average, expend essentially the same amount of energy as those who did not engage in the strenuous activity.  Women who train for their first marathon gain, on average, 2-3 lbs of fat, even though they have expended tens of thousands of extra calories during their marathon training.  Cardio has its uses in fitness, just not for losing fat.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jHOeoGMiFz8?t=270\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jHOeoGMiFz8?t=270<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-27 02:31:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tmarsden"],"id":[21888235],"kids":[21888250],"parent":[21887538],"text":["You’re not going to get an endorphin rush from walking for 20 minutes.

It&#x27;s foundationally true, of course, because energy is conserved, and we use all of the calories that we eat, with few exceptions, either for energy or for fat storage.<p>But exercise really helps. It changes what you want to eat first of all. Fat loss can be grueling or easy, depending on where your body wants to be, and exercise pushes it to the easier side.<p>Some of the non-calorie burning exercises have the biggest effects here. Weightlifting is almost pointless from a calorie perspective, but it really energizes weight loss. I assume that the hormonal effects are king.<p>Biking colossal distances is another thing that seems to lead to leaning out. In theory it should be possible just to eat through the calories burned biking, but in practice, it seems to shift the bias towards losing.<p>Also, the biggest problem with calories-in calories-out is that weight regain after a calorie deficit period -- even a long one -- seems to be almost a law of nature. The body seems to push extremely hard for regaining everything that has been starved off."],"time":["2019-12-27 02:32:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
