Ventilators are failing at a shockingly high rate, with a death rate up around 80% or so.

When one looks at Epocrates (database for drugs which is why I&#x27;m not linking anything here) the severe adverse reactions of hydroxycholoroquine include QT prolongation, cardiomyopathy, and torsade de pointes. Just to define some things here, QT prolongation is the time from your Q wave to your T wave, or the start of an electrical depolarization on your cardiac ventricles to repolarizations. QT elongation usually leads to cardiac arrest. Torsade de pointes is a syndrome where your cardiac ventricles beat so quickly that your heart paradoxically cannot fill up with blood potentially, and usually, leading to sudden cardiac death.<p>Giving someone who has had essentially a heart attack (by definition COVID patients have elevated troponin which is the marker we use to assess if one has had a heart attack) is probably a bad idea so my question is: why would we celebrate a drug that has massive cardiac adverse effects as a side effect? Don&#x27;t get me wrong I understand that there are drugs that are even worse. Cyclosporine is the first line immunosuppresant for kidney transplant. Do you know what one of the most common adverse effects of cyclosporine is? Kidney failure. But we don&#x27;t know what is causing the kidney failure in a kidney transplant (rejection vs adverse effect) so we have to biopsy. Kidney biopsy is a very invasive procedure, FYI. My point is, maybe waiting for double blind placebo research here is the best case. Also, I made this exact same point on here a month ago and people told that they would take my dose if it came to that and at this point I will say go ahead.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;32169400\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;32169400<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2004500\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2004500<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ahajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1161&#x2F;CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046941\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ahajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1161&#x2F;CIRCULATIONAHA.120.0...<\/a>\n[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamacardiology&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2763524\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamacardiology&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-15 18:44:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jonplackett"],"id":[22881096],"kids":{},"parent":[22879361],"text":["Why is it taking so long to do a big study on this?<p>There are so many sick people and it’s a cheap drug and only takes a week Or 2 to see if it works.<p>Can someone please just do a Really large trial, like, 2 weeks ago so we can put this to bed one way or the other."],"time":["2020-04-15 20:16:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mekoka"],"id":[22882231],"kids":{},"parent":[22879361],"text":["I think it&#x27;s too bad that this drug has been so politicized. It&#x27;s really unfortunate that its two original and most prominent champions are people that are so disliked. So many people spoke up (maybe prematurely) against it in a knee-jerk reaction to its advocates. Now many act as if they&#x27;re more concerned about being right to ridicule the claims all along, than they are about whether the drug is actually helpful in fighting COVID-19. Which, for the rest of us without a stake in their stupid political feuds, is all that matters. And because of this idiotic battle of the egos we could be passing on something useful.<p>So here we all are, hanging by the edge of our seats, waiting for definitive proof that <i>HCQ does not help in fighting COVID-19<\/i> and we keep getting these half-assed reports, seemingly more aimed at pushing a narrative than to present (or eliminate) an option in a fight.<p>One of the latest examples is the account of Rita Wilson (wife of Tom Hanks) who survived what seems like a difficult case of COVID-19 and shared her experience with the media: she felt very tired, extremely achy, uncomfortable, didn&#x27;t want to be touched, on the ninth day her fever climbed up to 102 and she had chills like she&#x27;d &quot;never had before&quot; (her words), she lost her sense of taste and smell. Then she was given chloroquine, her fever broke (it&#x27;s not clear how long after). She goes on to warn against the &quot;extreme&quot; (her word) side-effects she attributes to chloroquine: she was completely nauseous, she had vertigo, she could not walk and her muscles felt very weak. She then concludes that although her fever broke after been given chloroquine, she doesn&#x27;t know if it helped or if it was just time, which is fair. What do you imagine the headline for that story should be? Well, to save you the trouble, most read like this <i>Rita Wilson warns against &quot;extreme&quot; side-effects of chloroquine<\/i>.<p>Are HCQ&#x2F;CQ effective? We&#x27;re still sitting here like idiots not knowing. If they are, should they be taken carelessly? Definitely not, we already got that, thanks, but <i>that is not the point<\/i>. We can&#x27;t afford to have an &quot;all or nothing&quot; mindset with these drugs as we did with masks. Simply proclaiming that HCQ is useless because it is shown not to reduce viral load is just the best way to pass on some other ways it might be helping. If it is shown to have other palliative effects that actually help patients in their fight, such as reducing inflammation or helping cope with high fever long enough for your immune system to do the job, it&#x27;s not <i>nothing<\/i>.

I started with very little config and it was very hard.  Because many operations were different to the GUI editors I&#x27;d used before, I had to waste 20% of my brain power to consciously do things that should be unconscious (save, cut, paste etc).  This made it much harder to program!<p>The first step was updating the config to make emacs more similar to my old editor.  For example: make it so pasting text when text is selected replaces the selection.  Turn off branching undo.  Install a plugin that gave me an autocomplete list of every file in my current project.  Make it so that if I copy text in emacs, it appears on the OS-wide clipboard.  I&#x27;m sure your list of things will be different.<p>Another important step was getting my emacs theme to look nice.  This really made me love the program a lot more.  It&#x27;s silly, but there we are.<p>The third important step was finding things that emacs does better than other editors.

We still regularly teach each other about existing emacs functionality and exchange messages along the lines of:\n- I just found that there is a function foo, which I have made a keybinding foo and can now search open a tab with a SO search with text from the clipboard\n- whaaat? That&#x27;s super useful!\n- I know, right?<p>He works with a couple of greybeards, who also seem to be constantly finding emacs functionality that makes their lives easier, which suggests it would be beneficial for all of us to watch others in emacs.<p><i><\/i>* Interview<p>I was given a real git repo that I needed to load into my environment (spacemacs on Linux) to debug and fix failing tests. They sat me down during the onsite (the days when we would go to interview in person), told me to download the repo from the URL, told me how to run the tests (after activating the python venv) and watched me debug and fix failing tests - only 5 were failing from about 100. The interviewers were not proficient in emacs, but I felt that they could follow my thought process and workflow. I had only recently set up python dap-mode and felt clunky navigating in pdb through dap, so ended up print debugging.<p>It made me think how interesting it would be to watch other people with different backgrounds and experiences debug the same problem and how often I would learn new tricks or debugging techniques. Having a good understanding of the problem and the code allows you to focus on the activity of programming and watch out for new ways of tackling the same problem.<p><i><\/i>* What will we investigate<p>Furthermore, it might be interesting to see what debugging practices are statistically more succesful in tracking down the bug faster (and control them for overall years of programming experience and emacs proficiency).<p>If our sample is big enough we can answer questions like:\nCorrelation between overall years of programming experience and debugging time? \nWho is faster at debugging: printf or gdb debugger people? \nWhich keybindings and modes are most frequent across users? \nIs there a correlation between having custom elisp functions and debugging time?<p><i><\/i>* Format<p>I will prepare a representative repo in the most popular language (I am most comfortable in Python, happy to consider other languages, if people prefer), bury some bugs in it (that will be easy), administer the study and summarise the findings in a spreadsheet&#x2F;write-up.<p>Following the debugging session outlined above.

Forty years ago (i.e., when kabdib started using it), I would have agreed with it (I&#x27;d have to be born first, though). In essence, the vanilla Emacs is a powerful text editor with macros, syntax highlighting for many languages, debugger and linter integration, split panes, great diff viewer, and so on. In short: vanilla Emacs is still loaded with features, especially if you compare it to EDIT under MS-DOS or MS Write from Win 3.1.<p>The problem here is twofold: due to strict GPL licensing requirements, the inclusion of new features in the Emacs core is not that fast, and (more importantly) the rest of the world hasn&#x27;t been frozen for the last 30 years. What I mean is that today, the comparison is not Emacs vs. Notepad, but rather Emacs vs. (Sublime | VS Code | Atom | ...). The vanilla Emacs has <i>literally no features<\/i> you could see as an advantage over the other editors (and that&#x27;s even before we start talking about modern IDEs).<p>Basically, the only thing Emacs has in its favor is this: it&#x27;s a full-blown, incredibly efficient IDE for programming in Elisp, and it&#x27;s been like this for the last 40 years. Thousands of programmers used that environment to build the tools for just about anything under the heavens, and most of their code is out there, on Emacs Wiki, in ELPA &#x2F; MELPA repos, and all over GitHub.<p>To me, using Emacs without taking advantage of its ecosystem is simply a waste of time. So to summarize this point: you don&#x27;t have to fiddle with your Emacs config too much, but one of the first commands you should learn is probably `M-x list-packages.`<p>---<p>Second, while I say you &quot;don&#x27;t have to,&quot; it&#x27;s important to remember that you <i>can<\/i> fiddle with the config. The &quot;incredibly efficient Elisp IDE&quot; is always there for you, a single command away. You can use it to read the code and docs for any function or command you use (or want to). You can make a small change in command and have it immediately reloaded. You can <i>put a breakpoint<\/i> anywhere in any function and <i>step through<\/i> its execution while having call stack with all the (if not compiled away) variables and their values.<p>The browser-based editors could, in principle, offer a similar or better experience, but for some reason, they currently don&#x27;t (yet). You don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it right off the bat - or you can ignore it altogether - but when you need it, it&#x27;s always there. Fixing a typo, disabling unused features, automating chains of commands, binding commands to whatever is convenient to you, and so on - Emacs allows you to do all of that more efficiently than any other editor I&#x27;ve seen (LightTable being dead and all).<p>Also, as for &quot;endlessly tweaking&quot; your config: in my experience, that&#x27;s not what happens. It took me a year to learn Elisp, then I spent about two years trying out various packages, writing my own, adding some conveniences on top of what&#x27;s provided, and so on. That was almost a decade ago, though, and since then, I touched my config with very minor edits every couple of months, and I tried out some new packages as they came, so maybe a few times a year? Something like that. This is because I made my Emacs fit my habits, and once I did, I have had no incentive to fiddle with it further. Why would I? It works exactly the way I want it to.<p>---<p>TLDR: first, learn how to install (and <i>uninstall<\/i>!) packages and how to customize them with the `customize-...` commands. Then, go through the &quot;awesome emacs&quot; on GitHub and play with any package that catches your attention. Ask for package recommendations on StackExchange or somewhere if you&#x27;re not sure which to choose or if there&#x27;s a package implementing what you want (there is). Then, if you wish, delve deeper: start debugging and editing the packages&#x27; code, learn Elisp in the process, write whatever helpers you need. And after that, yes, simply <i>use<\/i> the editor (<i>your<\/i> editor!) for the next couple of decades."],"time":["2020-04-16 13:15:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22890905],"kids":{},"parent":[22881808],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-16 18:19:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["UsuariAsw2"],"id":[22890214],"kids":{},"parent":[22881808],"text":["asdasd"],"time":["2020-04-16 17:14:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sandworm101"],"id":[22874262],"kids":[22874737,22875528,22874560,22874972,22874460],"parent":[22872301],"text":["Take EVERYTHING in that article with a giant tub of salt.

Dynamic scope. Dynamic scope (aka special variables) means that if I locally bind the variable foo to bar, that binding is available for the dynamic extent of the let (ie a function deep in the call stack may access that binding of foo even if it was not defined lexically inside the binding). This allows passing state or options or configuration between different places which are amenable to extension, or modifying the behaviour of existing features by temporarily modifying their state. In other systems these problems may be solved by using lots of arguments, special mechanisms for passing custom parameters around, or well defined protocols to extensions with their own state. In those alternatives the fallback is either to impossibility or to storing state in poorly managed global variables. Elisp handles that “local global” state better and eg makes sure it correctly deals with multiple bindings or stack unwindings. One example usage would be for some custom comment syntax. You can just (locally) bind custom values to the variables which define the comment syntax and then call the usual comment function.<p>2. Hooks are very natural data structures which extensions use to make explicit extension points. Because books are lists, they may be conveniently dynamically bound (e.g. (let ((foo-hook (cons blah foo-hook))) ...)).<p>3. Buffer-local variables attach arbitrary state to each buffer and make it available as global variable bindings when that buffer is current. The alternative would be less begged local state, state attached to many more different things, and doing lots of requests for current-buffer.state.foo. Maybe these would make you think more about the current buffer changing but I’m not sure thinking about the problems leads to less buggy code. Buffer local variables makes writing modes easier and it makes it easy to not have to care much about the existence of other buffers while still easily being able to write code that spans multiple buffers.<p>4. Advice. Advice is like complex hooks except you can put it almost anywhere. You can “advise” any function with extra code to run in various places (eg before, after, around, just modifying the arguments, before but the advice is and’d with the function so if it returns nil the function isn’t called, and so on). This lets you tweak just about anything. For example I was using a build-managing mode which was not so extensible but by advising process creation I could modify its behaviour to nice the compiler executable.<p>5. Various save-restore macros. This could be done with first class functions but programming against the macros makes common idioms so much easier. Maybe an argument could be made that not having global state would make things a lot more manageable but I think macros like save-excursion, with-temp-buffer, and so on generally keep things under control<p>6. Most state is globally accessible. By this I mean most variables are special, and there is lots of important state which is global or buffer local like the point, mark, window configuration, or current buffer. This means that the current state is generally available to any extension code that runs and not kept private to some other bit of code (prohibiting extensions from getting at it). It allows most behaviour to be tweaked.<p>7. Recursive editing. It’s just really nice that you can pause half way through your program, have some editing done, then resume where you were: the user may live inside as well as outside the elisp call stack. Though mostly this is infrequently used.<p>8. Simple data structures. Because most things are text in buffers, you generally move around this data structure in a rough way (search forward for this, edit that, and so on) which is resilient to that data structure being changed&#x2F;extended under you.<p>It’s curious that a lot of these qualities are generally considered terrible features for writing maintainable code. This is because maintainable code generally wants different things to not be able to affect one another much.

This lead me to think that the tech industry was the obvious career for me. During my time in the industry, I felt miserable. I would say that the main reasons for that were:<p>* Meaninglessness. Most of the projects are simply not necessary, they do not help society in anyway, they just exist to make someone else wealthy.<p>* Tedium. The intellectual challenges aren&#x27;t there after a while. There are countless intellectual challenges in the field of computing &#x2F; computer science, but they are usually precisely the ones that industry has no interest on.<p>* Micromanagement. &quot;Agile&quot; and similar management practices (yes, I know, you&#x27;re not doing it right, blah blah blah) are downright humiliating and infantilizing. Almost no other highly skilled professional has to tolerate such level of intrusion on their day-to-day activities. I love deep thinking and creative expression. The modern corporate setting prevents this <i>by design<\/i>.<p>* Open-spaces. See above.<p>* Idealism. I was so excited about the possibilities that the Internet opened for humanity. Now we have ad-tech and horrible exploitation of &quot;gig-economy&quot;, warehouse workers and the like. This is definitely not what I have in mind when I started.<p>* Conformism. The tech industry is extremely conformist. Monetary consideration always wins. Deference to power always wins. &quot;Hacker&quot; used to mean something completely different. Almost opposite to the current definition.<p>I realized that what I always loved about computing was the endless creative and intellectual possibilities allowed by the medium. This is more or less the opposite of what the industry values, despite what they might advertise endlessly. There is nothing cool about it. It is stale and anti-intellectual.<p>I don&#x27;t need a lot of money to be happy. You probably don&#x27;t either. Time on this earth is the most valuable thing we have, and I would rather spend it waiting tables than enduring one more stand-up meeting.<p>I think creative nerds are the life-blood of the industry, but they tend to be shy and not assertive, so they have their life controlled by the &quot;business types&quot;. I honestly believe that if the nerds told them to fuck off and started spending their time working on things they think are relevant, the world would become much better quickly.

And the days are long, helping tourists, checking permits, etc. Permanent jobs are also incredibly hard to get - you usually have to do years of seasonal work to accrue enough seniority to get considered for a permanent position.<p>But the benefits? Being able to crack open a drink after a long day and look up at more stars than I ever thought existed - I spent many nights on the front porch of my cabin looking up at the Milky Way. Hiking, camping, boating on the weekends are easy because I was right there in the park. Clean air, clean water. A good group of coworkers (for me) who legit really care about protecting these astounding natural resources. And a feeling that you&#x27;re really making a difference and reaching people.<p>I did this for a few years and they were among my happiest years prior to my marriage.

The problems were interesting, though largely not things I was especially passionate about (I spent a couple years making software for call centers, a couple years on enterprise videoconferencing, etc.).<p>I decided to go my own way for a few reasons. First was financial - I had already started investing in some real estate on the side, and it wasn&#x27;t a leap to see how much of a financial advantage you can gain from owning and running an operating business vs. being a salaried employee. Second was just that I really like to be in control. Even in a 100% self-owned small business you find that you&#x27;re not really in control on a lot of things (getting permits from the city for stuff is exhausting, plus you&#x27;ve got a landlord, bank, etc.), but from a day-to-day perspective, I am the one who makes the call on everything.<p>Last was that it was a good way out of SF.

I finished my Bachelor and started at a StartUp. I totally loved it. I could build things they way I wanted, had a great CTO who helped me along the way.<p>But of course, you are getting ambitious, so you move on. Next company, higher pay, more complex problems.

I haven&#x27;t left but I&#x27;ve been considering it. My reasons for wanting to leave are:<p>1. The interview process<p>This is my biggest gripe. Imo it&#x27;s a hazing ritual that pretty much doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the candidate -- I think companies have it because <i>they<\/i> had to go through it, so why shouldn&#x27;t <i>you<\/i> have to?<p>I really wish I knew that this was a thing before I got into this profession because I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have gone into the field if this were the case.\nIf I knew that I&#x27;d be asked arbitrary questions on literally everything I learned over the course of my CS degree + 3-4 years of professional experience on virtually every programming topic, language and tool imaginable, I&#x27;m not sure I would&#x27;ve entered the industry.<p>It used to be all whiteboard questions of leetcode, for which I would consume many hours a week just practicing even though it has nothing to do with coding unless you&#x27;re writing C&#x2F;C++ code, and even then, you&#x27;d probably use already existing libraries for algorithms. Some say it&#x27;s a proxy for an IQ test, but I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s BS: it can be easily gamed, and I know a lot of smart people that butcher those because they&#x27;re introverted and&#x2F;or don&#x27;t do well with on-the-spot performance tests with someone watching over their shoulder.<p>This now got replaced with often arbitrary coding projects that have nothing to do with the job and often take up considerable amounts of time to write. 3 hours? sure if you want to deliver the bare minimum, but then someone else who wants the job more will do way more, so you do (a lot) more if you want the job. A lot of them are now at the screening stage, before you ever even talk to anyone. I&#x27;ve often been ghosted on coding projects: I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve dumped maybe 100+ hours and been ghosted on those projects. It really wears me out. Some places started to add time limits to the projects, which helps, but I&#x27;d rather have a 1 hour whiteboard interview on a project than several hours with a considerable amount of time spent setting up the tech stack instead of working on the problem because you&#x27;re building it from scratch. You could game this somewhat by setting up a ton of template projects over a wide variety of tech stacks to save time, but it&#x27;s all just a time sink (tooling fatigue).<p>2. It&#x27;s always &gt; 40 hours&#x2F;week<p>Related to #1. The pay is high, but if you consider the fact that you need to:<p>- Have a decent open source portfolio to stand out from the crowd<p>- Constantly learn new tech and show that you know it (learning on the job is apparently out of the question), usually as part of the open source portfolio or a blog. The new tools usually aren&#x27;t interesting -- they&#x27;re usually a rehashed version of the older tooling with <i>maybe<\/i> one very small kind of useful improvement on the old tooling, and possibly 1+ drawbacks, but requires you to have to relearn a whole new api&#x2F;way of doing things.<p>- The interview process is incredibly time consuming now that everyone is doing screening tests with several hour-several day coding projects, often which never gets followed up or read<p>- Meet arbitrary deadlines and create a bunch of technical debt because &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27;, and then be expected to come in after hours to put out fires that you have no control of preventing or didn&#x27;t even start, because feature creep trumps sound technical decisions<p>Then, considering all of this, the pay is actually quite low when you realize you need to put in 60-70 hours&#x2F;week to stay ahead. Unless you work for a spyware company (unless you get into netflix), see:<p>3. Detrimental to society: automate or spy<p>Most of the apps out there either don&#x27;t actually improve society in any way or are actually actively detrimental to society. You&#x27;re often either writing spyware (probably backed by some govt), or you&#x27;re writing software to automate away some white-collar job that society desperately needs as the middle class, the backbone of a healthy society and economy, is continually shrinking and politicians are doing jack about it (to be fair I&#x27;m not even really sure what they can do about it...). Modern day spies are basically all in the tech sector, so there&#x27;s plenty of spy shit. I&#x27;m from an eastern european country working for western companies, and I&#x27;m sure trust plays into whether or not I&#x27;m even considered for positions. Same deal as #1: I really, <i>really<\/i> wish I knew this as well before going into this field because I probably would&#x27;ve stayed well away<p>4. You&#x27;re not a software engineer<p>There&#x27;s very little actual engineering involved in the day-to-day work. It&#x27;s really like 70-90% debugging (repairman) and 10-30% development (white-collar construction). Maybe like 1% is actually engineering in most jobs. I thought I&#x27;d get to be an engineer, and it&#x27;s the aspect I liked the most out of my classes. I like developing stuff but not if it&#x27;s detrimental to society (#3) and only with a reasonable amount of tech debt. Sound engineering practices would reduce repairman down to like 10%, but tech goes in hype bubbles and is often crap, and the best pieces of engineering are utterly unpopular for some bizarre reason<p>5. It&#x27;s all getting automated away<p>There was a time when having strong linux and networking chops gave you a lot of street cred. Now those people are obsolete as more and more people are switching to cloud companies to save on costs (#3). Open source has killed the engineering aspect as jobs are now all about slapping libraries together and debugging (construction repairman). It used to be a white collar job but it&#x27;s increasingly turning into a blue collar one (bootcamps?), so I think it&#x27;s not surprising that the industry is treating it&#x27;s employees increasingly like replaceable code monkeys (we probably are, and soon to be obsolete) and making us jump through all sorts of arbitrary hoops to get a job.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking of getting into teaching + research and becoming a professor, but I&#x27;m not sure because:<p>1. I might just run into other issues in academia that I didn&#x27;t know about before entering the industry, just like with the tech industry<p>2. There&#x27;s also the aspect of bad luck&#x2F;making your luck -- there are companies where none of this stuff applies, and so I could try to find&#x2F;target those kinds of companies. My earlier experiences at companies were different. And the culture could probably change on a lot of this stuff, like how interviews are done, though some of it is probably inevitable and unavoidable (like automation + spy shit)"],"time":["2020-04-16 18:10:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["richjdsmith"],"id":[22884780],"kids":[22884807],"parent":[22876241],"text":["I have always loved computers. I&#x27;m a millennial, and a child of the internet. I remember with fondness the day my parents upgraded to DSL in the early 2000s and what effect that had on me. Raw excitement like little I&#x27;d felt before.<p>Despite that, I studied Economics in university. It fit my personality as being a lover of data and &#x27;business&#x27; but a lot more of the human side of it. I&#x27;d always loved business, and while I started out in business school, I found quickly I didn&#x27;t like &#x27;business people&#x27;. So I switched into Econ. Halfway through my economics degree, I took a course on the history of labor markets. This course made me realize I needed to learn to code to stay relevant for the rest of my life. I didn&#x27;t have aspirations of doing a trade and the course and further research made me realize how vulnerable my skill set was to automation.<p>So I finished school and then learned to code. I did a bootcamp, and became a very junior full-stack dev. I absolutely loved programming at this point. But I still missed &#x27;business&#x27;, so I decided to mix the two and start my own software development company. I quickly figured out there is little money in building businesses websites, but plenty in building custom applications or add-ons for e-commerce businesses and focused my efforts there. I made good money, got to live and work in Europe (I&#x27;m Canadian) and overall enojyed myself for a few years.<p>All the while I was perfectly content in the back-end world of web development, working mostly in Ruby, Elixir and PHP. But the front-end started sneaking in. JS has a way of doing that. Soon I found myself spending more time fixing broken node packages than I was coding. Someone above me said it felt like being a carpenter, while spending 80% of the time fixing your tools. That couldn&#x27;t have described how I felt any better.<p>Turns out, while I love programming, I hate JS and the world that node has given us. If you want to work on the web, sadly, you&#x27;re often faced with dealing with it at some point or another.<p>At this time, I was also discovering that while I always knew I loved interacting with people, that managing remote teams and having occasional video conference calls was not enough to satisfy my extroverted personality. I was becoming lonely in my work.<p>So I quit. I spooled down my business, going into maintenance mode only. I&#x27;ve since switched into the finance industry, doing underwriting for a small private bank. I love it. I still write code. I spend a decent portion of my time optimizing our company (we&#x27;re small and the board is happy with any of my tech proposals so long as I explain the value added) with technology wherever possible.<p>Programming is now only a small portion of my day, but I treasure it now. I still program in the evenings (Elixir Nerves is super cool!) for fun, and of course at work. But it&#x27;s not my primary role. I will still get paid, even if Yarn breaks something that day.<p>I&#x27;ve since discovered that .asdf handles 90% of my dependency problems, and that the finance industry doesn&#x27;t care if your app uses webpack or any javascript for that matter. Removing the need to follow or even keep up with the latest trends in web development from my life has been a breath of fresh air. I couldn&#x27;t be happier."],"time":["2020-04-16 02:23:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["at_a_remove"],"id":[22879240],"kids":{},"parent":[22876241],"text":["My dissatisfaction, aside from the usual foolishness one has come to expect from one&#x27;s employers like a weekly viewing of <i>Brazil<\/i>, stemmed from this kind of engineering cruft that has seeped into a very small shop.  The cruft looked like this kind of enormous parasite that had battened onto programming, slowing it down, draining it.  I don&#x27;t doubt that very large projects with tons of developers and enormous LOC counts, with a few million users need that kind of thing, but it does not seem to scale <i>down<\/i> very well.  What might have been a symbiotic relationship with a larger host organism became like a lamprey fastened to a guppy.  Now artificial deadlines had their own artificial deadlines inside them, ad infinitum.<p>Despite being an incredibly small shop, we &quot;leaned in&quot; to the Agile thing in a way that was completely foolish.  Scale was irrelevant, we had some services that were hit an average of seven times a day, sometimes spiking to ten.  You will have to trust me when I say that they would never go viral.  Ever.  We did not have teams of programmers working on one product, we had a few programmers constantly bouncing from one little project to another as management demanded.  This &quot;pivoting,&quot; (and I guess you have to be Agile to pivot so often) resembled nothing more than Brownian motion from the ten thousand foot view.  Management would shift in and out, old work was looked at with &quot;why did we build that?&quot; while never asking if the hotness du jour was similarly unnecessary.  Meanwhile, backbone processes were neglected and began to crumble.<p>Ah, but the churn, that was huge.  We kept switching from one platform for engineering issues we didn&#x27;t have before to another platform.  We had this, now we are going to Trello.  Then it turns out that our parent organization was going to switch to something else entirely in six months, but let&#x27;s take a little detour from Trello to this <i>other<\/i> platform just for fun before we go to what the parent organization will mandate.  This was most likely to be just another bullet point on the old resume for the lead, to say that he had done it, on his way out the door to somewhere else; if I had to guess, he had figured out what ecosystem his target job was using and picked some items out of that for us to purely temporarily migrate to.<p>People would buy wholesale into services that simply were not going to last.  I would smell the stench of impending death upon them but no.  And then later, into the Google Graveyard or the like it would go.  So much jabbering about frontend frameworks when almost no Javascript was required, only to have to then keep those frameworks current.<p>The churn was there in other ways.  I had never used a particular backend framework before, in fact had little experience with them.  I was forthright about this, so I bought some relevant books, set up a test machine to dabble with, and was ready to go with a tiny little &quot;get my feet wet&quot; project that would still have some minor value.  The other &quot;contributor&quot; had agreed to all of this, and when I was set up and ready to learn, somehow everything pivoted to Django.  No &quot;buy-in,&quot; as the lingo I had to learn goes, from me.  Time, effort, money: wasted.  Update update, migrate migrate.<p>I remind people often that nomads never left great architecture behind.  If you are constantly migrating, you are not building anything to last.<p>I switched to something tech-adjacent.  I still program.  I still use technology to solve problems.  Now, when I program to solve a problem, it stays solved.  I do not have endless meetings fractally interspersed into my schedule like some kind of stuttering hardware interrupt all to talk about solving a problem.<p>I follow Hacker News because I am interested in some trends, pet projects, and the like.  On a purely cruel level, watching people simply tear into one another again and again over what looks like religious differences (Agile in particular is a fantastic example, makes top-posting vs. bottom-posting thing look tame) reminds me of why I left."],"time":["2020-04-15 17:53:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LocalMan"],"id":[22889776],"kids":{},"parent":[22876241],"text":["I got old and retired."],"time":["2020-04-16 16:35:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Holmes"],"id":[22876799],"kids":{},"parent":[22876241],"text":["Mainly the grammar."],"time":["2020-04-15 14:14:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FlowNote"],"id":[22877539],"kids":[22878189],"parent":[22876241],"text":["I left when project managers tried to Taylorize programming."],"time":["2020-04-15 15:39:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["agingburnout"],"id":[22891135],"kids":{},"parent":[22876241],"text":["I&#x27;m an asshole with bi-polar disorder.

I dropped out of college and into the first dot-com boom. I dearly wish I hadn&#x27;t these days, as I&#x27;ve never completed my degree. But, it&#x27;s part of my story.<p>I joined an aging software company first, not a shiny dot-com. I learned a great deal here. I was 19 when I started. The place was staffed with amazing engineers and some of the worst management I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I was pretty unsure of my path at this point and was willing to do anything they asked of me. So when I showed a little aptitude for system administration and fixed several glaring issues, they asked me to join that team. My joining made it a team of two. Over the course of the next <i>week<\/i> management determined that I was a better fit for the job. They asked me if I could do it solo. I wasn&#x27;t sure but they seemed ok with it. Everyone in the office knew, including me, that the guy I was slated to replace had cancer. At a small company, everyone knew everything. The guy was literally family. Like many there, he had several other family members on staff. They fired him. While he had cancer. He lost his insurance. When I questioned this, I was told: &quot;that sounds like his problem&quot;.<p>I left that job and moved on because I was rather disillusioned. I went looking for a job that was &quot;fun&quot; -- and ended up in the music industry. I immediately found solace for my low point in the form of drugs, booze, etc. I lived like a rock star for a couple of years, and my employers were more than happy to let me. It was the music industry, and it was flush with cash -- just before Napster! These were mind-boggling decisions at every level here, all of them motivated by greed, all of them tainted by cocaine. It was rough. Eventually, the drugs and booze caught up with me. I took some time to dry out before going back.<p>My thought process at the time was &quot;ok, lets make some fast money and get out of this field&quot;, so I took a job on Wall Street. In hindsight, incredibly foolish. My drug problems returned, my work suffered, I moved on.<p>I spent the next several years doing private consulting work. I made more money than I ever had, but it always felt tainted somehow. The disillusionment of my earlier years was hard to shake. All these years later, I still haven&#x27;t shaken it.<p>I&#x27;ve had many jobs at this point. There are several common threads running through them:<p>- First, profit above all else. The human toll is meaningless.\n - Second, and highly related to the first, are compromised ethics. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve <i>ever<\/i> worked for good people.\n - Third, incompetence is the rule. I&#x27;ve worked with &quot;senior software engineers&quot; who couldn&#x27;t use an editor. Who didn&#x27;t know how to use variables -- and not some weird syntax issue. I&#x27;m talking &quot;thousands of files duplicated with hardcoded values where variables should be&quot;\n - Fourth, generally no consequences for bad actions. Ignore user security? &quot;Not really our problem&quot;. Not meeting SLAs because management refused to properly staff&#x2F;equip your project? End up the scapegoat because &quot;we weren&#x27;t aware&quot;. You SIGNED THE CONTRACT. Didn&#x27;t you read it?<p>My most recent job was focused on correcting my personal physical health issues. Spending a long time behind a desk made me sedentary. I took a job doing datacenter operations work: racking, stacking, running cable, etc. Loads of fun, and for the fist time in ages I actually <i>liked<\/i> my day-to-day coworkers. Our clients were trashy though: spammers mostly, porn sites, and so on. As a customer of a huge datacenter, the business was deemed &quot;essential&quot;, when clearly it was not. But that didn&#x27;t matter to the company! They are more than happy to sacrifice their employees to COVID-19. Gotta protect those profits! I left at the end of March. I&#x27;ve subsequently learned that people have died. Because they show up when they have no other choice. Can&#x27;t lose those benefits!<p>So that&#x27;s my story. Neat, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s a fair critique to say I&#x27;ve made bad decisions. I most certainly have, and I gotta own that. But at every step of the way, there&#x27;s been a corporate vulture ready to pick the meat off my bones. I have so many regrets -- the biggest being my naive optimism where I take people at their word. A huge mistake that I constantly regret.<p>For these reasons, I plan to leave, or... I have already? But not leave tech. I do enjoy the work. I don&#x27;t enjoy &quot;the rest&quot;. One thing I&#x27;ve learned though, across all the industries I&#x27;ve worked in is this:<p>The problem isn&#x27;t &quot;tech&quot;. The problem is the culture of the United State of America. A &quot;me first&quot; culture. A culture that promotes races to the bottom at every level. A culture that glorifies ignorance. A culture that is based on lies, near as I can tell. But who can really tell anymore? What is truth these days, other than an anachronistic notion shared by the naive?<p>So I am leaving the United States if this pandemic ever ends. Because our culture is abhorrent. I won&#x27;t support it any longer.<p>Oh, and why do I keep coming to HN? It&#x27;s like driving past a traffic accident. I can&#x27;t help but look at the destruction man creates. It reminds me of how NOT to be. How NOT to exist in this world. I hope, with any comment I leave, and I&#x27;ll be honest I&#x27;m all on throwaways like this one, I hope that if I can change one person&#x27;s mind in this field it will have a positive impact somewhere. Even if it&#x27;s just one person that decides &quot;hmm, maybe profit above people isn&#x27;t the best idea&quot; ... well, I&#x27;ll take it as a win."],"time":["2020-04-15 20:32:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["mmargerum"],"id":[22877505],"kids":[22877707,22877737],"parent":[22876241],"text":["Making 6 figures to play and create all day if just awful.

Its procedural rhetoric promotes inclusivity, diversity, personalization, and tolerance, and supports self-expression, creativity, storytelling, and sharing. Players impress their own identities, families, homes, communities, and stories into the game, and share their own personal emergent narratives with tools like The Sims Family Album and The Sims Exchange.<p>The Sims presumes to model human minds and relationships, but necessarily makes brazen simplifications due to technological constraints. It optimizes for playability instead of realism, while making concessions to marketability, corporate interests, societal norms, and taboos. But somehow it works, and this paper attempts to explain some of the magic.<p>Will Wright defined the “Simulator Effect” as how players imagine the simulation is vastly more detailed, deep, rich, and complex than it actually is: a magical misunderstanding that you shouldn’t talk them out of. He designs games to run on two computers at once: the electronic one on the player’s desk, running his shallow tame simulation, and the biological one in the player’s head, running their deep wild imagination.<p>The “AI” of The Sims is scripted in a noodly visual programming language called “SimAntics”, and is distributed throughout the objects and characters of the Sims microworld. But it magically offloads most of the heavy lifting into the player’s own imagination, incorporating and enriching their intertwingled tapestry of common-sense knowledge and stories about people, families, and communities.<p>The graphical design of The Sims was inspired by Scott McCloud’s “Understanding Comics”, in which he illustrated how the “Masking” visual style draws abstract characters against realistic backgrounds, which increases empathy and projective identification, empowers emotional connections, and permits players to easily and deeply identify with characters.<p>The educational philosophy of The Sims and SimCity was inspired by Seymour Papert’s “Constructionism” learning theory, with which learners construct mental models to understand the real world by building tangible personally meaningful shareable microworlds, and learn by discovery and exploration, by leveraging information they already know to learn more, and architecting their own educations.<p>This paper reviews the history of inclusivity in The Sims franchise over two decades, and explains some techniques for imagination, persuasion, identification, empathy, storytelling, and education, which can also make other games more inclusive, expressive, and enlightening.<p>----"],"time":["2020-04-16 07:43:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["benibela"],"id":[22893291],"kids":{},"parent":[22871124],"text":["I wrote games when I was around 10 years old.<p>I was very proud when I figured out how to calculate if two axis-aligned rectangles intersect.

Our Python build process is fairly custom for what amounts to historical reasons, but when you create a new Python project, you get automated builds and tests on all the OSes you care about (through our central build and test farm), a way of declaring dependencies (that has nothing to do with pipenv&#x2F;poetry&#x2F;etc., but whatever), flake8 enabled by default easy toggles for mypy and black if you want them, a standard way of doing code reviews, a standard way of doing releases, etc. - simply because it&#x27;s possible to assume shared infrastructure and shared defaults.<p>When you&#x27;re writing open-source code, you don&#x27;t have any shared infrastructure or defaults to assume, so you have to find some infrastructure (e.g. GitHub + Travis) and you have to basically include all the infrastructure configuration in your project, possibly through adding a bunch of dev-dependencies that set things up the way you want. It&#x27;d be interesting to think about how to abstract this further so you don&#x27;t have to think about that many things.<p>Some possible inspirations:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis.debian.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis.debian.net&#x2F;<\/a> - if you have a Debian package on GitHub, and you want automated tests, you just grab the .travis.yml file from here and a script written by someone else will set up builds and tests in Docker containers. It does rely on Debian having a standardized way of specifying build rules, dependencies, and tests and a standardized layout of packages, though. But most Python packages have a pretty standard layout, too, and you can imagine having things like isort&#x2F;flake8&#x2F;nose&#x2F;etc. be installed only in CI and not explicitly listed in your code.<p>- Rust, I think, makes this a little easier because there&#x27;s a high-quality packaging system, test runner, formatter, and doc generator all in the standard Rust tools. While Rust-the-language has a standard library that&#x27;s much emptier than, say, Python&#x27;s, rustc comes with way more developer tools than Python does. That means that you don&#x27;t need to install custom tools to handle most of this because it&#x27;s assumed that people are using the standard ones. (This does, of course, rely on the tools actually being high-quality, and as a young language, Rust has an unfair advantage in watching Python and so many other languages try to figure out what works well and what doesn&#x27;t. You&#x27;d have an easier time in Python if you stuck to distutils and easy_install, but on the other hand, you&#x27;d have to use distutils and easy_install.)"],"time":["2020-04-15 07:30:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liquidify"],"id":[22874916],"kids":{},"parent":[22874476],"text":["I have felt like it is way to complicated to do certain things in python... primarily relating to building and packaging large scale code.

[1] Our digital medicine group at Scripps Research Translational Institute has just launched a health study [2] to explore one possible approach: crowdsourcing data from wearable devices like the Apple Watch and Fitbit, and then attempting to use machine learning (or less grandly, linear regression) to identify COVID-19 infections.<p>In January, my colleagues at Scripps published a study in the Lancet that used heart rate and sleep data from about 47,000 Fitbit users in the U.S. to predict which areas would be hardest hit by flu. [3] The correlation with actual reports from the Centers for Disease Control was very high: 0.9.<p>We’re hoping that we can do something similar for COVID-19 infection. In particular, elevated resting heart rate appears to be a reliable indicator of viral infection. [4] We’re wondering whether it might also be a leading indicator, i.e, spiking to a detectable degree before any measurable fever. If it were, we might be able to identify COVID-19 infections in individuals -- and areas with outbreaks -- before people even have any symptoms.<p>To figure this out, we’re going to need a lot of participants. And that’s really the greatest challenge for us now. A similar project in Germany [5], which was inspired by our Lancet flu study, already has more than 160,000 volunteers. But they have the advantage of being sponsored by a national research institute. We don’t.<p>If you have suggestions about how we might reach people with wearables who want to help out -- or if you have questions about the DETECT study -- please add them to the comments.<p>Thanks,\nDanny<p>[1] Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;24&#x2F;science.abb3221\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;24&#x2F;scie...<\/a><p>[2] Pivoting health research to take on COVID-19. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;pivoting-health-research-to-take-on-covid-19-detect-lessons\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;pivoting-health-resea...<\/a><p>[3] Harnessing wearable device data to improve state-level real-time surveillance of influenza-like illness in the USA. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;landig&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2589-7500(19)30222-5&#x2F;fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;landig&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2589-7...<\/a><p>[4] Fever and cardiac rhythm. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamainternalmedicine&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;606966\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamainternalmedicine&#x2F;articl...<\/a><p>[5] Germany launches smartwatch app to monitor coronavirus spread. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;reuters&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;07&#x2F;technology&#x2F;07reuters-health-coronavirus-germany-tech.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;reuters&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;07&#x2F;technology&#x2F;07reut...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-15 21:44:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nicthesailor"],"id":[22882988],"kids":[22883021],"parent":[22882148],"text":["I just tried to download the android app, but it says it&#x27;s not available in my country.<p>You might get more volunteers and data if you remove the geographic restrictions."],"time":["2020-04-15 22:59:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["a2x0"],"id":[22883433],"kids":[22883519],"parent":[22882148],"text":["For those of you that are located in Germany and want to help with their data: the RKI has an app[1] like that and uses heart rate, resting heart rate, sleep, and steps to determine the spread throughout the country<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corona-datenspende.de\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corona-datenspende.de<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-15 23:43:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["exabrial"],"id":[22882870],"kids":[22883695,22888767,22882909],"parent":[22882148],"text":["I really wish Apple, Garmin, Google, Fitbit would start working on body temperature sensors.

All information contained in the graphic output is a black box to them. This has to change.<p>Responsiveness - because the current canvas element doesn&#x27;t know how to play nicely with CSS responsive design patterns.<p>Fun - because trying to do anything reasonably complex with the Canvas API is not fun.<p>&quot;What are your hopes for the project?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not looking for the library to take the frontend world by storm (though it is a nice fantasy).<p>What would really make me happy would be if maintainers of other canvas libraries look at what I&#x27;ve tried to do with Scrawl-canvas around the areas of accessibility and responsiveness, and add that sort of functionality to their projects - hopefully in even better, more efficient ways.<p>Oh - and finding some collaborators to work on the project would also be good, because I&#x27;ve spent too long working on it by myself and it could really do with some fresh eyes and opinions."],"time":["2020-04-14 12:00:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrismorgan"],"id":[22887235],"kids":[22887671],"parent":[22859099],"text":["This fails my very first test of anything canvasy: it’s not scaling by devicePixelRatio, so it looks bad on a high-DPI display, especially if text is involved.

I think it&#x27;s because everyone wants their own lane, so they can cruise. It&#x27;s not a case of &#x27;a few bad apples&#x27;. Anecdotally, about 1&#x2F;3 of the cars actually let you pass, the others don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass, slowing down the traffic for no reason.<p>Speaking of cruising, my second complaint is how most don&#x27;t use cruise control. It&#x27;s painfully obvious, because the other cars slow down significantly when going up the hill and accelerate downhill. I see the same cars passing me, downhill, then ending up behind me uphill. It&#x27;s so annoyingly unnecessary. If your car doesn&#x27;t have adaptive CC, that means you have to turn on&#x2F;off the CC frequently.

I would not constrain myself to running inside a fixed grid character terminal if I could help it.<p>The thing I would focus on is interactivity and modifiability of commands. Most of my time at a command line is doing one of two things:<p>1. Typing simple commands to e.g. start systems or query their state or otherwise poke them. Here command has a more traditional meaning than “invocation of a program which may do arbitrary things”.<p>2. Piecing together pipelines to extract some data and do things with it (first I write a command to get some data and probably pipe it into less, then I try writing a bit of sed on the end and piping that into less, then some awk, and so on until I have the pipeline I want)<p>For 1, I would want things to mostly work like bash.<p>For 2, I would want something more. Instead of using regular pipes, add an intermediate program (or use the shell). At first it can just hold onto the input as well as sending it to the output. That would make it easy to inspect what is going into a pipe. I guess it may eventually want to stop building memory usage so maybe it could have a large ring buffer instead. I would also like to be able to get some pv like behaviour to see progress. This could also be switched into something with lower overhead. I think it would all be reasonably cheap with splice, tee, and vmsplice (I’m not interested in support for non Linux platforms).<p>I’d want the ability to e.g. write my command with a trailing pipe, see some output, and then interactively add more stages to the pipeline<p>Ideally, I’d like an interactive awk-like tool where I can see the effect of my partly-written command as I write it.<p>I’d want ssh to be treated in a first-class reasonably transparent way where I don’t need to think about complicated quoting rules. But maybe somehow efficiently trying to avoid too much bandwidth or remote computation.<p>I think I would want it to mostly run inside emacs but able to spawn a fast terminal emulator automatically as necessary for large files or long lines (you may be surprised to know that a shell in emacs tends to give you much lower typing latency than typical terminal emulators because Mac’s handles its own rendering and line editing whereas a terminal emulator must send the key to bash through a pty which then sends back some terminal control codes which must be interpreted before the display may be rendered."],"time":["2020-04-15 23:33:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thanatropism"],"id":[22882230],"kids":{},"parent":[22880320],"text":["... the Wolfram Shell?"],"time":["2020-04-15 21:51:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SketchySeaBeast"],"id":[22877670],"kids":[22878057,22877787,22877814],"parent":[22877228],"text":["Given the reticence of states to encourage social isolation it&#x27;ll probably be more enlightening to see April&#x27;s numbers.
