Language primitives are reliable, predictable, and non-breaking. If they do, they don&#x27;t affect business logic written on top of it. If parameters are added, defaults are provided. They don&#x27;t just abstract, they enable developers to express business logic more elegantly.<p>The challenge is to pick the part of the code abstractable to be primitive-like first and make it a top priority.<p>This is why language features like Rust async, Go channel-based comm, ES6, C++ smart pointer was such hype in their time and is used up until now. It also applies to enabling tools such as React, tokio, wasm-bindgen, express, TypeScript, jquery (even this which is not a thing anymore)."],"time":["2020-01-12 07:28:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["itchy"],"id":[22023341],"kids":{},"parent":[22022466],"text":["The problem is not abstractions or clean code, it is the lack of experience, lack of time to think and contradicting views of fellow developers in the team.

I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it was an improvement (which I don’t believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it. A healthy engineering team is constantly building trust. Rewriting your teammate’s code without a discussion is a huge blow to your ability to effectively collaborate on a codebase together.<p>There&#x27;s no question about this. Nobody likes the self-proclaimed savant who works in isolation and makes sweeping changes to the codebase or other people&#x27;s work without collaborating and gaining some consensus. If it&#x27;s a change worth making it should be a simple case to present to your (hopefully) equally intelligent team.<p>There is a difference, it has to be highlighted, between refactoring someone&#x27;s code in order to extend it yourself and simply re-writing someone&#x27;s implementation because it doesn&#x27;t suit your requirements. The former is part of the job, the latter should at the very least be an opportunity to mentor the person&#x27;s whose code you want to re-write in <i>why<\/i> it was suboptimal and guide them on the changes you&#x27;d like to make, or even give them the chance to make it themselves. This is kind of what code reviews are supposed to do.<p>That does not negate the need to structure and optimize code to remove duplication whatsoever. It&#x27;s not an argument against clean code standards and it&#x27;s weak that it amounts to 50% of his case here.<p>&gt;Secondly, nothing is free. My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication, and it was not a good trade. For example, we later needed many special cases and behaviors for different handles on different shapes. My abstraction would have to become several times more convoluted to afford that, whereas with the original “messy” version such changes stayed easy as cake.<p>Time changes, requirements change. It&#x27;s part and parcel of our jobs in software development. Writing code that at one point is optimal and most legible for the cases present should also be done to try to make it refactorable and extendable.<p>It is much easier to refactor and extend code that isn&#x27;t riddled with duplication and mangled with hardcoded business logic.

There is simply not enough information to know whether the refactoring is better or worse. In terms of less lines of code and code reuse, it is better in this sense. I suspect the author is pretty junior himself to imply the old way is better than his refactoring without a clear explanation as to why. I guess putting your baseless opinion on a fancy blog or medium makes you seem more legit than you really are.<p>I get his point, however. In the spirit of his argument there is an exact answer as to why one way of designing a program is better than another way despite more&#x2F;less code re-use or more&#x2F;less lines of code. I&#x27;m not even going to get into legibility here as that is just an opinion piece. Also I&#x27;m going to give a very concrete answer here. No design principles no design philosophy or any of that.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have feature which we call &quot;A&quot; that can be created as a composition of several primitives. We call these primitives &quot;a, b, c, d.&quot; Let&#x27;s also say feature &quot;A&quot; can be constructed from a different set of primitives &quot;b, f, g, a.&quot;<p>Note the overlap in primitives. The overall set of primitives are different but both ways of constructing feature &quot;A&quot; can share the same primitives if needed. The two sets in the example share primitives &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.<p>Now let&#x27;s say we want the code to be flexible enough to construct feature &quot;B&quot; or feature &quot;C&quot; sometime in the future.<p>lets say feature &quot;B&quot; needs primitives &quot;a, d, b&quot; to construct.<p>lets say feature &quot;C&quot; needs primitives &quot;b, f, a.&quot; to construct.<p>Which method of constructing Feature &quot;A&quot; is better knowing that you will need to construct Feature &quot;B&quot; in the future? what if it was Feature &quot;C&quot; for the future?<p>Obviously depending on &quot;how&quot; flexible you want your design to be you can choose one way to initially construct the program or another way. It&#x27;s all an opinion and anticipation for the way you design your program in the future.<p>One strategy to remove opinion from your design is to try to incorporate the full union of primitives &quot;a,b,c,d,f,g&quot; Or find another completely different set of primitives (perhaps &quot;h, i, j&quot;) that can be used to construct features &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C.&quot;<p>SO the concrete answer is &quot;h, i, j&quot; is the best set of primitives you can use to construct your program but if &quot;h, i, j&quot; aren&#x27;t available then your choice of &quot;a, d, b&quot; or &quot;b, f, a&quot; or &quot;a,b,c,d,f,g&quot; both hinges on whether you need to construct feature &quot;B&quot; or feature &quot;C&quot; in the future.<p>The problem with this article is that he never got into the nature of program design&#x2F;organization.

Several studies have supported a potential link between irritability and statins, including a randomised controlled trial – the gold-standard of scientific research – that Golomb led, involving more than 1,000 people.

They looked at age strata, baseline aggression, sleep-status, serotonin status, until they found a group -- post meno-pausal women -- in which the statin appeared to increase aggression.

People also tend to overestimate their abilities to perceive the effects and endeavor to address them.<p>“But Golomb’s most unsettling discovery isn’t so much the impact that ordinary drugs can have on who we are – it’s the lack of interest in uncovering it. “There’s much more of an emphasis on things that doctors can easily measure,” she says,”<p>And what is it about medications that makes people willing to connect these dots? Money and a willingness to not want to know and even to deny what is known. The chemical industry is very good at this and we&#x27;ve known about that for a very long time. There are numerous studies that have found these same associations with various chemical products from artificial food colorings to laundry chemicals and more, with effects that include anxiety, depression, and rage. The ubiquity of chemicals with unknown physiological and psychological is staggering. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where we can barely socialize without being inundated with the 21st version of passive smoking. People and places can&#x27;t exist without dousing themselves and their spaces with chemical crap that also includes air &quot;fresheners&quot;, candles, essential oils, etc. Road rage, infertility, anxiety, depression . . . all these psychological phenomena that have risen along with the public test lab that is our world.

And if it&#x27;s a problem for medications that are presumably scrutinized, what do we think is the case with the 10s of thousands of chemicals that are basically tested using the “honor system” of industry testing its own products for safety? These chemicals are not tested singly, nevermind in the near limitless combinations in which they exist in our daily lives.<p>“At this point it’s worth pointing out that no one is arguing that people should stop taking their medication.

It&#x27;s a crime that &quot;pierces the corporate veil.&quot; That is, natural persons can be tried and convicted, even if they were acting on behalf of corporations.<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a Breach Notification Rule, requiring holders of data to notify patients and CMS themselves if PHI is breached. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hhs.gov&#x2F;hipaa&#x2F;for-professionals&#x2F;breach-notification&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hhs.gov&#x2F;hipaa&#x2F;for-professionals&#x2F;breach-notificat...<\/a><p>CMS announces breaches involving 500 or more patient records here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocrportal.hhs.gov&#x2F;ocr&#x2F;breach&#x2F;breach_report.jsf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocrportal.hhs.gov&#x2F;ocr&#x2F;breach&#x2F;breach_report.jsf<\/a><p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the people involved in securing these sloppily configured DICOM servers are in a state of panic.

An example that jumped out at me (this from Chapter 1.7) was the use of<p><pre><code>    &amp;s.to_string()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nwhich is an expression that could be shortened to just s. (Specifically, s has type &amp;str, calling to_string() on it converts it to a String, and borrowing it allows it to be coerced back to a &amp;str but now with unnecessary copying.) Elsewhere (this from Chapter 1.2) it has explanations like<p>&gt; Copy and Clone allow this [type] to be used as a &quot;value&quot; type (that is, it just passes around the value instead of pointers)<p>which is also not a correct explanation, or at least is a misleading one: things can still be passed by value even without Copy and Clone and without any pointers at all. (Arguably, he meant, &quot;You can share the value without using borrows,&quot; but that&#x27;s not what the explanation said.)<p>That said, all this is nitpicky (and I suspect that Herbert would be receptive to feedback along these lines—I just haven&#x27;t had a chance yet to provide it!) because the tutorial&#x27;s explanation of roguelike-writing is still very good, and in fact I&#x27;ve been following it as a rough guide for writing a tutorial on top of a different Rust library myself!

Some of the guarantees afforded by Pijul&#x27;s model are clearly superior to those afforded by Git, but I can&#x27;t help but get the impression that Pijul is:<p>1. considerably more complex under the sheets, and<p>2. considerably more complex <i>in situations you&#x27;re going to have to deal with as a user<\/i>.<p>It would be nice to read an article from someone familiar with Pijul, that would take a look at the &quot;ugly&quot; (from the user&#x27;s perspective) parts, and either explain how they aren&#x27;t issues in practice, or at least show how you would handle them and argue why the benefits outweigh the costs.<p>For example, accurately representing repository states with files appears difficult: the page on Pijul&#x27;s theory[0] explains how Pijul does not limit the repository to containing valid states, and mentions that &quot;...else, we say the file has a conflict, and presenting the state of the file to the user in an intelligible way is not obvious.&quot;. There&#x27;s an independent article about Pijul[1] that gives some examples of how you could end up with two different conflict states in Pijul that render into identical files.<p>I also had a look in the patch list for the master branch[2]. I managed to find a few patches I couldn&#x27;t understand by looking at them. I realize that Pijul is still some ways from being ready for mass consumption, but the selling point of Pijul is its theory of patches. The documentation for &quot;pijul patch&quot;[3] notes that outputting patches as text &quot;may lose information&quot;, and that &quot;the text representation is merely a pretty-printed representation, and is not sufficient to apply the patch&quot;. This suggests to me that the difficulty in viewing those patches is at least partially due to viewing Pijul patches being a hard problem.<p>Here&#x27;s an example, &quot;Fixing a conflict with #387&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nest.pijul.com&#x2F;pijul_org&#x2F;pijul:master&#x2F;patches&#x2F;6E7KeeqoxngvDnPvBbQDSeMvWZLN2qUMUvDnF8wADb42iZtLFWHbQSf7YAyx5D37ZuoRY3W2B5opjUJt5ZPHGUpY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nest.pijul.com&#x2F;pijul_org&#x2F;pijul:master&#x2F;patches&#x2F;6E7Kee...<\/a><p>Some lines at the top appear to be for informative purposes. They reappear later on, but slightly different (e.g. imports reordered, or with changed whitespace), and without any color (green or red) that would indicate that they were added or removed. They&#x27;re shown in a context (e.g. line 219, 222) where they fit in as additions together with other lines that were added, though. The output of &quot;pijul patch&quot; for this patch[4] looks somewhat similar, and likewise not very easy to digest.<p>I really want to like Pijul, but I&#x27;m worried that it&#x27;s too powerful and requires too much from the user.

I started reading, prepared for something which was probably going to point out all the flaws in those people who gossip, and how they can be rectified etc.<p>But the article took a very interesting turn. It said, (paraphrasing) without gossip, people in power will arrange everything in the general direction of usurping more power (e.g. dictators). And how gossip serves a very important evolutionary need (a powerful, guerilla style technique to destroy power-grabs). If you were under a dictator, openly criticizing them leaves you with a small chance of being murdered. Hence you will choose instead to gossip. Imagine if the dictator then tells all his subjects - &quot;whatever you have heard about me is untrue, it is just some haters hating&quot;.<p>So there is another explanation for haters (and their apparent obsession) - they look around and see a lot of injustice. Usually they are powerless to do anything, and waiting until they achieve something in life might make the problem much worse before they can offer their viewpoint. So perhaps hating has an evolutionary benefit - it gives clues to non-haters to then go and do their own additional research.

People are just people. No matter how good someone is, they fuck up, make mistakes, aren&#x27;t so good at other things and have flaws.

The article even uses the words famous and successful interchangeably, entertaining the idea that fame may be ill-received only in the footnotes.<p>Also the emphasis on &#x27;neutral opinions&#x27; is revealing. The problem when speaking to powerful people is that they&#x27;re very adept at deflecting &#x27;objective&#x27; criticism. It&#x27;s the sort of discourse they&#x27;re accustomed to. Hate and anger and even slightly mad and irrational criticism can come from a place of truth. And it can be valuable because in contrast to polite discussion scathing anger is hard to deflect.

There are others with the same or more talent (maybe even the hater or someone they know) who get no attention at all and toil in obscurity.<p>Of course luck is a sliding scale (there is always luck) but someone in theory would be less likely to hate someone who ran a race and was the fastest (low on the luck scale high on the skill scale) but more likely to hate a startup founder or a singer or actor who had fame but it didn&#x27;t appear related as much to talent but to luck.  Someone can imagine &#x27;I could do that&#x27; but not &#x27;I can beat that person in a marathon&#x27; (easy to quantify).<p>2) There are fanboys and that enhances the annoyance by the hater. So it&#x27;s the constant attention (which they feel is undeserved and quite frankly it probably is) that drives the hater. Not the person themselves. The media attention the fawning articles the fawning comments.<p>3) They get attention for things that the same activity would not get attention by a non famous person. Example is PG wrote this essay and everyone here (including me) are feasting on it.<p>4) They are unapproachable. They wouldn&#x27;t give you the time of day (because of course they don&#x27;t have time to give everyone attention). If you wrote to them they might write back a quick reply but they would never engage in a discussion or invite you to go out or be their friend. They would give you some trivial brush off (if they replied at all). You are not important to them and they know that. That bugs people even if they know there is a legit reason for the brush off.  People react negatively to lack of courtesy and to have it in their face that they are not important even if rationally they understand why it&#x27;s happening to them.<p>So at the core it&#x27;s not the actual famous person that is hated so much as the attention that is given to the famous person that drives the hate.

An alternative theory of fandom:<p>A. Hypothesis:<p>The person you laud is a target of your psychological projection.<p>B. Evidence:<p>Let&#x27;s take Apple. It had a lot of fanbois, especially 1990-2010. If one thing can be said for it, its ads were true: it thought different. In a world of computers for businesses and penny pinchers, Apple catered to artists and perfectionists.<p>My first computer was a Macintosh. So that&#x27;s another thing: nostalgia.<p>Steve Jobs said and did things that I wish I had the courage to say and do.<p>C. Conclusions:<p>When I think of the fanbois of Apple, I think of people who feel (1) underrepresented, and now have found (2) representation.<p>Therefore to them, Apple is, in a way, them. Apple is me, Steve Jobs is my avatar. I am not famous, so I rely upon Steve Jobs to go out in the world and speak on my behalf. When I see him make a mistake, I explain it away, the way I explain away my own shortcomings. When people attack him, I feel attacked, and so I speak up in his defense.<p>---<p>II. Paul Graham suggests that fanbois and haters are two sides of the same coin. So let me put haters under the same light.<p>A. Hypothesis:<p>The person you cast aspersions upon is a target of your psychological projection.<p>B. Evidence:<p>Scant evidence, because I don&#x27;t talk to haters much about their hating. I did have a friend though who was normally cheerful but surprised me one day with his hatred for Ben Affleck. Now that I revisit the memory, I wonder if Ben Affleck reminded him of an old classmate.<p>People have an unusual hatred for celebrities who seem nice like Taylor Swift. Maybe she reminds them of an old girlfriend who hurt their feelings.<p>C. Conclusions:<p>As I walk these streets, I seem to be surrounded by nice, well-adjusted people. Most of them are polite and quiet. But as I get to know people, and as I read the news, I keep finding out that emotional abuse is rampant. I think everyone is hurting, but they&#x27;re usually stuffing it, and then it escapes in unexpected directions, like at Ben Affleck.<p>Therefore Ben Affleck or Taylor Swift is, in a way, the person who hurt them. Ben becomes the avatar of a certain enemy (or perhaps one&#x27;s own repressed shame, maybe he reminds you of you).<p>Such is psychological projection. I didn&#x27;t make it up. I read about it. It&#x27;s usually about projecting onto not-famous people, just people around you. For example, a father might project his own faults onto his son. But now I am thinking of it specifically for people in the spotlight. It makes sense that people who have your attention could become the target of your thoughts.<p>---<p>Coda:<p>A nice side of this theory is that it explains sports fans too. Why do you care about this group of people throwing a ball around in this field down below? Why are you yelling and screaming? Well, because for whatever reason you have decided that they represent you. Maybe it&#x27;s as simple as the team is from Cincinnati, and you live in Cincinnati. Or in the case of college sports, that you went to that college, or your mother did. (I admit I&#x27;m not into sports, and many people root for teams that seem to have nothing to do with them, so this explanation may be incomplete.)<p>---<p>Epilogue:<p>Paul Graham did not treat this possibility, but his conclusion rings true: When people love or hate you unreasonably, it&#x27;s not about you, it&#x27;s about them."],"time":["2020-01-11 16:38:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mhluska"],"id":[22021296],"kids":{},"parent":[22018599],"text":["The conclusion of this post can be summarized as “haters gonna hate”."],"time":["2020-01-11 19:05:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Rerarom"],"id":[22019323],"kids":{},"parent":[22018599],"text":["Now renamed to just &#x27;Haters&#x27;"],"time":["2020-01-11 12:13:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lovemenot"],"id":[22018684],"kids":{},"parent":[22018599],"text":["Haters gonna hate, and &#x27;flaters gonna inflate."],"time":["2020-01-11 08:29:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tipiirai"],"id":[22024653],"kids":{},"parent":[22018599],"text":["This essay makes a strong assumption that haters are haters and fanboys are fanboys.

This makes them ideal for stuff like checking file integrity, message authentication, inputs for cryptographic signatures and the like. But since they’re meant to be fast, they’re very poor choices for hashing low-entropy data such as passwords - attackers can test vast numbers of passwords (even if you salt!!) on GPU hardware.<p>For low-entropy data, you want a hash function that is slow and hard to parallelize. Use a specialized password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt or Argon2, and tune it so it’s slow enough without impacting overall usability (e.g. takes 50ms on your server). These algorithms are resistant to parallelization, so attackers will only be able to test a small number of passwords per second.

BLAKE3 supports an unbounded degree of parallelism, using a tree structure that scales up to any number of SIMD lanes and CPU cores. On Intel Cascade Lake-SP, peak single-threaded throughput is 4× that of BLAKE2b, 8× that of SHA-512, and 12× that of SHA-256, and it can scale further using multiple threads. BLAKE3 is also efficient on smaller architectures [like] 32-bit ARM1176<p>In the introduction, the reason for BLAKE3 is described:<p>&gt; A drawback of BLAKE2 has been its large number of incompatible variants. The performance tradeoffs between different variants are subtle, and library support is uneven. BLAKE2b is the most widely supported, but it is not the fastest on most platforms. BLAKE2bp and BLAKE2sp are more than twice as fast on modern x86 processors, but they are sparsely supported and rarely adopted. BLAKE3 eliminates this drawback.

The most common ones are &#x27;null&#x27; and &#x27;Optional[T]&#x27;. Neither just makes the problem magically go away. If a process is designed (or a programmer writes it) thinking that &#x27;ah, well, here, not-a-value cannot happen&#x27;, but it can, then.. you have a bug.<p>Some language features might make it possible to help reduce how often it occurs, but eliminate it? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Imagine, for example, in an Optional based language, that you just map the optional to a lambda to execute on the optional, and the behaviour of the optional is to then simply silently do nothing if it&#x27;s optional.none. That&#x27;d be a much harder to find bug than a nullpointer error. (errors with stack traces pointing at the problem are obviously vastly superior to mysterious do-nothing behaviour with no logs or traces of any sort!).<p>Some other creative solutions:<p>* [Pony](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ponylang.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ponylang.io&#x2F;<\/a>) tries to be very careful about registering when an object is &#x27;valid&#x27; and when it isn&#x27;t, and when you write code, you have to say which state the objects you interact with can be in. This lets you avoid a lot of the issues... but pony is quite experimental.<p>* In java you can annotate any usage of a type with nullity info, and then compiler linter tools will simply tell you that you have failed to take into account a potential null value. You are then free to ignore these warnings if you&#x27;re just writing test code, or know better. Avoids clogging up the works with optional, but as the java ecosystem shows, you can&#x27;t just snap your fingers and make 30 years of massive community effort instantaneously instantly be festooned with &#x27;might-not-hold-a-value&#x27; style information. At least the annotation style gives the hope of being backwards compatible (to be clear, optional, for java? Really bad idea).<p>* in ObjC, if you send a message to a null pointer, it silently does nothing, in contrast to virtually all other languages with null types where attempting to message a null ref causes an error or even a core dump.<p>* Just write better APIs. Have objects that represent blank state (empty strings, empty collections, perhaps dummy streams which provide no bytes &#x2F; elements, etc). For example, in java: Java&#x27;s map (a dictionary implementation) has the `.get(key)` method which returns the value associated with that key, and returns `null` if there is no such value. About 6 years ago another method was added in a backwards compatible fashion (so, all java map implementations got this automatically): `getOrDefault(key, defaultValue)`. This one returns the provided default value if key isn&#x27;t in the map. You&#x27;d think optionals provide a general mechanism for this, but, in scala, you have both: There&#x27;s `someMap get(key)` which returns an optional, so to get the &#x27;give me a default value&#x27; behaviour, that&#x27;d be `someMap.get(key).getOrElse(defaultValue)`, but maps in scala also have the java shortcut: `someMap.getOrElse(key, defaultValue)`. Sufficient thought in your APIs mostly obviates the issues.<p>null is not a milion dollar mistake. It is a solution to an intrinsic problem with advantages and disadvantages over other solutions."],"time":["2020-01-11 14:51:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mlangenberg"],"id":[22025502],"kids":{},"parent":[22019627],"text":["I was expecting someone to mention the Crystal programming language.<p>In Crystal, types are non-nilable and null references will be caught at compile time.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crystal-lang.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;null-pointer-exception.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crystal-lang.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;null-pointer-exception.h...<\/a><p>I certainly recognize that many bugs in Ruby programs announce themselves as `NoMethodError: undefined method &#x27;&#x27; for nil:NilClass`.

Here are a few tips for visitors:<p>- When interacting with locals, always start off by saying Bonjour Monsieur, Bonjour Madame. That will help disarm cranky Parisians. If doing an AirBnb make sure to do this when seeing people on the “palier” — stair landing in Parisian apartment buildings.<p>- Consider going to the top of the Tour Maine-Montparnasse, instead of the Eiffel Tower. You will have 1&#x2F;100th the foot traffic and you won’t be surrounded by pickpockets.

Indeed, they already had slight mood disorders, or a general malaise, but which remained unexplained or unconscious. &quot;During the consultation, there is often a history that goes unnoticed, which neither the patient nor those around him or her have been aware of. At that time, these people were somehow predisposed to psychic decompensation,&quot; explains Dr. Mahmoudia. And all it takes is a triggering factor for the pathology to reveal itself. Also, being in an unfamiliar environment can lead to a distressing experience and reveal certain disorders. However, the journey is not the only revelation. &quot;The same type of disorder can also occur at home, following a completely different traumatic event such as the loss of a job, a break-up with a loved one, or an assault,&quot; adds Dr. Mahmoudia. But in the context of a trip, what would have been a &quot;banal&quot; depression takes on a much more dramatic expression.<p>In a second case, rare and more serious, the trip is part of the patient&#x27;s delirium, it is part of a pre-existing psychiatric pathology. It is then described as a &quot;pathological journey&quot;. Dr. Mahmoudia remembers this Japanese woman brought to the emergency room for behavioural disorders. &quot;From Tokyo she said she heard the voice of the Virgin Mary begging her to come in front of the Notre-Dame de Paris church. In such a situation, the patient obeys the orders of a voice that he hears, but which is hallucinatory in nature and actually belongs to his own delirium. In other situations, the journey becomes an escape, a survival instinct. &quot;Some patients have only one idea in mind: to flee at all costs from the haunting voice that persecutes them and prevents them from sleeping. Travel can therefore be a symptom, among others, of a pathology that is already known. &quot;The journey then becomes part of a delirious process that belongs to the patient&#x27;s psychiatric picture,&quot; concludes Dr. Mahmoudia.<p>These two situations are different. In one case, the journey is part of the patient&#x27;s delirium, in the other, it is the triggering event of his pathology. But in both situations, Dr. Mahmoudia prefers to speak of pathological travel or travel-related psychopathology, rather than traveller&#x27;s syndrome. The latter term is used incorrectly, as it originally defines a completely different situation. Also called &quot;Stendhal syndrome&quot;, the traveller&#x27;s syndrome is actually a state of ecstasy accompanied by a strong emotional charge when in contact with a work of art. This experience remains quite rare and affects the most sensitive souls. Their heart accelerates, they are taken by vertigo, they suffocate. And then they quickly come to their senses. This emotion is not a real psychological disorder and therefore does not lead to any particular treatment. It was Graziella Magherini, a Florentine psychiatrist who, in 1990, described for the first time this surprising syndrome linked to travelling in art cities. Surprised to receive emotionally shocked tourists, she wondered about the effects of an artistic overdose. She then made a link with Stendhal&#x27;s travel diaries, which in 1817, on leaving the church of Santa Croce in Florence, reported: &quot;I had arrived at that point of emotion where the heavenly sensations given by the Fine Arts and passionate feelings meet. On leaving Santa Croce, I had a heartbeat, life was exhausted at home, I walked with the fear of falling&quot;. These are certainly moving words, but they are not comparable to the emergency cases that Dr. Mahmoudia is able to meet in his consultation.&quot;"],"time":["2020-01-11 23:52:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["55555"],"id":[22024228],"kids":{},"parent":[22020336],"text":["There is a similar Japan syndrome in NEETs and weebs who spend years obsessing over how amazing living in Japan would be and who then finally move there and realize it isn&#x27;t as it is depicted in their anime and porn and on their imageboard"],"time":["2020-01-12 04:16:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wozniacki"],"id":[22021322],"kids":[22021601,22022554,22021767,22021447,22025302,22021552],"parent":[22020336],"text":["Not to put too fine a point, but is this the Paris you&#x27;ve encountered?[1] [2]<p>Do you expect others who&#x27;ve visited Paris to come away with quite a different perception, even being in the same places you were in or objectively no?<p>[1]<p>The Streets of Paris<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z1Js8wntdk4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z1Js8wntdk4<\/a><p>[2]<p>Is My &quot;Paris Streets&quot; Video Fake News?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7Iw1_Zakbb0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7Iw1_Zakbb0<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-11 19:09:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["kevingadd"],"id":[22013242],"kids":[22013478],"parent":[22012511],"text":["&gt; Traffic was moving smoothly.

The city is indeed unique and beautiful and building it in about 4 years is an incredible feat, but the airplane-shaped urban design is <i>terrible<\/i>.<p>It is easy to cross the city from east-west but quite painful to do so north-south. Things are quite far from each other, so it isn&#x27;t common to simply walk: you either drive or take a bus (and the public transportation system is awful) even for the most mundane things. Retail suffers a lot because there is simply not enough people walking close to stores. No day-to-day coffee shop survives because people don&#x27;t take their cars for a regular coffee (only gourmet ones thrive). Even worse, the city is more or less sectorized (hospitals, government buildings, hotels, industry etc are clustered in specific zones), which drives up the number of cars in these areas.<p>Also, the city was planned for ~500k people, up to 1M. The metro area currently has 3.5M inhabitants and is one of the fastest growing metro areas in Brazil. Since the airplane sector cannot be modified, most people end up living in dorm-cities around Brasília even though 95% of them work in the airplane. A commute of 20-50km is pretty standard, so the traffic during rush hours is horrific.<p>At the end of the day, in my opinion, the design really influences how people behave in the city for the worse. Since I left Brasília to live in &quot;normal&quot; cities, both in Brazil and abroad, I came to the conclusion that Brasília became a failed experiment of the Brazilian modern architecture and urbanism.<p>Feel free to ask me anything about my hometown or even disagree with me if you also lived in Brasília!"],"time":["2020-01-11 03:20:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["qwerty456127"],"id":[22017531],"kids":[22018166,22018169],"parent":[22014316],"text":["I&#x27;ve also taken a look into Wikipedia and it says<p>&gt; The city&#x27;s design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector.<p>LOL.

Here we analyse the performance of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 in projecting future global mean surface temperature (GMST) changes. Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model-projected and observationally-estimated forcings were taken into account.<p>&quot;External forcing&quot; means basically CO2 level.
