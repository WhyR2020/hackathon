If you build a factory around here, with as much publicity as Tesla gets, you are going to see protests. There are probably two rare species of mosquitos being released in that forest <i>right now<\/i>.<p>But just the existence of opposition isn&#x27;t very meaningful. Of a few million people, <i>some<\/i> will oppose manna raining from heaven.<p>Does this have a chance to derail the project? Absolutely not!<p>Germany is getting quite nervous of its car industry doing an impressive 4-way re-enactment of Nokia&#x27;s fate, and a significant Tesla presence is just about the best thing imaginable. The local politicians here in Berlin and Brandenburg (the state surrounding Berlin that includes the actual factory) are even more motivated, because it (still) lacks industry. Not one of the top-30 public companies in Germany is located in the east, for example.<p>It&#x27;s also important to mention that the concept of &quot;protests&quot; has significant different meaning here than elsewhere, especially the US: A protest is seen as one method&#x2F;venue&#x2F;institution among the many that make up &quot;civil society&quot;. It carries no connotation of lawlessness[0], and any average citizen, even the blandest centrist, will attend many protests during their life. It&#x27;s often a social event as well, and can include entertainment, somewhat similar to parades in the US.<p>0: some specific protests, like May Day, tend(ed) to involve some violence.

SSDs have a limited lifetime measured in writes, and some of your customers will leave broken programs running that chew through this precious resource for no reason. If you throttle them, they&#x27;ll complain.<p>Then there&#x27;s the support. Handling a support ticket costs you at least $3 in salary and benefits (remember, your typical customer pays $5&#x2F;mo), and people will demand that you help them fix their broken MySQL server or whatever. They&#x27;ll yell and threaten when you tell them that this is outside the scope of what you can do.<p>And don&#x27;t forget security. Your customers will install broken-ass Wordpress sites and forget to upgrade them for 5 years. Then a worm sweeps through and now a whole bunch of them have been pwned and are mining cryptocurrency. Those pwned customers are complaining and demanding that you fix it, and the regular customers are also upset because of slowness due to the &quot;noisy neighbor&quot; problem inherent to all VPSes.<p>Speaking of which, preventing one VPS from hogging all the CPU or disk bandwidth is harder than it looks. The two dominant software platforms are Xen and KVM, and neither gives you great tools for dealing with disk bandwidth. Limiting CPU is much easier, but there&#x27;s still the problem that you&#x27;re overselling. Which is fine until half the VPSes on your machine are trying to mine Ethereum.<p>On the bright side: half your customers will buy the VPS, leave it running, and forget about it for years at a time.

With that said, I still know enough about the business to say the following.<p>Been reading about developers, business owners, etc worrying about your application stability or fearing the need to migrate to another infrastructure, all warrented feelings. I want to share some thoughts as an (old)insider.<p>DIGITALOCEAN IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. You don’t make $200M+ in ARR and all of a sudden shutdown. Especially as a company who has always prioritized the BEST product experience. Prioritized the BEST customer experience. If you’ve been a customer of DO, you know they go above and beyond you. DigitalOcean’s offering is still by far the most developer-friendly and delightful infrastructure experience on the market.<p>One of my biggest frustrations when I worked there was the lack of advanced features offered for scaling applications, I&#x27;m shockingly surprised that in the past few years they quickly launched Kubernetes, Database as a service, and Object Storage, granted all table stake stuff that AWS already has, but nevertheless has made DigitalOcean a very mature product. I&#x27;m low-key annoyed they didn&#x27;t launch this when customers were yelling at me as the customer success point person, begging for all these features...anyways good for those that are customers today :)<p>As the co-founder mentioned above, the business has gone through several CEO changes with the purpose of preparing for an even grander expansion. So far hasn&#x27;t worked as planned. When leadership changes, rockiness always occurs, and it’s up to the next CEO to steer the ship. I don&#x27;t know the new CEO and have no clue if he&#x27;s any good, but I wish him good luck. Layoffs happen when businesses are tanking, but they also happen when a business is preparing for another launch at greatness. I&#x27;m truly empathetic to those that were laid off today, as a fellow DO-Shark that can&#x27;t feel good. Even though you are likely folks I&#x27;ve never met, my thought are with you.<p>If you are a developer, DigitalOcean will always be a place for you to incubate, innovate, and grow your business.

Should I build a custom version or just use $distro&#x27;s pre-packaged version? How do I tell my Makefile&#x2F;configure&#x2F;CMakeLists where to find the headers and libraries?<p>This is generally a bad thing. It leads to NIH, to poor portability, to difficult integration in other dev environments etc... But it does mean that you carefully consider every dependency that you must use. The quality of the packaging is often an indication of the quality of the code too, a well polished build system inspires confidence, a crappy buggy bespoke shell script less so.<p>Meanwhile take this example: I&#x27;ve re-started working on a PlayStation emulator a few weeks ago.

That&#x27;s 0 dependencies.<p>But then I wanted to add some basic logging infrastructure to be able to do &#x27;warn!(&quot;this thing shouldn&#x27;t happen&quot;)&#x27; or &#x27;debug!(&quot;this register has value {:x}&quot;, val&quot;)&#x27;. I could just use println! but, hey, adding dependencies is super easy and I&#x27;ll end up with more flexible and expressive code, so let&#x27;s do that instead.

The maintainer of the actix project had a particularly terrible experience of escalating harassment from the users of this subreddit, and its extremely sad. This has caused a lot of grief for the maintainer of actix and prevented real (but <i>far<\/i> overblown) code issues from being fixed in a productive way.<p>But I think Steve undersells the absurdity of the unsafe anxiety. Some Rust commmunity members are conflating two wildly different scenarios together. The first is a library exposing an API which, if used in an unlikely and contrived way, could result in a program using that library containing undefined behavior. Then, since that program has undefined behavior, it could contain a memory bug. If that were the case, someone could potentially exploit that bug to attack a user of that program. You&#x27;ll notice this is a series of conditional statements - its a funnel of decreasing probability.<p>So yes, library APIs which can allow UB in safe code - even unlikely and contrived safe code - must be fixed. The goal of Rust is that safe APIs can never cause UB. But people should have a proportionate understanding of the risk profile of these bugs (again: a programmer using this API in an unlikely way could create a program with a bug that could potentially be exploitable). This is a miniscule increase in the <i>risk<\/i> of another heartbleed, it is not <i>the same thing<\/i> as heartbleed.<p>The spark that lit the kindling of the toxic Reddit community was a blog post by Shnatsel, a member of the RustSec team. This blog post didn&#x27;t get attention here, but I want to take a moment to look at how ridiculously it frames things by examining its analysis of a different project: reqwest (sort of the most standard HTTP client library in Rust).<p>Here&#x27;s the link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@shnatsel&#x2F;smoke-testing-rust-http-clients-b8f2ee5db4e6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@shnatsel&#x2F;smoke-testing-rust-http-clients...<\/a><p>The fuzz test, which is what the library is about, found no security issues. It found some hangs in 6% of cases and Shnatsel traces them to a known deadlock issue. This is a great result.<p>But Shnatsel spends most of this talking about a custom hashmap implemented in the http library, which the RustSec group did a security audit of just a few months ago. That security audit found only two issues, both UB that would result from a contrived use of a minor library API (they are linked in the blog post, but not explained). These two issues were fixed, and the fix released, by the maintainers of the http crate in 10 days.<p>This is an incredible success! The security audit of a foundational library found two minor issues which were promptly fixed, and the fuzz confirms that the entire stack on top of it seems to contain no memory issues. Wonderful result, but how does Shnatsel frame this?<p>&gt; First things first: it didn’t segfault! I am actually impressed because I had really low expectations going into this.<p>Come on! The blog post is full of these kinds of snide zingers which are totally unfounded in the face of the actual evidence presented. When you have someone writing in this disingenuous, meanspirited way about open source maintainers and then putting this in front of a groupthinking rage machine community like Reddit, of course you&#x27;re going to get harassment.

YOU are responsible for your dependencies.<p>&gt; 2. Open source participants are volunteers and owe you nothing.<p>The above is true. But there&#x27;s another aspect here, that of cultural norms, implied goals and the expectations derived therefrom.<p>By my observation of mailing lists, hacker&#x27;s blogs, my own attempts at contributing to various projects, and other things, there&#x27;s come to be a set of expectations of the authors, maintainers, contributors, and even to some degree, users, of FOSS projects. These expectations are not set in stone; they can be shaped by the statements and actions of the maintainer(s), implicit or explicit, or the lack thereof. But there is nonetheless a default set of expectations. A set of social norms, if you will.<p>One of the expectations I&#x27;ve observed, and discovered I myself had absorbed through cultural osmosis, is thus: A maintainer should make clear what a project&#x27;s goals are, and earnestly consider patches&#x2F;pull-requests offered in good faith support of a project&#x27;s explicit or implicit goals. They should communicate clearly technical facts, concerns, and considerations when discussing or debating an offered patch. Said discussion should be focused only around the technical facts as they relate to the goals of the project and the offered patch. And if the patch is rejected, the maintainer should clearly communicate why. Said communication could be a long essay expounding on the technical trade-offs the project has had to make, or a simple link to a FAQ entry covering why such-and-such common patch type will never be accepted. (In that latter case, presumably the earnest consideration of that patch type had happened sometime in the past).<p>A related norm, one tying back in to ddevault&#x27;s post, is the contributor&#x27;s end of that exchange. One offering a patch should accept a rejection with grace. A contributor can and should be willing to discuss and debate and try to persuade a maintainer how the offered patch actually does align with the project&#x27;s goals after all. But he should do so only with technical facts and logical argument, not fallacies, emotional manipulation, name calling, threats, or other such juvenile BS. To persist and pester after a final decision has been made is a violation of that norm. Thus, it is as equally gauche for a contributor to tell a maintainer to die in a fire after a rejection as it is for a maintainer to state he doesn&#x27;t accept patches from people who voted for the Labor party in 2017.<p>None of the above invalidates ddevault&#x27;s assertions. However, IMO, social norms serve as a sort of oil on the machinery of the human interaction inevitable in collaborative projects. A person rightly gets upset when those social norms are violated. But, there are right and wrong ways to respond.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen of this kerfluffle so far, it is a violation of those norms which led to this mess.<p>Recall what I said about a project&#x27;s goals, above. Rust&#x27;s explicit goals of memory safety, thread safety, etc, IMO carry with them an implicit goal of making for secure programs, by making it easier to avoid the kind of mistakes that cause programs to become insecure. I&#x27;m not a rustacean, but it seems to me that at least part of the wider Rust community is working on making that implicit goal an explicit one. And so, by building your project with Rust, that goal of a secure implementation transitively becomes one of your project&#x27;s goals, at least implicitly. If it&#x27;s not, you had better explicitly state otherwise. And if you do, I don&#x27;t think you should be particularly surprised when some push back.<p>And so we come to the violation of social norms. I can&#x27;t find any before-the-kerfluffle articulation of actix-web being a for-fun project. So, actix-web was seen as having the goal of being sound and secure, by virtue of being implemented in Rust. And here was Nikolay&#x27;s virst violation: failing to make clear the goals of the project. If after that first instance of &#x27;unresponsive maintaner&#x27;, as steveklabnik puts it, Nikolay had made clear his main goals were being fast as possible and winning the benchmarks, that soundness and security were non-goals, and he had firmly and politely held his ground on that, I think the kerfluffle could have ended there. If he&#x27;d made those goals explicit then, then other users would have been able to take a look at the project, and see that all that Unsafe code was probably not something Nikolay cared about changing, and so know they need not offer patches for it.<p>But since that wasn&#x27;t done, we come to the next violation: not earnestly considering those patches offered in good faith -- or at least seeming to. Because of the impedance mismatch between Nikolay&#x27;s actual goals and those seeming goals of actix-web, he seemed to not take seriously those patches offered.<p>As I said above, there&#x27;s a right way and a wrong way to respond to such things. And sadly, the response by some was to violate the contributor&#x27;s end of the bargain: accepting a patch rejection with grace. By responding with out-of-line remarks like &quot;please stop using Rust&quot;, the quality of the discourse degrades, and shit rapidly gets toxic.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would have been a violation of norms to call out all the use of Unsafe, and the various ways it was unsound, or even to advocate that others should not use actix-web, so long doing so stayed fact-based and did so somewhere other than the actix-web bug-tracker. As far as I can tell, the smoke test of HTTP clients did that. I haven&#x27;t dug deep into the Reddit thread, but if there was personal attacks on Nikolay, I&#x27;d not be surprised.<p>What have I learned from this, despite not being part of the Rust community? Well, if nothing else, it highlights the importance of clear communication. In any future projects, I will need to make what my goals (and non-goals) are as clear as possible. I will also need be willing to clarify things when there seems to be an impedance mismatch between my goals for a project, and what a contributor thinks they are or should be. And I&#x27;m going to have to develop a thick skin and the ability to de-escalate, because some people are going to respond with perceived rudeness from me with deliberate rudeness of their own.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s a naive take on it. I welcome suggestions on how to improve it.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22075346\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22075346<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-18 00:54:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rezeroed"],"id":[22076739],"kids":{},"parent":[22075076],"text":["I deleted the issue - I regret that.

A lot of answers were that the profession did not fit their life, they felt the environment to be alien and uncomfortable, and they didn&#x27;t feel like they fit in the work culture.<p>What the study also found was that the remaining male teacher that did stay tended to enter specialties such as PE and STEM subject, and away from subjects like langue and social studies. Many who left did so for similar profession outside of the education system such as sport.<p>So here we have women and men, both being described as a leaky pipe, both leaving at similar rates, both describing similar reasons for leaving, both finding specialties where they are not a minority. Could there be a common theory rather than two separate theories to explain this?<p>And the government study had such suggestion. There is research that is now about 50 years old that observed that people who are in an environment as a minority does not feel same confidence in themselves as those being part of the majority. When faced with a failure such as a missed exam, and making a decision to continue, being part of a majority increase the probability of the person continuing. The government study suggested that if you apply this theory over the time frame of a teacher career from the point of student to being a long term employee, what you get is a leaky pipe. It also suggested the solution that mentor ship programs helps in reducing this.<p>I also recall that a while back a women in IT imitative that said that of all their work, what had actually produced results was their mentor program. Seems like a pretty good evidence to me, and as a universal theory it seems pretty good explanation to explain the situation for both men and women."],"time":["2020-01-18 02:20:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jkingsbery"],"id":[22078795],"kids":{},"parent":[22077603],"text":["I&#x27;m totally on board with making changes that address concerns for women specifically.<p>That being said, as someone not in academia, it seems like a crazy path for anyone, male or female.

There are three factors that influence this, IMO:<p>(1) The OSS community has trended towards an insular culture incentivized by OSS popularity where stars and Twitter followers are status signals. In this world, it’s hard for talented engineers to stop seeking “star status” and transition to the business ecosystem where they’re bottom rung of the ladder.<p>(2) The space is extremely sophisticated — with longer R&amp;D cycles — and VCs routinely incentivize suboptimal growth trajectories when they’ve identified apparent winners and miss opportunities with more practically iterative companies. (Expecting growth at all costs in a space where continuous delivery + R&amp;D is the norm.) This blows up some companies early and prematurely kills other promising technologies. I think the 18mo expected cycle time probably needs to be adjusted for these companies, <i>especially<\/i> early stage.<p>(3) Founders are heavily pressured towards exits. Long R&amp;D cycle time, the pressure cooker of VC growth expectations, and the rarity of high-ownership, customer-oriented developer tool + engineering talent makes early exits extremely attractive for both founding teams and acquirers.<p>How do we fix this?

You have to drive 20,000 miles to get down the ballpark of the IRS number. This indicates that expenses affected by mileage like gas, maintenance, and depreciation are dominated by up front costs like insurance and taxes. Now consider that most door dash drivers already chose to have a car before working for door dash, so they will have to pay the up front costs regardless. For this reason, I don&#x27;t think $0.58 per mile is a good estimate of the marginal cost associated with extra driving for door dash. The AAA report estimates gas and maintenance costs per mile at $0.17 to $0.23 depending on the type of car.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t believe it is right to include depreciation in a household budget because it does not manifest as an additional cost on top of the price of the car. Unless the car is listed as a line item on your household budget, you don&#x27;t have to account for any additional loss in value. Imagine that you bought a car in cash for $1000 and never drive it. You lose the $1000 immediately. If some years later the car is worth $0, your total cost of ownership is still just $1000, not $2000.<p>I believe the fact that people still chose to work for door dash is additional evidence that the estimated costs in this article are too high. We may not be perfect rational actors, but most of us can tell if our bank account is going up or down.<p>None of this excuses the unethical behavior of door dash, and personally I choose not to use them. I believe tips are intended as a gift to the driver, so it is misleading to call it a tip if the driver isn&#x27;t getting it. That said, I didn&#x27;t find this analysis convincing for the reasons above."],"time":["2020-01-17 17:21:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["koolba"],"id":[22071570],"kids":{},"parent":[22070318],"text":["Do DoorDash or if it’s competitors allow delivery drivers to set their own prices or max distances before receiving bids?<p>For example, can you say in advance “<i>Only accept $25+ jobs<\/i>” or “<i>Max distance 5 miles<\/i>”?"],"time":["2020-01-17 04:21:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thomk"],"id":[22074819],"kids":[22079943,22075183],"parent":[22070318],"text":["Yeah, f<i>ck DoorDash.<p>DoorDash is the worst of all of these types of gig services.

The obvious problem is that I can’t see customers paying that much for delivery - ie. at those wages Door Dash can’t exist.<p>The fact that people choose to do the work makes me think there are people who find it worthwhile, and I can explain a few scenarios that make a lot more sense than the ones in the article:<p>I live in SF, which is only about 7mi by 7mi square, so if you do door dash here it’s very unlikely for a delivery to require more than 2-3 mi of travel. Further I see a lot of deliveries made on bikes, skateboards, scooters, etc. so the cost is much lower than the suburban deliveries made by car.<p>I see a lot of young delivery people, who I imagine may be high school or college students who just want a few bucks spending money without any kind of time commitment, and maybe this works nicely for them.<p>Regulating the wages to try and turn door dash into a “family feeding” job seems like it would do nothing but kill the business (and all the gig businesses), depriving people who want that kind of ultimate flexibility of the freedom and also depriving customers of a really convenient service.<p>But I <i>do<\/i> think regulation could be very beneficial in creating transparency around payment to both the customer and the gig worker. I can see no reason the companies should be allowed to obscure what they pay their workers, where tips for, how many miles the worker traveled on a job etc. That kind of information is fair and reasonable to provide, and would help avoid gig companies exploiting people who unfortunately may not understand how to properly value their expenses.<p>The final thing I would argue is that it’s reasonable to prohibit <i>blind<\/i> auctions, as door dash does.<p>Instead of randomly pairing a person to a job, giving them only seconds to respond, and penalizing them (by not offering more) if they fail to respond, it would be much more fair to have a real-time auction map showing all deliveries that need to be picked up in a certain area, where they need to go, how much the pay is, and then letting them “sit on the map” and slowly tick up in price until a worker picks one. That’s a half-baked brainstorm so maybe that’s not the right implementation, but my point is simply:<p>1. I think regulating gig wages is a blunt instrument that would mostly end the gig companies and possibly entrench one or two mega corps as survivors that are still exploitive toward workers - whereas providing information transparency could potentially preserve the good things about gig jobs while eliminating the majority of bad outcomes for workers.<p>2.

It was something about a completely lock-free operating system optimized using run-time code generation, written from scratch in assembly running on a homemade two-CPU SMP with a two-word compare-and-swap instruction - you know, nothing fancy. The print-out I was holding was Alexia (formerly Henry) Massalin&#x27;s PhD thesis, Synthesis: An Efficient Implementation of Fundamental Operating Systems Services (html version here). Dutifully, I read the entire 158 pages. At the end, I realized that I understood not a word of it, right up to and including the cartoon of a koala saying &quot;QUA!&quot; at the end. Okay, I exaggerate - lock-free algorithms had been a hobby of mine for the previous few months - but the main point I came away with was that there was a lot of cool stuff in operating systems that I had yet to learn.<p>&gt;Every year or two after that, I&#x27;d pick up my now bedraggled copy of &quot;Synthesis&quot; and reread it, and every time I would understand a little bit more. First came the lock-free algorithms, then the run-time code generation, then quajects. The individual techniques were not always new in and of themselves, but in Synthesis they were developed, elaborated, and implemented throughout a fully functioning UNIX-style operating system. I still don&#x27;t understand all of Synthesis, but I understand enough now to realize that my grad student friend was right: anyone really interested in operating systems should read this thesis.<p>Other interesting mentions:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19598385\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19598385<\/a><p>&gt;Massalin&#x27;s Synthesis kernel [10] stands out to me as another example that for me crosses the boundaries and is both outstanding engineering and art in challenging the ideas of how systems could be built in ways that make me look at it just as much because of the beauty of it as because of the practical ideas. (The main thing it brought was the idea of making the kernel adapt to its clients by generating custom code for system calls; to me it is art because it turned the idea of a kernel as something static on its head; and conceptually we&#x27;re still just scraping the very surface of dynamic code generation in kernels that Massalin&#x27;s thesis started playing with). There are many works like that, where the specific implementations are irrelevant - nobody uses the Synthesis kernel - but where the ideas are as important as any expressed in more overt or &quot;intentional&quot; art.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20507155\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20507155<\/a><p>&gt;ggm: It feels to me like if you can do runtime code call checks, and confirm which actual calls you make, then stripping the bits of libc and associated libraries out, being left with only the strictly required calls, and then by extension the syscalls, and then by extension the kernel elements, is actually possible a lot of the time. So, library -&gt; reduced library -&gt; reduced calls -&gt; reduced syscalls -&gt; reduced kernel state is a sequence or set or something, of applied minimisations which can be done, if you can predict all the call paths in your code and their dependencies.<p>&gt;NelsonMinar: That sounds a little like the ideas in the Synthesis kernel, the idea of the kernel JIT-compiling itself to optimize your code path."],"time":["2020-01-17 09:40:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22073374],"kids":{},"parent":[22055020],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-17 11:01:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["monocasa"],"id":[22074209],"kids":{},"parent":[22055020],"text":["&gt; Although Call Gates are the somewhat official way of implementing system calls in the absence of the more modern alternatives discussed below, I’m aware of no use except by malware.<p>I think 386BSD and early FreeBSD used call gates for syscalls."],"time":["2020-01-17 14:00:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TheDesolate0"],"id":[22073666],"kids":{},"parent":[22055020],"text":["Was reading this article while waiting for my kernel to build.<p>bwrawp giving my LFS nightmares, and I&#x27;m not super keen on user_namespace, but suid isn&#x27;t working either, FML"],"time":["2020-01-17 12:06:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Paperweight"],"id":[22072955],"kids":[22073558,22073231,22075065],"parent":[22055020],"text":["I wonder if mainstream CPUs will ever get back to being truly programmable with software instructions, instead of running off and speculating on what you might do next."],"time":["2020-01-17 09:42:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trumbitta2"],"id":[22072953],"kids":[22097367],"parent":[22055020],"text":["Generate thermal element.<p>Form arrow shape.<p>Discharge!"],"time":["2020-01-17 09:42:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryantgtg"],"id":[22079802],"kids":[22082862,22080896,22094881,22085813,22081242],"parent":[22079160],"text":["HN suggested I repost this, since last time it didn’t get much attention (cool feature!).<p>Here is the description I wrote last time:<p>Hi, Pinball Map is a hobby project we&#x27;ve been doing in our spare time for the past 10 years. It&#x27;s currently listing 7,291 locations and 24,918 machines. Code is on github[1][2], and we have an API that is used by various folks.<p>Web Stack = ruby on rails, heroku, tile server on aws. App = React Native (launched the redeveloped app last June).<p>We took a relatively slow-growth approach for the first 9 years: we added &quot;regions&quot; one at a time for places where people demonstrated a strong desire to update the data, and a volunteeer administrator could oversee it (in fact, we originally intended for this to just be a map of pinball machines in Portland, Oregon, but people kept asking us to expand to their areas). This gave us a pretty strong userbase and a reputation for having clean, up-to-date data. Each regional map was a distinct, silo&#x27;d map. Lately we&#x27;ve de-emphasized this model in favor of a single map that covers the whole world.<p>For the first 7 years, all map updates were made anonymously. But after two instances of abuse, we implemented a user system. We now have about 9,000 registered users. The map gets around 3,000-5,000 edits per month, including 100-200 new locations.<p>Search experience on the web could use some updating. The app is where it&#x27;s at right now. We spent the past 14 months on its design&#x2F;development, and we think it came out well. Throughout the 10 years, the majority of our users use the app rather than the website (but we don&#x27;t have great analytics).<p>We have no ads, no analytics aside from the free new relic stuff that comes with heroku, and no business model.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scottwainstock&#x2F;pbm&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scottwainstock&#x2F;pbm&#x2F;<\/a> [2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bpoore&#x2F;pbm-react\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bpoore&#x2F;pbm-react<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-17 22:49:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryantgtg"],"id":[22079730],"kids":[22080398],"parent":[22079160],"text":["Someone just anonymously noted that we need to credit OSM contributors (so I can’t respond to them, but will respond here).

There are also some 16-pin integrated circuits, encased in pink plastic.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that flatpacks (both ceramic and EP) were and probably still are a mainstay of military and aero electronics. These were never used in consumer electronics. Apart from microprocessors and EEPROMs, consumer electronics never really used ceramic or hermetic metal packages for cost reasons. Perhaps the most common components would be TO-3 power transistors and small metal can transistors before TO-92 and similar packages obsoleted all of those.<p>&gt; Many of the components in the power supply look different from American components.

We moved out here for a startup, but shortly after relocating the founder ran out of money and could no longer pay me. This was a huge shock because on the surface everything was fine and dandy. Got totally bamboozled.<p>I still remember walking into our co-working spot to pick up some mail and was told that I should leave the premisis becuase our bills were way past due and I could not have access to our mail. I was like uhh wow holy shit, he isn&#x27;t paying you either. That was a surreal moment.<p>After the move and the shit show of the startup, our savings had basically evaporated. I had to get to work ASAP. I am very fortunate to have a support group of friends and family and was able to land a gig working on a Rails-based ecommerce site for a furniture company.<p>Fast forward to now and I am still a freelance consultant with usually 3-4 clients or projects happening simultaneously. I have done pretty well for myself, but the last year was one of the most stressful and chaotic years of my life. I am seriously struggling with my mental health.<p>Throughout the entire time we&#x27;ve been able to save a little more money, but all-in-all we are pissing away a tremendous amount of cash every month on our rent and other expenses that are a little higher here in CA. Moving here to Orange County was predicated on the killer salary from the new gig.<p>The current plan is to head back to Michigan. My wife&#x27;s family is all there, so as far as a state to flee to it makes the most sense. Our rent will cut in half for what will be a far bigger property with a lot more breathing room. An idea we are tossing around is buying land and building our own home from scratch, which is something we could never even imagine doing here in California.<p>I think that I have a tougher time appreciating all the wonderful things our state has to offer. Having grown up here I just see all the traffic and density and lack of breathing room and want to head for the hills. It makes the higher living cost tougher to swallow. Plus, knowing we&#x27;ll really never be able to afford the kind of property and home that we know we can have over in Michigan, it makes sense to get out of here without planting deep roots again."],"time":["2020-01-17 23:01:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shaneprrlt"],"id":[22079643],"kids":[22081056,22081854],"parent":[22078141],"text":["Illinoisan here, have a lot of family and friends that have escaped.

Looks like Ohio is attracting more immigrants from other countries, than people from other states.<p>Really think it&#x27;s a shame tech is so centralized in a handful of cities, but I do see things like warm weather and walkability attracting people. I&#x27;d love to live somewhere where I wouldn&#x27;t be far from my office, places to eat and shop without needing a car. I figured maybe around where the domain in Austin would be a cool place to live maybe. Seems like it&#x27;s cheap to live in Ohio but not much to do other than drinking, playing video games, bowling or doing drugs (Dayton was ranked top city for heroin overdoses) and not that many jobs in tech, and then even huge loss in manufacturing too.<p>I know people say Austin is the next Silicon Valley, but I feel like the cost of living for housing keeps going up, so sounds like going to have similar problems as in California.

So I think a simpler tax structure would be nice. I kinda feel there should just be one tax only to simplify things, and let the cities or states argue over who gets what. Then some tax software won&#x27;t even help with city taxes, I think Michigan that&#x27;s the case since cities haven&#x27;t standardized on things, I know there was a proposal in Ohio for the state to collect city taxes on the city behalf and redistribute them to the cities while charging the cities a service fee but the cities didn&#x27;t like that idea. I know some cities go as high as 2.5% percent, I think it&#x27;s a little insane some cities with less population and square miles of Utah needs to collect half of what the entire state of Utah collects, makes me feel like there&#x27;s a lot of waste or people are paid too highly working for the city."],"time":["2020-01-17 23:28:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["glofish"],"id":[22079279],"kids":[22080357,22080070,22079290],"parent":[22078141],"text":["Considering that Florida is slowly but surely going underwater it is weird to see it as the most popular destination to move to."],"time":["2020-01-17 22:02:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[22078938],"kids":{},"parent":[22078141],"text":["<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;vo0cm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;vo0cm<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-17 21:34:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22079293],"kids":{},"parent":[22078141],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-17 22:03:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["GhettoChild"],"id":[22080549],"kids":{},"parent":[22078141],"text":["Look at cheap states with no state income Tax.

They want to move there for the big bucks in tech, but they don&#x27;t want to be a minority party&#x2F;culture. CA has lots of problems, but when I hear &quot;housing is too expensive, lots of homelessness and petty crime, AND it&#x27;s so liberal that they just can&#x27;t fix anything,&quot; I know the last one is the key. They complain about the NIMBYs who keep real-estate prices high (as if that were the only thing), complain that no one is building denser housing, then leave and move to sprawling suburbia with it&#x27;s HOAs and de-facto segregated zoning. Go try to build a 4-plex in your new neighborhood, then get back to us.<p>Cue all the complaints about the entrenched residents in their Prop 13 homes or rent-controlled units, building permits and red tape nightmares. Yes, there is a problem. You not making it and having to move away (after moving there 2 or 3 years ago) is not the problem. Look at it this way, the system is working for 80-90% of the long-term residents, and they&#x27;re aware of the hardships for the disadvantaged among them. Why should they go out of their way to accomodate conservatives who want to undermine their tax-and-spend heaven?<p>As for the Democrats who leave CA and vote Democrat elsewhere, why not? They didn&#x27;t get in early enough on this wealth train (OK, jokes about CAHSR will be tolerated), so they&#x27;re going somewhere else, and trying to get it started there. CA is defined by excess of liberal values, elswhere by lack, so they&#x27;re just trying to bring some moderation. They won&#x27;t be very successful, and I will tell them not to go whining about the conservative values in their new home, so there.<p>California just is. It&#x27;s the world&#x27;s 4th largest economy by itself. For good or ill, it&#x27;s home to so many internet companies (and other industries) that have made so much money in the internet revolution that it has skewed its cost-of-living and real-estate markets off the charts. It has made many of its residents fabulously weathly, both in relative and absolute terms, and they want to stay and enjoy it mostly the way it is. In SF&#x2F;SV, it has redefined middle-class at around 300K combined income, and that money (at least what&#x27;s not dedicated to housing) drives a lot of other sectors (public transit, restaurants, and other quality-of-life businesses). Yeah, I know, all those have issues and&#x2F;or are overpriced, no need to comment to say that. It also leans very liberal in the coastal cities, meaning tolerance, compassion, social justice, sanctuary, etc. It seems like they still have a democracy, and since they&#x27;re still the majority, they get to keep experimenting. It&#x27;s not going anywhere, and it&#x27;s not going to change much, and certainly not because of the whining.

These are in-band audio tones used to cause some receivers to open squelch as a form of selective calling.<p>The method is predominantly used in public safety radio systems, where tone paging may be used to cause a fixed receiver in a station to open squelch (triggering an alarm) or cause a portable paging receiver (like a Motorola Minitor) to open squelch as a simple form of paging. Rural VFDs often rely on the latter to call out volunteers.<p>Anyway, the world of in-band signaling in voice communications is really pretty interesting, and while digital systems have reduced the need for in-band there are still a lot of real-world systems that rely on it for compatibility with legacy equipment. The telephone system has largely moved on (except for various niche uses of DTMF) but in-band signaling is still pretty common in radio systems, where upgrading to a digital system is high cost and comes with its own limitations.<p>Another example off-hand: most large-area public address systems, the type of thing the military often calls Giant Voice and might be used for tornado warning in some areas, use either DTMF or SelCall (five-tone) on the control radio channel (which in many cases is the same radio system used by public safety portable radios) to cause the loudspeakers to activate. A particular oddity of a lot of these systems is that they have different generations of receivers that use different methods, so sometimes you&#x27;ll end up hearing the tones played aloud if a receiver opens squelch in reaction to something earlier in the sequence.<p>And a last example, also usually seen in public safety - some radio schemes like MDC transmit a burst that sounds like a roger beep whenever the PTT is released, but is actually a short data packet that identifies the transmitting radio. This allows a specially equipped base station to show e.g. a dispatcher who was just transmitting. Sometimes the same signaling system is used to implement other features like &#x27;man down&#x27; detection where a radio signals if it is not upright or has not moved for a period of time (common safety feature in fire departments), but sometimes these kinds of systems also just use a sample-based speech synthesizer if there&#x27;s no digital system already in use.<p>Oh, I can&#x27;t resist one more. The &quot;buzz,&quot; repeated three times, which proceeds emergency alert messages in the US is actually a short data packet which gives certain metadata about the alert and causes hardware in receiving radio stations (the system operates a bit like a &quot;calling tree&quot;) to cut out the program audio and switch over the received alert. The two-tone beep which follows is a legacy system for the same purpose, although today no such receivers should still be in use. It&#x27;s amusing that many phones use that two-tone signal as their ringtone for emergency alerts considering how divorced that is from its original purpose, but it&#x27;s quite recognizable. Emergency alert messages should be followed by a three shorter data bursts which inform receivers that the alert is over. A closely related scheme is used by NOAA All-Hazards Radio to cause dedicated &quot;weather emergency&quot; receivers in people&#x27;s homes to open squelch, these are more common in tornado-prone areas but generally work throughout the US. As the name suggests, All-Hazards also retransmits alerts from agencies other than NOAA including emergency alert system messages."],"time":["2020-01-17 17:58:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bilekas"],"id":[22074232],"kids":[22075224,22074826,22074833,22076300,22074316,22074906,22075434,22074538,22075140,22077745,22079167,22074753,22077143,22074504,22075311,22075462,22078484,22077594],"parent":[22061174],"text":["&gt; if NASA wanted to send control signals like transmit on and off, they’d need to run a whole parallel set of wires, which would be expensive.

See the 79 page complaint from my last link, filed just last month. They have a template lawsuit that&#x27;s dozens of pages long, and they just fill in the specific seller details. They have a bunch of screenshots of negative customer reviews, but those are from Amazon broadly and are not connected to the seller they&#x27;re suing - they use the same negative reviews for all their lawsuits. (It looks like they have two negative feedback for popsocket sales traced to that account out of the many pages of negative reviews that isn&#x27;t connected to an account.)<p>To be clear, they are not alleging counterfeits in the lawsuits. The claim is that the product doesn&#x27;t carry the manufacturer warranty, and that sellers don&#x27;t follow the right quality controls, both of which are very shaky claims legally (warranty restrictions are problematic under federal law, and there&#x27;s no serious quality control concern on sealed electronics accessory products - it&#x27;s the same product in the same warehouses, it doesn&#x27;t magically become lower quality just because a different seller is selling it. There&#x27;s a potential quality control concern with groceries or products requiring temperature controls, but it stretches credibility to argue that applies to sealed popsockets.) But a small seller can&#x27;t afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars it takes to get a court decision affirming that. I know multiple sellers that have settled rather than fighting it. It&#x27;s the path of least resistance.<p>Popsockets is not the only brand that&#x27;s been using these abusive tactics. There&#x27;s a string of lawsuits by Otterbox, Skullcandy, GNC, Murad, Standard Process, Noco, and others.

For myself, I think it gets the balance of complexity wrong: it focuses on shifting various things into JavaScript, rather than doing it all in CSS using the (prefers-color-scheme) media query, and <i>rewriting<\/i> media queries to achieve manual switching.<p>As a demonstration of the alternative approach I advocate, see what I came up with for my own website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrismorgan.info&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dark-theme-implementation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrismorgan.info&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dark-theme-implementation&#x2F;<\/a>. This uses native CSS techniques, working completely without JavaScript, merely using JavaScript to allow the user to manually switch, retaining that preference for future page loads and optimising page loading just about as far as is possible when doing it client-side to minimise the probability of a flash of inverted content if you manually switched to the opposite of what (prefers-color-scheme) would have chosen.<p>The main thing that my approach doesn’t do that this thing does is dispatching an event, so that other JavaScript could conveniently be notified of a theme change. This is fairly deliberate on my part (I deliberately do all theme switching with CSS, and have no JavaScript that needs to change anything for dark mode), but could readily be added to what I wrote if desired.<p>With my approach (for which I will also clarify that the JavaScript is deliberately written for compactness, not some theoretical notion of maintainability or extensibility), the example:<p><pre><code>  &lt;button id=&quot;dm-toggle&quot;&gt;Toggle darkmode&lt;&#x2F;button&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    const darkmode = new darken({\n      toggle: &quot;#dm-toggle&quot;,\n      variables: {\n        &quot;--primary-color&quot;: [&quot;#ffffff&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;],\n        &quot;--secondary-color&quot;: [&quot;#000000&quot;, &quot;#ffffff&quot;],\n      }\n    });\n  &lt;&#x2F;script&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n… would be written more like this:<p><pre><code>  &lt;script&gt;\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; (Add the button to the document in JS,\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; since it’ll only work if this JS runs anyway.)\n  &lt;&#x2F;script&gt;\n  &lt;style&gt;\n    body {\n      --primary-color: #ffffff;\n      --secondary-color: #000000;\n    }\n  &lt;&#x2F;style&gt;\n  &lt;style media=&quot;screen and (prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot;&gt;\n    body {\n      --primary-color: #000000;\n      --secondary-color: #ffffff;\n    }\n  &lt;&#x2F;style&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n(Two style blocks because my thing doesn’t deal with `@media … { … }` inline in CSS, because I don’t need it.

And so they proceeded to massively subsidize right wing politicians, work with organized crime to intimidate and disrupt unionized workers, and gather intelligence against opposition to the LDP’s rule.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1994&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;world&#x2F;cia-spent-millions-to-support-japanese-right-in-50-s-and-60-s.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1994&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;world&#x2F;cia-spent-millions-...<\/a><p>So if you want to understand why the country has devolved into this kind of crushing exploitation and culture of suffering, you really need to begin with the fact that the US rehabilitated a bunch of fascists, helped orchestrate their rule over the postwar order, and crushed all meaningful challenge to this state of affairs.

Its relevant but lets keep it general.<p>You&#x27;d be amazed how much you can glean from even something as apparently simple as staff leave entitlements.<p>Based on my experience in a previous type of role interacting with &quot;less than stellar&quot; businesses, here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d review that guys manager and company performance:<p>That guy&#x27;s manager is either incompetent or in a high stress environment themselves from on-high. They don&#x27;t know how to manage people. Likely running all staff at overload. They are therefore underperforming with fatigue an issue. Likely error rate is excessive, or worse, minor mistakes are being covered up and are already on slow burn to becoming larger ones. Fear is a factor in all decisions involving responsibility. CYA is overused.<p>Leadership is probably running the business poorly across multiple measures. Untested or non-existent disaster contingency plans. Every person is either a critical link or near one. Too much in each persons head because they are too scared to share information. Proliferation of business silos. Entire groups are isolated from each other. Pointless duplication of work or systems. Managers increase headcount for power but then purge when expenses get flagged.<p>Embezzlement or some other fraud is likely because no one is second guessing the day-in-day-out work. The corrupt group are left to run continuously and uninterrupted because no one honest takes the reins at regular intervals. No rotation of staff at any particular point needed because no one really goes on leave. Financial mismanagement at minimum is likely even if fraud is not present.<p>Poor social inclusion&#x2F;cohesion. Staff are isolated from their communities and those links are shaky or broken. This is not good for anyone and the damage will flow back in other ways. Low cohesive people later turn into messes of their own and in turn result in increasing turnover overall or worse they stay and lower performance of themselves or others. Bullying&#x2F;mobbing are likely present.<p>Since corporations are legal individuals, this one is a workaholic jerk that doesn&#x27;t play well with others and at extreme is headed for prison &#x2F; bankruptcy &#x2F; or both. Even if the corporation succeeds its still a failure since it had to sacrifice so much to get there it barely got there at all. Dying at the summit is not success when the real success is returning to what matters. Plenty of companies are run this close to failure. Next financial hiccup will cause this company to trip or fall over.<p>And that&#x27;s how much you can link from staff leave entitlements. Its a lazy way of identifying red flags for sure. Some of these are only related because a company with bad leave arrangements is of a certain design or style. But the financial aspects have served me well as a rule of thumb. Culture matters. Be very suspicious of short leave entitlements and actual usage as they hide a multitude of sins and dysfunctions."],"time":["2020-01-18 06:55:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WC3w6pXxgGd"],"id":[22078044],"kids":{},"parent":[22076453],"text":["This is not the proper role of government.

This was the <i>third<\/i> major public event involving controversial design and implementation decisions.  A great number of people in the Rust community have refused to accept that not everyone subscribes to their ideology about use of unsafe.  They&#x27;ve repeatedly tried to impose their values and priorities upon someone who has been more than capable, if not more capable, of reasoning about legitimate issues and risks and who has his own priorities.  The author has not been kind towards those who challenge his decisions, and this has not helped him navigate social issues.  It&#x27;s not just that he struggles with English but has a very different value system and set of priorities than those who he&#x27;s had to interact with.  Further, these contributions weren&#x27;t from neutral parties but rather a group of long-term adversaries who have taken it upon themselves to hold Nikolay accountable for having differences.  They blog, they control the narrative in message forums, they basically do everything in their power to cancel Nikolay and his tremendous work, shaping the public narrative as one that suits their goals.<p>It took great strength to go as far as Nikolay did in spite of these challenges.   I understand why he doesn&#x27;t want to participate in this culture any longer.  It comes at a great cost.  Unfortunately, the actix projects and its author are not the only ones who have been targeted for having differences.  The next example is Ferrous Systems, who have authored a new ecosystem for asynchronous development.  The team has been attacked in all sorts of ways and are going to great lengths defending themselves and to help shape the public narrative.   Eventually, they will tire from constantly defending their decisions.  Some will lose their patience and tempers will flare.  Then, an angry mob will re-emerge and do everything in its power to cancel the momentum of their work and attack the reputations of the authors.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether this social behavior will change without the culture changing as well.  It requires a respect for viewpoint diversity and acceptance of people unlike ourselves, not just in gender orientation but in opinions and values.

Cutting-edge research does feel like it&#x27;s reaching a plateau - across most AI fields even &quot;major&quot; breakthroughs are only gaining a couple percentage points and we&#x27;re probably starting to hit the limits of what current approaches can achieve. When the state-of-the-art is 97% on a task, there&#x27;s only so much room for improvement. Yoav Goldberg posted a tweet about Facebook&#x27;s RoBERTa model that summed it up pretty well: &quot;oh wow seems like this boring public hyperparameter search is going to take a while&quot; [1]. There&#x27;s a vague feeling of &quot;What&#x27;s next?&quot; now that all the benchmarks are fairly well-solved but AI in general clearly doesn&#x27;t feel solved.<p>However, state-of-the-art models aren&#x27;t really used in production yet. I think the trend of &quot;use AI&#x2F;ML to solve X&quot; has only started to pick up in the past 2 years, and it&#x27;ll continue well into the 2020s. The process of taking research models and putting them into production is not standardized yet, and many models don&#x27;t even really work in production - if your model takes a second to do an inference step that&#x27;s fine for research but maybe not for a real product.<p>I think in the next decade, on the research side, benchmarks will be beaten less often, and instead there will be more focus on trying out radically new things, understanding weaknesses in current techniques, and finding new measurements that assess those weaknesses. On the industry side, there will still be lots of cool and exciting new achievements as already-known techniques are applied to old problems that haven&#x27;t been addressed by AI yet.<p>As an aside, this was the first time in my life that I read the phrase &quot;10s&quot; referring to the 2010-2019.
