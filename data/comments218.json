My Life is Better With You.<p>I&#x27;m going to voice maybe the unpopular opinion here...\nDisclaimer:I don&#x27;t work for google, nor am I rich or part of a big corp.<p>Thinking of what google has given us... mostly for free (yes yes I know we have paid in data and privacy...)<p>1. Really good search results:\nI remember the day of the search wars. AltaVista was the best there was and it was kinda crap.\nBut but but I hear you say.... the results are worse and the ads blah blah so use another search engine then. For the most part they deliver on what they promised.. Organising the worlds information and they do it mostly for free for you.<p>2. Maps: Holly hell I don&#x27;t want to live in a world WITHOUT IT !! I&#x27;m the type of person that gets lost in a mall. I kid you not. Yea I had a very expensive(for me at least) TomTom but Google maps has been free and always in my pocket.<p>3. GMail: When last did you have to delete a mail ? I freaking love GMail. There are few companies so good at spam protecting a 10 year old email address ! Sure there are things that can be better... ironical for me I wish it was search-inside-gmail. But apart from that Gmail is amazing they almost never down and never crap. GMail got there first with the big mailboxes and not too crappy UI. Thunderbird is a mess and slow. I save so many digital stuff(forever) just by emailing it to myself. Its Free - You bloody ungratefull fools !<p>3.Chrome(Browser). As stated I come from a time of the browser wars and Netscape and though Netscape was nice for the time. Chrome again blow it out the water... It just took us to the next level. Fine right now most modern browsers are at this next level but again Google got their first and again its free.<p>4. ML and Data-Tools.\nMaybe I get a bit specilzied here but TensorFlow is a fantastic.. yes its awkward to program but keras is a nice layer on-top of it. But Google did the ground work and still pushing the boundaries. Guess what yea... TF is free.\nEvery had to pay for a &quot;Delphi-Component&quot; or any fancy Borland Compilers ?? Blessed you lucky stars  ! Thanks Google !<p>5. Targeted Ads: Yea I get ads can be anoying but all these  amazing planatary free service as mentioned above needs to be paid somehow... Guess what I like personlized ads compared to shitty ads about hair shampoo for women ! I watched &quot;normal free to air tv&quot; the other day, and q generic ad break came on... Lol it almost felt cruel to watch this advertiser just blasting it&#x27;s un-targeted ads at me that will never buy fancy hair shampoo to the masses. If I type in plumber by god I want to see plumber ads in my area.<p>5b GoogleAds: Still the cheapest way to promote your business. Can you imagine going back to the old day... Printing 5000 flyers paying some kid to delivery it for you\nTry working out your CPL on that !\nI always try to look for new advertising opportunities for my small business from newsletters to billboards the money they want to charge is crazy !! And most of the time untraceable ! With GoogleAds if I spent 1k on ads I can pretty much make up a spreadsheet model and deduce how much I will get for it. Try doing that with a billboard, flyers, school newspaper, BingAds( awful ), newsletter.radio  or SMS.<p>Balancing the products and balance sheet of a company as big as Google must be a nightmare I don&#x27;t want that job. Most comments here about Google ruining this and that... well its easy don&#x27;t use their products go be unhappy on another platform. My life is truly easier with Google in my life !<p>Thank You Google.... You Are Like A Long Marriage... Your Not Perfect And Neither Am I...

I was very excited to have Signal available back in 2015, but when I learned about cellular baseband processors and DMA attacks, I realized the whole smartphone stack is insecure. We can&#x27;t audit anything in our phones, down to the cellular chip.<p>Even if our phones were 100% trustworthy, they are triangulated by cell towers thousands of times per day. Location tracking can only be avoided by:<p>1: Not owning a phone.<p>2: Powering off your device and keeping in a Faraday cage while not using.<p>Tempting to own a cute little purse that blocks phone signals, but do I really need a cell-phone on my body, 24&#x2F;7?<p>If I evaluate the overall pros &amp; cons of my cellphone, it has been overwhelmingly negative. I&#x27;ve had a phone since August 2014, when I went to college. Before that, I would text with my parents&#x27; phones.<p>Here are the top negative things that have happened due to using a phone:<p>1. Miscommunication, isolation, social anxiety due to social media and texting. Talking in person is so much better. And what about the hours and hours of snapchatting, so pointless and sad looking back.<p>2. False sense of security, thinking you can know what&#x27;s going on, help people, intervene when necessary (friend sexual assault stuff at parties). What about when their phone dies? It made me wish we had landlines, or that I had been there. If I didn&#x27;t have a cell phone, I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve left the party. I  would&#x27;ve stayed and kept watch.<p>3. Poor posture, lack of sleep, constant exposure to blue light (who knows if the light is really bad), etc.<p>4. Missed connections by having my head in my phone all the time in public.<p>5. The US government has a total map of my life since August 2014, even though I have sent thousands of encrypted messages and hundreds of encrypted phone calls.<p>6. Less time available each day. I have spent typically 1-3 hours per day on my phone since I got one, about 1,980 days ago. This amounts to probably 4,000 to 6,000 hours, or about 170 to 250 days. In other words, about 1&#x2F;8th of my life since 2014 has been dedicated to bullshit technology.<p>Here are some positives:<p>1. I have lots of photos that would otherwise have required a camera. But I have dozens of film cameras and a few digital ones, and there&#x27;s no reason to shoot photos on such a tiny format. Good luck printing cell-photos beyond 5x7 or even 8x10.<p>2. I occasionally talk to family. This could be accomplished with a landline.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve missed some things, and maybe I&#x27;m being pessimistic, but the reality is that I&#x27;ve lost lots of sleep and experienced more problems with interpersonal relationships as a result of having a phone.

Be aware that your body has various nutrient buffers, cycles and momentums and it may take months or even years to really run out of some really important nutrients, given your diet and lifestyle, and this will be exacerbated and accelerated by aging.

I have spent some time with the guys who build PCs and who know great deal about fans and one thing I learned even an object that the air has to pass around or any kink in the path of air can severly impact performance of PC fan. Because they are designed to be quiet and still provide good flow of air they produce almost no pressure differential to speak of and the flow can be halved by a wire mesh that is a bit too dense.<p>You need to cycle the air in your room through the filter couple of times to clean it, assuming your filter is any good.<p>The cheap fan in the picture would barely be able to cycle the air in a small room maybe once an hour, if it was completely unobstructed. It is very likely that with any kind of HEPA filter the flow will drop by an order of magnitude.<p>Go with suggestion of other readers. If you want good, cheap filter, use a box fan and especially one that was designed to give good pressure difference. Take large cardboard or plastic box and mount large HEPA filter in it so that the air has to pass through.

Without becoming a federal union like the US, but having a common currency, Germany&#x27;s exports have been artificially cheaper and thus more competitive for over 20 years.<p>&gt;This is the natural outcome from the obsession with running fiscal surpluses. Now Germany is on the brink of recession and they&#x27;re finally starting to make some noises about fiscal spending, but the politics will likely limit it to modest deficits than anything transformational. Enjoy the negative rates.<p>The common currency (Eurozone) is deeply flawed and it only allows a rich country like Germany to win at the expense of poorer countries like Greece or Portugal. I find it insane that EU politics have never really dealt with this. I find it absolutely insane that after the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, Germany somehow managed to escape with keeping the Eurozone intact and having the poor countries impose austerity instead.<p>There absolutely needs to be a political revolution in the Eurozone countries. Either complete the EU project by becoming a United States of Europe, and receive all the equalizing payments of healthcare, social security, and common military spending at the federal level, or get rid of the common currency. It&#x27;s just hurting the poorest people in the Eurozone to keep the current arrangement.<p>You might be under the impression &quot;well Germany might be parasitic vis a vis other Eurozone countries, but at least it&#x27;s good for working Germans&quot;, but you&#x27;d be wrong.<p>The US today has a tight labor market which will eventually drive wages up if it persists long enough. Germany on the other hand has similar employment statistics but they did it with the Hartz reforms [2]. The unemployment stats look great because you can get a shitty low wage job [3].<p>Germany has kept the wages of workers depressed in order to be an export powerhouse. It&#x27;s parasitic on other Eurozone neighbors but also on German workers. The people who have benefited the most from this arrangement are the German capital class. The shareholders and managerial class of German industry, whether it&#x27;s giants like Volkswagen or even the small Mittelstand companies. German workers should have gotten wealthier over time which would have made Germany similar to the US in being driven by domestic consumption. That in turn would have made other EU members better off because those wealthier Germans would have been able to consume more of their goods and services. It&#x27;s truly baffling how even German workers have put up with this. They&#x27;re losing to the benefit of German capital.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20793982\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20793982<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;questioning-the-claim-of-germanys-employment-miracle-106895\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;questioning-the-claim-of-germany...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marginal_employment#Germany\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marginal_employment#Germany<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-21 17:12:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["em500"],"id":[22108741],"kids":{},"parent":[22106906],"text":["&gt; ...

In constrast, if you use the `move` keyword, compiler will correctly move the value into the anonymous structure of the closure itself during its construction, and the closure will be a `FuMut` and&#x2F;or `Fn` as long as you don&#x27;t consume the said value in the closure."],"time":["2020-01-22 05:14:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimbob45"],"id":[22110772],"kids":[22110814,22110919,22111231,22112503,22111187,22110953,22113465,22113305,22111134,22112084,22115872,22110985],"parent":[22108957],"text":["I don&#x27;t understand the intuition of closures and they turn me off to languages immediately.

Then PHP has a built-in time and date helpers, like timezones.<p>However, the $ dollar sign for variables kinda annoys me, as switching back and forth between PHP and other languages like JS. Like recently ran into an issue where I forget $ in front of a var and JSON encoding it, and then went to var_dump it but realized I forgot the $ so it was outputting the variable name instead of the variable contents. I guess muscle memory.<p>I know I was reading a blog post though where someone built a React frontend around Wordpress as a headless CMS, thought that was interesting but haven&#x27;t looked into how to do it yet 100% but was proposing it to someone I know that has a large site built around WP but seems like a mess of plugins and theme tweaks so I felt moved to something else would let controlling the design and changing things without forking plugins when there are tweaks wanted that isn&#x27;t part of the official plugin, etc as I feel like that would allow more complete control of the presentation layer without tweaking multiple things and stuff. However some businesses don&#x27;t really care about the tech under the hood, they just want it done quick with results, don&#x27;t really understand all the technical stuff and care about costs, so not like a tech startup where you care about a lot of the little details or maintaining things for the future. Then some people don&#x27;t even really know what they want either, but I guess business people managing tech people, but even big tech companies I doubt all of their CEOs are even technical either though but maybe they hire technical project managers to help bridge the gap between the two parts of the business but their product is mostly tech though anyways so I assume a different culture than tech in a non tech business.<p>Looks like some projects to do server-side react with PHP too, but haven&#x27;t played with any personally - but that&#x27;s useful if someone cares a lot about SEO even though Google can crawl SPA&#x27;s but other search engines might not be as capable, then sharing on social media not sure if they use server-side rendering when grabbing the metadata for open graph for example. That&#x27;d be neat to pitch to non tech businesses who might just be running on a cPanel server and don&#x27;t want to really invest in servers and managing them much yet, so mix both PHP and React would be prefect maybe for some types of companies, PHP and MySQL for the data part with a nice clean modern and fast react front end with near instant page loads.<p>Kinda interesting about support for web sockets and more async stuff in the future, I guess in theory than you could write real-time game servers in PHP for example? I know some game servers are in C, C#, C++ or Node though, but long-running PHP code would be useful for other types of applications that aren&#x27;t just mainly restful web pages or APIs.<p>Then another thing is you might find examples or libs in PHP but have to dig for equivalents in other languages, probably since PHP is so popular and easier to get into maybe. Then somethings you&#x27;d find a good lib in Python like I was looking at something and didn&#x27;t see an official JS client but they offered a C, Go and Python one... Would be neat if somehow you could easily just combine the languages, I seen there is a Node PY bridge though and sounds like some experiments of compiling PHP to WASM but haven&#x27;t played with it(wondering if it compiles only the code you wrote(I guess perfect for code you happen to strongly type) or the entire PHP binary along with it, but I know FB was working on compiling PHP to C with the HACK project, so a similar idea might work for WASM but not sure if it&#x27;s a sane idea - maybe just porting the code you need would be a better answer maybe...  but that&#x27;d be an interesting way to develop, but I guess with microservices you could mix and match too but some little tiny things seems a waste with all the networking calls."],"time":["2020-01-22 08:59:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brakmic"],"id":[22112047],"kids":{},"parent":[22111518],"text":["PHP, LOL."],"time":["2020-01-21 22:51:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["whalesalad"],"id":[22111937],"kids":[22112110,22112019],"parent":[22111518],"text":["PHP is tolerable if you NEED to use it.

While much of what the article says is true, it talks about a phenomenon that exists mostly in the funhouse mirror of HN and Reddit. People don&#x27;t actually rewrite so much; in fact, they probably do it less than they should. Yes, there is a &quot;contempt culture&quot; but it almost always comes from the losing side. E.g. Go is not very popular outside the US, but it&#x27;s <i>hugely<\/i> popular in America; how popular is it in the US for <i>active<\/i> development? 33x <i>less<\/i> than Java [1]. That&#x27;s still very respectable, but let&#x27;s not get carried away. Moreover, HN and Reddit are not only terrible at describing the current state of the industry, they&#x27;re also terrible at predicting trends. While a few of the ideas&#x2F;language&#x2F;techniques hyped on such forums do end up successful, the vast majority end up failing. Some of them continue to be hyped on those forums even long after they&#x27;ve failed.<p>Why do Reddit and HN paint such a distorted image? I have a couple of guesses. For one, by their very nature, they focus on new and unusual things, which is what they&#x27;re supposed to. This means that by their nature they focus on things people <i>don&#x27;t<\/i> actually do. For another, these forums can, at best, represent the content that&#x27;s actually produced online, and here there is a big bias towards smaller companies -- perhaps because such content is an efficient form of marketing for them -- as well as towards places and industries where producing blog posts featured on HN is a part of the culture, namely startups and SV companies. Even there we see that an SV company like Google, that employs 2000 times as many employees as a startup, does not produce 2000 times the number of technical blog posts. When the content is so skewed towards small organizations, it gives disproportionate representation to the practices of small companies working on small codebases. When those companies grow, they tend to shift their practices and technologies to more established ones that are not as new and not as unusual, and also produce fewer technical blog posts. Similarly, younger, less experienced developers have more time and incentive to publish posts, and so are overrepresented, but as they mature the often realize, like their predecessors, the mistake of their ways, but also produce less online content. The result is that HN and Reddit mostly talk about things that <i>aren&#x27;t<\/i> usually done, and overrepresent smaller problems and practices that come from inexperience. That makes them fun to read, but readers shouldn&#x27;t forget that the genre they&#x27;re reading is more that of GQ&#x2F;Vogue than, say, the New York Times.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hiringlab.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;todays-top-tech-skills&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hiringlab.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;todays-top-tech-skills&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-21 14:11:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rafaelvasco"],"id":[22109634],"kids":[22110913],"parent":[22106367],"text":["A programmer never starts from scratch.

If the developer responsible for the rewrite satisfies this constraint, I have a much greater deal of confidence in the success of the effort.<p>Also, any rewrite should be done in contrasting terms of: Value to the end customer VS long-term technical value. Many rewrites remove value from both ends of the scale. Some may improve both. I think as long as you keep this equation balanced you will be ok. Many developers have ulterior motivations which can greatly compromise this equation if not carefully accounted for (e.g. chasing shiny things, resume padding, etc).<p>I would say that in purely technology terms, rewrites are amazing. My approach to writing a new system usually involves writing it 2 times at a minimum. The first pass is the fastest, hacky way I can get to MVP with a major focus on the most difficult technical aspects of the product. This pass is what I put in front of our internal developers to get some input so that I can quickly correct course if needed. During this time, I allow myself to make sloppy mistakes in favor of proving that a certain feature can (theoretically) work. This seems to do wonders for productivity because you are much more likely to experiment and find better paths when you aren&#x27;t worried about your extremely pedantic code policies (of which we have many).<p>The 2nd pass (aka the rewrite) is when I have the first pass project up on the left hand side of my monitor, and a new solution on the right hand side. I use my original implementation as a reference, but now view it through the lens of auditing another developer&#x27;s code for quality and policy. Having already proven that the hard thing can be done, my mind is now free to focus on the correctness and standards applied throughout. This is the code that I would actually put in front of our customers. From this point onward, unless a major shift in framework, architecture or language is decided, all future iterations are done on top of this 2nd pass codebase.<p>I would also say that just because you decide to do the rewrite doesn&#x27;t mean you have to throw away the old code and any support for it. The most successful rewrites I&#x27;ve ever seen occur where the legacy system is ran in parallel with the new system with both being maintained and used in production simultaneously.

So it&#x27;s a rewrite. But of course, the re-write doesn&#x27;t work, primarily because of fundamental misunderstandings about what properties allow software to scale across many machines, in many time zones, running processes 1000&#x27;s of times per day. So it becomes necessary to either cut losses and re-write the re-write or decide to start iterating now on the crappy re-write to make it closer in terms of functionality to what already existed in the crappy on-prem systems - which begs the question of why you didn&#x27;t just iterate on the original sketchy code in the first place.<p>There are times when rewriting does make sense - rare though they may be. I&#x27;ve only seen a few, and they always had to do with improving stability and reducing the potential for bugs. None of them required you to use the latest shiny to &quot;completely reimagine what software could be doing for your business&quot;. I&#x27;ve helped to  rewrite subscription-management systems that ended up noticeably reducing churn and cutting out spurious chargebacks from customers who couldn&#x27;t navigate our bug-prone subscription service wasteland. But some refactors are so labor intensive that they amount to re-writes, even if you&#x27;re using the same tools and languages. Some code is acutely awful and it needs to die for people to be able to go to sleep at night without having to drink a fifth of whiskey beforehand. Some atrocities don&#x27;t need to exist.<p>But, again, if the reason for a refactor or rewrite is summed up as &quot;we&#x27;re bored and want to play with these new shinies&quot; then you are in for it. If rewriting provides you with some sort of new business capability or fundamentally changes a business process drastically for the better, then go ahead. But in my experience, if a technology or paradigm is fundamentally &quot;so much better than what we do now&quot;, then it should work so well with what we do now so well that it doesn&#x27;t require fundamental rewrites of large software systems. So rewriting things in Python or C++ is great, or using Kubernetes instead of Lambdas or whatever is fine, but it&#x27;s more important that these paradigm shifts can be incremental rather than a complete recreation of what already exists, that the gulf between refactoring and rewriting can be relatively small instead of two completely different processes."],"time":["2020-01-21 23:27:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cratermoon"],"id":[22110858],"kids":{},"parent":[22106367],"text":["Does anyone know the error handling pattern the author mentions?"],"time":["2020-01-21 20:59:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aidenn0"],"id":[22109325],"kids":[22110349],"parent":[22106367],"text":["Something I&#x27;ve noticed over the years is that the people who say that reading code is harder than writing code are people who have been writing code for a long time and are paid to write code.<p>I think the truth is that it&#x27;s actually a different skill, and one that&#x27;s much harder to pickup because when you write code, there&#x27;s a very quick feedback loop telling you that you&#x27;re wrong, but you can read code, think it does something different than it does and never ever learn you were wrong."],"time":["2020-01-21 18:48:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["luxuryballs"],"id":[22116795],"kids":{},"parent":[22106367],"text":["What if it’s written in ASP classic and powered by deprecated SQL procedures that won’t run on anything newer than SQL Server 2005?"],"time":["2020-01-22 13:05:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Sophistifunk"],"id":[22114152],"kids":{},"parent":[22106367],"text":["People not wanting to write Cold Fusion isn&#x27;t &quot;contempt culture&quot;, it&#x27;s an objectively terrible platform."],"time":["2020-01-22 03:55:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["krn"],"id":[22107134],"kids":[22107252,22107180,22107181],"parent":[22106367],"text":["But isn&#x27;t Firefox Quantum a result of a successful rewrite of Firefox Gecko?"],"time":["2020-01-21 15:28:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["agumonkey"],"id":[22107057],"kids":{},"parent":[22106367],"text":["do we have a model for differential structure migration back to formal specs ?"],"time":["2020-01-21 15:21:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Allower"],"id":[22106573],"kids":{},"parent":[22106367],"text":["If you believe this it just means you lack experience.

If you add to that the possibility to interrupt the flow with related melodic fragments so that the melody seems to &quot;comment&quot; upon itself, you already have a rich set of tools from which to create a dynamic section of music. It&#x27;s unlikely it will sound anything as sophisticated as what Beethoven wrote. But it will likely be coherent.<p>Now compare that to this:<p>* learn to read, remember, improvise upon, and mash up all the musics of continental Europe<p>* when asked to write a piece, think of the most fitting styles and textures from what you learned (and sometimes, mash them up to make new ones), improvise some new content for that, and then write it down<p>* if you know your musicians, tailor the music specifically to any special skills or limitations (including yourself)<p>* put in various types of musical jokes to amuse yourself and the performers<p>So suppose you are a budding composer and want to express your support for universal human solidarity. Do you chose as your model music from a composer who masterfully employs Romantic irony for the singer to interrupt the symphony that was previously in progress (Beethoven&#x27;s 9th) to sing about universal brotherhood?<p>Or do you choose the composer who masterfully mashed up three dances in three disparate time signatures showing how three different social classes could all make merry together in agreeable harmony (Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni)?<p>Keep in mind that if you choose the latter you need to conduct and cue three different groups from the orchestra so they know when to start and can remain synchronized.<p>Given hundreds of years the musical legacy tends toward Beethoven more than Mozart for this reason. Still, I&#x27;d bet if you measured 9th Symphony references to Mozart&#x27;s Requiem, the latter wouldn&#x27;t be too far behind.

Keep in mind this was 1978 so the size of the chip was goin to be limited given our facility. I did not know a lot about music, I knew I liked music but I just didn&#x27;t know a lot about the theory behind it. So I decided to take a music class as an elective. After I enrolled in the class I was told by fellow students that this class was &quot;an easy A&quot;. I was tempted to drop the class because I was not looking for an easy A I was looking to learn about music. On the first day of the course the professor was an older, grey haired older gentleman. He explained that the course would be composed of some music theory and some listening. We were to go to listening rooms and listen to various pieces of classical music and become familiar enough with the music to be able to identify it when hearing it. Again, it was 1978 so the music rooms contained vinyl records and record players and headphones. Our first Quiz came and the professor played various records and we were to identify each piece. To my surprise and amazement the other students were able to easily identify each piece. I was not able to pick out even one. The music theory part I was picking up easily but the listening part I was struggling with. I spoke with the professor and explained to him what my project was and he seemed very interested. We got into a long discussion about it which I was really excited about that he was so interested in what I was doing. I explained to him that part of my dilemma was to fit the notes into a small amount of memory that I would be able to fit into the chip I was making. He suggested that I look into Bach, specifically Fugues because there was a lot of repetition, sometimes the same notes simply shifted in tone etc. That was excellent advice. I continued listening, more and more time in the listening rooms but for some reason I was just not picking up on how to identify the music as easily as the other students in the class. I finally asked a fellow student how he was able to do it so easily. He said that everyone in the class had notes that he showed me, the notes said things like &quot;blue label with yellow writing&quot;, &quot;red label, blue writing&quot; and other such things relating to the appearance of the labels on the records. Again, it was 1978, and the professor would hold up the record to the light, then place it on the turn table before playing each piece, the other students would then refer to their notes which they had prepared in the listening room.  They were cheating.  I really liked this professor who I had forged a relationship with so I went to him and explained to him what was going on and that people had told me his class was an easy A. He thanked me and asked how my project was going and we talked about that. He didn&#x27;t seem mad or perturbed particularly. He mentioned that he would appreciate if I brought my project by and show it to him when I finished it and I said I would. The final exam day came and I had continued the listening sessions and had decided not to cheat like everyone else, I really wanted to learn about music. I was really glad I made that decision because for the final there was a written theory portion and a listening and identifying part. The professor brought out a tape deck (reel to reel) and would start and stop it for each piece or portion of a piece we were to identify. You could hear the air go out of everyone&#x27;s lungs in the class (except me). I got a little smile and proceeded to identify each piece to my own surprise.   Later after I had presented my project to my EE professors (and got an A for it) I took it to my music professor and showed it to him, he really liked it, I had hard coded Toccata Fugue in D-minor. He revealed to me that I was the only one in the class that passed (I got a Not so easy but satisfying A).  He flunked everyone but me !

Well, actually it will, if you remove the church.<p>That&#x27;s not true. In the real world an acoustic device will never generate a pure sound. An organ pipe will generate all sorts of artifact noises and its overall sonic behaviour will be affected by temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and its physical promixity to other pipes (interference is a common problem in mixtures).<p>It is important to note that organ builders will graduate the different pipe dimensions within a single register in order to achieve a homogeneous sound from low to high notes, but that graduation does not necessarily follow physical laws but rather an approximation. Sometimes the graduation will involve jumps or repetition in order to create a register with a mixed character.<p>Finally, the voicing of individual pipes, done by hand, will (when done by a master voicer) balance character and homogeneity. Each register will have its own personality, but each note will sound slightly different.<p>&gt; You have to add movement, energy, and emphasis (which, on an organ, has to be implemented by varying the duration of the notes, and the pauses between them, because there&#x27;s no dynamic response).<p>On mechanical organs, a good player will also be able to adjust the opening and closing of individual pallets (valves) using their fingers, in order to control the attack and decay of individual notes."],"time":["2020-01-21 06:58:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lispm"],"id":[22105414],"kids":[22107819],"parent":[22103310],"text":["Nice.<p>Reader may be interested to hear how church organs from Bach&#x27;s time sound.

If this lasts long enough, then there are portions of the supply chain that will start to simply disappear as vendors go under or switch away to different customers and de-prioritize Boeing.<p>It isn&#x27;t just the monetary cost to re-calibrate machining and tooling, also the staff time and monetary cost to fill in gaps that appeared during the shutdown, both material and vendor relationships. And an abundantly clear lesson (as if the domain experts in sourcing shouldn&#x27;t know this already) from the debacle is that outsourcing is not plug-and-play: there will be both product and relationship re-alignment and re-certification going on anywhere vendors are swapped out in the supply chain.<p>If Boeing was forward-looking, then they would bite the bullet and keep production going, but use the downtime to crawl through every aspect of production to look for and fix any quality and safety-related concerns on the line (including absolute bottom-up authority for production line escalating concerns through to engineering and design) and in the supply chain. It massively slows down the production, which is perfectly fine right now. It wouldn&#x27;t matter if they slowed to 10% of normal output, if the deliverable was absolute confidence in what is built on that line; they should have started this a long time ago when the shutdown passed 90 days.<p>Even after the design is amended, planes modified, re-certification awarded by all the aviation agencies around the world, there will be a titanic push to run the line as fast as possible. And if they don&#x27;t completely debug every piece of that line to an inch of its life, there will be guaranteed production quality problems when it restarts, and if those problems lead to more crashes, Boeing is getting bailed out by taxpayers and unalterably changed.

I think it will probably head lower, but as a general rule I try to find companies I believe in rather than companies I don’t.<p>It was a very interesting choice to maintain the dividend for now. I think they will have to revisit that and it will kick-off the next big swing downward.<p>Last week the WSJ reported [1] that they are in the process of raising a new $5 billion round. Now [2] the word on the street is they’re looking for $10 billion over 2 years - a “mid term” debt round, structured as a line they can draw on over several years - somehow this is supposed to limit the effect it will have on their debt rating. A significant Moody’s downgrade seems like it’s past due, and Moody’s recently announced they put BA “on review”. [3]<p>Their debt at the start of Q4 was $15 billion and then rose to $20 billion by the end of Q4. Back in 2018 it was closer to $12 billion. I wouldn’t be surprise to see it near $25 billion at the end of Q1.<p>Supposedly Boeing keeps about $10 billion in liquidity “available” but they’ve burned through that by now.<p>The “charges” they take against the MAX disaster which started at $5.6 billion could balloon as high as $20 billion as the ramifications continue to unfold. [4]<p>Lastly I would point out that over the last decade plus timeframe the FAA hollowed out as a regulatory agency into a box checker. Today they have as I understand it just ~750 total pilots and engineers on staff to review technical data from the plane manufacturers. The FAA said last year to do it themselves they would need 10,000 more. [5]<p>&gt; <i>“It would require roughly 10,000 more employees and another $1.8 billion for our certification office,” Elwell told the Senate subcommittee on aviation and space.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>The FAA Aircraft Certification Service had a budget of $239 million for fiscal 2019 and about 1,300 employees, 745 of whom are pilots, engineers and technical staff who oversee design approvals and production.<\/i><p>I recall news articles claiming Congress recently approved significant new funding for the FAA, but looking at their budget [6] PDF page 37 it seems like “Regulation &amp; Certification” remains level-funded at $1.3 billion the last three years.<p>A more recent report on the MAX specifically [7] said;<p>&gt; <i>The report said the FAA had just 45 people in an office overseeing Boeing&#x27;s Organization Designation Authority (ODA) and its 1,500 employees.<\/i><p>...<p>&gt; <i>The FAA&#x27;s office oveseeing Boeing has just 24 engineers and they face a wide range of tasks to ensure compliance in overseeing Boeing&#x27;s 737, 747, 767, 777, and 787 programs.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>The review added there are only two technical FAA staff assigned per Boeing program and some are &quot;new engineers with limited airworthiness experience.&quot;<\/i><p>The full report which this article is excerpting I believe is this one. [8] See specifically PDF Page 47 but put down any objects you might be prone to throwing before beginning to read.<p>I would imagine engineers qualified to actual critically review detailed 737 specifications aren’t unemployed and take a long time to hire. How long will it take the FAA to even staff up to the point where they can <i>start<\/i> doing their job if they are only just now getting the money to hire? Pundits saying they expected the 737 return-to-service to happen before New Years and now say it’s happening any day now I think don’t comprehend the massive gap between what the FAA used to do and what they are now tasked with doing, and that they literally don’t have the qualified people in-house to even start doing much of this work. All that assumes necessary funding has even been appropriated and there are the people and the culture in place to even do the work. Big IFs.<p>To me that points to a extremely delayed return to service as new engineers are hired and brought on to critically review documentation which used to be rubber stamped — let alone dealing with the actual software failures and faulty design specifications which straight up didn’t&#x2F;don’t conform to modern safety standards.<p>In short, my prediction is that BA will inevitably have to suspend its dividend, it will take a charge upwards of $20 billion for the MAX, return to service will be extremely delayed beyond analysts wildest expectations, they will be downgraded by Moody’s and their debt load will increase to nearly $30 billion over the course of 2020 into 2021, and there is a remote chance of a debt squeeze, and the company declaring bankruptcy and having to restructure.<p>I don’t currently own any position in Boeing (other than through holdings in the S&amp;P500) and do not plan on initiating any BA position in the next 72 hours.

If other hardware in the plane is connection-wise split between the two computers, you will end up in situations where the two computers fundamentally disagree on what reality is.<p>The only backup in that case is good airmanship to know that you are in an anomalous condition, diagnose whether you have a set of gauges that you can rely on, and finally, what to do about it. ATC could have been utilized to cross-check instruments.<p>This is honestly non-trivial machine operation 101. Your sensors can be wrong.<p>A resolution I might suggest moving forward is an MFD function that allows pilots to manually remap avionics data sources in flight.

The things that don’t need to be fast can use whatever you want (I used Haskell and Racket for my own tools at the time). Python is.. not the greatest. The major value add is the multitude of scientific libraries. If you’re gonna throw that all away, why not just use something better? Things like Julia, OCaml, Haskell, etc. I personally think Julia is pretty dope and is what I would use today for bioinformatics research.

One of the main goals we had was to push the boundaries of how much stuff in Python can be deduced by compiler, as we loved the Python&#x27;s syntax (Seq is to Python as Cystal is to Ruby--- or at least that is what we are aiming for).<p>- We do not want people to learn a new language--- Seq should be pretty much a drop-in replacement for Python, at least for most scientific&#x2F;bioinformatics software. There still remains a small gap, but we are actively working to close it.<p>- At some level, Python libraries cannot cut it, especially when dealing with next-gen sequencing data.

Fortunately there is the Regexp::Exhaustive perl module which is what I used. The way this module works is pretty awesome. It adds a special &quot;FAIL&quot; directive to the end of a pattern, so that the match can be recorded and artificially failed, triggering the regexp engine&#x27;s backtracking mechanism to back up and find the next match (if any).<p>Reverse complements: Because DNA is double-stranded (well, usually... this is biology after all) there is a &quot;complementary&quot; pattern on the first strand that corresponds to the pattern you are interested in on the other strand. You almost always need to search for both. And what&#x27;s more, DNA is directional so you actually need to search in the reverse direction for this complementary pattern. You can either reverse and complement your sequence (which seq has a special ~ operator for, neat!) and search again, or reverse and complement the search pattern itself, assemble a single combined regexp (Regexp::Assemble module), and do a single scan over the data, which is what Bio::Regexp does.<p>Circular DNA: Some DNA (plasmids) are actually circular in shape, meaning the start is connected to the end.

This isn&#x27;t particularly difficult, but for very large restores it requires long loops using large lists, arrays, and&#x2F;or dicts.

In Python 2.7, the test used 1.1GB of RAM and about 8 seconds.  In D (fully compiled) the same test used 881MB and 7.4 seconds.  Here&#x27;s the D version:<p><pre><code>  import std.stdio : writeln;\n\n  int main() {\n    int[int] map;\n\n    foreach (i; 0..10_000_000)\n      map[i] = i;\n\n    foreach (i; 0..3) {\n       foreach (j; 0..10_000_000) {\n         map[j] = map[j] + 1;\n       }\n    }\n    return 0;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn Seq it ran in 5 seconds and used 395MB.
