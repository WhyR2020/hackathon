I guess the deaths identified by gender are a smaller subset). The figures are similar for motorcycles, about an order of magnitude larger for men than women [1].  In part this is due to the larger share of riders being men. But even when we compare the rates, there are significant differences. This disparity typically indicates behavior-based risks. In aggregate, the majority of motorcycle-automobile collisions are the fault of the latter, but fatalities often result from risky behavior on part of the former - hence the gender disparity, since said behavior is much more prevalent among men.<p>Some of the purported reasons don&#x27;t measure up. This article claims that the prevalence of larger SUVs and trucks are resulting in more bicyclist deaths, and compares SUV and truck sales in 2019 vs 1994. But the fatality rates among bicyclists are not substantially different in 1994 than 2019. There&#x27;s actually an overall downward trend the in rate of bicyclist deaths [2]. The same applies to the rising speed limits and greater prevalent of phones - these don&#x27;t seem to correlate with any increase in fatalities. The overall trend from 1975 to the latest data is a downward trend from a fatality rate of ~0.4 per 100k people to 0.3 to 0.2.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;fatality-statistics&#x2F;detail&#x2F;gender\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;fatality-statistics&#x2F;detail&#x2F;gende...<\/a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;fatality-statistics&#x2F;detail&#x2F;yearly-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;fatality-statistics&#x2F;detail&#x2F;yearl...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 22:11:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["danial"],"id":[23084601],"kids":{},"parent":[23084151],"text":["This made me really sad.<p>Donovan Oxendine\nAge: 14 Date: 4&#x2F;9 Location: Red Springs, NC<p>Aiden Christopher Manning Caldwell\nAge: 13 Date: 4&#x2F;9 Location: Red Springs, NC<p>The news article doesn&#x27;t mention that they were brothers, but I found obituaries that link each other."],"time":["2020-05-05 22:26:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xiphias2"],"id":[23086381],"kids":{},"parent":[23084151],"text":["Tesla&#x27;s cyclist detection is awesome:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Dg2MqMJo-uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Dg2MqMJo-uk<\/a><p>I really want to buy a Tesla as soon as I have the money for it to be a safer driver, as it&#x27;s generally really hard to spot cyclists and pedestrians sometimes, and I&#x27;m more worried about hitting somebody than getting killed in an accident."],"time":["2020-05-06 01:41:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loco5niner"],"id":[23096768],"kids":{},"parent":[23084151],"text":["This seems like a very one-sided article.

That said, I&#x27;m really disappointed in his one sided take here. Amazon did not fire these people without cause. They fired them because they violated company policies. These employees were using company time and resources to push personal political agendas that have no place at work. They were rightfully fired, and a huge number of Amazon employees are thankful they are gone. There is a big silent majority, probably at all major tech companies, that is left voiceless because the progressive left is vocal and aggressively shouts down anyone who is even slightly to the right of their own views. At Amazon, most of us seek a professional workplace where employees are working towards the common goal of helping customers. These employees that Tim is standing up for were the opposite of that, distracting everyone with loud activism and probably not focusing on their own jobs either.<p>To provide a counter to Tim&#x27;s account: Chris Smalls was told to quarantine himself and not come to the work site because he was in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;regulation&#x2F;labor&#x2F;490805-fired-amazon-striker-demands-bezos-protect-workers-in-open-letter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;regulation&#x2F;labor&#x2F;490805-fired-amazon-str...<\/a>). He came to the site anyways to protest. Why wouldn&#x27;t he get fired for putting others at risk? People who think this firing was malicious are speculating. If this was a topic that Hacker News readers had a different group perspective on, they would call it a conspiracy theory. Someone would surely be quoting Hanlon&#x27;s Razor by now.<p>Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham were the most visible ringleaders of activists pretending to be employees. They clearly were not doing their job as well as they could, because they had time enough to engage in lengthy political discussions on mailing lists during the workday. They were also repeatedly disrupting everyone else&#x27;s work. They, and others from their group, would spam hundreds of company mailing lists repeatedly. They would send long political rants, links to activist events, and even solicit employee information. It was very over the top, and pleas from list moderators to stop spamming were ignored or met with baseless accusations of racism (or another -ism). That reaction, to shout down opposing views with absurd justifications, is the mental gymnastics of intersectionality at work. It&#x27;s the unfortunate culture of intolerance that this aggressive flavor of progressive activism has taken on in workplaces like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.<p>I&#x27;m also dismayed at the public reaction to these events. For some reason, the general public simply craves stories attacking winners, and the same is true for Amazon. If you want to balance out the info you&#x27;ve been exposed to, check out Amazon&#x27;s official blog on the large number of changes they&#x27;ve made in response to COVID-19, at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;amazons-actions-to-help-employees-communities-and-customers-affected-by-covid-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;amazons-actions-to...<\/a>.

It treats its workers humanely, strives for work&#x2F;life balance, struggles to move the diversity needle (and mostly fails, but so does everyone else), and is by and large an ethical organization. I genuinely admire its leadership.<p>Having worked there, I 100% agree with this statement. I&#x27;d go so far as to say that the blame for this toxic and intolerable atmosphere lies with a single person who is not Jeff Bezos. His name is Dave Clark.<p>When I was in his org, I regularly interacted with FC General Managers, Ops Managers, and Area Managers. There was a humorous nickname that quite a few called him behind his back,  and I think it fits him perfectly. It was Dave Mussolini. Not so much a nazi in his evil, but rather someone who desired and cultivated and enforced a pure cult of personality for his own personal ego gratification and career advancement. Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Disagree And Commit&quot; leadership principle gets thrown out in his org and becomes &quot;Disagree amongst yourselves if you want, but <i>never ever<\/i> disagree with me, never do anything that I do not approve of, and kiss my ass any time you are around me&quot;. Subsequently, all of his subordinates adopt the same attitude, and becomes a culture of complete subservience to your master, no questions asked.<p>I have personally witnessed people get fired within 10 minutes of sending out an email making a suggested path that Dave Clark had already decided. The email came out, Dave Clark walked into his managers office with an HR rep, and literally within 10 minutes they were packing their things and saying goodbye.<p>I have been in an elevator which opened up to him and his EA, and instead of getting in and going to his floor, he told us we needed to step out of the elevator and get a different elevator because he needed to talk confidentially. He couldn&#x27;t wait to get to his office, he had to make one of his lemmings take the long way to accommodate 10 seconds of his time.<p>The Kiva acquisition was something he pushed for extensively. They weren&#x27;t even Kiva customers at the time, he just jumped the gun and bought the company. It turned out that Kiva&#x27;s productivity improvements didn&#x27;t scale very well at Amazon&#x27;s level. They really worked well for much smaller companies, but in large FCs, their optimization and routing algorithms hit NP Complete complexity bottlenecks, resulting in much lower productivity than had been advertised to them. But instead of taking the blame for his lack of due diligence, he created a hellfire and damnation environment, regularly storming into their offices and throwing Steve Jobs level temper tantrums. He made the entire place so toxic that half (not exaggerating) of the Kiva engineers that were acquired had left the company before their very lucrative aquisition stock grants could vest. We&#x27;re talking hundreds of engineers who would rather give up hundreds of thousands of dollars than deal with Dave Clark (Mussolini) for one more minute.<p>Dave Clark is a toxic asset. He is failing at his job. Fulfillment costs are skyrocketing, inventory turns are tanking, and profitability of the retail division is at an all time low, despite all time high revenues. He has burned through staffing so heavily that they have had to abandon entire fulfillment centers because there aren&#x27;t enough people in these small blue collar towns that are eligible to work for Amazon anymore <i>because they&#x27;ve all been fired<\/i>. He is a constant PR nightmare for the company.

When I contrast that to the absolutely horrendous keyboard on the 2017 model, I long for 2015 style keys with their somewhat existent key travel. The fact that a dedicated escape key was missing on the first keyboard revision baffles me, and makes me wonder what is going on in product design at Apple. I have not experienced their newest revision of the keyboard on the 16&quot; so I cannot speak to that, but it seems to be received more positively than the 2017 model.<p>If the touch-bar were there to compliment the function keys instead of replace them I don&#x27;t think it would be nearly as hated. As alexggordon mentioned, with BTT[0] much of the functionality of missing function keys is restored but why is third party software needed to give back full functionality on what is supposed to be a laptop for professionals?<p>On the IO port front, the loss of MagSafe charging is still felt, and while there are MagSafe like adapters for USB-C, I ask myself why does each new generation feel full of unneeded and unwanted compromise? Why can&#x27;t Apple just stop at replacing the USB-3.0 &amp; Thunderbolt ports with USB-C? A dongle for ethernet makes sense, a dongle for what seems to be everything is madness.<p>And what is Apples obsession with making their laptops ever-thinner? The Pro&#x27;s are not netbooks from the early 2010s that you can fit in your pocket. Their obsession with making each generation thinner seems to cause thermal throttling, with the culprit always being... <i>insufficient cooling<\/i>. Shocker. Yet this is supposed to be laptop for professionals?<p>This isn&#x27;t to say there haven&#x27;t been improvements. Thinner bezels are always welcome and Apple clearly puts a great amount of thought into their displays and it does not go unnoticed. In addition MacBooks only seem to get better at increasing battery life at levels above the competition.<p>For the time being the <i>it just works<\/i> factor of Mac OS and being able to use almost any linux package&#x2F;program thanks to homebrew will probably keep me as a user, but I can&#x27;t help but notice their <i>Pro<\/i> lineup seems to less and less useful for professionals and makes me wonder who Apple thinks wants any of these changes.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;folivora.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;folivora.ai&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-04 17:21:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gigatexal"],"id":[23073392],"kids":{},"parent":[23067181],"text":["So the question becomes now: who is buying this instead of a thinkpad&#x2F;Linux equivalent laptop?

Surprising for a company that likes proprietary connectors. Professionals quite often dock to a desktop setup.<p>- Not sure if the battery life can be trusted on the i7.

Lenovo and others have this figured out.<p>- Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro did not evolve its 13” design to offer something. The a Dell XPS 13 seems to have and offers a compelling package.<p>Having carried a MacBook for the better part of 15 years.. I switched when Windows Vista arrived and destroyed my computing environment with forced upgrades, In terms of performance and reliability, the 2014 13” i7 MacBook Pro could be the peak of Apple laptop quality and performance.<p>After 2015, the MBP continued its eating disorder obsession with thinness, which invited thermal issues as well as a keyboard that was never really ready for the real or professional world.<p>Current setup:<p>I purchased a i9 15” MBP a little over a year ago with 32 GB RAM. The ram has been nice, otherwise its generally been underwhelming and disappointing.<p>When picking this up, the Apple employee asked if I was excited because he personally hadn’t see many of this spec sold.  I mentioned to him after ones 10th or 15th laptop, you are more buying the death of a new device down the road.. than buying a new laptop... and I wasn’t looking forward to migrating.<p>So far, it has needed a replaced screen, battery, keyboard. It suffers like many from the phantom kernel_task cpu issue if you plug the power and an accessory on the left side of the laptop that instantly goes away if you plug in one on each side. I might tolerate this from an inferiorly priced machine. I carry a large PD battery to top up the 3-4 hour battery life and keep the laptop charged when carrying it between meetings.<p>I wonder if it’s normal for so many of my MacBooks to have gone in for repair, so many times, even though they remain in flawless condition physically years later.<p>I don’t buy a laptop, I buy a warranty and a guarantee of a working laptop so my laptop is can become invisible, just work, etc.<p>All this.. to say I tried out Ubuntu 20 last week on a Lenovo Tiny PC.

Take &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book for instance - it&#x27;s completely free online but I was more than happy to purchase the paper version in order to support the authors, the same way I donate to the Linux foundation, the PSF foundation and so on. And sure enough, I appreciate someone&#x27;s hard work here and I&#x27;d happily buy their books should I see them useful to me.<p>I can&#x27;t recall which artist it was (I recall it being Jan Garbarek but don&#x27;t quote me on this) who gave away an album online where you could get it for free or any amount you like. I recall several sales in the 5-digits which is a clear message. But much like textbooks, such music has a very particular audience and such... Let&#x27;s call them &quot;stunts&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be successful for most products and would backfire terribly."],"time":["2020-05-05 09:21:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["asicsp"],"id":[23076258],"kids":[23076577],"parent":[23073126],"text":["That&#x27;s crazy sales numbers.

Then, released the new book early (cutting down exercises and few more things). My post on HN [1] reached front page, in which I also mentioned about my other books. Last month saw the biggest sale ever for me, covers about four months of my living costs. After about two week break, I decided to update all my books (will take about two months). And then back to writing another book.<p>I also got an offer for one of my books from a publishing company, which I turned down.

This was a direct response to customers voicing their opinions on forums and radio show chats&#x2F;comments that made an effective feedback system possible.<p>I used to have to wait 2-5 weeks for a vinyl to arrive, and the USD-GBP exchange rate was horrible, so I  often resorted just getting the digital version, but after having lost my collections due to failed HDDs twice I knew I had to change.<p>And once they offered this option the community responded and an influx of vinyl purchases started to come in from everywhere creating 2-3rd pressings just to fulfill demand Soon after that low-cost vinyl players were starting to gain traction and it really took off, as it was seen as somewhat of a status symbol.<p>Now, every bandcamp artist worth it&#x27;s salt has limited pressings with exclusive deals that offer this as the model proved successful--many of the artists I follow are often sold out within a week.<p>The Freemium model can be pretty effective, I used it in my startup to some success: but 60x is beyond anyone&#x27;s expectations, congrats!<p>Sidenote: the aforementioned music community had its humble beginnings as a Pirate Radio station and being a platform to highlight local talent in an emerging scene. Years later Red Bull Music Academy would come around and invest tons of money in PR and events for those same artists."],"time":["2020-05-05 04:57:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bovermyer"],"id":[23073871],"kids":{},"parent":[23073126],"text":["I&#x27;m not surprised.

Ideally, you want everybody who wants to consume your product to do so at the highest price they are willing to pay (as long as that is above the cost of production and some minimum profit margin). People willing to spend a lot of money are willing to also spend less, but people who are only willing to spend less money are not willing to spend more. Therefore you target the high-buyers first and the low-buyers second, until you reach zero.<p>2. Value loss over time means that there is some non-infinite window in which to sell your product in order to maximize profits. The trade-off is likely market (people wanting to purchase), selling price and exposure (how many people even know it exists) - x axis is time and y is profit.<p>In relation to this story, the exposure was low and the market was lower as a result. Reducing price increased exposure and therefore allowed the visibility of the product to the market out there. Don&#x27;t under value word-of-mouth!<p>I think this is why the film and music industry need to calm down about piracy. The EU for example withheld a study because it showed that piracy didn&#x27;t provably harm sales [1]. How many people have had their internet shut off, been fined or worse because of piracy - when there&#x27;s no proven victim. In fact, if anecdotes like this story are anything to go by - it may even improve sales.<p>My anecdote: After pirating the Matrix trilogy (in a time where I had no money), I ended up buying the films on DVD twice (each film individually and then the box set). I never would have purchased these films had I first not pirated them. Similarly, I found a PDF for a book on scrum before purchasing it - and then recommending my team do the same.<p>Side note: I remember interviewing for a company that did this kind of analysis and automatically adjusted prices for online websites. I don&#x27;t think those guys actually had any clue (it was all very young programmers and no mathematicians&#x2F;machine learning people) - but in theory it&#x27;s entirely possible.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;eu-study-finds-piracy...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 00:51:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gnicholas"],"id":[23075445],"kids":{},"parent":[23073126],"text":["Lots of edtech companies gave away their tools for free [1] to support distance learning during school shutdowns.

First it was a week of recommended WFH followed by a predictable shift to mandatory WFH but I&#x27;d already decided that NYC was not the place where I wanted to be when this all played out so I exiled myself.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know what going back to the office looks like at this point, both in timing and the logistics. The fact of the matter is that we have open plan layouts with minimal space per employee (basically a desk plus chair) because of cost. An office per employee simply doesn&#x27;t scale for the size of the big tech companies if they want to have offices in coastal urban areas.<p>I haven&#x27;t run the numbers on this but I&#x27;d guess it averages out at about 60sq ft per employee in the desk area and probably twice that once you factor in all the meeting rooms. It may even be as high as 150sq ft.<p>As an example since there are public numbers on this, Google&#x27;s building on 111 8th Ave is, I believe, 2.1 million square feet of rentable space divided over 16 floors. Higher floors have smaller footprints so for the lower floors that&#x27;s probably around 160,000 sq ft. I don&#x27;t know the number of employees per floor but I believe it&#x27;s around 1500 give or take so this would fit the estimate of 120-150sq ft per employee.<p>Google bought that building for $1.9B. It&#x27;s probably appreciated some since then but probably not hugely, being commercial. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s $3B. That&#x27;s a value of $1400&#x2F;sq ft. Assume an 8% gross yield then 140sq ft of space costs ~$2M and has an opportunity cost of almost $160,000.<p>Doubling that space gets real expensive. Even if you&#x27;re prepared to pay it, having room for the ~8000 employees you have gets impractical. 111 8th Ave is already one of the largest buildings in NYC (by rentable square feet). Google have already overflown to Chelsea Market and 85 10th Ave and probably more by now (I left ~3 years ago).<p>Social distancing is going to be a thing for the foreseeable future. People have this weirdly optimistic view that we can just develop a vaccine or an effective treatment for this. There are many diseases that have killed millions and been around for decades that still have no vaccine (eg HIV, malaria, dengue fever).<p>In fact, no coronavirus to date has had a vaccine developed for it.<p>It&#x27;s unclear what will happen with Covid-19. will it mutate and become something you seasonally just &quot;get&quot; like the flu? We have flu vaccines but they&#x27;re partially effective and the virus mutates such that you need a different vaccine every year.<p>Generally speaking, viruses tend to get less deadly over time (eg Spanish flu evolved into H1N1 eventually) but it doesn&#x27;t seem like Covid-19 is particularly deadly now. You might point to the number of deaths in each country but the number of infections in almost all cases is underreported. Some don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;ve had it.<p>Or will herd immunity kick in at some point?<p>But I look at all this and wonder if I&#x27;ll get back into the office <i>this year<\/i>.<p>Even when I do, I just don&#x27;t think more space or private offices are in my future. I also don&#x27;t foresee a WFH revolution.

Emulation should skip the rest of processing too.<p>This doesn&#x27;t give us much more information, and I&#x27;m not familiar enough with this code to understand the changeset. Thankfully, by looking up the changeset name, we can easily find the email that proposed the changeset[2], which explains the issue more in-depth:<p>&gt; There has been a long-standing (and documented) issue with seccomp where ptrace can be used to change a syscall out from under seccomp. This is a problem for containers and other wider seccomp filtered environments where ptrace needs to remain available, as it allows for an escape of the seccomp filter.<p>So the basic idea is to use ptrace to swap an allowed syscall with a forbidden syscall. Seccomp used to run before ptrace, so it would see the allowed syscall and allow the code to continue, but then ptrace would swap the syscall to something forbidden! The details are a bit thin, however, they don&#x27;t explain <i>how<\/i> we can do that. After a bit more digging, I found this pdf[3] which contains a simple POC showing the issue, and explaining it.<p>The TLDR is to use ptrace with `PTRACE_SYSCALLS` to execute until a syscall is hit. When a syscall is hit, seccomp would first check the syscall is allowed, and then pass execution to the tracing system of the kernel, that would stop the process for ptrace to inspect. From ptrace you can then modify the registers with `PTRACE_SET_REGS` to change the syscall being called (the syscall number is in register RAX on amd64) and resume execution. The kernel will then happily execute the modified, unchecked syscall!<p>So what changed is that seccomp will be run after ptrace now, so there isn&#x27;t a way to modify the registers before the syscall is run anymore.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;moby&#x2F;moby&#x2F;commit&#x2F;1124543ca8071074a537a15db251af46a5189907\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;moby&#x2F;moby&#x2F;commit&#x2F;1124543ca8071074a537a15d...<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux&#x2F;commit&#x2F;93e35efb8de45393cf61ed07f7b407629bf698ea\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux&#x2F;commit&#x2F;93e35efb8de45393cf6...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mail-archive.com&#x2F;linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org&#x2F;msg104378.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mail-archive.com&#x2F;linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org&#x2F;m...<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asm.rajiska.fr&#x2F;misc&#x2F;container_security.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asm.rajiska.fr&#x2F;misc&#x2F;container_security.pdf<\/a> page 9 for the explanation, page 16 for the POC code"],"time":["2020-05-04 14:44:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23069219],"kids":{},"parent":[23065994],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-04 17:32:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["jsnk"],"id":[23069427],"kids":{},"parent":[23065994],"text":["I had a memory leak problem running a node service inside a docker container.

I feel Tim&#x27;s railings against 21st century capitalism and praise for France for their bare-faced protectionism are misplaced, but understandable under the circumstances."],"time":["2020-05-04 18:06:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23068606],"kids":{},"parent":[23067957],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-04 16:40:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["FriendlyNormie"],"id":[23069558],"kids":{},"parent":[23067957],"text":["I suppose the stock is rising because a traitor at such a high level being visibly removed from the company is a good sign."],"time":["2020-05-04 17:58:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["lawnchair_larry"],"id":[23068701],"kids":[23069080,23068814,23068960,23069411,23075607,23069242,23068822,23068736],"parent":[23067957],"text":["The implication that race or gender is involved in the firings is pretty silly."],"time":["2020-05-04 16:48:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rickpmg"],"id":[23069313],"kids":[23069643],"parent":[23067957],"text":["I think it would have been more effective if he just &#x27;called in sick&#x27; (if that was possible for him) or staged an extended walkout of engineers.

Much as in the OP, the main thing they want is just current revenue, or at least proxies such as monthly unique users, significant and growing very rapidly.<p>So, I switched projects to one I can do as a sole, solo founder funded with just my checkbook.<p>Let&#x27;s get a view of something VCs do not like but their Web sites implied they would like:<p>To the users, my project is just a Web site.  The project is a new search engine for Internet content. The main <i>business idea<\/i>, drawing in part from some old work at Battelle, is that quite generally keywords are good for only about 1&#x2F;3rd of content search.  My project is for the other 2&#x2F;3rds.  Keys in the work are some new data and new ways to process that data.  The new ways are from narrow, advanced pure math and some original applied math I derived (users will not be aware of anything mathematical) -- this use of math is the <i>intellectual property, trade secret, secret sauce, technological advantage and barrier to entry<\/i>, etc.<p>Status:  Code for the project as envisioned, not just a <i>minimum viable product<\/i>, is ready for significant production, say, if enough users like the site, a one person company with revenue of $10 million a year, nearly all pre-tax earnings.<p>Team?  Just me, and that&#x27;s enough for now.  Qualifications?  Plenty in computing from IBM&#x27;s Watson lab and much more.  For the math, I hold a Ph.D. in applied math from a world class research university -- one advisor had other students build on my research and was later President at CMU.<p>Status:  Code (.NET and SQL Server) for the project as envisioned, not just a <i>minimum viable product<\/i>, is ready for significant production, say, a one person company with revenue of $10 million a year, nearly all pre-tax earnings.<p>Lesson:  My project is of zero interest to any well known VC.  They don&#x27;t care about any such project.  Period.<p>Before going live, I need to add data -- doing that.<p>Got delayed by some outside interruptions, e.g., moved.<p>Early on, but not really now, the work could have been helped by some VC funding.  Now, if the project gets even $1 million a year in revenue, then I will not want or need VCs.<p>So, net, with VCs, when I would have wanted them, they didn&#x27;t want me;  if I get to where they want me, then I won&#x27;t want them.<p>There is some advice about VCs:  Wait, that is, be successful enough, for them to call you.  If that time comes, I will just check my old files and tell them the dates when I did contact them and they were not interested.<p>I want to make two broad points:<p>First, the economic shutdown for the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that &quot;50% of the US economy&quot; (whatever the details on that are) is &quot;small business&quot;.  Next, as I have looked around at the families doing well, e.g., money enough for a 50&#x27; yacht, to pay full costs at Harvard, they are nearly all from running a family owned business and never got even 10 cents from a VC.  Okay, start and run such a business where computing, the Internet, maybe some <i>secret sauce<\/i> (now these three can be just dirt cheap, less than some people spend in restaurants for a year) help but without VC funding.<p>Point:  To do well in the US, don&#x27;t really need VCs; e.g., nearly all the US families doing well are running family owned businesses, all across the US and not just along the east and west coasts, without any VC funding.<p>Second, there should be some big opportunities in applying what is in the research libraries in math, science, and engineering and&#x2F;or doing and then applying more such research.<p>This fact has been well known for ~70 years by the US Department of Defense, CIA, NSA, Department of Energy, NSF, NIH, CDC, NASA, ONR, etc., well known and heavily exploited with huge benefits for US national security, health, and economic prosperity.  E.g., we got GPS from a project of the USAF.  For some decades, there were similar contributions from Bell Labs -- information theory (e.g., upper bounds on data rates), error correcting codes, the transistor, tiny solid state lasers lighting long haul optical fibers, etc.<p>Typically these projects are submitted and approved just on paper.  The batting average is high:  E.g., Keyhole (like Hubble but before Hubble and aimed at the ground instead of the stars), LIGO, the A-bomb, the H-bomb, the SR-71, navigation satellites (first from the US Navy and later from the USAF), nuclear fission power, the SSBNs, TCP&#x2F;IP, NSF Net (now the Internet), DNA sequencing (the key to detection of SARS-COV-2 and now maybe to a fast vaccine), ..., all worked just as planned, essentially the first time, on or close enough to on time and on budget.  Batting average!  ROI!<p>Gee, if the USAF charged a penny for each use of GPS they would have how much money?<p>If Bell Labs got a penny for each transistor they would have how much money?<p>Point:  The VCs just will not evaluate and fund projects presented just on paper and, thus, are missing out on such developments.<p>Final Point:  VCs make some money and do at times help some projects, but their methods of working are quite narrow, and in the US the paths for making money are in principle and at times in practice much wider.  There is a lot of opportunity doing projects the VCs won&#x27;t fund."],"time":["2020-05-04 19:09:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["frandroid"],"id":[23068938],"kids":[23071874,23069732,23071646,23073064,23098378,23076567],"parent":[23058280],"text":["Y&#x27;all missing the most important paragraph in the whole article:<p><i>&gt; I spent many years working in a satellite office.

After all, its how I involuntarily became a developer in the first place.<p>I was hired by Travelocity late in 2007 to be a designer.  In early 2008 I was a UI developer and if I wanted to continue to be employed I would have to figure it out.  JavaScript developers, at least competent ones, were nearly impossible to find, so it made sense for the company to convert me into a developer instead of struggling to hire somebody who probably couldn&#x27;t do the job anyways.  Keep in mind this is before jQuery became popular, before JavaScript became fast, and before massive MVC frameworks did your entire job for you.  Competent JavaScript developers were nearly impossible to find for what companies were willing to pay.  Also, keep in mind that at that time JavaScript developers earned about half what a Java developer earned but had a wider distribution of responsibilities to account for.  My incompetence that first year writing logic was a profitable opportunity cost to the employer.<p>As an aside I can remember Google Web Toolkit (GWT) from that time.  It would compile Java logic to JavaScript, which was great for barely competent Java developers who couldn&#x27;t figure out JavaScript.  The compiled JavaScript was garbage though.  The logic was a mess that often broke.  The people who generated that code were afraid of it and hid from it leaving nobody to own or maintain it.  It was like some horrid combination of pride, insecurity, hubris, and negligence rolled up in a ball.  Was this an opportunity cost or just stupid, it is a challenge to distinguish.<p>Fast forward to modern times and people who write JavaScript are easy to find and are paid much better.  Actual JavaScript developers are still almost as rare though.  Most people who write JavaScript are not actually JavaScript developers, but rather something like: Angular, React, or Vue developers.  They do not write original code, but supplement a framework.  If you put a gun to these guys heads and told them they had to write an application without their favorite framework they would happily take the gun from you and shoot themselves in the face.  They have no idea what the DOM is, how to architect anything, and in many cases writing any original logic scares them to death.<p>In many cases people who write JavaScript have absolutely no idea what to write, so they only write browser facing single page applications, because that is the preference of their pet framework.  To be fair some of the React developers might possess some vague half notion about the DOM, but they would call it a virtual DOM and get angry when I ask them to find <i>&quot;virtual DOM&quot;<\/i> in the standard DOM specification.  In fact many technical requests that are explicitly outside the immediate documentation of their favorite pet framework might make these developers immediately angry (inwardly insecure).  This folly is commonly known and accepted as an opportunity costs so employers set the expectations very low and don&#x27;t ask for such things.  The stupidity and incompetence are also distinguished by hiring employers during hiring and candidate selection whether they are looking for a Node.js developer or a UI developer even though its all the same language.<p>The better pay and frequent incompetence are opportunity costs, because somebody has to write this code.  The business need is present and so factors are adjusted to ensure delivery of necessary business solutions while reducing hiring risks.  It made sense to hire people who could get by just writing minimal logic over a framework tool, because developers are interchangeable assets of the business that come and go rapidly in the marketplace.  When there is a shortage of talent you take what you can and ensure it is commonly replaceable.  It should also be stated the conditions for hiring developers were well in the developers&#x27; favor because the business need was clear and businesses could afford to hire more people while enjoying the longest running bull market in history.<p>I suspect, though, this party is over.  We now exist in a period of rapid economic contraction unlike anything in history.  Before the recent bull market developers primarily existed to provide automation.  The value of most developers was in the reduction of expenditure on the employer&#x27;s internal operating costs.  During this bull market that value became lost as the lines between automation and product creation frequently blurred.  Regardless employers just knew they need people to write code and could happily afford it.<p>COVID has put many developers out of work and economists are anticipating the economic hardships will continue for about 2 more years.  From a business perspective developers are expensive cost centers.  Developers do not add to the revenue of the employer.  They only exist to substitute business expense for automation.  The people who actually generate revenue are called something like sales, marketing, or merchandising.  So, for a hiring manager of a business struggling to stay afloat why would they hire 12 barely competent people who write a few lines of code here and there for a framework SPA when instead they could hire 2 or 3 developers at a slightly hire rate that focus on automation in general?  In other words the safe expectation moving forwards is to expect that developers will require more from fewer developers or will find a completely different medium with which to engage their users&#x2F;clients.  With many developers suddenly out of work talent is no longer rare.<p>The opportunity costs have drastically changed in response to market pressures.  The employers who will most rapidly adapt their hiring and use of developers are those under greatest financial pressure.
