It is more geared towards ontology developers, biocurators, and the kind of people who might build tools biologists would use. I would recommend portals such as the OLS (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebi.ac.uk&#x2F;ols\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebi.ac.uk&#x2F;ols<\/a>) for biologists -- but even this site tends to be used by bioinformatics-savvy folks. Domain scientists and users often use ontologies indirectly. For example, the Human Phenotype Ontology is used in many clinical settings for entering patient phenotypes, and subsequently in diagnosis (making use of the logical structure of the ontology). The cell ontology is central to many single-cell seq efforts. And of course the GO is ubiquitous in interpretation of experimental data via enrichment analyses.<p>One thing we have tried hard to do with the OBO site is ensure we have up to date metadata for all registered ontologies -- including GitHub trackers. So if you have comments on any particular ontology then engaging the developers via their issue tracker is strongly encouraged. And OBO itself has a tracker, as well as a mail list anyone can join.<p>One thing we have not done a great job of is in giving any kind of order to the many ontologies now listed. It can be overwhelming to someone not familiar with the field. Which ontology should I use ?(or avoid?) Which ontologies integrate well together, and which ones have duplication or incompatibilities? We have a number of new developments in the pipeline that should improve the situation here through the development of a new mid-upper level ontology called OBO Core (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OBOFoundry&#x2F;Experimental-OBO-Core&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OBOFoundry&#x2F;Experimental-OBO-Core&#x2F;<\/a>).

A lot of work is community effort. Not saying that to deflect any criticism - constructive criticism is good!

The usual way is with a solid cup (think plastic) with a softer rubber-like ring around it. Near the ring, you will have atmospheric pressure (high) outside, and vacuum pressure (low) inside, so if the ring doesn&#x27;t make perfect contact with the surface, some air is going to come in and ruin you vacuum. What they are doing is that they are rotating a bit of water in the suction cup, which because of centrifugal force will come close to the suction cup frontier in a ring-like shape. This water ring will -- thanks to fluid mechanics black magic -- have a different pressure at its exterior and its interior. Its interior pressure will necessarily be the same as the vacuum, and you can make it so that the pressure outside is the same as the atmospheric pressure, hence, according to this paper, if the rubber ring fails to make hermetic contact, air won&#x27;t come in because at the frontier of the cup, the pressure is the same both outside (atmosphere) and inside (exterior of the water ring)."],"time":["2020-01-20 13:42:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ta1234567890"],"id":[22096381],"kids":[22103214,22098225,22097328],"parent":[22083072],"text":["Pretty cool.

Computer systems could be designed more carefully than they are at present, but safeguards that provide the protection of privacy are expensive. As the engineer has been trained to focus his attention on carrying out the task assigned to him in as inexpensive a manner as possible, concern for privacy has been too often ignored. In the absence of an organizational structure to enforce a code of ethics, a restructuring of the profession at the engineering school level is indicated. The engineering school curriculum must be modified to cope with large systems in which the citizenry are an integral part of the system, and a new curriculum be devised that would provide course material on the behavior of individuals and of organizations to balance the weight given to training in quantitative methods.<\/i><p>Published:  1968<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;P3829.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;P3829.html<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;rand&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2018&#x2F;P3829.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;rand&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2018&#x2F;P3829...<\/a> (PDF)<p>&quot;There are many amongst us who would not hesitate to build equipment to compromise the privacy of any given individual provided the price is right.

Especially the new virulent variation which defends privacy in public.<p>1) Privacy in Public is impossible<p>Besides being a contradiction in terms, imagine what an ideal society of public privacy looks like: a society where everyone is masked, where voices are obscured, where names are anonymized, where everyone is isolated from everyone by a wall that says, “why do you need to know?” It is patently absurd to promote privacy in public. And ultimately the winners are those who don’t follow the law — those in power in the first place. Do you really think governments and corporations are going to follow their own laws, or fail to ensure loopholes which only their and the cronies can fit through? Yes, look at China. The solution to advanced technology is not to pretend it can be stopped. The solution is to make it available widely and freely. Technology can’t be stopped. But it can be monopolized and misused.<p>2) Privacy in Public is economic sabotage<p>Economically, the more corporations know about their customers the more that their business decisions — both strategic and tactical — will be made upon data rather than intuition. The less they know about their users — as any HN reader should know — the more their business is at risk of dying. The presumption of corporations as evil is simply unintelligent. It is especially galling to see such knee-jerk stupidity in a forum dedicated to making corporations. The greatest engine of wealth mankind has ever invented are corporations unhindered by market manipulations. The one exception being rules against monopolization and labor-abuse — i.e, practices that undermine the existence of corporations.<p>3) Privacy in private is overrated<p>I received an amber alert on my phone a few days ago. If even one child could be saved from abominable acts of evil, even if it meant privacy was abolished in public and private, I for one would be willing to make that sacrifice. Yes, I’d be embarrassed. Yes, it would put an enormous weight on me to know that anyone could find out about anything I’d ever do or am doing. But for me, a society of truth is a society without a place for evil to hide — whether that evil is kidnapping or corporate corruption.<p>3) Privacy is going to be lost.<p>The war is over. We shouldn’t pretend that those who stand most to abuse privacy — the powerful — are the ones best suited to control their own behaviors. Laws won’t stop those passing the laws. Only unhindered permeation of technology will.<p>I recognize I’m saying something unconventional if not provocative. But when people are scared they make irrational decisions. I’ve never seen so much irrationality among the intelligent as when it comes to privacy.

It turns out, there is an upper limit to how &#x27;complicated&#x27; the statement being proved can be, before I, a &#x27;simple&#x27; verifier, can&#x27;t possibly tell the difference between a true claim and a false claim. The limit is called PSPACE.

Suppose that instead two people come to me, claiming some fact is true. Then, those two people are separated - they are not allowed to communicate. Then, I ask them both questions, again trying to ferret out lies. This procedure is called a &quot;Multi-prover Interactive Proof&quot; (MIP).

Suppose that again two people come to me, claiming a fact is true. This time, before the two people are separated, they divvy up some entagled quantum states. Then they&#x27;re separated, and not allowed to communicate. Then, I ask them both questions, again trying to ferret out lies. This procedure is called a &quot;Quantum Multi-prover Interactive Proof&quot; (MIP*). This time, things are different: There is (basically) no limit on how &#x27;complicated&#x27; the statement being proved can be before I, a &#x27;simple&#x27; verifier, would not be able to distinguish true and false claims. (Basically) The only limit on the ability of the provers to prove things to me is their ability to discover the claims, not my ability to verify those proofs.

It&#x27;s not clear to me how that premise is justified, and Kuhn&#x27;s claim that the model has failed to increase software freedom seems totally unjustified.<p>At the heart of Kuhn&#x27;s argument about &quot;seediness&quot; seems to be CLAs, which is where a third-party developer using software under FOSS terms is asked to sign the rights to their modifications over to the original vendor. If CLAs were coercive, this would indeed be seedy: FOSS developers would be getting baited into contributing to commercial products. But CLAs aren&#x27;t coercive; the AGPL requires only that you meet the requirements of the license itself, not that you sign away your rights to your own modifications. People sign CLAs because they want their modifications upstreamed, and to avoid maintaining forks, not because they&#x27;re legally required to do so.<p>Meanwhile, the kinds of software we talk about when we talk about the AGPL are overwhelmingly things that used to be (and in some cases in large part still are) closed source proprietary products. It&#x27;s a little hard to imagine a closed source distributed database taking off in 2020; 20-30 years ago, to use Kuhn&#x27;s framing, the opposite statement would have been more valid.<p>Fundamentally, software offered under the AGPL is almost always developed under the model of a single commercial vendor doing most of the heavy lifting, and, usually, all of the initial lift in getting a piece of software to the point of viability. It&#x27;s hard to see how these vendors are taking something from the community by releasing their products under the AGPL when their alternatives would certainly be either a fully closed-source proprietary release, or no release at all. Kuhn writes as if licensing and advocacy decisions determine the economics of software development, but if the last 30 years has been an experiment conclusively demonstrating anything, it&#x27;s that --- at least for the kinds of serverside code we&#x27;re talking about --- no matter how you license it, companies paying software developers are what gets software built.<p>I have strong opinions only about the AGPL; I don&#x27;t pretend to fully understand the ramifications of MongoDB&#x27;s SS GPL, nor do I support the SS GPL unreservedly."],"time":["2020-01-20 21:42:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pabs3"],"id":[22095684],"kids":[22103231],"parent":[22095674],"text":["This reminded me of the agreement between Qt and KDE, where if Qt is ever made proprietary, KDE can publish Qt under the BSD license:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olafsw.de&#x2F;a-better-qt-because-of-open-source-and-kde&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olafsw.de&#x2F;a-better-qt-because-of-open-source-and-...<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;QtFramework&#x2F;comments&#x2F;e9376a&#x2F;troublesome_development_about_relicensing_qt&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;QtFramework&#x2F;comments&#x2F;e9376a&#x2F;trouble...<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21755337\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21755337<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-20 03:09:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kazinator"],"id":[22102087],"kids":[22105662,22102923],"parent":[22095674],"text":["&gt; <i>The essence in non-legalese is this: If you offer a license that isn&#x27;t a copyleft license, the copyleft provisions collapse and the software is now available to all under a non-copyleft, hyper-permissive FOSS license.<\/i><p>Why would anyone choose this?<p>It must be for the sake of giving the downstream users some sort of assurance that a Bad Thing won&#x27;t happen to them, as a sort of promise.<p>&quot;If we ever commercialize this, we will give all of you the opportunity to do the same.&quot;<p>It seems that the only authors for whom it would make sense to choosing this license would be authors who have no intention of going mixed proprietary licensing now, or in the future.

These questions are asked from a developer-centric perspective. FOSS never has been, and never will be, developer-centric. Free as in freedom software was created to be USER-centric. The whole point is to take power AWAY from the developer, because otherwise the balance is always in the developer&#x27;s favor. The benefit for the developer is that developers are also users, so they in turn benefit from others releasing the software as FOSS, both as libraries to write better software with and as programs used in day to day computing.<p>Any issues companies have with FOSS licenses is entirely on them, assuming they arent one of the few who actively contributes to and fights for FOSS. MongoDB doesn&#x27;t like competition from Amazon? Understandable. But don&#x27;t play the victim and then turn around and screw everyone who isn&#x27;t Amazon over with a license change. Maybe instead you could take some of your shake-down money and put it to good use by lobbying against these monopolistic conglomarates in the valley so that they can&#x27;t use their overreaching power to screw you with your own code. Maybe instead, you could encourage ALL developers to start using copyleft licenses, instead of the weaker licenses everyone loves to throw on their project these days. Because those weaker licenses are somewhat to blame for this too. What good is a FOSS program if its just going to lead to more proprietary software? How does that help anyone? There&#x27;s a reason most of the big tech monopolies release most of the open source code they do produce under non-copyleft licenses. Its not because they love FOSS, its so that they can pay lip service to the community and then use it with their the proprietary programs we&#x27;re so concerned about them surveiling us with.\nOf course, the retort to all of this is &quot;developers need to eat to, how can we make money off of copyleft?&quot; I have two answers, one thats snarky but possibly helpful and one that&#x27;s honest but possibly rude, and hopefully enlightening. The first answer is &quot;Ask Qt.&quot; &quot;Ask Blender.&quot; &quot;Ask Redhat.&quot; Ask one of the many companies that do buisiness while still releasing their main software under a FOSS license. They all seem to be doing pretty well. The second answer is that I don&#x27;t care how or even if you make money. Thats not the reason you release something as FOSS. Never has been, never will be. If you release software as FOSS, its because you believe that there should be a balance of power between developers and users. Its because you believe that sharing information and knowledge is the best way we can improve quality of life for ourselves and those around us. If you can&#x27;t make those ideals your biggest priority even in the face of financial loss, frankly don&#x27;t even bother releasing your software as FOSS.

What neural networks are useful for here is to extract the feature vectors from the face and perform facial recognition on them."],"time":["2020-01-20 18:36:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nlh"],"id":[22100221],"kids":[22100461,22100321],"parent":[22100083],"text":["This is a totally random shot, but I wonder if Pixelmator Pro&#x27;s new ML Super Resolution could be of help here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pixelmator.com&#x2F;pro&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pixelmator.com&#x2F;pro&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;<\/a><p>You could grab individual frames of the video and run them through this and see what the results look like?<p>(no connection to Pixelmator - just played with the software and it looked pretty darn cool)"],"time":["2020-01-20 18:05:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hackpert"],"id":[22101415],"kids":{},"parent":[22100083],"text":["You might want to try out some stacking based resolution improvement methods, like the ones used in astronomy.

However if what you want to exchange is a blockchain asset, assumption 1 and 2 is very reasonable. Valuing a blockchain asset already assumes that the blockchain is trustworthy because the value and ownership of the asset requires a trustworthy blockchain.<p>A very cool result is that a party can perform a fair-exchange between a cryptocurrency and the solution to a problem in NP. For instance the ZKCP (Zero Knowledge Contingent Payment) protocol has been used to perform a fair-exchange of bitcoins for the solution to a Sudoku puzzle [2]. SIA coin uses a slightly different model to enable users to prove and collect cryptocurrency for storing another users data [3].<p>Taken to its logical conclusion, this seems like it would allow substituting information or math for currency. Could we build an economic in which hard currency is backed by proof-of-storage or solutions to problems in NP?

Hopefully it works out better than for the protagonist of that poem who ends up living in YMCA.

You will still likely be a cog, but with luck you might be able to influence the edges of the game.<p>2. Find an orthogonal vector into doing computer work - look outside the set or opportunities typically presented to you and instead look at problems you care about and whether you have an edge that lets you put together a team to go solve it. Note that this works best with at least one other person, you need someone in the trenches with you to keep morale up and even if you’re both talented at the construction and people end of things it’s better one specializes in each.<p>3. Organize your fellow workers - we are quite possibly the single best paid, most powerful group of workers in the history of humanity. There are efforts to collect this power so that we may actually influence the decisions that get made.<p>One last piece of advice, the way you feel in this moment is where anyone who has ever done anything great has started.

I am now an engineer with very little client facing responsibilities and am much happier. There were a few problems that I experienced with client facing work. You basically have to answer to another set of managers (a.k.a the clients) in addition to your actual managers. And managing client relationships is an entirely different skill set from the technical work. So if it doesn&#x27;t come naturally to you it can be down right exhausting to have to try and improve both people skills and the technical skills.  Also, missing client facing deadlines is much more serious than letting internal deadlines slip, which adds to the stress.<p>If I ever decide to move more towards a client facing role again, I would probably do one of two things. 1) Find a role that was very light on (or eliminates) the technical work, and only focus on managing the client relationships or 2) stay technical, but go the freelance route. If you are going to have to deal with all of the stress of managing clients, you might as well get the benefit of being your own boss.<p>Another thing to consider, appearances matter for these types of roles.

People will usually underestimate you because people who are not programmers don&#x27;t understand programming. When I broke into programming, my managers at the time wanted me to do QA instead. However, in my case they weren&#x27;t really paying attention and weren&#x27;t technically savvy, nor did they really actually care, so I simply ignored them and worked on the programming tasks instead. This doesn&#x27;t always work, but I think knowing when you can get away with breaking &quot;the rules&quot; is an important part of getting ahead. Looking at mega-successes like Carmack and Jobs, they also didn&#x27;t play 100% by the rules all the time.<p>It&#x27;s also important to understand when it&#x27;s beneficial to the company that you break the rules. Because if you&#x27;re just doing your own thing without a thought to the company&#x27;s needs, that will cause trouble. But if you break the rules in a way that you bring more value to the company than your formal job description dictates, then a smart manager will let you continue to do so (and if they aren&#x27;t smart, I recommend getting a new manager).<p>&gt; but now the whole system is geared towards blind compliance and disengagement<p>This sounds to me more like a company culture problem than necessarily an industry problem.

You can be a &#x27;consummate professional&#x27; by &#x27;solving challenging problems&#x27; in the very best way you can, but it seems like this just doesn&#x27;t hold much personal meaning for you anymore. I think you can do a couple things to find meaning in your work.<p>First I&#x27;d suggest not thinking of your work as &#x27;writing code&#x27;. Think of it as &#x27;producing a product&#x27;, &#x27;helping users&#x27;, &#x27;facilitating economic and social progress&#x27;. Re-gear what you do around those ideas. It reframes what you&#x27;re doing from just &#x27;mindless mechanical labor&#x27; to actually improving someone&#x27;s life, or enhancing the value of some part of society. If you don&#x27;t feel like your work is doing that, either change how you do your work, or do some other work.<p>You can focus more on performing the task at hand at the highest level you can. This might involve going back to school, attending conferences&#x2F;seminar on your subject, compiling lists of inefficiencies with your current work methods, trying to figure out how to work around problems in your current workflows or methods and how to solve them in really beautiful, simple ways.<p>You can look past the task at hand, and look at what it&#x27;s being used for. What&#x27;s the end goal? What can you contribute to that has to do with that? It might be a deeper understanding of how someone uses what you create, finding out problems or inefficiencies in those use cases, and working on how to solve those from your position.<p>You can also work on things outside your immediate purview that relate to either the task at hand or ultimate goal. Maybe there&#x27;s something in the SDLC that&#x27;s inefficient or creating unnecessary problems. Maybe there&#x27;s outside groups that have inefficiencies. Maybe there&#x27;s communication problems, process problems, business problems. What is really involved in the entire value chain of this thing you&#x27;re working on? How can you contribute, even if it means not working on code? How can you improve the whole process, the whole business?<p>And you can think bigger. How is society impacted by this thing you&#x27;re working on? What changes could you make at a level outside your organization that would help? Can you get engaged in civil organizations? Can you work directly with communities that have to do with this product? Can you organize a PAC of some sort?<p>Last thing I&#x27;d add is to beware a mindset of trying to &#x27;change the world&#x27; or &#x27;fix big problems&#x27;. I think these are negative perspectives, because they assume the world needs changing, or that things are broken. People that get passionate about an idea often drift toward a more extreme position than is realistic.

You&#x27;ll never want to write unit tests again (this is an exaggeration of course, but not much). IMHO the modern cult of unit testing has about the lowest effort&#x2F;reward ratio I&#x27;ve seen among standard programming practices. Put that effort into isolating non-trivial invariants in your code (which might actually require thinking about the problem, i.e., producing an informal spec), asserting those invariants everywhere you can in your code, and writing generative tests that just test your assertions with random input. Then you can think of higher-level invariants (&quot;properties&quot;) that might not be possible to verify in the code itself, and write property-based tests to verify those invariants. The most important such invariant is that your program computes the right answer. You can test this by creating a &quot;model&quot; or oracle which you are confident will compute the right answer (albeit perhaps horribly inefficiently), and writing property-based tests that verify that the model gives the same answers as your code on random inputs. (&quot;Inputs&quot; in this case aren&#x27;t just user data, but also sequences of operations or state transitions; they can be any data that your code bases its decisions on.)<p>Unit tests will always have their place as 1) a minimal, provisional test suite for initial development, and 2) some finite set of important edge cases that might not be covered by randomly generated test cases. But they are much less efficient (IME) than generative testing in terms of developer effort per-bug-found. Additionally, property-based tests force you to think systematically about your code to identify important invariants, and that&#x27;s always a good thing. You can spend the time left over from not writing useless unit tests in writing functional and integration-level tests, which (IME) are far more likely than unit tests to yield bugs (which IME generally reside in unanticipated interactions between components rather than internal logic errors)."],"time":["2020-01-20 21:15:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wizzwizz4"],"id":[22101377],"kids":{},"parent":[22094844],"text":["Thanks for posting this; I finally regained a link to American Fuzzy Lop (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lcamtuf.coredump.cx&#x2F;afl&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lcamtuf.coredump.cx&#x2F;afl&#x2F;<\/a>) which I&#x27;d forgotten the name of.

It was super awesome that everything worked exactly as it should and it clears the way for SpaceX to launch people to the space station.<p>What is more relevant for me, is that if NASA follows their own rules, it also means that SpaceX will beat Boeing to having a manned spacecraft capability.<p>The &quot;rules&quot; in play here is that Boeing had a requirement of doing a successful unmanned flight. In government contracts this is known as a &#x27;threshold requirement&#x27; meaning that it has to be done before the contract can be completed. Boeing also had a parachute deployment failure during their drop test. As NASA (and some members in Congress) have been emphasizing on how important safety is and relentlessly hammering SpaceX over their refueling techniques and their &quot;history&quot;, if they do not want to be seen as hypocritical they should require Boeing to at least achieve a successful unmanned flight to the space station and they could piggy back the parachute deployment test on that flight (and get a twofer, both the parachute test and the end to end flight test.) Requiring that however, will cost Boeing money (they have to pay the expenses for the retest out of their pocket) and more importantly time (they need another launch vehicle from ULA and a launch window). Versus SpaceX which only needs the results of today&#x27;s test audited and signed off before they can launch their test crew. So perhaps 60 days, 90 at the most before they are cleared to fly people.<p>So I think it is highly likely that SpaceX gets people up into orbit first. And that is a pretty amazing milestone and it slaughters a couple of sacred cows in the aerospace industry.<p>The most impressive one for me is that an aerospace company can be started from scratch and beat all established players in capability, cost, and launch cadence. It is both a huge endorsement of SpaceX&#x27;s approach and a huge black eye for the existing players. Given that the existing companies actually want to survive it heralds some really exciting times ahead for space.<p>The other thing is that a company has this capability at all. I was talking with some friends about how do you &quot;value&quot; that in the market? How does it affect the geopolitics of space? What happens when Bigelow aerospace or another &quot;space industry&quot; partner starts selling access to orbital facilities that aren&#x27;t government owned and operated?<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned I wish this had started 40 years ago rather than a bit less than 20, but I&#x27;m glad I have had a chance to watch it unfold.

How you navigate through the environment matters. A lot. Let me use an example to try to illustrate how navigation plays a role in the method of loci. You&#x27;re tasked with remembering how to solve a maze you must walk through. Consider how your brain ultimately end up encoding the solution. The brain only retains information that&#x27;s (likely) relevant to solving some problem it is motivated to solve, and, also noteworthy, it tries to encode this information as sparsely as possible. Thus, what you end up remembering is not the precise spatial layout of the maze. Instead, you remember a stack of instructions&#x2F;decisions associated with certain visual cues that contain a very small handful (say 1 to 3) of precise identifying details framed within a very undetailed visual &quot;gist&quot;.[0] How does this relate to the method of loci? Well, as the encoding of your memory palace matures in your brain it is precisely these pictorial memories that end up solidifying in long term memory and becoming the &quot;loci&quot; in which you place the items you want to remember.<p>This entails some important things: first, to actually use a &quot;method of loci&quot; it is important that the environment change little. The solution here does not appear to afford that; you generate the environment, you can change the environment, etc. Well, learning is ultimately a generative activity, so this is okay. Chunking is a generative activity, and that is a highly effective memory technique. But I am going to guess that this, as a generative activity, is not significantly more effective than the generative activities of spider diagramming or outlining in a word document. Worse, if it&#x27;s implemented poorly or lacks certain features it&#x27;s probably worse. Second, to actually use a &quot;method of loci&quot; it is important that you have a clearly defined path to navigate. Again, the solution here does not afford this, as you seem to be constantly moving around wherever you like in the environment. Exploration is fine as a learning activity but if you never boil it down to a specific path (like you do in the maze example), you&#x27;re not creating a true &quot;mind palace&quot; and getting the benefits thereof. Third, each loci must have specific and fairly apparent details that distinguish it from the others, or else your images will tend to get confused. Doesn&#x27;t look like this solution offers much in the way of that with the little models you can place on the islands. I assume that will change over time.<p>As a side note, I also once tried to use the method of loci with such a top down perspective as you see in the demo (specifically I was using the Sims 2, ah how I love that game...). I found it didn&#x27;t work that well.<p>Some years ago my experience was further validated by reading Mary Carruthers&#x27; work on the medieval idea of _ductus_, a core concept in medieval memorytechnique. Ductus doesn&#x27;t have to do with a defined navigation of your body through an environment, though, but a defined navigation of your eyes through an image.<p>To sum up point #1, this solution does not help you produce strong loci like you get with a true method of loci. The &quot;loci&quot; it helps you produce are, if I had to guess, not significantly more effective than the &quot;loci&quot; you produce in your mind when you create, view, and encode the spatial relationships in, say, a draw.io diagram.<p>2. The loci are not being populated with imageable contents, and the method of loci works best for imageable content. I remember reading some cog psyche studies showing this somewhere but CBA to go find them. Also, the more specific the images the more memorable. E.g. apple is worse than Macintosh is worse than &quot;that one Macintosh apple I saw on the floor at the store last week&quot;.<p>3. Related to #2, converting non-imageable concepts to images is expensive and, when you don&#x27;t have at least a partly preconceived &quot;memory language&quot; of images, this almost always offsets the advantages of using the method of loci. I think the problem with non-imageable content is probably the biggest obstacle to using the method of loci for real work (There are some exceptions to this, e.g. if you&#x27;re learning Art History or Medicine) and this does nothing to solve that big problem. Again, I think this puts it in the same league as other diagramming&#x2F;outlining techniques.<p>&lt;long tangent&gt; \nThe solution to this problem I found was creating a bunch of rules for creating such a &quot;memory language&quot;. Most of these images (I call them &quot;esographs&quot;) are compiled and a few can be made JIT when you need them. Another advantage of using these rules is that creating and using the esographs can be a mnemonic&#x2F;memory exercise in of itself that can be used for real work. An example. I might use a black chicken to represent the concept of a decimal point. The connection comes from a story that I heard from watching the TV show QI[1]. The story goes that John Napier, the inventor of the decimal point, had a thieving servant. Now, to figure out which was the thief he persuaded his servants that he owned a magic black chicken that could identify thieving hands when touched. He placed this chicken in an empty room and had each servant go in and touch it. In reality, the story goes, the chicken was actually covered in soot and he identified the thief by seeing which servant had clean hands.<p>Now you can see that this image packs a whole parable-like story (which is itself a memory techniqe), and every time I use this image it reinforces my knowledge.<p>The trick to creating a &quot;memory language&quot; like this is to get into the habit of creating these images whenever possible and eventually you will build up enough images to have some sort of fluency in the language. Admittedly, this is a difficult habit to pick up. But after a while it has been paying off in my case, and can be enhanced with the method of loci. YMMV.<p>Digging through some old notes I found a list of good &quot;rules&quot; for converting non-imageable concepts into imageable ones. I&#x27;m not sure if I should share them since this post is already really long.<p>In any case, such a framework is actually more important than the method of loci since, without it, it&#x27;s very difficult to use the method of loci for real work.<p>Funnily enough, such images representing abstract concepts is also core to medieval memorytechnique and also seems to be a major underlying motivation for religious iconography. And of course you can use the iconography as readymade images for certain concepts.\n&lt;&#x2F;long tangent&gt;<p>I guess the last thing I will mention is that the method of loci seems to work quite well for some people, especially when they are highly motivated and interested in content that is more imageable, but it does not seem to be all that effective for others. So YMMV.<p>[0] Anecdotally, I have a long commute that doesn&#x27;t require a lot in the way of cognitive effort to navigate. I noticed that it took a very long time for me to remember the landmarks on long stretches of road where I don&#x27;t have to turn.<p>[1] Season 3, Episode 3"],"time":["2020-01-19 08:41:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j7ake"],"id":[22090774],"kids":{},"parent":[22087780],"text":["It worked great on Safari.

Take, for example, &quot;employee morale&quot; which matters because it may affect, say, retention, or product quality. Hubbard suggests that we can measure (many|most|all|??) of these things by using a combination of &quot;calibrated probability assessments&quot;[2], awareness of nth order effects, and Monte Carlo simulation.<p>Basically, &quot;if something matters, it&#x27;s because it affects something that can be measured&quot;. So you identify the causal chain from &quot;thing&quot; to &quot;measurable thing&quot;, have people who are trained in &quot;calibrated probability assessment&quot; estimate the weights of the effects in the causal chain, then build a mathematical model, and use a Monte Carlo simulation to work out how inputs to the system affect the outputs.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not <i>perfect<\/i>, since estimation is always touchy, even using the calibration stuff. And you could still commit an error like leaving an important variable out of the model completely, or sampling from the wrong distribution when doing your simulation.

It was one of the first efforts to apply mathematical logic to philosophy (Wittgenstein borrowed a lot from it), and to provide an axiomatic model of emotion. Very roughly, it took a two pronged approach to illustrate there is no objective logical foundation for differentiating between &quot;me&quot; and &quot;not me&quot;: firstly, by showing that, given determinism, everyone&#x2F;thing is part of a single unalterable process, and secondly, by showing that there is no single objective standard for drawing the line between a thing and the things around it. (He doesn&#x27;t deal with nondeterminism, but most of the conclusions could be mapped directly to a system containing a mix of nondeterminism and determinism, as adding nondeterminism cannot &quot;increase&quot; moral responsibility or &quot;self-causation&quot;).<p>In that sense it gave a (comparatively) rigorous argument for the nebulous eastern concept of &quot;oneness&quot;. Using this foundation he then makes a logical argument (given his axiomatisation of emotion) for why we should be happy.<p>It&#x27;s also the book that made me realise that, even if the jealous Abrahamic God exists, He is not moral. Because due to determinism every action can be traced back to the initial cause, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense for Him who created the universe to punish or reward people for actions that were ultimately predictable consequences of the universe&#x27;s creation, which if omniscient he should have foreseen. (And if some things are nondeterministic, this still applies, because somebody cannot gain moral responsibility through decreased determinism)."],"time":["2020-01-20 05:52:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["richev"],"id":[22094412],"kids":{},"parent":[22092108],"text":["I can really recommend Sweating Bullets: Notes about Inventing PowerPoint[1].

This book caught my eye as it was one of the few actual books on any form of science I had seen there (many of the books were history, and often specifically about Texas, which did not interest me).  \nAs the title suggests it is a part History, part Chemistry, book about the development of theory of electrons and the steps it took to get there. It explains various theories, and state of the Chemistry world at certain times in History. It often quotes and references older books, and provides the citation at the bottom.  \nWhile my Chemistry knowledge is really lacking, it was still quite an interesting read. I haven&#x27;t yet completed it, but I&#x27;m slowly working my way through it, and it&#x27;s reinvigorated some of my interest in Chemistry that I had lost in schooling.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Electrons-Valence-Development-Theory-1900-1925&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0890961247\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Electrons-Valence-Development-Theory-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-20 01:55:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zokier"],"id":[22094410],"kids":{},"parent":[22092108],"text":["I did enjoy The Transylvania (or Writing on the Wall) Trilogy by Bánffy. It has similar feeling to Tolstoy (Anna Kareina, War and Peace) but bit less high-concept and more grounded to reality, maybe bit closer to Il Gattopardo by Lampedusa. One nice thing about Bánffy is that it gives insight on a period and setting that was so important, but not that well understood, in (European) history; the just before fall of Austro-Hungarian empire that eventually then led to triggering first world war. The books are fictional, but the author was an actual count from that era which lends certain degree of authenticity to it.
