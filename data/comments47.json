How could I not find out about this soon enough. I mostly deal with static typed languages and seeing the primary use of map and keywords as main data structure scares me. Rich Hicky said not to put too much emphasis in what in the map but the data&#x2F;keywords you need, kind of like you do not care what in the UPS truck as long as it could deliver your package, right? But, navigating maps and nested data structures around is the pain. Specter definitely easies that pain a lot now that I know it!<p>This is why I am grateful for hackernews. Once in awhile, browsing the site and discover something like this makes me rethink the ways I do stuff.

All 12 pitches of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music without emphasis on any specific note.

Just sharing some bits about my experience, this is just my experience and doesn&#x27;t reflect official Policy.)<p>Prior to working at Amazon, I had mostly worked for start-ups. The thing I found at startup is that people are trying to figure out processes, and it&#x27;s kind of hard. Most people putting in a process (whether that&#x27;s HR or the founding team) are trying to do their best, but start-ups aren&#x27;t at a large enough scale where they really need to have scalable processes, and for individual contributors all the distinctions are pretty informal anyway, so there&#x27;s usually no individual contributor promotion path.<p>At Amazon, I was fortunate to work under someone who had been my boss previously, and we had a good working relationship. He was not afraid to give me blunt, useful feedback about either my work or how my work was perceived.<p>At some of the start-ups I worked with, part of the year-end evaluation involved filling out a form with a lot of evaluation criteria - the employee would fill out a self-eval form, and the manager would fill out a form, and then they would compare during the evaluation meeting. There&#x27;s no such equivalent at Amazon.<p>One thing that overall I like about Amazon&#x27;s performance management in terms of promotions is how it&#x27;s centered around a document that you and your manager write together. There are some tedious aspects to the process, but if nothing else when you go up for promotion you know what your manager is officially telling other people are your strengths and weaknesses. The flip side of the process is that decisions about your promotion are being made based sometimes on the quality of your promo doc. I&#x27;m not sure about all the company, but at least in the team I was on some of the senior folks set aside time for reviewing promo docs that they were working on with other members of the team to iron out any &quot;doc writing&quot; issues.<p>We don&#x27;t really have an official OKR system, but as a more senior engineer my personal goal has generally been to enable whatever my team&#x27;s goal is for the quarter or year (launch this product; get this architecture document done; research how to solve this problem).<p>Besides the official process, I&#x27;ve also found it useful to ask trusted peers how I&#x27;m doing, whether I&#x27;m giving them everything they need and expect of me.

We have tried Balanced Scorecards&#x2F;OKRs linked systems, 360 Evaluations, etc and ended up making a mix.<p>We used Google Sheets and asked for qualitative feedback on defined headers (skill with KPIs &amp; culture&#x2F;values), and a rating (1-5). Each of the headers had weightage that changed with roles &amp; levels.<p>We tried to make promotions and compensation changes as data driven as possible, but they were inline with intuition &#x2F; general opinion. To the employee it always felt like &quot;Why did we do all this for such little change?!&quot; It sucks but you need to improve the system across many years. With every round try and understand signal vs noise. That&#x27;s how you build trust.<p>Consistency is key. A few learnings regardless of the system that I learnt the hard way:<p>* Communication. You need to communicate before, during and after the process. You need to make it relatable for all levels of employees. Give them specific templates with specific examples. You need to remove the narrative of you-vs-them, doing-this-to-justify-an-increase, and bring focus on reflection.<p>* Frequency&#x2F;Cycle. &quot;if it hurts, do it more often&quot; is the quote that applies to this. Never let it slide. Minimum every six months, ideally every quarter.<p>* Review of KPIs. You need to review the KPIs every week without fail. It forces you to focus on metrics that you can move on a week-on-week basis. Anything that changes in step function over a month&#x2F;quarter&#x2F;year can be broken into a smaller metric.<p>*  Rewards and Recognitions. We were always late on this. Always rolling out the red carpet when someone threatened to quit. It always felt like extortion as the manager. Don&#x27;t wait for the cycle to call out extreme performance (great and terrible). Give negative feedback in private as quickly as possible. Do a non-monetary (Amazon Gift Coupons etc) for great performance. Wait for promotions and compensation.<p>* Pay performance linked pay well. I think this was what I got wrong the most. I did not plan the company finances well enough to pay out immediately. I would say &quot;Hey great performance! We will pay you $$ but in 2-3 months when our situation improves&quot;. That erodes trust in a moment.<p>* Getting and acting on feedback. I struggled on this one too and made many excuses -- we are going through a curve<p>Hope this helps.

I&#x27;ll explain my philosophy behind performance levels and goals.  I&#x27;d love any feedback.  I&#x27;m specifically trying to make this an actionable process.<p>First, the levels, because I perhaps have a different interpretation of these than I&#x27;m used to seeing.  There are essentially three levels that correspond to performance compared to expectations.  So underperforming, performing, and overperforming.  Only underperforming carries a negative connotation [0], because it means that you are not meeting the expectations for your level.  In contrast, overperforming means that you are reaching beyond your current level.<p>So, hopefully we have zero people underperforming.  Also, hopefully we have the vast majority of people performing.  Because overperforming basically means we need to be finding an expanded role for that person, which we may or may not have.  If too many people are overperforming, then we can maybe expect turf wars as people start trying to expand their role without guidance, which is terrible for morale.  Hopefully we can balance overperformers with growth, so we are moving people to expanded roles and then filling in below with new hires.<p>So, given this leveling, there are two types of goals:  baseline and growth.  Baseline goals apply to the entire team and define those baseline expectations for that team.  Meeting these goals will keep the team out of underperforming territory [1].  Growth goals are tailored to a specific individual, and detail specific targets to work on.  The idea is to provide meaningful growth to the person and their capabilities, with an eye towards expanding their role.  Over time, having and meeting these growth goals will result in overperforming as the individual fills that expanded role more and more.<p>[0] Caveat:  I would expect a junior-level to be growing.  So juniors who are not overperforming are worrisome.<p>[1] There&#x27;s a bit of issue here in team vs individuals.  Generally, as long as the team is successful, I tend to err on the side of overrating individuals.  After all, part of the reason we make teams is to allow them to shore up weaknesses and play to strengths.  However, I leave in an out by having a baseline goal centered on teamwork and team success.  So if someone is not contributing as expected to the team, there&#x27;s something to call them out on."],"time":["2020-09-04 18:33:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["underwater"],"id":[24381301],"kids":{},"parent":[24374347],"text":["I&#x27;m surprised at the references to OKRs as a part of performance reviews.

Best example I saw recently (and I can&#x27;t find the twitter thread, I&#x27;m sorry) was weirdly shaped food startups. The large point was that there are stores for oddly shaped food, they&#x27;re just ones rich people don&#x27;t normally shop at (WinCo anybody?). And there are uses for damaged food, like juice.

We urge you to take steps to preserve the funding prerogatives of Congress before allowing any such disruption to take place, for the following reasons.<p>&gt; First, the House-passed version of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2021, contains additional funding not requested by the Administration to continue operating Stars and Stripes. Second, the Senate has not yet released a defense appropriations bill, nor had an opportunity to conference with the House position, leaving it as a real possibility that Congress may not agree with the proposal to eliminate this funding. Third, the standard text of a continuing resolution – that funds are provided “at a rate of operations… for continuing projects and activities” as provided for in the previous year’s Department of Defense Appropriations Act – places a legal obligation on the Department to not act on a termination of a program until a full-year appropriations bill is enacted. We seek your written assurance that the Department will comply with this obligation and avoid steps that would preempt the funding prerogatives of Congress.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boozman.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;index.cfm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;9&#x2F;boozman-colleagues-urge-dod-to-reinstate-stars-and-stripes-funding\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boozman.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;index.cfm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;9&#x2F;boozm...<\/a><p>Additional coverage:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.military.com&#x2F;daily-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;senators-esper-reverse-your-decision-kill-stars-and-stripes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.military.com&#x2F;daily-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;senators-espe...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stripes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us&#x2F;bipartisan-group-of-senators-urges-esper-to-keep-funding-stars-and-stripes-1.643650\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stripes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us&#x2F;bipartisan-group-of-senators...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-04 18:08:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["glitcher"],"id":[24376423],"kids":[24376774,24376626,24377246,24377163,24376515,24383013,24377844,24380450],"parent":[24374807],"text":["One thing I&#x27;ve always wondered about when it comes to the temporary nature of US presidential terms and their respective administrations - why does it seem like it&#x27;s so much easier to dismantle things than to create them in the first place?<p>Especially for things that took a substantial amount of time and effort to build, shouldn&#x27;t we require much more scrutiny before considering an action that effectively dismantles&#x2F;dissovles&#x2F;destroys \nthem?

You don’t need to resort to nuances to tell the difference between the music of the 1970s and 1950s or the 1950s and 1930s.<p>I find this comparison completely ridiculous. It is not just that I can tell difference between Madonna and Lady Gaga or 1980 metal against todays one. It is also that the actual difference between 1970s and 1950s music is that they changed genre. Metal must be metal, if it was different then metal if would not be metal. It just so happens that new genres did appeared between 1980 and now. Contemporary techno progressive music is incomparable to anything in 1980. Also, 1980 music is ridiculously easy to distinguish as 1980 music. And not just that new genres appeared, the music in 1980 was not consumed the way it is consumed now - all the time for free huge selection by own personal choice.

Considering the scale and complexity of a large &#x27;enterprise&#x27; org AD deployment, I found it hard to believe that Microsoft would come away with nothing.<p>The most realistic outcome seemed like the DoD would rely on AWS for most infrastructure simply because the people at the top wouldn&#x27;t know better and regulatory capture. I figured they would, almost begrudgingly, bring Azure into the mix, simply because Microsoft makes it nearly impossible these days to retain a completely on prem AD deployment and how in the hell is a bureaucratic monstrosity like the DoD going to disentangle itself from Active Directory?<p>Another scenario is that if whomever is in charge of making the final decision is a bit more forward thinking and has some vision, they&#x27;ll go all in on a multi-cloud strategy for maximum redundancy and resiliency and we might see GCP get thrown in the mix. I think it&#x27;s really hard to argue against this strategy for an org as important as the DoD frankly. Some people often make the argument that starting with one cloud platform and incrementally moving beyond that is the way to go, but I strongly disagree with this. A true multi-cloud strategy has to start by incorporating multiple platforms from the beginning or else you&#x27;re extremely likely to get locked into a single platform due to organizational inertia. Not to mention the cost benefits. Locking yourself into a single vendor basically removes all your leverage to take your business and go elsewhere. You really can&#x27;t bluff your way out of that one either, because what are you going to do? Go redeploy all your applications that were built with proprietary platform specific tools on a _different platform_? Nope.<p>I think the most unlikely, but also most interesting outcome would have been the DoD goes all in on GCP and the chromebook style of computing, basically tearing everything down and starting from scratch. If ever there was an opportunity for that, this would be it, though there are many arguments against that. I think there&#x27;s a scenario in which something similar might have been possible for AWS, but in reality it doesn&#x27;t seem possible, because AWS doesn&#x27;t really have a competitor to G-Suite &#x2F; Office365. I know they have WorkDocs, but that&#x27;s not exactly the same thing.<p>Having used all three, including Azure, myself though, I really didn&#x27;t believe a Microsoft only scenario would come about. Among other reasons, and to be fair its been a while, but last I remember Azure&#x27;s annual downtown far exceeds the other two platforms, which seems like a pretty critical point when considering the systems running on here may hold soldiers lives in the balance.<p>Anyways, I do hope we see a more reasonable scenario come about eventually. Any single vendor locking in the DoD would be a disaster for national security, soldiers lives, and frankly the federal budget."],"time":["2020-09-05 01:02:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blaisio"],"id":[24379731],"kids":[24380042,24379778,24379898],"parent":[24379304],"text":["I think this is meant to try and make it more of a political issue.

And let&#x27;s set aside the fact that in the end it&#x27;s all going to regress to supervision, without which you can&#x27;t optimize. Let&#x27;s also set aside the fact that performance against a &quot;gold standard&quot; SemEval dataset doesn&#x27;t mean shit in a lot of real world applications.<p>So you try out the standard issue &quot;top of the line&quot; algo, like YAKE, which is so fucking slow in pure Python that it&#x27;ll choke a Bayesian optimizer. You sit around for a while debating whether or not to port it to Cython, having little idea if the effort will pay off because you aren&#x27;t sure how well YAKE is going to work to begin with and it might get bested by another algo anyway.<p>So you go looking through the literature and you&#x27;re delighted to find that within just the last few months, there have been some really cool and promising algos coming out with solid benchmarks, and there&#x27;s code available to boot. Yay!<p>So you download the &quot;weakly supervised&quot; statistical one and it turns out to be a fucked up polyglot of Bash, C++, and a stale version of OpenJDK, some of which you have to compile yourself with g++, and then you have to dump your corpus into text files even though you&#x27;ve already got it in memory, run it through a tokenizer you neither want nor need, and then read the results back out of other text files. Sure, there&#x27;s a docker version. It&#x27;s full of bloat and solves some of the more negligible problems at hand.<p>Then you download a graph-based algo and it&#x27;s such an undocumented mess of spaghetti it might as well have been written by an Italian restaurant. So you spend a really unreasonable amount of time just trying to figure out which function even takes your text as an input, and you read through a bunch of other functions trying to figure out if it needs to be pre-tokenized or not and if it wants the input as sentences or not or whatever. It also wants your input as a text file.<p>Then you download a language model-based algo and you think you&#x27;re going to run the BERT variant you have at hand, but you double check the paper and it happens to perform way better with ELMO and then if you&#x27;re lucky you don&#x27;t spend a whole day trying to get AllenNLP running because you&#x27;re using WSL on a laptop without a GPU and the non-gpu Tensorflow dependency is shitting itself all over the stack trace. You finally get the environment going in all its bloated glory even though you just wanted the pre-trained ELMO model, which you finally get deployed to Cortex or whatever and breathe a sigh of relief. And then it turns out your corpus is so domain specific that your matrix is sparser than swiss cheese because it&#x27;s chock full of unks.<p>What have you learned after all this? That building an ensemble model which plays nicely with spaCy or SparkNLP is going to be an order of magnitude harder.

Until a complete and detailed standard is published, Rust will not have a stable AI, and cannot enjoy multiple implementations (which inhibits its portability).

You should be getting both guidance navigating your company&#x27;s politics from your manager, and overall career growth by working on their team. Sometimes they won&#x27;t be technically stronger than you, but in those cases they should be helping you grow in other ways (giving talks, mentoring others, taking on leadership tasks). In cases where they are technically more proficient you should be learning from them, perhaps not actively but at least they&#x27;re pointing you in the right direction. During all this you&#x27;re enjoying spending time working with this person professionally.<p>In return what you offer your manager is someone who&#x27;s capable of doing work and becoming increasingly capable of working with less direction. Eventually you take ownership of initiatives. You should advocate for your team where appropriate, but never fanatically. You should be brave enough to speak up if you&#x27;re worried about their course of action.<p>The main dynamic is this: In return for them helping you grow and navigate, you&#x27;re trying your best to be someone who&#x27;s self-sufficient, capable and someone they don&#x27;t have to worry about.<p>There are a few things you should definitely not be doing. You shouldn&#x27;t be spending too much time with them outside of work (an occasional happy hour or office event is a-ok). You shouldn&#x27;t be getting drunk with them. You shouldn&#x27;t be getting counseling or guidance on intensely personal issues like romantic relationships or personal life goals. Your relationship should pass a simple smell test: if you were to tell someone you were engaging in a behavior with your boss would they be shocked or surprised. If so it&#x27;s probably not appropriate. Here&#x27;s an example: &quot;I eat lunch with my boss a few times a week.&quot; Seems fine to me. &quot;I&#x27;ve eaten lunch with my boss every day for the last six months&quot; Seems a bit off to me. Of course different people will have different limits-- it&#x27;s up to you to set healthy boundaries that work for you.<p>Finally, when one of you moves on from the company, feel free to have any type of relationship you want with the manager. You&#x27;re both now two independent people. I would still overall caution from becoming too intimate with them, but it&#x27;s your life and you should trust yourself to steward it correctly. The reason I caution is that it&#x27;s because you really don&#x27;t know this person on a deeper level, and you might be surprised with what you find out. Most likely you&#x27;ll maintain some professional friendship, perhaps even help each other out for several years, but after that lose touch.

In the 1960 lots and lots of innovative reactors were build, often with relatively low budgets at that. The amount of untapped potential in nuclear energy is incredible. We don&#x27;t need fusion, fission is plenty energy dense, if we can&#x27;t figure out how to make fission practical, we want with fusion either.<p>Yet here we are in the year 2020 and we are still building new PWR reactors. But the reality is, in the US it is essentially impossible to build anything else. Regulations are designed so that the only reactor that can really get approval is a PWR.<p>If you attempt to build anything new, you have to basically pay the government to study your design and after a unknown amount of time and money, the government might develop a new regulatory framework. By the time that happens of course you have run out of money already, no buissness plan that depends on the government figuring out how to regulate a new type of reactor would ever really happen.<p>The good thing at least is that the DoE in the last 5 years seem to have realized that their whole approach was a problem and they have done a lot of good things to try to change. Outside of the US the energy sector is government controlled or to small for a nuclear reactor startup to have a large enough market to make a new reactor worth it.<p>Canada has established itself as basically the only viable place for new reactor development, with Terrestrial Energy and Moltex Energy (moved from Britain to Canada because regulation).<p>So, good luck to NuScale, I hope they can prove me wrong and deploy many of these in an economical way."],"time":["2020-09-03 20:54:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zymhan"],"id":[24367344],"kids":[24367736],"parent":[24358850],"text":["Previous Discussion 2 days ago<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24345288\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24345288<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 20:48:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jvanderbot"],"id":[24371236],"kids":{},"parent":[24358850],"text":["&quot;The design is based on Multi-Application Small Light Water Reactor developed at Oregon State University in the early 2000s.

It&#x27;s a very informative and thought provoking book.<p>&quot;Bullshit&quot; grossly misses some fundamental aspects about modern markets and power structures and as a result turns into an insipid, meandering grievance without substance.  The commentary mistakes social-welfare states which have monopoly enforcement on: credit repayment (legal tender), and authoritarian control of the means of production (permitting) as capitalism (_private_ ownership and deployment of goods and services).  As a result, the entire subsequent criticism that follows in the book is misguided.  If I had to summarize it: &quot;Economic (consumer&#x27;s-goods) producers are supremely inefficient in the deployment of labor, resources, time, production quantity which results in a social malaise&quot;.  It implicitly pathologizes the choices of people who work in the &quot;bullshit&quot; jobs as unable to make nuanced, multivariable decisions.  Yes, it may be the case a security camera would be a more efficient observer to an empty lot than paying a human, bored out of their mind, to sit in a hut. But that critique denies the economic calculus the hut worker made, that this job was the most ideal option out of the many different dimensions available to them.<p>If the set of available options cannot be combined to produce desired results, it&#x27;s not possible to combine inputs among a further reduced set of options to produce the desired results (&quot;regulation&quot;).  The only option is to increase the set of available options (liberalization, de-monopolization), to produce different outcomes.  The entire book fails to address to roll of entrepreneurship, e.g. a speculative endeavor by an individual or group that they can deploy labor, resources, time, production quantity in a more ideal and enjoyable arrangement.  The absence is a shame because instead of the book being a diatribe, it could have been a powerful call to action to improve our lot."],"time":["2020-09-03 21:00:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lucasnortj"],"id":[24367665],"kids":{},"parent":[24365811],"text":["Bullshit jobs was a tremendously tedious book but then that is to be expected from someone who  is an anarchist; an ideology that competes with Marxism in its idiocy"],"time":["2020-09-03 21:16:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["fskg"],"id":[24374127],"kids":{},"parent":[24365811],"text":["He tweeted this out recently:<p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;davidgraeber&#x2F;status&#x2F;1277208664873603075\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;davidgraeber&#x2F;status&#x2F;1277208664873603075<\/a><p>&gt; this is why I like the phrase &quot;white supremacy&quot;.

There was some relief but there were also unpleasant side-effects, and I just had a strong feeling these treatments were not really addressing the core problems, and indeed I even felt like the symptoms were fairly normal reactions to the life experiences I&#x27;d endured.<p>Later I tried to heal myself with nutritional and exercise-based approaches, and relatively conventional emotional approaches like meditation. Again, some mild&#x2F;temporary improvements were noticeable, but they were inadequate, and it still felt like there was something deeper I needed to connect with.<p>About 8 years ago, I found an approach that involves identifying and releasing traumas, attitudes, behavioural patterns, self-perceptions and defense mechanisms that are held in the subconscious mind, particularly ones that have been attained in early life and have snowballed through repetition compulsion [1] (a concept that Freud first articulated).<p>I&#x27;ve been undertaking these approaches continually since I discovered them, and bit by bit all the symptoms have resolved.<p>My experience has confirmed, at least to me, that these conditions are &quot;adaptive responses to adversity&quot; (or something else related to that concept), and that in order to heal the symptoms, I needed to understand their basis at a very deep level; as Jung said, &quot;making the unconscious conscious&quot; [2].<p>Once that had been done, adopting new, healthy attitudes and behaviours and living free of those symptoms has been fairly easy; i.e., healthier behaviours just emerged naturally once the causes of the unhealthy behaviours were identified and understood.<p>If any researchers or laypeople are interested to know more about the techniques I&#x27;ve used and the results I&#x27;ve experienced, I&#x27;m happy to be contacted (email address in profile).

It&#x27;s a biological thing. Psychology never helped me, instead it actively harmed me. The lectures of Robert Sapolsky and the concepts of cognitive behavioral therapy helped the most from the psychological perspective, however.

What I mean by this is that I sincerely doubt the authors intended to protect lies, deceit and libel.  It would make no sense whatsoever to create a law that effectively says &quot;You can lie cheat and steal all you want and this shall be protected by the highest law in the land&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the text from the first amendment:<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;<p>Some might say:  Well, libel is addressable through other legislation.<p>Well, yes and no.  It just so happens I was involved in a libel case many decades ago.  In this case a newsletter (this was before internet days) had given a competitor a monthly column to author.  This competitor decided to dedicate one column to attack our company and print a bunch of outright lies about our products.  Things like &quot;they don&#x27;t test&quot;, &quot;they ship their customers untested products&quot;, etc.  I mean, this guy knew nothing about us and yet he focused an entire page to defaming me and my company.<p>A meeting with my attorney resulted in letters to the publication&#x27;s entire board as well as the author&#x2F;competitor.  The only way I can characterize the reaction from the other side was &quot;they shit in their pants&quot;.  I came to learn a libel lawsuit is a very serious and potentially financially crippling event for someone without the means.  Large companies can manage them but individuals can lose their home, savings, job, etc.<p>I wasn&#x27;t interested in destroying lives or taking their home and savings.  They agreed to print a solid retraction, fire the competitor&#x2F;author and hire someone without skin in the game to pen that column.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem:  Retractions don&#x27;t work.  We saw an immediate and lasting hit to product sales.  It took about a year to recover from the hit piece.  Reputation is something that is hard to regain, particularly when people enter a fearful mental state.  In retrospect I should have been smarter and should have gone for a financial settlement of sorts to compensate for the damage they caused.  Our competitor actually gained sales and status in the industry as a result of this hit piece.<p>My point is that lies are like climbing to the top of a hill with a feather pillow, ripping it open and letting the winds take the feathers in all directions.  Fixing the damage caused by lies requires finding every single feather, which is impossible.<p>Sometimes I think we need to rethink this one aspect of the first amendment and either modify it or bolster it externally (through separate legislation) in order to prevent the kinds of lies and manipulation that have been a part of the press since, well, according to Jefferson, the very founding of this nation."],"time":["2020-09-03 17:31:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mensetmanusman"],"id":[24365575],"kids":{},"parent":[24361744],"text":["“  I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. “<p>This is the best quote, because they sensed to be true what we now know is true for pew research data.
