Computers should be able to do most of this for us. It makes no sense that we are still writing the same simple and tedious data validation and transformation programs over and over ad infinitum. There must be a better way.<p>This is the problem that we set out to solve with TerminusDB. We identified two absolutely indispensable characteristics that were currently sorely lacking in data management tools.<p>The first one was a rich and universally machine-interpretable modeling language. If we want computers to be able to transform data between different representations automatically, they need to be able to describe their data models to one another.<p>The second major missing requirement is effective revision control. Revision control technologies have been instrumental in turning software production from a craft to an engineering discipline because they make collaboration and coordination between large groups much more fault tolerant - and boy humans produce faults. The need for such capabilities is screamingly obvious when dealing with data - where the existence of multiple versions of the same underlying dataset is almost ubiquitous and with only the most primitive tool support.<p>In October 2019, we released version 1.0 of TerminusDB - it contained the culmination of 4 years of building out the data modeling capacity that we needed - the W3Cs web ontology language with a closed world interpretation.<p>We chose this solution firstly because OWL is by far the best thing humanity has yet produced in terms of a rich, machine-interpretable data modeling interchange format. It is essentially first-order logic with set operations - when it comes to platform interoperability nothing beats mathematics! And adding a closed world interpretation to OWL turns out to be surprisingly easy and semantically unproblematic (closed worlds are contained within open worlds).<p>In January 2020 with version 1.1. we released the first version of our immutable revision control storage layer - with many of the ideas shamelessly borrowed from git, but expanded significantly because when dealing with data, you need to distinguish between things like schema and instance data and keep them aligned. It turns out to require a significantly more complex structure of internal pointers, but it can be done!<p>In June 2020, we release version 2.0 - this included the revision control API - push, pull, branch and merge fully integrated with the database, query, and modeling engine. At this stage the database itself was more or less complete in terms of features, but there was one more critical and important point before we could say we had managed to deliver on our vision.<p>With distributed collaboration technology there is always a bootstrapping problem - it’s no use having technology that allows you to collaborate on data in a peer-to-peer decentralized way unless there are other people out there to connect to and collaborate with. To overcome that problem, we needed to deliver an infrastructure that would allow people to get started, to share and find data and collaborators.<p>Today we release TerminusDB version 3.0 and at the same time we open the doors of TerminusHub. The database is now fully integrated with the hub, allowing all TerminusDB users to share, store, publish and collaborate on databases with other users and do so at the grand price of free. With this release, I think we can say that we have a product that delivers on our vision.<p>The product itself is only a means to an end. We built TerminusDB to take away the pain of building amazing evidence bases for computational analysis. Although we will relentlessly continue to focus on product and remove every pain point that shows up, we now have the type of tool that we wanted. Now we are going to build some truly wonderful data resources."],"time":["2020-09-08 17:26:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Naac"],"id":[24412863],"kids":[24413093,24417884],"parent":[24409334],"text":["Are you using a self-signed cert?<p>I&#x27;m getting a &quot;Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead&quot; from Firefox."],"time":["2020-09-08 22:25:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["burlesona"],"id":[22935470],"kids":[22936782,22935638,22936370,22936280,22938227,22940368,22943542,22937860,22938232,22948889,22935741,22935700],"parent":[22934558],"text":["This is an interesting commentary on Andreesen’s piece, but it doesn’t really change or contradict anything.<p>At the end of the day, the US is a litigious society covered in Byzantine regulation that most people aren’t even aware of.

Modern C++ typically suffers from only the last point raised - exceptions during destruction, but that goes against the all good C++ practices.<p>Overall, the author&#x27;s approach to exception use is flawed. It&#x27;s bad form to use exceptions for code flow purposes, as per their example. If you throw an exception in the same block that catches the exception, you&#x27;ve wasted a whole lot of time doing something an IF-statement could solve trivially.<p>All projects that I have worked on that use C++ has declared that exceptions should be used in exceptional circumstances only - that is, when you cannot handle the error in the current code block and the function interface does not support returning enough information to the caller to detail what went wrong. An exception is more than just throwing your hands in the air and saying &quot;I can&#x27;t do that&quot; - it has context, purpose, history. Getting rid of exceptions breaks some of the fundamental design concepts of the language.<p>2-step initialisation is the only way around errors during construction whilst forbidding exceptions. But 2-step init breaks a fundamental rule of RAII - the constructor acquires the resource and establishes all class invariants or throws an exception if that cannot be done. If the constructor is not allowed to throw exceptions, as per the language&#x27;s standardised interface for constructors, then my library or application needs to be modified to support whatever process a third party library has defined as appropriate. There is a wide surface for bugs to creep in, let alone costing me time, money and effort in supporting whatever interface they&#x27;ve come up with.<p>If an object has been constructed, it should be in a valid state unless an exception has been thrown, in which case I&#x27;m told what went wrong. If I can fix it before the stack is fully unwound, I can save the day. but if there&#x27;s nothing I can do, the exception has to roll to the top as that&#x27;s the only other option. That then begs the question; should I catch all exceptions at the top level and prevent crashing, or should I crash and allow whatever system I&#x27;m running under to restart me? That depends on the project, but typically I&#x27;d let it go. systemd should bring me back, docker should restart me, kubernetes should restart my pod, etc etc. If I focus on what is within my control, and delegate everything else, the system will be cleaner and much more maintainable.<p>I&#x27;ve never come across a situation where exceptions during destruction is a problem, but am very interested in any examples. C++ standards define that you _can_ throw exceptions, but you shouldn&#x27;t for the exact reason raised in the article - the process will be terminated as there&#x27;s nothing else that can be done. If there aren&#x27;t any destructors containing the throw keyword, it&#x27;s not likely to throw an exception - OOM or other system exceptions are still possible, but why are you allocating memory in a destructor? destructors just need to release resources and clear down the object, it shouldn&#x27;t be requesting more resources.

It&#x27;s really good, the team behind it is great, and I strongly recommended it out of all the major routing systems. We tried them all, graphhopper is the most extensible, fastest, and best managed project. Graphhopper takes OSM data and computes a routeable graph based off one or more routing profiles you specify. There are default profiles, but we have spent a considerable amount of time making our own custom routing and weighting profiles to give the best directions for cyclists, and are in the process of extending it further so that it takes into account our database of about 50mm recorded bike rides by our users. The result is that our cycling directions are pretty dang good at this point. We hope to deploy the new popularity based routing stuff in the coming weeks.<p>We have both a web and mobile route planner that are worth checking out. The mobile route planner is a paid feature, but allows free demos without saving.

It&#x27;s hard to read, but this seems very intentional. There are a number of salient points that are very specifically not stated. Some questions deliberately not answered:<p>Who was on the Working Group, other than Patrick? Dr. Tyler Cowen spread the results, but no one is mentioned as working in the group other than Patrick. This seems designed to limit potential social fallout to other parties. The whole &quot;Someone read between the lines&quot; section would be much easier to read with the relevant person named. Also consider that Patrick may be limiting fallout to himself here, with the bold statement early on that &quot;I instigated the Working Group and I was the primary author of its white paper.&quot;<p>Did the NYT article writer correspond with the Working Group? The white paper was published with plenty of time before the article was written, and the explicit goal of the Working Group was to &quot;leverage a news organization.&quot; Also consider that the NYT article was published on Thursday. And when discussing the goals of the working group, &quot;This implied a publication deadline of Thursday. We assumed media organizations would need our work by Wednesday to check it and produce reporting informed by it.&quot; Note that Dr. Cowen&#x27;s quick post was also published on Thursday, possibly to increase deniability when referring to that goal date.<p>What Japanese organizations failed to respond to this crisis? The most damning prose in the entire article is &quot;May all judgments be just and merciful.&quot; Patrick does not identify any Japanese organization or government by name, but says that the Working Group spoke to many of them. Also, both memos are listed in the timeline immediately before a announcement by Governor Koike. Patrick even convolutes his prose to the point where he never mentions the Olympics. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he had another sporting event in mind that also matched the specifics of what he wrote.<p>How much influence did the Working Group have in Japan&#x27;s response? The NYT article is definitely one potential point of influence, but it seems that the memo itself was shared widely. Consider the difference between this humble ending to the article: &quot;I am a responsible professional. I have no relevant expertise or authority. I have avoided unproductive criticism. I might have made some guesses, during a year when many people were guessing on many topics. I quietly told some people about them. Some guesses may, perhaps by happenstance, align with official guidance and credible published reporting.&quot; and his tweet confirming the memo (option 1): &quot;I am materially wrong about the most consequential thing I&#x27;ve had to have a view on in 15 years. You should probably degrade your estimate of my ability to think through complex problems.&quot;<p>Interpreting things through an aggressive lens, I read this as a scathing diatribe against the Japanese government, where a non-expert foreigner living in Japan has to get the Western media involved before the government would admit to there being a problem. Props to the governor of Tokyo for being more on top of this than anyone else (perhaps with the Working Group&#x27;s involvement), but the national government completely dragged its feet until it was forced by international pressure to start asking real questions.<p>But I&#x27;m probably reading too much into it.

Pricing is followers multiplied by engagement. You&#x27;ll figure it out. 3% higher engagement is much better than higher followers. But you can get in the door with partners with higher followers.<p>You break even on the account by doing paid features for like a month.<p>The rebrand will cause a bunch of followers to leave, so THATS when you use bots like instagress to get the attention of other real humans to offset the decline. <i>you are never actually growing the account<\/i>, teenagers in Albania and India are growing the accounts. Don&#x27;t fall for the time wasting ideas, unless your time isn&#x27;t valuable. You buy their already grown accounts.<p>Use those accounts to hack hashtags for several years. I&#x27;m not sure thats a term but here is how you do it: you take the account private, and thats when YOU pay for promotions on other people&#x27;s accounts to drive real humans to your account.<p>When your account is private, instagram queues up follower requests 100 at a time, and when you switch back to public only 100 followers or so are added at once I think. There is some limit. The point is that you always maintain a currency of new followers that you can accept in bulk at any time.<p>So THEN when you post a picture with almost any hashtag (based on popularity of that tag), you can accept a TON of followers that you&#x27;ve been queuing for an indefinite time period - also amplified by paid promotion again - and everyone likes&#x2F;engages with it quickly, pushing it to the TOP section of a popular hashtag.<p>Rinse, repeat.<p>Regarding promotions again, you also want to be in a liking ring in Instagram DMs with other popular accounts. You post your picture in those rings and they like your photo, and vice versa. I&#x27;m not sure how much this works since the friend&#x27;s activity feed is gone, but it can still move your photo up on other people&#x27;s normal feeds if you share followers.<p>Its a decent place to START your funnel these days."],"time":["2020-04-21 15:42:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mkohlmyr"],"id":[22933691],"kids":{},"parent":[22933182],"text":[" &gt; I feel absolutely shit when I am trying to be relevant<p>Sounds like you should stop.

Then it will be taste, the tall mother, class, sisterly love ect. The cycles of what the nature in people want can be tracked over days, months, years, decades, centuries, ect. People have been doing this stuff for millennia.<p>Hate, jealousy, ect are signals that something of value exists and is worth hating. Getting your product hated for silly reasons is a great boost, sell to both the haters and lovers. People won&#x27;t tolerate inaccessible and distant rich or classy figures at the moment, all the cash and attention is in relatability.

My advice to you would be to not worry about any specialization as you can change it later on. Focus on taking courses that interest you. You need to complete 10 courses for completing the program.

FWIW, my undergrad was in a different engineering field. So I really enjoyed the Network Security and Intro to Operating Systems.

It&#x27;s been very valuable for me. However, I think I&#x27;m like most of the students: coming from a math, engineering, or science background, transitioning into a more software development-oriented career. The value of the OMSCS degree is very clear for us: the degree as a qualification, and exposure to knowledge&#x2F;skills we don&#x27;t already have.I&#x27;m not sure if it would be as valuable for someone who already has some sort of computer science&#x2F;systems background. I&#x27;m not really sure what a computer systems engineering degree entails so I may be way off here.<p>Some other thoughts:<p>The time investment and effort to do the courses is serious. Not only are the courses very time-consuming (10 - 30 hours per week), but you&#x27;re also expected to do research and study up on material on your own in certain classes. You can&#x27;t just be a passive consumer of the material. It can be very rewarding and&#x2F;or very painful depending on what you&#x27;re getting out of the course.<p>Your choices are constrained by class capacity. It is very difficult to get into the more popular courses (i.e the ML ones in particular) and so be prepared to take non-ML courses until you have enough seniority to get better registration preference. Don&#x27;t even bother trying to plan out your courses in advance, a lot of it will just be determined by when you are permitted to register for classes! To be fair, based on recent emails from GT, it seems like they&#x27;re aware of this problem and looking to open up other classes (possibly taking advantage of more courses going online during the pandemic). They also seem to be opening up courses that were formerly restricted to the OMSA degree (the more math-heavy analytics equivalent) which I&#x27;m really excited about."],"time":["2020-04-21 19:17:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cameronfraser"],"id":[22937914],"kids":[22938475],"parent":[22931570],"text":["UT Austin&#x27;s program is also worth considering.

The upside of delighting some users with natural language understanding doesn&#x27;t yet justify the downside of making the experience worse for everyone else.<p>2) Most users today don&#x27;t use natural language search queries. That is surely a chicken-and-egg problem: perhaps users would love to use natural language search if it worked as well or better than keyword search. But that&#x27;s where we are today. So, until there&#x27;s a breakthrough, most search engine developers see more incremental gain from optimizing some form of keyword search than from trying to support natural language search.<p>3) Even if the search engine understands the search query perfectly, it still has to match that interpretation against the documentation representation. In general, it&#x27;s a lot easier to understand a query like &quot;shirt with stripes&quot; than to reliably know which of the shirts in the catalog do or don&#x27;t have stripes. No one has perfectly clean, complete, or consistent data. We need not just query understanding, but item understanding too.<p>4) Negation is especially hard. A search index tends to focus on including accurate content rather than exhaustive content. That makes it impossible to distinguish negation from not knowing. It&#x27;s the classic problem of absence of evidence is not being evidence of absence. This is also a problem for keyword and boolean search -- negating a word generally won&#x27;t negate synonyms or other variations of that word.<p>5) The people maintaining search indexes and searchers co-evolve to address -- or at least work around -- many of these issues. For example, most shoppers don&#x27;t search for a &quot;dress without sleeves&quot;; they search for a &quot;sleeveless dress&quot;. Everyone is motivated to drive towards a shared vocabulary, and that at least addresses the common cases.<p>None of this is to say that we shouldn&#x27;t be striving to improve the way people and search engines communicate. But I&#x27;m not convinced that an example like this one sheds much light on the problem.<p>If you&#x27;re curious to learn more about query understanding, I suggest you check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;queryunderstanding.com&#x2F;introduction-c98740502103\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;queryunderstanding.com&#x2F;introduction-c98740502103<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-20 21:22:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bryanrasmussen"],"id":[22925983],"kids":{},"parent":[22925087],"text":["I think, looking at shirt without stripes and shirt with out stripes in Google images, that without is decompounded, which then ends up giving you shirt with stripes, however the slight difference between the two searches &quot;shirt without stripes&quot; and &quot;shirt with out stripes&quot; is that the there are some exact hits mixed in also, so there are some results for &quot;shirt without stripes&quot; mixed in with the decompounded query.<p>Just my theory."],"time":["2020-04-20 19:18:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jpswade"],"id":[22933231],"kids":{},"parent":[22925087],"text":["Google search doesn’t work that way, it’s still based on how we link to things.<p>Nobody would describe a plain shirt as a shirt without stripes unless it’s within that context."],"time":["2020-04-21 11:01:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["holdenc137"],"id":[22925456],"kids":[22925517],"parent":[22925087],"text":["Wake me up when I can google\n   &quot;anything but crocodiles&quot;"],"time":["2020-04-20 18:29:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rubatuga"],"id":[22927112],"kids":{},"parent":[22925087],"text":["Also, what really angers me is when websites don&#x27;t support the minus operator for search queries.

That has opened up an unprecedented discount of more than $10 between the two nearest contracts.<p>This situation—in which the price of the June contract is far above that of the May one—apparently delights in the name “super contango.” People put a price on oil—they think it has value and want to own it at that value—but they also put a price on not having it now, and the latter price is quite high relative to the former. Conceivably, in theory, the latter price (what you’d pay to not have oil now) could exceed the former (what you’d pay to have oil eventually), leading to negative spot prices. We’re getting there:<p>There are signs of weakness everywhere. Buyers in Texas are offering as little as $2 a barrel for some oil streams, raising the possibility that producers may soon have to pay to have crude taken off their hands.<p>In ordinary economics, things do not have negative prices: If nobody wants a thing, if you’d have to pay them to take the thing, you just don’t make it. Oil is a little weird—it is hard to shut in and then restart an oil well, and there are all sorts of weird cartels and game theory involved in oil pricing and production—but the other thing going on here is that a global pandemic is pretty weird for commodity prices. The price of oil is not approaching zero because nobody needs oil; you can look into the future—or at futures prices—and see that, in fact, there is demand for oil.

The Athlon 64 tech was downscaled for mobile uses fine, but AMD did not have a good answer to Intel&#x27;s broad Centrino platform for mobile technologies. Moreover, Intel was quick to introduce the Pentium M on the mobile market, which was a much better and competitive product than the Pentium 4 (and the direct predecessor of the &quot;Core&quot; branded processors that marginalized AMD again later). AMD was competitive with Intel before the Athlon 64 too, but the mobile market was more niche before the early 2000s and the differences were smaller anyway.
