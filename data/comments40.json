Many tasks which were considered too heavy for the web in the past, are implemented with web technologies now. Microsoft Excel Online and Google Sheet for spreadsheets, Figma for graphics design.<p>I have worked in large enterprises most of my career. Many enterprise&#x2F;business applications I have seen could be web-based, but were not, because they needed access to various desktop APIs. I&#x27;ll focus on three use cases here.<p>Authentication, Authorization, Audit<p>Web-browsers give no direct access to authorization, authentication and audit APIs provided by operating systems. Windows workstations are usually joined to an Active Directory domain. Permissions are managed by group membership within the domain. Hundreds, if not thousands, of groups and policies are serving usual enterprise. Restricted logon hours, whitelisted logon workstations, centralized collection of audit log. Every desktop application may call a few simple APIs to check if current user has specific privilege, is a member of some specific group, just lists all current user groups, or writes an important message to the event log. But good luck integrating this with your new fancy web-based SaaS. No single sign-on for you, no event log. If infrastructure is hybrid and the cloud part is Azure, you may have some luck with SAML and Azure Active Directory, but if not, you most likely will be asked to install on-premises version or leave immediately.<p>Printing and imaging<p>Web-browsers provide no usable printing APIs. Printing is important, whether it is cheque, report or handout. Most websites just give up on printing and export PDFs. This experience is terrible, starting with color support and ending with A4&#x2F;Letter confusion. If printing is an essential part of your application’s workflow, like for a cash desk, web technologies are simply unusable. Google Cloud Print is discontinued, so the situation will become even worse. Scanning with preview? I don&#x27;t even know where to start. It&#x27;s simply impossible.<p>Industrial devices<p>There are a lot of industrial hardware devices. None of them can be accessed from the browser, if not explicitly supported, like FIDO tokens. Most can be accessed via text-based protocols over serial ports. They are begging to be wrapped into web-sockets.<p>Why is it so bad?<p>There are two answers I know:\nFirst answer is “other priorities”. Web technologies are mostly for landing pages, not for business applications, so a new CSS selector is more welcome than industrial devices.\nSecond answer is “security”. It is hard to introduce new features without introducing new attack vectors.<p>The Proposed Solution<p>Create a universal windows service application which will provide a highly secure, easy to use REST interface. Allow JavaScript applications to fully integrate into desktop environments.\nSecurity is paramount. Permissions, which website has access to what APIs, should be opt-in only, clear, managed by Administrators only and optionally by global Active Directory policies. Everything is double checked, secured, isolated and sandboxed if possible."],"time":["2020-05-15 15:24:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MertsA"],"id":[23188243],"kids":{},"parent":[23170881],"text":["I&#x27;ve been hiking in the government reservation around my town. I live near Eglin AFB which has almost half a million acres of land and about a quarter of a million acres are open to the public with a permit. There&#x27;s easily over a thousand miles of trails going through the woods and the vast majority of them aren&#x27;t on any official maps. I&#x27;m cobbling together a u-blox EVK-7P GPS receiver with a USB-C hub and battery bank that supports USB-PD passthrough to a phone hooked up to the hub to log the raw GPS observations from the u-blox receiver as well as log the sensor data from the accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometers in the phone. After a hike the idea is to post process those observations using a nearby Florida Department of Transportation reference station as a base station in order to get accurate positioning after the fact. (should be on the order of centimeters) The u-blox receiver also supports measuring the doppler shift to each satellite as well which should give me not only position but direct velocity measurements as well. Combined with the accelerometers and gyros in the phone I should be able to use Google Pose Optimizer (If anyone knows of a more up to date sensor fusion library please reach out to me) to combine the results into a fine grained and highly accurate track of each trail and publish some of the trails online as KML or GPX. The part that&#x27;s pretty up in the air is taking the raw track and combining points of interest with the track and combining overlapping paths where I doubled back on a trail. My basic plan is first take all of the raw positions and times and construct a continuous non-branching path that accurately shows the actual path I took and then iterate through it from start to finish constructing a new path and check to see if the point I&#x27;m sampling from the raw path is already nearby an existing point on the new path and if so, skip it and start a new branch when the path diverges.<p>The other side project keeping me busy has been setting up my desktop as a multiseat computer both at my desk and on the living room TV for my son to play some emulators, Minecraft, PBS Kids games, etc. As luck would have it, the length between the back of my PC and the HDMI input on my TV through the cable management arm, wall, closet, baseboards is juuust short enough that a 25ft regular passive HDMI cable will reach. I&#x27;ve got a Monoprice two port active USB extender hooked up as well going to a webcam mounted on top of the TV and a Bluetooth dongle that&#x27;s mounted just barely peeking out from below. For a controller I picked up a bluetooth Xbox One controller and I&#x27;m using xpadneo as the driver for it on Arch Linux. That plus a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse are the only HIDs out in the livingroom and the keyboard and controller are rechargeable. It&#x27;s better than any console and wound up being cheaper as well and it&#x27;s expandable for e.g. one of our latest favorites of playing Hans Zimmer&#x27;s &quot;No Time For Caution&quot; while playing SpaceX&#x27;s ISS docking simulator with the goal of docking before the song ends.<p>That last side project has also expanded into some Minecraft modding working on porting an old mod that adds Joypad support to the PC version to more modern versions of Minecraft. Right now he&#x27;s still pretty unfamiliar with using a keyboard and mouse so controller support is a must which really limits the mods available because that basically pins me to Minecraft 1.12."],"time":["2020-05-15 04:34:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mvkel"],"id":[23187918],"kids":{},"parent":[23170881],"text":["Origami."],"time":["2020-05-15 03:42:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["npsimons"],"id":[23187156],"kids":{},"parent":[23170881],"text":["I have been all over the place, never able to focus much.

Being here where I don&#x27;t have IT rules that are cumbersome at best, I can easily just install a software package to try it out. I&#x27;ve been a bit stultified by the job for many years now, and am only just catching up on learning new tools, mostly by doing a crash course in setting them up and using them. To date, I&#x27;ve<p>- Setup my own personal webconferencing server (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bigbluebutton.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bigbluebutton.org&#x2F;<\/a>). I did this on Digital Ocean, which I&#x27;d never done before, but I couldn&#x27;t provide the necessary bandwidth or hardware at home. It&#x27;s really opened my eyes to having someone else host the infrastructure, but I still get the sysadmin control I crave, plus it&#x27;s cheap and just so fast and easy to spin up new machines.<p>- I setup a phone number with SignalWire to hook it up to the webconference server as a dial in. That turned out difficult, so I quickly turned it around when it came up in my mountain rescue group that we had a need for a more customized replacement for GroupMe. I now have started working on an interactive system to manage callouts to missions.<p>- I went to setup a Gitlab server as a support tool for developing the aforementioned project (and other future projects), but it turned out to be quite resource intensive, so I learned to spawn it in Docker on my main development machine at home, along with a runner to do continuous integration.<p>- I finally got around to replacing my internal dhcp&#x2F;dns&#x2F;time&#x2F;print&#x2F;file server with something that uses an eighth of the power, produces much less heat, and is very quiet. It&#x27;s so much nicer to have a quieter office.<p>- I&#x27;ve been working on updating my old library of code templates&#x2F;snippets, including adding new programming languages. This project I also use to test out the Gitlab instance as my goal with the templates is to have things that are self-contained, but run a number of unit tests.<p>- I finally installed my smart thermostat, a HestiaPi (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hestiapi.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hestiapi.com&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>- I&#x27;m looking into RFID&#x2F;NFC for a small project with my brother. He and I are also discussing a project using UE4. Hopefully I can find a way to cheaply host the Gitlab instance, or maybe I&#x27;ll just end up paying for an account with them or Github, which I&#x27;ve also been learning how to do CI with and comparing with Gitlab.<p>- Since I&#x27;m also a member of a big band, I&#x27;ve been getting into home audio recording and mixing, using Ardour and Audacity (for click tracks).

It is free and does not require a license, nor does the enterprise installer for Adobe Reader require a license. Features I disable include the online subscription services (actually a checkbox labelled &quot;Disable Upsell&quot;), cloud storage integrations, and Adobe sign-in. I enable Protected View for documents from &quot;potentially unsafe locations&quot; (basically downloads&#x2F;emails). You can also disable automatic updates, though I tend not to. These changes make the UI far less cluttered. I suspect that these changes also improve speed, security and privacy, though I have not done any particular testing to confirm that.<p>Basically you use it by uninstalling any existing Adobe Reader installations, installing the customization wizard and then downloading the enterprise installer for Adobe Reader[2] and extracting it with 7-Zip[3] (or the commands Adobe provides in the documentation). Then, you open the msp file in the wizard and customize your options. Finally, you save the changes and run setup.exe in the directory of extracted files. Once you&#x27;re done, you can uninstall the customization wizard.<p>There is also a version of the wizard for macOS[4], but it seems to be far more limited in terms of what can be configured through the UI, and most of the configuration has to be done by manually editing plist files.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;devnet-docs&#x2F;acrobatetk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;Wizard&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;devnet-docs&#x2F;acrobatetk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;Wizard&#x2F;in...<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.adobe.com&#x2F;reader&#x2F;enterprise&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.adobe.com&#x2F;reader&#x2F;enterprise&#x2F;<\/a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.7-zip.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.7-zip.org&#x2F;<\/a>\n[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;devnet-docs&#x2F;acrobatetk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;AdminGuide_Mac&#x2F;predeployment_configuration.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;devnet-docs&#x2F;acrobatetk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;AdminGuid...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-14 22:39:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jrochkind1"],"id":[23191491],"kids":{},"parent":[23180975],"text":["&gt; Today, Adobe Acrobat Reader DC for macOS patched three critical vulnerabilities<p>If you have a mac, you might want to know what version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is necessary to have the patches.<p>The OP doesn&#x27;t appear to say?

A bit of history. Several years ago, as part of an internal project, we tried to create a data analysis service that meets the following minimum requirements: - as simple as possible integration with an existing java application - support for persistent data storage - indices support\n- support for a distributed database and distributed operations, such as the ability to insert or modify data in a database from any of the available nodes<p>- the easiest cluster deployment<p>- transaction support<p>- basic SQL support with complex event processing and stream SQL support<p>One of the outcomes of this development was an open source product branch called interference. What can this service do?<p>Easy integration with java application. You include the library and then simply manage all the interference functions from within the java application using session methods, JPA annotations, queries and direct access to table objects. Interference is a distributed service. This means that this service can be used within a distributed cluster, or you can build a distributed event-driven application based solely on this service, without any additional services like coordinators and so on.<p>Now, we suggest you use interference as a distributed platform when developing data analysis applications.<p>Interference is not an RDBMS in the usual sense. You do not use JDBC or anything like that to access the data. Instead, direct object-relational mapping is used that works directly with persistent storage and remote event transport mechanisms.<p>Minimal common insert performance on standard i7&#x2F;4core workstation is up to 10000recs&#x2F;sec on indexed table with UC constraint check and up to 50000recs&#x2F;sec on plain table w&#x2F;o any checks.<p>In the next time, we plan to publish an article with a detailed review of the service architecture and performance metrics.<p>Now, read the documentation for a detailed understanding.
