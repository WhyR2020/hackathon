These masks differ by the type and size of infectious particles they are able to filter. Face masks are used more commonly for respiratory viruses that spread via droplets, which travel short distances and are transmitted by cough or sneeze. Face masks often fit loosely, and prevent the wearer from spreading large sprays and droplets, as well as preventing hand-to-face contact. N95 respirators block 95% of airborne particles. They are tight fitting and prevent inhalation of smaller infectious particles that can spread through the air over long distances after an infected person coughs or sneezes<\/i><p>The difference right now is that everyone <i>might<\/i> be carrying a lethal pathogen that we have no treatments for."],"time":["2020-03-31 02:04:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jandrese"],"id":[22733444],"kids":[22733594,22733551,22733514,22733467,22733564,22733480,22733647,22733468,22733572,22733639],"parent":[22733249],"text":["At the same time you shouldn&#x27;t be wearing one because they&#x27;re a scarce resource and doctors&#x2F;nurses&#x2F;first responders need them more.<p>To be fair the article does suggest making your own and then helpfully links to this [1] dead website.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consumer.org.hk&#x2F;ws_en&#x2F;news&#x2F;specials&#x2F;2020&#x2F;mask-diy-tips.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consumer.org.hk&#x2F;ws_en&#x2F;news&#x2F;specials&#x2F;2020&#x2F;mask-di...<\/a><p>Edit: fixed a typo"],"time":["2020-03-31 01:52:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacquesm"],"id":[22733515],"kids":[22733573],"parent":[22733249],"text":["A friend of mine is setting up a manufacturing line for masks here in NL.

They aren&#x27;t rebutting this implicit notion that any mortality risk below 1% can be rounded down to zero. As a consequence, the idea that it might be a good idea to let younger, healthy people just go out and get the virus and get immune seems to still have currency, and this is really dangerous. We can&#x27;t open things back up until we have a credible plan for driving the infection rate toward zero. Leaving aside the risk of life-changing injury, a mortality risk of eg 0.5% applied to eg half of young adults would still be by far the most dangerous thing that happens to most of them this year, and a huge personal tragedy for many of us.

Just gonna cover the highlights:<p>&gt; My company devguard was - by numbers of deployments - the largest user of rust before we stopped using rust entirely.<p>I don&#x27;t actually believe this is true. The link at the end has a slide that says &quot;We shipped a quarter million devices with rust.&quot; This is certainly a big deployment, but if we just consider Firefox, Mozilla reports ~800,000 YAU, and about 250,000 MAU. I don&#x27;t think this is a problem; I want people to have a good time with Rust, regardless of how big they are. But when summed up with all the other stuff, well... I only even mention this because it frames this article as &quot;Rust&#x27;s largest user is leaving.&quot;<p>&gt; If you target anything else, you’ll be fighting upstream<p>There is no fight here. These architectures require help to support. This is how open source generally works. If the author wanted to pitch in, we would have loved the help.<p>We&#x27;ll get back to this later.<p>&gt; If you have no responsibility, you can prioritize fun over results<p>We take our responsibilities very seriously. If Rust were about fun, we wouldn&#x27;t put so much work into stability, or performance, or anything else. This section reads mostly like an insult, so I&#x27;m not really going to get into the rest.<p>&gt; The recent ecosystem break with async has put the nail in the coffin for us, because again they put the burden of actually making their poor design work on the community, again hiding the true runtime cost (TLS) away from the user while ignoring any prior work on the topic.<p>This has been a persistent issue with the author. He wrote his own coroutine + async io system. In the release announcement, (and on twitter) he made a number of factually incorrect statements about Rust and async&#x2F;await. The largest of which that you could not use it on embedded, when that was a hard constraint on the design in the first place. TLS is not a true runtime cost, as I mentioned in a thread yesterday, async&#x2F;await no longer uses TLS. This was always the plan; the initial implementation was shipped using TLS so that folks who didn&#x27;t mind could get started using it. The author links to a blog post by Ferrous systems (another company using and selling a lot of Rust in the embedded space, incidentally) about how this was accomplished. It seems like this is saying that we forced other people to fix some sort of mistake. This is not the case; like any open source project, there was some work to be done, and someone did it. (I am not sure if this work was sponsored by Ferrous or not, I think it was.) I think this sort of ties back into the earlier bit about architectures; Rust is not a company, nor a foundation.

All this means is that all ingredients are measured in relation to the total amount of flour being used. If you’re using 100g of flour, then at 75% hydration you add 75g of water. Note that to be super precise when you get more experienced, you want to include the amount of flour and water in the starter used in the loaf, but when getting started it doesn’t matter.<p>Use bread flour specifically. All purpose flour doesn’t seem to have what the yeast and lactobacilli need. It can grow, but the resulting starter is weak and prone to getting mold infections easier.<p>For a period of a week, each day mix an equal amount of flour and water by weight. I always use 100g of water and 100g of flour. This is considered 50% hydration.<p>On each day, throw out 90% of the mixture from the previous day. You aren’t wasting anything. The flour from the day before has been eaten up.<p>Weigh the remaining starter (20g in this example). Then weigh out 90g of water and 90g of flour. Mix all of these together.<p>One thing I’m trying to get across is maintaining a consistent total weight, 200g in this example.<p>After 5-7 days of repeating this process, you will have a healthy starter culture where the predominant microorganism culture is wild yeast and lactobacilli. These two work together symbiotically. The yeast eat the flour and excrete things the lactobacilli eat. In return, the LB excrete lactic acid which gives the bread the sour taste and works to suppress other bacteria and molds from growing.<p>Use and maintenance:<p>Once you have a healthy starter, you change the ratio of water to flour when feeding it.<p>When baking, you generally want a starter that is 75-80% hydration vs the 50% used during initially growing it. All this means is that after baking for the day or if you’re just feeding the starter daily to maintain it, you take the 10% of yesterday’s starter and add it to a mix of 100g of flour and 75g of water.<p>I always bake my sourdough at 75% hydration and maintain the starter at the same ratio. It makes the math easier and the bread comes out fine.<p>After a lot of experimentation I eventually locked in a recipe that has my specific amounts, so I don’t have to do the math every time.<p>If anyone wants my bread recipe, leave a comment here and I’ll add it later.

Follow their example. Don&#x27;t use your kitchen table as a workbench. Don&#x27;t eat and drink in your work area. Don&#x27;t lick solder. etc. etc.<p>If your living arrangement is so small that you can&#x27;t separate them adequately, seek out a local hacker space or a friend who does have space.<p>2) Wash your hands thoroughly after soldering (and if you are doing projects with your kids, instill in them the instinct to wash their hands, too!) If I&#x27;m finding myself doing a lot of soldering&#x2F;desoldering for a repair, I take frequent breaks and wash then, too. It also helps reduce mistakes.<p>3) At a minimum, use a desk fan to blow fumes away from your face. Better yet, invest in a fume extractor unit. I&#x27;d say the latter it&#x27;s a necessity if you do a lot of soldering.<p>The bottom line is, choose what you prefer and what you are willing to risk using, and take appropriate precautions.

I knew it was my job to lead my team to get something done but between telling them to get something done, and it being done, how could I know that they were working on it? It drove me nuts for a while so I asked a friend who had been a manager for while what they did and the answer surprised me in its simplicity, it was &quot;How much time do you give people to do something, and did they do it?&quot;<p>The secret was having something that was unambiguously measurable as &quot;done&quot; and establishing that expectation at the beginning. These days I&#x27;ll say to the team &quot;When we are done, these things will be true ...&quot; and list off the set of things we can say are true to indicate completion. I&#x27;ll also note them in my notebook so that I can track them over time.<p>The whole team knows what the exit criteria are so everyone knows if we&#x27;re done or not. Once you get to know your team better you can add incentive things, so that conversation would sound more like, &quot;The minimum we have to do to insure this is done are x, y, and z. If we can also do p, q, or r it will have this additional positive effect.&quot;<p>It also means I can go to a team member at a 1:1 and say, &quot;Ok, I&#x27;d like you to take x, what needs to be true for you to be able to say that x is true?&quot; Which encourages them to break up the problem into smaller bits.<p>If you have weekly 1:1s with people then you can check in on the status of their smaller bits, toward making the larger bits true. You always know who is doing work and who is under performing or needs help.<p>For more service type teams (like IT or SRE) you measure things like &quot;our backlog has not grown over the last 30 days&quot; or &quot;the median time to resolve tickets is less than 24 hrs&quot; etc. The key is you can measure it, and the measurement is not subjective.<p>Managers who need &quot;spyware&quot; to figure out if there folks are working or not need to be replaced with managers who know how to manage."],"time":["2020-03-30 19:41:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["redm"],"id":[22729933],"kids":{},"parent":[22728971],"text":["Upwork has a system to automatically capture screenshots while a user is on the &quot;clock&quot;.

US Army is not allowed to monitor user activity in that way and all users of Army networks are made aware of this.  Users must also sign their agreement to an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) before gaining access to the network.  The Army example is more extreme because the Army owns the computers, the network, and all physical network infrastructure that companies typically lease to ISPs.  The Army has the ability to monitor user activity in ways that companies cannot and yet the Army does not do so because it&#x27;s illegal without a probable cause search warrant or command directive with legal authorization.<p>For example, computers with an Army image monitor for attachment of mass storage devices and moment a phone or hard drive is plugged in the network administrator is immediately notified, the local network switch is automatically dropped from the network, and a report is automatically drafted for the respective violating unit.  The Army can monitor for that because it is a violation of the AUP users signed, but they cannot monitor any associated content without probably cause and an AUP violation on its own is not probable cause.<p>I have heard, on the other hand, the Air Force monitors absolutely everything because they require their users to sign a consent to monitoring directive to gain access to the network."],"time":["2020-03-30 18:40:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cookie_monsta"],"id":[22731120],"kids":{},"parent":[22728971],"text":["I would like to see a study of the productivity drain of having to have someone interpret all this extra data.

The only reasons for a government to bail out a company are 1) to protect the supply chain of a necessary good or service, 2) as a way of providing a safety net for people that doesn&#x27;t involve direct payment, 3) a way of maintaining the structure of the economy so it can resume normal operation more quickly after the shock, or 4) a way of giving a handout to a set of wealthy and connected members of society. I think most of us can agree that 1-3 are necessary response to a major disruption and 4 is corruption.<p>For a small business like a dog groomer or a restaurant, we expect the fraction that aren&#x27;t viable to go out of business with some probability during small economic shocks, and we expect that this will be a small fraction. So we let them go. But in a crisis where an entire sector will be mostly wiped out, such as restaurants in the current pandemic, some attempt at preserving the sector makes sense because otherwise you send shocks through everything connected with it. For example, if a restaurant occupies the bottom floor of an apartment building, and the building&#x27;s cashflow depends on that space not being unoccupied for more than two months, then you can have a sequence of events that result in mass evictions unless you control those side effects as well. It&#x27;s probably easier to try to maintain the web of cashflow.<p>Now, you may be able to get side effects that you like in some sectors, such as restaurants turning into food kitchens for the duration as part of the direct injection of cash. On the other hand, a bar or a salon probably just shuts down. But even there, most stylists rent a chair in a salon, so you need to make sure that web of cashflow isn&#x27;t broken by an owner pocketing it. It still gets very complicated. For some areas like farms we already have large measures in place, since bad seasons tend to affect large swathes of farms. Thus reserve boards, farm subsidies and the like.<p>Others have pointed out that such structural maintenance can be gamed by having a barely-viable company that is too big to fail. Then even small shocks can be turned into structural crises. Someone else suggested requiring capital reserves the way we do for banks, and for large companies that makes sense. If you&#x27;re that big and structurally risky, you should be required to derisk yourself.<p>One discussion I hope we will be having as a society during and after this is what disaster preparedness looks like. We should have the regulations for what putting the economy on such a footing looks like, run simulations every few years for a week, and have adversarial gaming on an ongoing basis to try to find loopholes and close them."],"time":["2020-03-30 17:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yalogin"],"id":[22727411],"kids":{},"parent":[22725905],"text":["Wonder how hhat the conditions for the bailout money in the US is.

In almost no other country are jobs being destroyed so fast. Why? Because throughout the world, governments are protecting employment. Workers keep their jobs, even in industries that are shut down. The government covers most of their wage through direct payments to employers. Wages are, in effect, socialized for the duration of the crisis.<p>Instead of safeguarding employment, America is relying on beefed-up unemployment benefits to shield laid-off workers from economic hardship. To give just one example, in both the United States and Britain, the government is asking restaurant workers to stay home. But in Britain, workers are receiving 80 percent of their pay (up to £2,500 a month, or $3,125) and are guaranteed to get their job back once the shutdown is over. In America, the workers are laid off; they must then file for unemployment insurance and wait for the economy to start up again before they can apply for a new job, and if all goes well, sign a new contract and resume working.<\/i><p>And: <i>There is nothing efficient in the destruction of businesses that were viable before the virus outbreak. The crisis cannot be blamed on poorly managed corporations. Government support, in the case of a pandemic, does not create perverse incentives. Bankruptcies redistribute income, but in a chaotic and opaque way. And while bankruptcy might be a way to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic for large corporations, it is not well adapted to small businesses. Without strong enough government support, many small businesses will have to liquidate. The death of a business has long-term costs: The links between entrepreneurs, workers and customers are destroyed and often need to be rebuilt from scratch.<\/i><p>Instead, tax corporations for excess profits later:<p><i>Windfall profits have a fair, comprehensive and transparent solution: The government should impose excess profits taxes, as it has done several times in the past during periods of crisis. In 1918, all profits made by corporations above and beyond an 8 percent rate of return on their capital were deemed abnormal, and abnormal profits were taxed at progressive rates of up to 80 percent. Similar taxes on excessive profits were applied during World War II and the Korean War. These taxes all had one goal — making sure that no one could benefit outrageously from a situation in which the masses suffered.<\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;coronavirus-economy-saez-zucman.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;coronavirus-econo...<\/a><p>However, I&#x27;m not sure what would prevent the Hollywood accounting trick in that scenario."],"time":["2020-03-30 17:25:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cs702"],"id":[22728290],"kids":{},"parent":[22728142],"text":["The income from the ACM&#x2F;IEEE&#x27;s investment portfolio is large enough that it could fund <i>all<\/i> of arXiv.org&#x27;s annual expenses ~20 times over, in perpetuity, without dipping into capital.

However, there are a lot of caveats I have become aware of. \nIn short: ventilators for use in intensive care need to be safe and adjustable. Oh, and it is not clear whether ventilators actually change the outcome.<p>Lungs of COVID-19 patients are often damaged, and ventilation causes additional damage. As the patients&#x27; alveoli no longer capture enough O2, you need to increase air pressure to force more O2 into them. More pressure = more damage to alveoli, so you need to be very careful. So you need to be able to adjust the pressure curve very finely. None of the BVM solutions I have seen so far has such a feature. COVID-19 already causes severe lung damage in some people - you don&#x27;t want to damage them even more due to wrong ventilation.<p>Unlike emergency care (where BVMs are usually used), intensive care of COVID19 patients needs to play the long game. AFAIK, patients need constant care, supervision and medication over a period of 10+ days. Any damage you cause to the lungs early on will make it harder later on.<p>But won&#x27;t it be better to keep people alive with a simple ventilator even if they will suffer lung damage? Maybe not. I am aware of the gut-wrenching situation doctors face in Italy and elsewhere - deciding whom to connect to the few available ventilators. It seems (I&#x27;m not really sure about it yet) that ventilators just delay inevitable death by a few days in most cases. A study from Wuhan notes: <i>“32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died.”<\/i> [1]<p><i>&quot;Not everyone is a good fit for ICU. Even outside of COVID, if you are of a certain frailty and you have certain underlying conditions, your chances of making it off a ventilator when you are deathly sick is close to 0%.&quot;<\/i> [2]<p>So the question is indeed whether one should really extend a patient&#x27;s suffering for a few days or whether one should instead focus on making their last few days as comfortable as possible, and give them the chance to stay conscious and say goodbye to family.<p>Even if there is a subset of patients who might benefit from a BVM-based ventilator (and I am not sure about this), I would be very hesitant to rely on them. If a motor burns out, a tube gets loose, or a microcontroller goes crazy, the patient might choke, panic, even die. None of the DIY ventilators has gone through rigorous testing yet. None of the ones I have seen has backup mechanisms (spare motor, continuous surveillance of all parameters, fail-safe power supplies, etc.) I would not want to inflict them on dying patients - or caregivers.<p>This leads me to the most important point: the most severe bottleneck are qualified professionals. Should we really hand these people some DIY Arduino-based ventilators that might fail any moment, that lack important features, and that need additional training? A ventilator that malfunctions at the wrong time (or does not reliably function at all) will take away time and attention from exactly those people whom we really don&#x27;t want to get distracted or burnt out.<p>There is a UK government guidance which gives a good overview of essential requirements for ventilators [3]. It states:<p><i>&quot;A ventilator with lower specifications than this is likely to provide no clinical benefit and might lead to increased harm, which would be unacceptable for clinicians  and would, therefore, not gain regulatory approval.&quot;<\/i><p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m no expert on medical tech or intensive care. I have just followed a few of those projects over the past weeks and read reports of experts. It could be that I am wrong and those projects will save many lives. There could also be use cases where DIY ventilators may help (e.g. in home care). But overall, I am rather skeptical and would rather suggest focusing on stuff that might be more useful.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0140673620305663?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S014067362...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Coronavirus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fnl0n6&#x2F;im_a_critical_care_doctor_working_in_a_uk_high&#x2F;fla5579&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Coronavirus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fnl0n6&#x2F;im_a_cr...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;coronavirus-covid-19-ventilator-supply-specification&#x2F;rapidly-manufactured-ventilator-system-specification\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;coronavirus-covid...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-30 20:17:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zenit-mf-1"],"id":[22742817],"kids":{},"parent":[22729078],"text":["One idea that is keep coming to my mind.

Life runs on land, and brain runs in water, and they interact and stimulate each other along the beaches where land and water meet.<p>Actually EcoLiBra uses &quot;AntiLife&quot; (aka &quot;Death&quot;) on land, the ones-complement of life, because that makes the empty space &quot;1&quot; for AntiLife stimulate Brain, and the empty space &quot;0&quot; for brain stimulate Life, so the beach is a fertile breeding ground that never dies out, and there&#x27;s much more cross-species stimulation and humping and birthing along the shores, then the children disperse by swimming down into the deep ocean, or climbing up into the inland hills.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rudyrucker.com&#x2F;oldhomepage&#x2F;celdoc&#x2F;rules.html#EcoLiBra\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rudyrucker.com&#x2F;oldhomepage&#x2F;celdoc&#x2F;rules.html#EcoL...<\/a><p>&gt;ECOLIBRA<p>&gt;The JC EcoLiBra rule, a cross between Life and Brain.<p>&gt;This rule is a cross between Life and Brain. The basic idea is that the cells are divided between dark &quot;sea&quot; cells and light &quot;land&quot; cells. We run Brain in the sea, and on land we run not Life but AntiLife. All the land cells are normally firing cells, and the presence of an active AntiLife cell is signaled by having a land cell which is not firing. Full details on EcoLiBra are in §<p>&gt;The name EcoLiBra suggests 1) an ecology of Life and Brain, 2) a balanced situation (equilibrium), and 3) the human intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli, known as E. coli for short. The third connection is perhaps a bit unsavory, but remember that E. coli cells are in fact the favorite &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for present day genesplicing experiments. As one of the goals of CelLab is to promote the development of artificial life, the designer gene connection is entirely appropriate. I&#x27;ve given EcoLiBra a nice, symmetric start pattern, but it also does fine if you press R to randomize the screen. You can make a randomized screen a little more interesting by using the screen editor to drill a big black hole in the center. This can be done by using the following keystrokes<p>Here is an earlier somewhat simpler cellular automata rule that Rudy Rucker made when he first started playing with the CAM-6 in 1987.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rudyrucker.com&#x2F;oldhomepage&#x2F;celdoc&#x2F;rules.html#BraiLife\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rudyrucker.com&#x2F;oldhomepage&#x2F;celdoc&#x2F;rules.html#Brai...<\/a><p>&gt;BRAILIFE<p>&gt;The JC BraiLife rule after 213 generations.

So I decided a good way to start might be to try combining some of the old rules, particularly the rules Life and Brain.<p>&gt;Life is very interesting, but it tends to die out. Brain, on the other hand, is extremely hard to kill off; if anything, Brain is too persistent. So I thought I might try running Life and Brain in parallel, using Brain to stimulate Life, and using Life to dampen Brain.<p>&gt;At first I had every firing Brain cell turn on a Life cell, and had every firing Life cell turn off a Brain cell, but, run fullscreen, this reaction quickly wipes Brain out. You can see the fullscreen reaction by loading BraiLife, clearing all the screens, setting plane 4 to 1, and randomizing plane 2. The keystrokes are as follows.

We can regard this as EveryCell conducting a little election between 0 and 1 among the nine cells in its neighborhood. If either 0 or 1 wins by a clear majority of 6 votes or more out of the nine votes, then that is the state which EveryCell will take on. But if either 0 or 1 wins by a scant, sneaky majority of 5 votes out of the nine, then the election is overturned, and EveryCell takes on the color of the &quot;losing&quot; state. Vote is discussed in more detail in the Theory chapter.<p>&gt;The version of Vote shown here uses bit #1 as an &quot;echo&quot; of bit #0. This means that cells will take on different colors if they have changed state in the last generation. You can keep rerandomizing Vote by pressing R.

Is what I consider the most interesting and relevant question.<p>There is also an unchecked assumption in this article that the N95 is &quot;most important design object of our time&quot;.<p>It also fails to explain that N95 is a standard of protection rather than a certain object, it fails to explain the meaning of the standard.<p>(Which is)\nN = Not oil resistant\n95 = Removes 95% of all particles that are at least 0.3 microns in diameter<p>It merges the development paths of protective masks against particulates, which is the true purpose of N95 masks, and protective equipment for healthcare. To me, I think N95 happened to be a standard similar enough to the requirements of healthcare, so they simply adopted it. Rather than the false narrative the article paints of the N95 mask being developed FOR medicine.<p>I would have been interested to read about the additional requirements a FDA defined &quot;surgical N95&quot; must meet (additional fluid resistance), or how the N95 plays into the entire suite of relevant protective equipment in this crisis (When doctors use a normal surgical mask, N95, PAPR, face shield, or goggles).<p>edit: clickbait article that doesn&#x27;t give any information beyond what 5 minutes googling would use.<p>edit2: would have been interesting to read about how people are making face masks and other protective equipment or experiments in sanitizing and reusing one time use face masks."],"time":["2020-03-30 13:49:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["forgingahead"],"id":[22726474],"kids":[22726931,22726755,22727321,22728093,22726657,22726660],"parent":[22719488],"text":["The mask denialism in the comments is incredible to see.<p>Let&#x27;s all agree (without polemics): masks can be helpful, so we should encourage everyone to wear them, unless there is a shortage, in which case priority should be given to healthcare workers&#x2F;elderlies&#x2F;front-line staff&#x2F;etc."],"time":["2020-03-30 11:45:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fasteddie31003"],"id":[22725644],"kids":[22725795,22726072,22725775,22726074,22727235,22726754,22725789,22725777,22726945,22727786,22725987,22725922,22725673,22725787,22728372,22725885,22726109,22726381,22725921],"parent":[22719488],"text":["I am a strong believer in the universal mask protocol for controlling COVID-19.

I just want to answer my first burning question of &quot;How cool is the output?&quot;<p>2- What other tools do we get in the editor? Some basic things like a table of contents would be mandatory. Something like a slider would be nice, but then you&#x27;re becoming a bit of a Wix clone if adding a bunch of html widgets.<p>3 - Why not make it free?

Gifs on the landing page. It makes a huge difference. People don&#x27;t want to click on videos. But gifs auto-load which is great. (Legit speaking from experience and stats, we did user studies to confirm this...but it is to an extent, common knowledge in the UX world)<p>3.

As it says in the Bible story, Satan tempted the Lord to throw himself off of a building because scripture said the angels would catch him. Christ responded that it was also written in scripture that you should not tempt God. This week, to take natural precautions without denying the sacredness of the Mass, we actually filled the parking lot and celebrated Holy Mass with everyone watching from their vehicles. This way, viewers could participate in the Latin Mass with minimal risk of exposure.<p>We obviously do not enjoy this method of worship.

This is to allow those who fought against evil to attain glory, and those who fought for evil to attain humiliation.<p>Which is more humiliating for evil?
