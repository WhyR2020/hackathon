This is an technological thought experiment and an allegory for fake news and modern propaganda. I use a technological hypothetical to remove the question of if people have any agency in falling for it and the question of if it is necessary to put up with fake news as a form of free speech. With those two questions settled in the premise, we can think clearly about the core issue of the threat of effective propaganda to democracy.<p>Suppose neuroscientists and neural network researchers found an adversarial image which worked on humans. Not all humans, but at least 15% of them. The technology is developed such that by including a specially crafted banner ad image next to an article you could put an arbitrary thought in the persons mind. This opens up a very serious hack in a democracy. The technology is hard to build, but a nation state actor like China or Russia could easily replicate the technology themselves and use these banner ad images to sway elections. Like a psychological atom bomb, it is just a matter of time before every major player has it. 15% of the population is larger than the margin on nearly every election ever. A democracy which wants to survive only has two choices:<p>1. Criminalize the adversarial images and censor them from the web. Congrats. You are now in an arms race with one side making better adversarial image detectors and the other making better hidden adversarial images. In the mean time you&#x27;ve built an insanely good machine learning based censorship apparatus which sits on top of all internet traffic. Eventually the technology gets to a point where the cognitive basilisk isn&#x27;t obvious to the unaffected and people are worried that some images are being censored for their substance. The adversaries intentionally hide the patches in posts &#x2F; ads about wedge issues like guns or abortion so that taking it down looks like political censorship. While everyone agrees censoring the thought breaking images is necessary, people are rightfully scared about this apparatus being abused.<p>Maybe the cognitive basilisks are de facto censored in the sense of being de-platformed by the media (both traditional and social variants). Maybe they are state-capitalism censored in the sense of de-platforming under threat of regulation if they aren&#x27;t. Maybe we go full China with it and have a top level federal internet censor. The only real difference between these mechanisms is the technical issue of legality. For our purposes the implementation does not matter.<p>2. Don&#x27;t let people in the 15% vote. People are again rightfully scared that it could easily expand beyond 15%.  A very small, very educated, very detached from the average class of people (neuroscientists) is now trusted to decide who gets to vote. All of the 15% (and quite a few in the 85%) are suspicious of them abusing this power to forward their personal political preferences. Disenfranchising people based on inherited neurological traits is extremely contentious. The question of if it is the right thing to do becomes the defining social issue of a generation.<p>A political fissure opens up. Some people prefer option 1 because they don&#x27;t consider the adversarial patches to be &quot;speech&quot; and thus don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a free speech risk in censoring them. Some people prefer option 2 because they don&#x27;t think it is possible to win the arms race in the first case and so long as we don&#x27;t let the disenfranchisement expand beyond 15% the sin is forgivable. At the very least they think option 2 is a less slippery slope than option 1. Some people like option 1 and 2 at the same time because just do whatever it takes to fix the problem as fast as possible. The people in the 15% think the cognitive basilisks are just a made up conspiracy by the elites. Of course they think this because the cognitive basilisks told them so.<p>Then comes the disingenuous part of the fissure. Some people like option 2 but their unstated reason is because they looked at how the 15% currently votes and they think disenfranchisement will finally lead to their political party winning. Some people secretly want to keep the exploit in place because their political party happened to benefit from interference in the last election. They don&#x27;t actually have a solution but instead constantly remind you how risky and undemocratic the two options are and insist we do neither. None of the disingenuous advocates are ever moved by any arguments because their purported beliefs were always just a fig leaf over their unstated wants.<p>The debate over how to deal with this technology takes on an impassioned, repugnant, culture-war tone that we have all grown to recognize by now. What happens next I don&#x27;t know.<p>What I am proposing is that if cognitive basilisk&#x27;s exist then there is a contradiction of wants within Democracy. You must pick at most 2:<p>-Everyone gets to vote.  \n-Nothing is ever censored.  \n-The internet has no borders.<p>The only remaining question is do fake news and AstroTurfing bots count as cognitive basilisks?"],"time":["2020-05-04 04:13:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cecja"],"id":[23063337],"kids":{},"parent":[23062723],"text":["In threads like this I am usually thinking I am taking crazy pills.

Typing up their clever ideas, full of good intentions (not being sarcastic, my default presumption is you all mean well), each author implicitly assumes their superiority over the masses who are so easily duped into believing awful and dangerous mistruths based on a few headlines boosted on Twitter. The mindset, stripped of all the complications and rhetoric and real positive intent, boils down to this: &quot;These poor fools are completely lost, already in a world of hurt, and their naivety threatens all we hold dear, and so we must protect them from themselves.&quot;<p>Already in this thread, all the usual quibbles &amp; arguments for &amp; against this particular form of censorship are being studiously re-litigated. I feel strongly enough to write internet comments about very few issues and my feelings in favour of free speech fundamentalism are making it difficult to stay out of the fray. But I will restrain myself--not because it&#x27;s a bad thing to do, but just because the ROI on everyone&#x27;s time is so low, considering the tiny likelihood that all these words spilled out here will change even one mind.<p>Instead, I will ask a question that thus far has not been raised, and that I think is fundamental to this issue:<p>Q: What problems are we trying to solve here?<p>It seems that somewhere in the recent past (if I had to ballpark it, I&#x27;d say this all began to rise sometime around 8 Nov 2016) basically everyone in society came to the agreement that misinformation is running rampant, so rampant it may be the #2 item trafficked on the web, King Porn secure in his crown. Not only do we all seem to agree that misinformation is everywhere, but we all seem to also agree that this misinformation&#x27;s impact is a massive threat to our society--the camel&#x27;s legs are shaking under the strain, and Zuck&#x27;s machine just keeps throwing straw.<p>This seems quite bizarre to me. Can someone here who&#x27;s proposed one of these Democracy Protection Apparatuses tell me what it is y&#x27;all&#x27;re trying to fix?<p>Make no mistake--I am quite aware that basically every public communications channel, not just the web but every channel, is under pressure from a constant flood of messaging aimed at literally changing minds, changing what and how we all think about this concern or that. I am quite well apprised of how the anti-vaxxers spread their wild, unbelievable propaganda, leveraging facebook moms&#x27; groups and instagram knitting forums to spread their evil &amp; subversive messages. I know all about how the wily Ruskies have become the world&#x27;s greatest social media influencers imaginable, who can take a shoestring budget that couldn&#x27;t cover a major campaign&#x27;s one day hotel spend and swing the most important election on earth.<p>Of course, as with the printing press and radio and television and fax machines and even pagers, I completely believe, based on solid evidence, that power factions attempt to leverage all broadly-adopted comms channels to their own selfish ends. I&#x27;m not denying that.<p>But can anyone here clearly identify what problem is right now such a huge concern that we should cheer on a corporation--one that wields power over our lives like no other ever has--as it unilaterally decides what we can and cannot here?<p>I mean, Susan&#x27;s big reason here has been laid out explicitly: The &#x27;rony pandemic is of such great concern that our ears should be blocked off from any sound that doesn&#x27;t emanate from Official Authority, in this case, the WHO, an organization which five months ago nobody cared about at all and now everyone knows is about as credible as The National Enquirer (todo: insert BatBoy joke).<p>I mean, to me it is clearly obvious that accepting censorship is a huge risk. I&#x27;m not crazy, I don&#x27;t think there should be literally zero restriction on free speech. The world would be a mess of scams were fraud permissible, for instance. But the risks censorship brings are huge and asymmetric--only us little people suffer when the surveillance and enforcement mechanisms censorship requires are abused. The wealthy and connected will always have more access to information than we do. When the abuse happens, it will always be to their benefit, because they either are the censors themselves or they control the censors. As we stand to lose the most when censorship is abused, we should have an extremely high bar for any justification for it. (Just think about that phrase, &quot;dangerous information,&quot; for a second--we&#x27;re not talking nuclear launch codes, we&#x27;re talking questioning public policy, this is what Susan thinks is dangerous. Clearly she thinks very little of us.)<p>Censorship is power. Actually, censorship is the root of the power hierarchy. It&#x27;s the most important tool in the shed, as a tractor is to a farmer so is censorship to Team Elite.<p>They want to control our minds.

The places where I went diving in the 90ies: like Great Barrier Reef, Gulf of Thailand, Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;ring of fire&quot;, that were full of life back then, they are now underwater wastelands. The primal forests &#x2F; jungle I trekked in North Sumatra are nearly burnt down and forests of Borneo under threat from total destruction thanks to the new capitol they want to buid there.

And then you fix the problem and run migration again. Easy.<p>In comparison writing migration scripts on Oracle is a nightmare - DDLs aren&#x27;t transactional (THEY COMMIT ON EACH LINE...), so you have to separate them from DMLs and ensure that only the scripts that haven&#x27;t passed yet are re-run later. I&#x27;ve worked in 3 different companies that used oracle, and there were 3 different approaches to that problem, and all 3 of them sucked :)<p>In one company we had several big customers each with 1 production db, and software was written on separate branches for each customer, and helpdesk staff was dealing with migrations - programmers just asked helpdesk to add a column and worked on the test db for that customer. It was a lot of unnecessary work to port changes and bugfixes between branches, but at least we knew exactly what is on each db and could fix problems by ourselves. There was no migration to speak of, just manual changes on dbs and documenting them in svn (it was before git was popular).<p>In another company there was one development branch and several customers, and there were migration scripts written by all developers when they made changes, which were merged into development branch for db by 1 guy whose whole job was to merge these scripts and check if migration works. It slowed down development (because when you finished your task on local db you had to make a migration script(s) and send them to be verified. And even &quot;that guy&quot; sometimes made mistakes and then if you fetched db scripts in the morning you couldn&#x27;t work until stuff was fixed (or you had to recreate oracle db from scratch which took several hours).<p>That was before docker BTW, now they probably use docker so that can be less of a problem.<p>In the third company we had one customer but with hundreds of installations, and we had one development branch with frequent releases. Developers maintained migration scripts between release, major and minor versions. There was no &quot;that guy&quot; - we had smoke tests instead, and it sometimes took more time to write that migration script(s) than to change the code.<p>So you want to add 3 columns to 3 tables and fill them? And it has to be done in order because of dependencies? Write no less than 6 migration scripts (alter table 1, update table 1, alter table 2, ...). Add them with proper names and some boilerplate to the migration scripts for minor versions (3.4.5 -&gt; 3.4.6). But that&#x27;s not all! We also have migration scripts for major versions (3.4.0 -&gt; 3.5.0), so you also need to add them there. You have to check the migration separately because these scripts often use shortcuts to run faster. So your scripts might break despite working for minor version migration.<p>Then there&#x27;s the scripts for release version migration (3.0.0-&gt;4.0.0). Add your scripts there as well, and test once again.<p>Oh, and testing these scripts on test data doesn&#x27;t mean they will work - each installation of db changes slightly over time - people add stuff from ui. There are rules what they can change and what they cannot, but if you don&#x27;t think about it you might break something with your migration scripts on production despite it working on test data.<p>When that happens you have to write migration fixes which need to detect that problem and fix it on data you don&#x27;t have direct access to :)<p>It was a nightmare.<p>Meanwhile Postgress is just doing the right thing, write 1 migration script with everything in it, if it works it works, if not - it rollbacks.

The Tetris Company is very aggressive about shutting down any popular clones. It seems pointless to invest energy in Tetris when they simply do not want any nonlicensed implementations to exist. The author of an older clone expresses this sentiment:<p>&gt; More importantly, the lead developer of LOCKJAW is a fan of free software, or software that the public can improve and share, as a means to protect the rights of users of computing devices. He does not share the belief expressed by Alexey Pajitnov, co-founder of The Tetris Company, that free software &quot;should never have existed&quot; because it &quot;destroys the market.&quot; (Mr. Pajitnov explained further in a 2015 interview with Matt Barton.) But what really destroys the market is monopoly.<p>&gt; In fact, though Mr. Pajitnov and his partner Henk Rogers want Tetris to become an internationally competitive sport, as Mr. Pajitnov mentioned in earlier in the same interview, a policy against free software makes it that much harder. Imagine if there were a Basketball Company LLC that could sue a city or school district for copyright infringement for putting a basketball court with correct dimensions into a city park or school gymnasium. There are multiple competing suppliers of basketball and chess equipment, unlike software for playing Tetris.

It was awarded &quot;best arcade game of the year&quot; by several Japanese magazines. This arcade version featured a 2-player mode and followed what came to be known as the &quot;Sega rotation&quot; ruleset due to restrictions on piece rotations.<p>The Sega version was ported to the newly-released Mega Drive (Genesis) console and was scheduled to be released in early 1989. It was to be the Mega Drive&#x27;s killer title, but when the release day came, stores did not get any shipments in. It was later discovered that Nintendo had sued Atari over the rights to the game right before the release of the Mega Drive port in Japan (Atari had given the rights to its subsidiary Tengen, who had licensed them to Sega in Japan). Nintendo won, and Sega was left with a huge stock of games that were eventually repurposed or destroyed.<p>The Game Boy version wasn&#x27;t released until mid-1989 in Japan, and the NES version after that.

The first argument states that assuming that coughs are independent, the cough pattern is unlikely. But the data later shows that they are hardly independent but cluster, often two or more coughs are in a short timespan.<p>The second argument goes through each of the questions, but doesn&#x27;t really show any evidence for cheating. Question 8 has no suspicious coughs (coughs close to the correct answer), and Ingram knows the answer quickly. Question 9 contains one suspicious cough, but only after the second mention of the correct answer. Again Ingram is quite sure about this answer and does not consider any other answer.<p>Question 10 is the first question (of that day) Ingram struggles with. There are 7 coughs recorded, 5 cough &quot;clusters&quot; (coughs very close to each other), 2 cough cluster could be suspicious. The first potentially suspicious cough cluster is pretty far away from the answers , while the second one is close to the correct answer. The next notes that these coughs didn&#x27;t come from the phantom cougher, but from his wife. On the other hand there are lots of better place to insert a cough to cheat. This is one of the few questions where he changes his mind.<p>Question 11 has five coughs in total and three suspicious coughs, but cough 2-5 are very close together (and very late). Ingram is focused on the correct answer from the beginning, and does not really consider any other answer.<p>Question 12 has one cough after an incorrect answer at the very beginning. There is one cough cluster later on after the correct answer, but the correct answer is said 5 times, whereas the only one other answer is mentioned once, and only considered for a few seconds. The other coughes are relatively far away from any answer.<p>Question 13 has a cough after the correct answer in the very beginning, but it is not called as a significant cough in the linked youtube video from WWTBAM. Only the correct answer is considered.<p>In Question 14 Ingram struggles similar to question 10. there are 12 coughs. 6 coughs  are heard shortly after a wrong answer (coughs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9), and 4 coughs are heard shortly after the right answer (coughs 6, 10, 11, 12).   The next mentions a muttered &quot;no&quot;, but any muttering loud enough to inform the contestant surely must be heard by the host and the crew. If they cheated using coughs, why muttering very obviously?<p>Question 15 has 23 coughs, 7 are close to wrong answers and 10 are close to the right answer. Ingram speaks the correct answer 11 times, and lists the incorrect answers 4 times. Most of the suspicious coughing happens in the very end, when he basically made his decision. Most of the coughing close to the incorrect answers happens early. If coughing was used, why did he not lock into one of the incorrect answers? The text mentions Ingram muttering &quot;I think I know...&quot; and calls that suspicious, but that phrase seems a very natural choice here.<p>The questions, coughing and answering doesn&#x27;t follow a pattern: Sometimes there is a cough very early after the correct answer and Ingram picks that option, sometimes there is a cough very early after the incorrect answer put Ingram doesn&#x27;t pick that option. Sometimes for unclear questions there are multiple coughs after the correct option, and Ingram picks that option; sometimes for unlcear options there are multiple coughs after the incorrect option and Ingram does not pick that option. On some unclear questions there is no coughing at all, but Ingram still guesses correctly. On some clear questions there is coughing, although Ingram did not even consider any wrong answer.<p>Next the blog post compares distributions of elapsed time since last answer for correct and incorrect answers. It does not use a statistical test (e.g. Kolmogorow-Smirnow-Test), but just counts coughs to some threshold. Resolution is very rough, the subsampling for that plot only done once. While simulations show that there are more coughs after an correct answer then expected, there are also more coughs after an incorrect answer then expected. The simulations disregard that for most incorrect answers there is not a lot of time until the next answer is spoken. Indeed often the incorrect answers are simply listed and immediately disregarded.<p>While the presented data might call for some scrutiny, it is far away from justifying the damning tone."],"time":["2020-05-04 20:19:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["JoeAltmaier"],"id":[23067402],"kids":[23067674],"parent":[23066330],"text":["Forget random.

If enough people simply held and used this currency as opposed to other crypto or USD&#x2F;etc, and enough started requiring buyers&#x2F;sellers to use it (for political reasons at first, then later practical reasons) then its price would quickly stabilize and make it a reserve currency, and there&#x27;s not much any other party could do to stop it.

It is simply built into the system at that point.

If UBIC is not immediately usable on almost every phone, it may not find wide adoption. And an UBI like this only gains value through adoption.<p>- government restriction of passport use: afaik, the German ID card can only be used to digitally sign data from sanctioned sources, i. e. your service that uses the ID card to sign data must first authorize itself to the ID card using a valid certificate issued by a government certificate authority.<p>- government sabotage: while flooding the system with fake passport certificates might mean bad PR, the government ultimately controls all the trust anchors and will do this if UBIC gets dangerous. It&#x27;s good to have different UBICs per country, this way the power of a single government is limited.<p>- privacy: since reliable passport revocation is not available, proof of passport is not enough to prevent multiple passport use.

I&#x27;m having an especially hard time balancing them.<p>I&#x27;ve been through various apps and approaches, and even tried to write some tools myself. So far I have been unsuccessful in finding the right abstractions and solution to solve the problem. Everything I&#x27;ve tried ran into edge cases it couldn&#x27;t handle. I always came back to listing goals and daily schedules in raw text files, sometimes using org-mode.<p>One approach that has worked okay-ish for me is to have a hierarchy of personal OKRs. Quarterly -&gt; Monthly -&gt; Weekly. I found anything longer than quarterly to not be very useful - life changes too quickly. Even quarterly may be too much. You create these as-you-go, e.g. each Sunday you review your past week and create OKRs for the next week, possibly adjusting some of your monthly goals. Each day is then managed with a simple TODO list and you count tasks towards your weekly OKRs. At the end of each period (day, week, month) you have a review.<p>This approach still has a lot of shortcomings (not being flexible enough, not incorporating habits, some things are difficult to measure and can&#x27;t be expressed as OKRs, etc) and I&#x27;ve tried several other things I could talk about, but the time period in which I used this approach was one of the more productive ones.<p>Regardless of the technique, one thing I&#x27;ve come to realize is that people tend to spend not enough time on &quot;meta&quot; - figuring out what to spend time on.

I think the “persistence paradigm” we’re living through causes these sort of psychological short circuits where we forget that what we’re doing is building our minds and not building some external edifice or monument that we can point to as our “knowledge”. There is never going to be a moment where you can point at your stack of notebooks or answers to textbook questions or list of books you’ve read and say “I’ve done it, I’ve learned so much”. The widespread behavior of persisting moments of our lives out into cyberspace has sort of bled into our psychologies. I think this is partially why you see so many people struggling with these sorts of questions.<p>So the short answer I think is to focus on a process of daily improvement instead of some systematic program for self study. Just read 60 minutes a day, journal 30 minutes a day, and place absolutely no restrictions on the subject matter. For a while I also burned my notebooks every 30 days, that was really helpful.

What they leave out is whether or not they <i>actually want to do those things<\/i>.<p>I think you may be suffering from this.  You life becomes this treadmill of trying to prioritise what you want to have accomplished coupled with statuses of where you are now. You are always fighting against the clock because you are wondering if you are making &quot;enough&quot; progress and worrying if you might be missing out because you made the wrong priority call.

From my teens, I realized that the internet was limitless in how much info it had, but that I was limited in how much I could pack into my brain.<p>Here are some things I try to keep in mind as I try to learn new things:<p>* Get enough sleep and nutrition. If you&#x27;re tired&#x2F;hungry you&#x27;re going to feel overwhelmed faster<p>* Don&#x27;t rely on motivation, instead rely on discipline. Motivation is great for a burst of energy, but it will eventually leave you. Discipline, on the other hand, is what will make you start and finish that book &#x2F; online course, etc.<p>* Track your progress in whatever way is best suited to you. This could be as simple as a check on a calendar or using an app. Personally I like the Jiffy and Habits app on the Android store. Seeing progress helps with both motivation and discipline.<p>* Learn one thing at a time. It&#x27;s tempting to spread yourself thin, but sticking to one thing is best.<p>* Give yourself more time than you think you&#x27;ll need to learn. In a classroom setting you can raise your hand and ask an expert a question which they can quickly clear up for you. When you&#x27;re doing self-study you&#x27;ll find that you may ask the wrong question, interpret things wrong, go down a Google rabbit hole trying to understand related topics, dig through forum answers which may not quite answer your question, and leave you with even more questions.<p>* Figure out your learning method. Maybe it&#x27;s video, maybe it&#x27;s a book. Your preferred learning method may change over time and it may change by topic. Don&#x27;t be afraid to stop one method and pick up with a new one, or change midway through. For example, when I&#x27;m learning a new language I find video courses helpful to get me started, but then once I&#x27;m running and past the basics, I find text content easier to digest.<p>* Personally I get frustrated when learning new things when someone decides to coin a new jargon term. For example a little while back I ran into the term &quot;upsert&quot; to refer to an &quot;update or insert&quot; process. The text I was reading used it like I was supposed to know what it was, but I had never run into it before. These things frustrate me and usually make me feel like I&#x27;m way behind in basic knowledge and tend to kill both motivation and discipline. Why not just the extended-term, especially in a course designed for beginners? It causes a weird mental block for me. My solution is to just say &quot;Fuck you, but fine. I accept this as it is&quot;.

It is about the drive to put in the yards for learning. Enthusiasm doesn&#x27;t always translate to motivation (perhaps there is a better word for it). \nb) Engagement - Without engagement, hours of watching or reading will still leave you dissatisfied that you haven&#x27;t learnt anything at all. Being engaged with a topic flexes the brain muscle and allows you to internalize the concept.<p>I use different techniques to maximize the two factors. For motivation, nothing fuels it better than achievement. This achievement can be something big like a complicated project or something simple like crossing of a chapter in a book. The key thing is to have a scorecard, minor or major goals. It is a bit like Gamification for self. It motivates people to no end.<p>For engagement, I mix and match learning mediums according to the environment. It is easy to despair waiting for the best setup, where you can spend your undivided attention. The smarter thing is to engineer your study plan for a realistic environment. I find that practice, books and videos engages you in descending order. OTOH if you have a busy schedule, focus level and time available may have a reverse distribution. The key is to pair each environment with corresponding learning mode. I watch videos while on commute or in in crowded places, read books while on couch or with family and do hands-on practice during my lone time. Videos and books complements practice nicely. It is not possible to pick up everything by practice alone. Likewise after practice, you can take more context and subtleties out of a book or video.<p>When it comes to practice, doing the prescribed exercises  or tutorials is helpful but you get maximum return by deviating from the script such as writing your own scenarios or doing a project. Even blogging or making a learning video will help to engage you more with the topic. This works by tuning your engagement to the maximum.<p>With books and videos, it also helps to find ways to engage with the medium.

In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance sqrt(n).

Use a Trello board.<p>Because you&#x27;re self-studying, you&#x27;re sort of going to a self-study university taking different modules from different faculties. This Trello board spells out your self-study university curriculum and you&#x27;re in charge of it.<p>Here is a 5-step process to build this curriculum.<p>Firstly, create say 3 lists on the Trello board: ML, CS and Math. Each list represents a &#x27;faculty&#x27;.<p>Then, for every list, create Trello cards where each card is a &#x27;module&#x27;. For example, you would create &#x27;Data structures &amp; algorithms&#x27; in the CS list and &#x27;Decision trees&#x27; under ML.<p>The next step is to figure out for each module if it&#x27;s something you either (i) wish to know or (ii) must know. You can use Trello labels or even use the Trello separators for this.<p>This following step requires a bit of work and it&#x27;s the fun part, only because it&#x27;s self-study. For each module, list down (you can list things in a card) the resources you have for that module. For this there are various resources you can get from the comments, search engines, and your peers. Consider the different modes of instruction: books, e-books, videos, lecture notes, slides, articles, blog posts, online learning platforms and so on. Choose what&#x27;s best for you. If you can&#x27;t decide just pick something first and find another time to source for another material.<p>Lastly, prioritise the modules. This can be done by easily dragging the modules which you want to do first on top of the list (having considered what you wish to know and what you must know). Set, say, top 3 modules for each list then you&#x27;d like to do for the next 2 weeks.<p>This is the high-level curriculum planning. If you plan on a micro-level planning like what modules to do for this week or for today, that I leave it to you."],"time":["2020-05-04 16:57:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jerome-jh"],"id":[23067300],"kids":{},"parent":[23057411],"text":["First of, you will not be able to learn all these things.

Start easy.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to grab a textbook or video series because it gets good reviews on Amazon or likes on YouTube. That&#x27;s all good and fine, but it&#x27;s more important to get a good introduction to the topic. The key here is to get a rhythm going and it&#x27;s very easy to disrupt your study rhythm if you start too hard. So, much like working out, start out easy, with something you can easily grasp. Moreover, do less than you can. As they say in weightlifting, leave a couple of reps in the tank. Don&#x27;t go all out as you&#x27;re running a marathon, not a sprint.<p>2. Be consistent<p>The key to finishing something is to do be consistent. Intense 5-day seminars can work, but you&#x27;re going to need a very good teacher and have a lot of motivation to get through it. For self-study, consistency is much more important. I would recommend somewhere between 4-10 hours a week. Anything more than that is going to burn you out and anything less and you&#x27;ll forget previous lessons. 1 hour a day for me on a given subject and taking weekends off works for me. The key is to build up momentum and keep it going.<p>3. Power through by stepping back.<p>There will be sections where you&#x27;re going to feel lost. You&#x27;re going to feel frustrated or not know what the text or video is talking about. This is where you need to &quot;deload&quot; a bit. Take a week to review all the material you&#x27;ve learned so far and redo some of the exercises. Everyone has these and the key is to <i>not<\/i> lose momentum. Many a study has stopped due to one obstacle. The key is to step back for a bit and try again without losing the momentum you&#x27;ve built.<p>4. Remove distractions.<p>Not everyone has the discipline to follow these, and most of the time your brain will try very hard to distract you when you encounter a hard problem. The key is to minimize all your distractions during your study time. This means no email, social media, walks to the fridge or anything else. You start and don&#x27;t stop until you&#x27;ve finished your hour (or 30 minutes or whatever you committed to). It&#x27;s okay if you only got through 2 pages during that time as long as you didn&#x27;t get distracted. Give yourself permission to stall a bit. And if this happens a few times in a row, step back and try again (see 3)<p>5. Get a buddy<p>The best way to study is with someone or some group that&#x27;s studying the same thing. There are lots of forums for all of those topics that you can engage in to answer some of your questions and possibly find someone to study with. Getting some accountability is an excellent way to keep up your momentum."],"time":["2020-05-03 23:44:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["danj"],"id":[23061211],"kids":{},"parent":[23057411],"text":["I was having very similar thoughts to you about a month ago.

When it comes to improving yourself and learning new things, I think attitude is more important than tools. There is only so much you can get out of organizing your goals, resources and time if you overstretch yourself. I have found two techniques useful in terms of focusing my time and energy: Extrapolating from future achievements and elimination.<p>What I mean with &quot;extrapolating from future achievements&quot; is setting concrete goals in terms of where I want to be in five years, or what I would like to be able to say I achieved, and working backwards from there. I feel that the main reason many people engage with new ideas, technologies, tools etc. is the infamous FOMO, fear of missing out. We fear that we will be left out, worth less if we don&#x27;t read this article or learn that programming language. If there is no actual driving force behind an approach to a topic, learning it will cost you a lot of energy. You will need to remind yourself again and again why you are putting in the time and effort, and even worse, the next shiny thing will be extremely distracting. If you start with the knowledge that it&#x27;s taking you somewhere, however, you will have much more internal drive.<p>Elimination is just not doing things. You have three languages you want to learn? Drop two. Two books on algorithms? Drop one, or maybe even drop both and do some sports instead. I know this sounds silly; you are asking how you can get better at learning things, and I&#x27;m telling you not to learn them in the first place. But I think this is a key talent; dropping things and not looking back, not feeling bad about it, not losing any sleep over a missed opportunity. Everyone knows deep down that there is enough time only to concentrate on a couple of topics and areas in one lifetime; you can be a novice at many topics, but being an expert requires huge amounts of time and dedication. And the only way to bring these is by eliminating other topics. The previous technique of extrapolating from the future is useful here. Do you want to be called a great roboticist in 5 years? Then you will have to drop the ML. You want to be a great Rust programmer? You will have to let Clojure go.<p>I hope this is useful. What you have to keep in mind is that deep, multi-faceted expertise in a single area is very valuable, both as a trade and for you individually, to feel great about what you do. Acquiring this expertise is very difficult. You will need to put in a lot of honest work, will have a lot of dead ends and frustrations, and frequent doubts regarding your choice. Nevertheless, you should try to pick one area of expertise and eliminate all other efforts that don&#x27;t contribute to your prowess at it."],"time":["2020-05-03 21:52:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RyanOD"],"id":[23069928],"kids":{},"parent":[23057411],"text":["Is one of the challenges the fact that you have too many options at your disposal?

Otherwise I would simply not do anything at all. And that&#x27;s a relieving truth, honestly. Be thankful that your brain budgets for you.

Realise that your laziness and intuitive preferences keep the world of &#x27;shoulds and oughts&#x27; a manageable size.

If you want to learn something, you&#x27;re going to have to put in the time. My biggest advice here is to make sure you&#x27;re applying the knowledge somehow. If you&#x27;re studying something but never putting it into practice (and the study is not its own reward), then you&#x27;re going to be frustrated later when you try to use all of these skills you think you understand. Kent Beck has a good quote about technique and discipline. He says, essentially, no book about gardening, <i><\/i>no matter how good it is,<i><\/i> will make you a gardener. You have to pull some weeds and trim some hedges. Maybe join a community of gardeners and learn about the practice of others. That&#x27;s what makes you a gardener. This doesn&#x27;t apply if you&#x27;re just learning for the sake of learning, of course, but it sounded to me like you actually wanted to master a technique.<p>For the latter problem, it sounds like you&#x27;re finally running into the reality that your time on this earth is a scarce resource. I don&#x27;t mean that to be condescending; it didn&#x27;t sink in for me until I was about 30. But the reality is that you won&#x27;t be able to do everything, and tracking your progress really isn&#x27;t the problem. You&#x27;re going to have to choose precisely the things you want to do. But here&#x27;s the thing: that choice <i><\/i>is not permanent<i><\/i> and almost certainly will not hold over your entire life. I like two quotes by Seneca and Thoreau (respectively) here. Thoreau says that a wise man remembers that the sun rose clear, and Seneca said that each day is a stage upon life&#x27;s journey. Those may sound like cliches, but you need to really understand them. Every day you get a fresh start and you get to choose what matters to you. If every day you wake up and decide &quot;I want to know ML mathematics,&quot; then by all means do that. Figure out what you already know and what you need to know next. But it&#x27;s OK if these things change from one day to the next. That&#x27;s part of the journey of life.<p>Last but not least, I got some good advice from the books &quot;How to Get Lucky&quot; and &quot;Refuse to Choose.&quot; The latter was about imposing some structure on yourself if you truly get stuck deciding in the moment. I don&#x27;t give myself a hard schedule, but I pick 6-12 things I want to work on (because I&#x27;m a person with a lot of natural interests) and I stick to what I&#x27;m doing for about 30 minutes. That gives me enough structure to force myself to follow through and not feel like I&#x27;m missing out on my other passions. And lastly when I&#x27;m really stuck about which thing to do next, I list my options and flip a coin. If you have problems with decisiveness like I do, this sounds stupid but it will move you out of your head and into action.

This is useful because it delineates what to read&#x2F;try&#x2F;master&#x2F;experiment and where to stop. If you work as a developer or scientist, you normally have one or more projects given to you or self-selected, and focusing on these keeps you grounded and avoids you getting lost.\nHaving a project means you do not just CONSUME knowledge but that you will also PRODUCE something, which gives you fulfilment.<p>YouTube is a useful supplement and it may speed up your learning, but note that there is a lot of overlap both in books and online. Focusing on one book per topic gives you a sense of where you are (x% complete), which may be helpful for orientation and self-motivation, too. It&#x27;s OKAY to supplement with additional reading and videos, but I&#x27;d suggest stick to one text book as your master source to have that orientation.<p>Having access to a group of students, e.g. at a university (research group, reading group) or meet-up, is also very helpful to stay motivated. Nothing stops you from forming your own if there isn&#x27;t one for the topics you care about. Nowadays it could be virtual, too. People in groups can learn based on personal study and then congregate to discuss or they can teach each other different sub-parts of the materials that the group attempts to master.<p>Best of luck!"],"time":["2020-05-04 23:14:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["the_burning_one"],"id":[23062407],"kids":{},"parent":[23057411],"text":["Coursera dude.

I try to set a goal of something I want to achieve. Set up a system with Arch linux with full encryption and LVM was something I wanted to do this weekend. I hadn&#x27;t used that for a few years. I really struggled getting UEFI to work and I could simply have reverted to MBR&#x2F;BIOS but I really wanted to figure out why it didn&#x27;t work. In the end I figured it out, and in addition I learned a whole lot about how UEFI worked on the way there. And LVM and LUKS as well as I screwed a few things up and managed to fix them without reinstalling :P I knew about all these, but not to the depth I do now.<p>If I&#x27;d just ran through the Ubuntu installer I wouldn&#x27;t have known this. Doing things the hard way is the best for learning. And more rewarding because you get exactly what you want.<p>I find I pick things up super quickly (at least in the IT realm) so usually I don&#x27;t do a deep dive until I run into issues. I do try to get a handle on the overall architecture though. So I set things up the right way, and then I figure out the nuts &amp; bolts along the way. I&#x27;m not someone for crunching through textbooks.<p>One thing I personally hate is tutorial videos, especially Youtube. I find them paced way too slow, whereas with text you can be super fast. So I never use video learning until I have to. I absolutely hate the stupid automated courses we have to do in work. Like office safety etc we have to repeat every year. They&#x27;re really made for the lowest common denominator, which is apparently someone who can&#x27;t understand more than 10 words per minute :(<p>And when you&#x27;re working on something, try to not use youtube, facebook etc. Don&#x27;t go looking for distraction. Unless you&#x27;re really banging your head on the wall on a problem, then it may help to do something else for a bit. And try not to ask others if you can&#x27;t figure something out. If you figure it out yourself it&#x27;s more rewarding and much more educational and memorable. It also avoids being &quot;that guy&quot; :)<p>Tracking progress, I can&#x27;t help with that. I often change my priorities as I go along, leaving stuff half-finished because I found something better or more interesting to do. So be it... I like not having a destination, and having a wide range of knowledge has helped me a lot in my job. What helps is that I live alone and technology is my job and my passion so I&#x27;m not struggling for time.<p>I don&#x27;t really care if I don&#x27;t finish something if it turned out it wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for, or I found something else that was more interesting. I hate using &quot;methodologies&quot;, I always think something that someone else invented can&#x27;t be perfect for me. I like to make my own way. I do sometimes look at them and pick out bits I like. For this reason I also avoid doing certification trajectories. And also because I think they are too much &quot;the world according to&quot; Microsoft&#x2F;Cisco&#x2F;etc. I care about technology, not about one particular company&#x27;s take on it.<p>But anyway, don&#x27;t take my advice for granted. Find out and then do what works for you. That&#x27;s my #1 bit of advice. Everyone is different. I&#x27;m not very typical actually. I have very low discipline but yet I&#x27;m actually very effective (including in my job) because I have very deep interest and motivation. What helps me is just not worrying about the things I didn&#x27;t finish. What&#x27;s important to me is the journey, not the end result. Even a failed or unfinished project provided lessons along the way.<p>I really agree with the comment of adamcharnock below who said it should be fun. Absolutely agree.

I think it helps _a lot_ to have an effective task management system.<p>Why?\nThere is this thing called the Zeigarnik effect. The Zeigarnik effect states that unoccupied tasks tend to overwhelm your conscious thought. When you have too much stuff to do you get overburdened and stressed and start watching Youtube. (I&#x27;ve definitely been there).<p>How do you deal with the Zeigarnik effect? \nWell, you can complete the task, but that&#x27;s often a tall order. There&#x27;s been research that shows that simply having a plan for how to complete a task helps you overcome the Zeigarnik effect.<p>How do you make sure you have a plan for all your open tasks&#x2F;projects?\nThis is where the task management system comes in. I&#x27;ll tell you a few that I&#x27;ve tried and the software I use.<p>I think the two biggest systems for managing your todo list are Agile (adapted for personal use) and Getting Things Done (GTD).<p>I have been using a person Agile system for about two years now. It has definitely helped with stress a lot. I have weekly &quot;sprints&quot; where I plan what I want to do for the week. I review every week - what went well and what can be improved. I have a backlog with all the tasks that I want to work on divided up by projects. I also have a board for projects and what state they&#x27;re in - TODO, in progess, done.<p>GTD is another system that I&#x27;ve been meaning to read about. What I know so far is that it&#x27;s basically a flow chart for each item you have to do. There are lists for items in different categories - projects, backlog, current work.<p>The key point is that both of these systems _never leave a task incomplete_. By &quot;incomplete&quot;, I mean not finished or reviewed. Yes, reviewed. If you recall, these are exactly the two ways of eliminating the Zeigarnik effect and the stress it entails.<p>Furthermore, with an effective task management system, you gain confidence and momentum in seeing your record of complete projects stack up. (I sometimes scroll back on previous years just for fun).<p>What about software?\nI started out using Trello. It&#x27;s simple, free, and has almost no learning curve. I have a board for my sprint, backlog, and projects. On my sprint board, I have 3 lists - TODO, in progress, and done. At the end of the week, I move the done list to the completed board. Then I have a visual record of everything I&#x27;ve completed over the past year (I make separate completed boards for each year).<p>However, I&#x27;ve been slowly trying to convert all my stuff to org-mode in Emacs. Look up org-mode if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with it. It&#x27;s very popular among GTD enthusiasts.<p>In short, have a plan for everything you&#x27;re working on, keep a &quot;scoreboard&quot; or list of things you&#x27;ve accomplished, and review constantly - review each task at the EOD and review on a weekly basis at least."],"time":["2020-05-04 01:24:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rajlego"],"id":[23069213],"kids":[23069772],"parent":[23057411],"text":["I have the perfect tool for you if you&#x27;re willing to suffer through getting used to it: SuperMemo [1]. The basic feature it starts with is spaced repetition [2]. Spaced repetition is good. But terribly boring if you&#x27;re making cards by hand. Because of that, SuperMemo has a feature that imo is just as important as SRS but much less known: incremental reading [3].<p>tl;dr of incremental reading: process hundreds of articles in a time efficient manner and enjoyably convert them to active recall items.<p>For a video on it in action check this [4]<p>More detail: incremental reading has a lot of parts but probably the most important is the priority queue and the concept of incrementally.<p>Priority Queue: imagine you had 100 articles to go through. How would you process them efficiently? What if you have 10,000? You can&#x27;t go through that reasonably. SuperMemo helps you manage that with a priority system which lets you choose what&#x27;s actually important and what you&#x27;ll end up seeing more and less often. I can&#x27;t express just how much this helps. This means I can import as much shiny stuff as I want and be confident I&#x27;m not gonna lose out on stuff I actually care about. If you just used priority queue and manually made cards while going through things SM would be a big improvement over standard SRS.<p>But it has another cool concept: incrementalism.\nWith SuperMemo you don&#x27;t read through an entire piece of content at once. You read it over time, and make extracts that you break down till you have facts you can memorize with SRS. You might be wondering: if you don&#x27;t read it all at once won&#x27;t you forget it? It&#x27;s the opposite that occurs. By separating reading of an article over time (separated by days) your brain has time to do a bit of memory consolidation and move some of what you read to long-term memory. That means next reread, you can process the article a bit better since you&#x27;re not taxing WM as much. This might seem minor but it makes a huge difference for comprehension and long-term efficiency. Processing things in bits means when you get board with one article you can go to the next one. I have ADHD which makes this really awesome, it&#x27;s like Instagram but with text and real learning.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in trying it out, let me know. If you have questions about it ask away, this explanation has plenty of gaps.

[1]<p>I&#x27;ve started doing machine learning experiments with it finally. (See [1] for details)<p>There&#x27;s a few tricks to getting the best performance. You want to convert your neural network to run with NVIDIA&#x27;s TensorRT library instead of just tensorflow or torch. TensorRT does all the optimized goodness that gets you the most out of the hardware. Not all possible network operations can run in TensorRT (though nvidia updates the framework regularly). This means some networks can&#x27;t be easily converted to something fully optimized for this platform. Facebook&#x27;s detectron2 for example uses some operations that don&#x27;t readily convert. [2]<p>But then if you&#x27;re new like me you&#x27;ve got to both find some code that will ultimately produce something you can convert to TensorRT, and you also need something that you can easily train. I&#x27;ve learned that training using your own dataset is often non-obvious. A lot of example code shows how to use an existing dataset but they totally gloss over the specific label format those datasets use. That means you&#x27;ve got to do some digging to figure out how to make your own dataset load properly in to the training code.<p>After trying a few different things, I&#x27;ve gotten some good results training using Bonnet(al) [3]. I was able to make enough sense of its training code to use my own dataset, and it looks like it will readily convert to TensorRT. Then you load the converted network using NVIDIA&#x27;s Deepstream library for maximum pipeline efficiency [4].<p>The performance numbers for the AGX Xavier are very good, and I am hopeful I will get my application fully operation soon enough.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reboot.love&#x2F;t&#x2F;new-cameras-on-rover&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reboot.love&#x2F;t&#x2F;new-cameras-on-rover&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;detectron2&#x2F;issues&#x2F;192\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;detectron2&#x2F;issues&#x2F;192<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PRBonn&#x2F;bonnetal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PRBonn&#x2F;bonnetal<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;deepstream-sdk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;deepstream-sdk<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-03 22:35:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["king_magic"],"id":[23062019],"kids":[23062321,23062112,23077726,23066897,23063421,23063956,23062113,23063910],"parent":[23061006],"text":["My biggest complaint with the Jetson line is it&#x27;s all ARM.

Add on top of that NVIDIA&#x27;s very low level documentation for pretty much any tooling they ship, coupled with the difficulty in getting near-time engineering support (unless you want to post to one of their message boards, and hope you get an answer back in less than a week)... basically, it&#x27;s really rough to do anything seriously useful with Jetson hardware.<p>Second biggest complaint is deploying Jetsons in production environments.

And even if not, it&#x27;ll be coarse.<p>- Never do anything in the UI thread that isn&#x27;t strictly responding to user input.<p>There are some things it&#x27;s mediocre and it would be somewhat difficult to implement better in an open tool:<p>- Really good understanding of mechanical mates. Basically Solidworks-grade constraints for putting things together.<p>- Tight interconnectedness between schematic and layout rules, and a really powerful and expressive language for writing rules. Altium&#x27;s rules language is simultaneously constraining and often lacks coverage for obvious cases. As an example, there&#x27;s no way to do same-net gap analysis. You can make unmanufacturable spaces between two traces of the same net all day long and the design rule checker would never care.<p>Some stuff Altium pretends to do but doesn&#x27;t, and it would be fiendishly difficult to do a good job in a FOSS tool:<p>- Physics modeling. I want to know how much coupling I&#x27;ll have between nets. I want to see discontinuities in transmission lines. I want to know what will radiate and absorb and how. Basically I want to be able to have my CAD tool also be Ansys HFSS with varying degrees of fidelity.<p>- Real schematic hierarchy. The schematic compiler is chock full of bugs that it&#x27;s dangerous to rely on hierarchy and also dangerous not to. I want to draw schematics with the same type of composition and repetition that I use to write software.<p>Then there&#x27;s stuff that Altium doesn&#x27;t even pretend to do and someone totally should write an EDA tool that does.<p>- Useful diff of schematics and layouts. I want to be better able to tell where I might have made an unintended change.<p>- Real time collaboration. Google Sheets but schematics and layouts. I want to be able to drop in on my layout artists&#x27; work and be able to point things out or share in the burden.<p>Lately in my office there have been lots of new people coming from places that use Cadence and they&#x27;re slowly trying to get us to switch over.
