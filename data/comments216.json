We have lots of evidence to back calorie restriction. We know that eating more earlier in the day vs later means your insulin levels can recover better (or something?). We know eating certain types of fats is bad for you, and eating certain types of other things are good for you. Exercise, or at least the right kind of exercise (seems like there are open questions here, like how much is actually important) is healthy.<p>Then there are a number of pills you can take. When it comes to the pills we have a lot less evidence. From what I&#x27;ve seen there are probably a dozen or so pills, each one with bits and pieces of science surrounding them, that will <i>maybe<\/i> have some impact on mortality or aging. Some of the research does seem quite compelling - niacin, for example, seems to be pretty well researched and is actually prescribed at times. Niacin is also one of the pills you&#x27;ll see come up a lot if you start looking into anti-aging. Others like resveratrol (which, actually, appears to be old news - people have moved on, it seems, to more bioavailable substances) have a lot less research, though they&#x27;re promising.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to spend 100-200 dollars a month or so it seems that you can get most or all of these. I don&#x27;t think <i>any<\/i> research has been done on what taking <i>all<\/i> of these will do to you, but there is research on how the chemicals behave and I suppose from there people seem to draw conclusions on interactions.<p>Interestingly, from what I&#x27;ve read a lot of the popular &quot;anti aging&quot; trends like anti-oxidants are, more or less, very much debunked. My understanding is that while anti-oxidants absolutely do what their name implies in a lab setting, most of them tend to not do a damn thing in humans with regards to oxidation. So who knows what is or isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>From my layman understanding, if you&#x27;re ~20 years old you can basically just not fuck up super hard and wait another decade and we&#x27;ll know a lot more. If you&#x27;re 30, definitely start taking health seriously but maybe don&#x27;t worry so much about downing 50 supplements that only have a bit of backing research. If you&#x27;re 40 and above, and your goal is life extension... you might have to take a gamble.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, I found this channel quite interesting - I appreciated the guy always citing studies (and he explicitly calls out why he thinks the study is or is not high quality).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCpcvPcHJVOkO9Qp79BOagTg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCpcvPcHJVOkO9Qp79BOagTg<\/a><p>This FAQ definitely seems to be a good &#x27;one stop shop&#x27; for learning the state of things, without being prescriptive.<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor. I just got interested in the last few weeks about this stuff. None of this is without risk - that much is obvious. Only just the other day I was reading a post by someone who ended up in the hospital with liver failure that very possibly could have been tied to their supplementation. If you start taking pills that you don&#x27;t understand you seem <i>very<\/i> likely to fuck things up - some pills require that you <i>take other pills also<\/i>, for example lots of nootropics will fuck you up if you don&#x27;t get enough choline in your diet. All of this is to say, there&#x27;s cool and promising stuff here, but do your own research, and if you&#x27;re very young and healthy don&#x27;t stress about this stuff yet - the first step is always diet and exercise."],"time":["2020-08-30 07:29:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thiagotomei"],"id":[24321333],"kids":[24321356],"parent":[24320846],"text":["If people were dying in troves of a disease (...) every effort would be put on saving them, right?

But obviously inside a computer simulation made up of operations that are all individually reversible, it&#x27;s trivial to rewind things.<p>The experiment sets up a situation where certain information is reversibly recorded, and then the records are unmade by temporarily rewinding. The rewinding is obfuscated by hiding it inside of a measurement that is incompatible with the presence or absence of the record. I guess the authors might disagree about the measurement implying rewinding, but as a bit of evidence I&#x27;ll note that Scott Aaronson and Yosi Atia have shown that performing the measurement in question over a simulated agent is at least as expensive as rewinding the simulated agent [1]. Whatever is being done, it is doing some <i>seriously expensive<\/i> screwing around with the agent&#x27;s state. It&#x27;s like the experiment has a step where you feed the human through a giant meat processing plant, and for some reason everyone is pretending that&#x27;s not somehow important.<p>Basically, the authors are appealing to the intuition that humans are big complicated in-practice-irreversible things, so clearly a record is permanent if it has affected the state of a human. But then they imagine instantiating the human&#x27;s state inside a ridiculously powerful computer capable of reversibly simulating time advancing and of performing operations that have been engineered specifically to mess with the presence or absence of the record&#x27;s effects on the human&#x27;s state.

They hosted the database on SQL Server shared clusters and much of the application backend in VMware instances running on &quot;mainframe-grade&quot; servers (dozens of cores, exotic high-speed storage).  The hardware outlay alone was many hundred thousand dollars, and we interfaced with no less than 5 FTE&#x27;s who comprised part of the teams maintaining it.  Ours was one of a few applications hosted on their stack.<p>Despite repeated assurances of dedicated resource provisioning committed to us, our users often reported intermittent performance issues resulting in timeouts in our app.  I was the first to admit our code had lots of runway remaining for performance optimization and more elegant handling of network blips.  We embarked on a concerted effort to clean it up and saw huge improvements (which happily amortized to all of our other customers), but some of the performance issues still lingered.  Over and over again in meetings IT pointed their fingers at us.<p>Eventually we replicated the issue in their DEV environment using lots of scrubbed and sanitized data, and small armies of volunteer users.  I had a quite powerful laptop for the time (several CPU cores, 32GB RAM, high-end SSD&#x27;s in RAID) and during our internal testing I actually hosted an entire scaled-down version of their DEV environment on it.  During a site visit, we migrated their scrubbed data to my machine and connected all their clients to it.  That&#x27;s right, my little laptop replaced their whole back-end.  It ran a bit slower but after several hours the users reported zero timeouts.  This cheeky little demonstration finally caught the attention of some higher-up VP&#x27;s who pushed hard on their IT department.  A week later they traced the issue to a completely unrelated application that somehow managed to monopolize a good chunk of their storage bandwidth at certain points in the day.  Our application was one of their more-utilized ones, but I bet correcting this issue must also have brought some relief to their other &quot;tenants&quot;.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t a perfect example, but it demonstrates how architecture encompasses a whole lot more than just the DB and apps.  There&#x27;s underlying hardware, resource provisioning, trust boundaries, isolation and security guarantees, risk containment, management, performance, monitoring and alerting, backups, availability and redundancy, upgrade and rollback capabilities, billing, etc.  When you scale up toward Heroku&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Google Cloud size I imagine such concerns must be quite prominent."],"time":["2020-08-30 22:05:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aszen"],"id":[24329291],"kids":{},"parent":[24324142],"text":["Earlier we used to have multiple web apps with separate databases, now we are using a single web app that can connect to different databases and configuration based on the subdomain, so far it&#x27;s worked great, having a single web app really makes development and deployment a lot easier. \nWe often host multiple databases in a single rds instance to reduce costs.\nWe get data isolation and don&#x27;t have to deal with sharding, of course this works well for enterprise applications with just 50 - 100 tenants."],"time":["2020-08-31 09:47:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lukevp"],"id":[24325922],"kids":{},"parent":[24324142],"text":["It’s really best to design everything for a shared app shared db model, and to have a user&#x2F;tenant heirarchy in every app. You can start with each user belonging to their own tenant.

At its core, we received events (5-10KB) from customers and did something with those events. In total, we were receiving 8K-10K events per second.<p>In terms of security and privacy, isolating an individual tenant from others wasn&#x27;t so much of a concern as each tenant was a customer within the organization with the same data classification level. So from a security perspective, we were &quot;okay&quot;.<p>Where this gets interesting is that one tenant would suddenly decide to push a massive volume of data. Now processing events within a specific SLA was a critical non-functional requirement with this system. So then our on-call engineers would get alerts because shared messaging queues were getting backed up since Mr. Bob had decided to give us 3-5x his typical volume.<p>The traffic spike from one customer, which could last from minutes to hours, would negatively impact our SLAs with the other customers. Now all the customers would be upset. ^_0<p>Being internal customers, they were willing to pay for the excess traffic, but we didn&#x27;t really have the tooling to auto scale. Our customers also didn&#x27;t want us to rate limit them. Their expectation was that when they have traffic spikes, we need to be able to deal with it.<p>Now – we didn&#x27;t want to run extra machines that sat idle like 90% of the time. And when we had these traffic spikes, we&#x27;d see our metrics and find maxed out CPU, memory, and even worse, we&#x27;d consume all disk space from the log volume on the machines filling everything up. The hosts would become zombies until someone logged in and manually freed up disk.<p>There were a few lessons learned:<p>1. Rate limit your customers (if your organization allows).<p>2. If your customers are adamant that in some instances each month, they need to be able to send you 5x the traffic without any notice, then you can&#x27;t just rate limit them and be done with it. We adopted a solution where we would let our queues back up while some monitors would detect the excessive CPU or memory usage and would start scaling out the infrastructure. Once our monitors saw the message queues were looking normal again, they&#x27;d wait a little while and then scale back down.<p>3. When you&#x27;re processing from a message queue, you need to capture metrics to track which customer is sending you what volume. Otherwise, you can have metrics on the message queues themselves and have one queue per customer.<p>4.

So the model did work.<p>I don&#x27;t have data for this, but I think what actually happened was just a lot more short-termism as investors, companies, and executives focused more and more on short-term profits, so large recurring R&amp;D expenses that might require longer horizons to recoup investments made less sense.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wallace_Carothers#Move_to_DuPont\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wallace_Carothers#Move_to_DuPo...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-30 17:24:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["friseurtermin"],"id":[24322064],"kids":[24322662],"parent":[24321799],"text":["This reads a lot like this blog post [0] that was shared here a while ago, the discussion is quite interesting as well [1].

The best way they could do that was to have these research labs that provided decent money and a lot of support and resources to pursue their intellectual curiosity.<p>In addition, given that capital funding was a lot harder to acquire back in the day, it was about as good a deal as a smart person could get.<p>Nowadays, a couple of things have changed.

The article starts to engage with this at the end but doesn&#x27;t really do so properly. It&#x27;s easy to find examples of firms doing large scale expensive R&amp;D:<p>- Many firms making big investments in AI<p>- Self driving cars<p>- SpaceX reusable rockets, plus all the other Musk firms<p>- Advanced database technologies (e.g. at Microsoft, Google, Amazon)<p>- Advanced compiler R&amp;D (Oracle&#x2F;GraalVM)<p>- The huge sums thrown around in pharma R&amp;D<p>- Advanced graphics R&amp;D is driven primarily by video game firms<p>- Intel&#x2F;AMD&#x2F;ARM&#x2F;etc in CPU tech<p>- Tons of R&amp;D in oil and gas<p>and those are just examples we&#x27;re most familiar with. Are these firms running &quot;labs&quot;? No, not in the sense of Bell Labs. That&#x27;s because this model is not the most efficient model available, and has thus mostly been phased out. Corporate R&amp;D is much better integrated with actual product development than the standalone lab model captures. In the most successful cases we don&#x27;t even really perceive it as an R&amp;D lab because the entire company is doing R&amp;D constantly, in a completely integrated manner.<p>Google is perhaps the clearest case of a company that has completely integrated R&amp;D with its operations. There is an org called Google Research but IIRC it existed mostly for a trophy hire and isn&#x27;t especially important: the bulk of actual research is&#x2F;was done by product teams as an integrated part of their development process. There is no lab, yet at the same time, the lab is everywhere.<p>The second aspect is that it doesn&#x27;t discuss the role of personality or personal visions of CEOs at all. Yet this is often critical to the decision to do R&amp;D.<p>Why does Google research AI? It&#x27;s <i>not<\/i> because it&#x27;s an obvious, slam dunk move. Google has been doing ML research since the very start of the firm, but other search engine firms didn&#x27;t. Why did Google research Google Glass? Or self driving cars? Google researches these things because Larry and Sergey thought it was cool. Page has even claimed in the past Google was founded specifically to do AI research (which isn&#x27;t really right, but whatever).<p>What about SpaceX? Tesla? The Boring Company? Neuralink? These firms exist and do R&amp;D because Elon Musk is a futurist. He doesn&#x27;t do R&amp;D for economic reasons, let alone for regulatory reasons. He does it because he wants to invent the future.<p>But this type of personality is rare. Our society is not kind to futurists. It doesn&#x27;t really value them. They&#x27;re seen as strange or dangerous; the story of inventing new technologies is usually a story of being attacked on all sides, by journalists or politicians or regulators or all of them at once. That&#x27;s why most companies set up &quot;innovation teams&quot; - the exact opposite of the approach taken by the most innovative companies. They&#x27;re little silos where people are taken and put in a corner, then told &quot;go innovate&quot;. The non-technical CEO has no interest in the innovation team and likely never talks to them directly, let alone gives them direction or ideas. The team members know this and usually just mimic whatever trends they see around them (IoT, blockchain, AI, cloud, etc). Their projects are usually doomed from the start.<p>In the end, for research to be valued people with the power to deploy it must be excited by technology, not intimidated by it. And that isn&#x27;t most corporate or government leaders today."],"time":["2020-08-30 20:24:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidtgoldblatt"],"id":[24323899],"kids":[24324008,24324223],"parent":[24314448],"text":["Of particular interest is section 20.18 -- &quot;Mirroring memory operands&quot;; extending (something like) register renaming to memory."],"time":["2020-08-30 18:34:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["enchiridion"],"id":[24325105],"kids":{},"parent":[24314448],"text":["Can anyone comment on how secure this architecture is against speculative execution attacks vs. Intel?"],"time":["2020-08-30 21:10:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Reelin"],"id":[24328779],"kids":[24328975],"parent":[24314448],"text":["I have a (likely silly) question for anyone well versed in low level CPU stuff. §20.7 says there&#x27;s a stack engine that optimizes manipulation of the stack pointer.

Simply have four different menus with the same items and look at the analytics provided by point of sale system.

There are other considerations such a cost of product but most restaurants increase overall demand by using analytics from the point of sale system and the most profitable dishes are not always the most popular.

I specialize in dealing with legacy apps (diagnosing, refactoring, figuring out what to do that would salvage them). Let me share some tips from my experience that will really help you step up your game (real projects I have joined):<p>1. Don&#x27;t write it yourself. Your expertise is too precious for the company and you work in a high cost location which automatically makes you too expensive to actually code. Outsource it to some other team in a low cost location. Hire entire team for the purpose of the project, ensure they know most of them will be let go before the project end and ensure they have no vested interest in the success of the project. Provide as little actual guidance on how the problem is to be solved, only very general requirements. Let the team self-organize. Don&#x27;t supervise (your time too precious, remember?) and only ever involve in discussion about high-level architectural concepts. Expect the application to be delivered to PROD on time regardless of the state and the missing features to be substituted with workarounds.<p>2. Not happy with quality of the code? Start a rewrite without a good idea on why exactly you are doing the rewrite, what you want to achieve or how you are going to do it. Decide to slowly migrate functionality from the old service to the new one using strangler pattern. Don&#x27;t get buy in from your stakeholders. Annoy them with requests for more staff while delaying development of critical features and creating more and more incidents. Eventually put the migration on hold having multiple services with unclear boundaries, copies of functionality, nonexistent documentation and new development team because the old got fed up with your bullshit.<p>3. Accept government contract to move 10 messages from webservice to a mainframe. Ensure you need 5 different features when processing moving the data. Each of the features requires, of course, their own programming language, database technology and their own message format. Use 20M (yes, that&#x27;s twenty million) LoC. Yes, I have worked on a contract to add new functionality to something like that (10 messages with two dozen  fields to move from ASP.NET service to IBM mainframe. 20M lines of code.

With different exceptions leading to entirely different flows. On C you can use setjmp&#x2F;longjmp + globals for a similar effect. This will help the maintenance programmer develop thinking in multiple dimensions.<p>- To save space, do not declare separate constants for every magic number&#x2F;string. Instead use one large constant pooling all the constants, and then deduce the other constants from parts of the one large constant. You&#x27;ll be teaching the maintenance programmer an advanced optimization technique.<p>- Abuse localization rules whenever a case-insensitive operation is operated (e.g. Turkish i, German eszett, etc.). You&#x27;ll be broadening the mind of the maintenance programmer, teaching cultural differences.<p>For extra points, when dealing with fixed string constants in the code, abuse Unicode&#x27;s right-to-left rules to make the shown data rather different than the actual data the compiler sees, and zero width characters the make the shown length different than the actual length. This is particular useful with the &quot;one large constant technique&quot; from above.<p>- Do use locals when the locals shadow the global variable. This will teach the maintenance programmer to pay attention.<p>- Supply more precise overrides in files&#x2F;projects included in partial compilation as to make code that will behave differently depending on compilation order, included files&#x2F;projects, etc. This will help teach the importance of a build system.<p>Bonus points if the included code is actually similar, but relies on subtle differences in the behaviour of a previous version of the framework or included packages."],"time":["2020-08-31 02:14:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[24328724],"kids":{},"parent":[24325974],"text":["These seem to be the interesting previous threads—let me know if I missed one...<p>2018 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17781475\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17781475<\/a><p>2016 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12188236\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12188236<\/a><p>2016 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12165878\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12165878<\/a><p>2015 (different article, same title) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10237636\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10237636<\/a><p>2015 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9602743\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9602743<\/a><p>2013 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6849532\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6849532<\/a><p>2012 (a bit) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4717912\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4717912<\/a><p>2010 (a bit) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1573034\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1573034<\/a><p>2009 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=637491\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=637491<\/a><p>As for the year, 2003 is an upper bound given <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20030626161523&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindprod.com&#x2F;unmain.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20030626161523&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindpr...<\/a>.

One easy way of adding more of an end game now is to do something like factorio and make upgrading the keep really expensive - you could have a couple of more advanced upgrades that require a lot of gold and glass for example. This would make the player need to harvest the full map. (2) deleting roads got really slow on a full map. (3) I clicked on the menu screen by accident frequently, but clicking on the menu again doesn&#x27;t close it (you have to go to &quot;return to game&quot;). If you could make clicking on it again close that would be great. (4) the one thing that was a bit challenging is not knowing what my resource limits are. Adding resource limits as small text under the amount I have now would be really helpful.<p>As a future game design, it could be fun to add a public health element - homes can get the plague, and you have to build wells for clean water, morgues, parks, etc. If you build too dense, the plague spreads faster, but you also have a productive city. It would add a dynamic of having to carefully plan where you build roads and, as a result how dense you want your housing to be. A worksite could be plagued just like a house, and then wouldn&#x27;t produce resources.

Sixty thousand people lost their telephone service completely. During the nine long hours of frantic effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million telephone calls went uncompleted.<p>&gt; Losses of service, known as &quot;outages&quot; in the telco trade, are a known and accepted hazard of the telephone business. Hurricanes hit, and phone cables get snapped by the thousands. Earthquakes wrench through buried fiber-optic lines. Switching stations catch fire and burn to the ground. These things do happen. There are contingency plans for them, and decades of experience in dealing with them. But the Crash of January 15 was unprecedented.

But of course exactly the opposite is true: if you split your message and deliver it via multiple channels, any one of those channels can be taken offline and thus thwart message delivery.<p>* The real argument for multiple services seems to be based on an assumed threat model of an attacker who primarily relies on lawful intercept orders, <i>not<\/i> on technical capabilities (e.g., a warrant, not cryptanalysis). Adding multiple services may do little or nothing for the latter threat, since many messaging services rely on the same underlying protocols (e.g. the Signal Protocol) or the same crypto primitives. This is important for my next point:<p>* If the threat model is about lawful intercepts, and you actually trust modern crypto, this entire scheme makes no sense. Just share a public key for a common, well-vetted algorithm. Encrypting messages using an air-gapped device makes sense.<p>* Further, if we trust crypto, this scheme&#x27;s sole value is effectively in contact (or public key) discovery: assuming you can&#x27;t meet face-to-face, the point of this scheme is really to allow multiple services to help you discover a contact&#x27;s public key (assuming we replace the unnecessary OTP approach with public key exchanges). But many (most?) of these services rely on the telephone system for identity--so there&#x27;s still a fairly trivial single point of failure, commonly controlled by the government.<p>* To beat a dead horse: if we don&#x27;t trust modern crypto, it&#x27;s likely an adversary can access all components of the message+OTP anyway (even without lawful intercept capabilities), so this scheme adds no value.<p>Summary:<p>This proposal would benefit by a more clearly stated threat model.

I&#x27;ll try without giving too much away and taking away the potential enjoyment of someone who could read it in future.<p>So much of what we read, fact and fiction, stands on the foundation of an omniscient first- or third-person narrator. We do not even think of questioning what the narrator tells us. Even mystery or suspense stories only hide a secret with the protagonist &quot;peeling an onion&quot; to find answers progressively. Deceptive incidents, the doubts of the detective, inconsequential objects, descriptions of crime scenes serve to distract us and we know we are being distracted and it is part of the game.<p>But unreliable narrators are a different beast altogether. As the story progresses, there are hints of doubt created in our minds regarding description of events, feelings of characters, gaps in some story lines which we hope will be reconciled later (and which are). A great author can do this so subtly that if you do not follow along closely it is easy to miss or, worse, mistake this to be a problem with the author&#x27;s storytelling.<p>Fight Club is one such story. It is non-linear which serves to disorient the reader and at the end we realize the narrator was also unreliable. There are sentences like &quot;Today I almost ate Marla&#x27;s mother&quot; and we are left wondering what that means until a few paragraphs later it is revealed. The non-linearity masks the narrator&#x27;s reliability. The book is well-done even though the story-telling is . But you have to read An Artist of the Floating World to see what a master can do with ordinary events, conversations, descriptions of places by (someone who we will later in the story consider as) an unreliable narrator. Stories like these serve as a reminder that every one sees the world differently.

For example, I love the history of semiconductor development, but simultaneously, I also recognize that a large number of semiconductor fabs in the 1970s operated by Intel, AMD, Fairchild, HP, National, Commodore, etc, are now superfund sites. At many sites, cleanup works are still ongoing today. And usually it was not a result of malice, but inexperience - many operational and regulatory safeguards were simply not established - in fact, many leaks were only discovered decades later. I summarized some of these incidents in a HN commment at [0] if you are interested.<p>Following the same line of thought, I wonder how dangerous dust-scale computing is, biologically and environmentally. In general, there are a lot of ongoing research projects on the safety of nanomaterials, and have already showed the potential hazards cannot be ignored [1]. In the particular case, it appears to be just a relatively conventional MEMS chip that we are familiar with, not some radically new and different nanomaterials, so [1] doesn&#x27;t apply here, but the question of &quot;what will happen if these chips enter the environment (air, soil, water) and biosphere&quot; remains, especially if these are going to be used at an industrial scale, and will be intentionally introduced to the environment for remote sensing.

Prices and wages are extremely flexible in Albania; as a result, the government was able to cut real public sector wages substantially in 1997 (by leaving nominal wages unchanged), and the economy suffered no loss of competitiveness when the lek appreciated. The new government’s willingness to tackle the budget deficit and undertake long-overdue structural reforms was also crucial. However, the social effects were profound. In addition to the loss of life, thousands of people were impoverished either by their unwise investments in the pyramid schemes or by the destruction of their property in the ensuing violence. Less tangible, but also significant, are the effects on confidence in Albania. The resilience of the Albanian people is consider- able and has been more severely tested in the past.

Currently, CI&#x2F;CD + agile is (necessary?) overhead that costs us precious time-to-product.<p>Here is my manifesto:<p>1. Anything related to &quot;production&quot; should be taken care of by DevOps peeps, yes even if it is &quot;MLOps&quot;. Monitoring, standardization etc\nshould not be your responsibility. If it is somehow on you, then it should be part of the same experimentation platform you are using. Extra tools? Extra people.<p>2. Likewise, anything related to data-engineering, preparation etc. should be compartmentalized and have separate version control (it is not as complicated as doing it the DVC way, BTW). If you do have to do these tasks - you guessed it - it should be part of the same experimentation platform you are using.<p>3. Research MLOps (ResOps?): Did I say experimentation platform? Any team member should be able to work as she wishes -  Notebooks, scripts, whatnot. And if you forget to commit something before you run? You want to know about all the changes. Sharing? Comparing? - must have.  Reproducible experimentation? Need to be able to automatically track environment variables, packages installed etc. Most importantly - Need to be able to offload to the cluster in the same running environment with a button click. I am not going to spend hours deciphering logs to find out that the wrong version of package was installed in our container. I am not going to spend days sorting out containers to find &quot;the one that works&quot;<p>4. Lastly - IT work (&quot;devops&quot;) on cluster management: Monitoring your GPU usage per task, scheduling experiments, early stopping with a button click, on-prem managed platform - WHY IS THIS OUR JOB? - well, it isn&#x27;t. But if it is, it should be integrated with your platform, and day-to-day operations should be &quot;automagical&quot;, cluster config should be done once, by professionals (even outsourced help).<p>If you feel me here, then know that you are REALLY not alone.

We shipped <i>many<\/i> projects and it can be taxing to work on different stacks, especially given the fact that we built for enterprise and they always want <i>complete<\/i> solutions. The model is but a foot in the door, and you must do custom front-end&#x2F;back-end&#x2F;model&#x2F;pipe&#x2F;data acquisition.<p>We decided to build tooling around that workflow. We shipped and were paid with that workflow, so we wanted to make it efficient and effective. Other solutions didn&#x27;t fit our needs. Straight out of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;<\/a>, except it needs to address <i>our<\/i> use cases. We backtest with our past projects and use it for our current ones to scale our consulting capabilities.<p>&gt;<i>- standardizing end to end tooling for special resources, eg queueing and batching to keep utilization high for production GPU systems, high RAM use cases like approximate nearest neighbor indexes, and just run of the mill stuff like how to take a trained model and deploy it behind a microservice in a way that bakes in logging, tracing, alerting, and more.<\/i><p>We do schedule notebooks[1]. We also publish AppBooks[2], which are automatically parametrized notebooks: it automatically generates a form so anyone can set variables the notebook author&#x27;s chose to expose and run a notebook without changing the code. Extremely useful when you want to have a domain expert tweak a domain specific variable, without them having to know what a notebook is. In some projects, there&#x27;s someone with deep, deep expertise in a field for whom a variable is really important, but that variable gets dismissed by the ML practitioner because they didn&#x27;t see a correlation or an impact on AUC or something, so the domain expert has an input, whether on relevant variables, or the <i>real<\/i> world metrics we&#x27;re working for. We also added instrumentation for the basic CPU&#x2F;RAM&#x2F;GPU, data, servers running, etc. Again, so that our teammates don&#x27;t bother with this. We use different Docker images for notebook servers with some that are 30GB so members don&#x27;t bother with dependencies, GPU&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;cuda and version conflicts.<p>We automatically track metrics and parameters without the notebook&#x27;s author writing boilerplate code, because they forget. The models are saved, and the ML practitioner can click on a button to deploy a model[3]. We stressed a lot on self service because its absense put a lot of stress on us: an ML practitioner wants to deploy a model, asks someone in the team who&#x27;s probably busy. So we said: anyone should click and deploy. This is also useful because a developer downstream will only need to send in HTTP requests to interact with the model. We used to have application developers who also needed to know more than they should have on the internals&#x2F;dependencies of the models. Not anymore.<p>We also added near real-time collaboration&#x2F;editing so many people can work on the same notebook, especially useful when a team member is struggling to implement something, and others chime in to help debug&#x2F;refactor, and review[4]. Everyone sees everyone&#x27;s cursor for better awareness of what&#x27;s being done. A use case is an ML practitioner playing with a paper who&#x27;s struggling on the algorithms or data structures part of the paper. They can sollicit another team member who&#x27;ll chime in and help. One of the features that&#x27;s useful is the multiple checkpoints[5], which allows one to revert to an arbitrary checkpoint, not just the last one. This, again, is porcelain because an ML practitioner playing with git is a context switch, and they don&#x27;t really like it.<p>So, we&#x27;ve done a few things to make our life easier. The workflow isn&#x27;t perfect, and the tools aren&#x27;t perfect, but we&#x27;re removing friction.<p>We add applications for the usual timeseries forecasting, sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, churn, to leverage projects we did in the past.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;#deploying-a-model\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;#deploying-a-model<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#collaboration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#collaboration<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#multiple-checkpoints\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#multiple-checkpoints<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-30 21:08:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["whatsmyusername"],"id":[24324499],"kids":{},"parent":[24323778],"text":["Have you actually negotiated or engaged with the platform team?

Here is a link to ACM Digital Library (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3313831.3376585\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3313831.3376585<\/a>) and a PDF copy of the paper on my Box account (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmu.box.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;89iugeaf3hcc51ir9f4akrp1a9b0mogd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmu.box.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;89iugeaf3hcc51ir9f4akrp1a9b0mogd<\/a>).<p>One of the things we did was a survey of N=226 AirBnB users. 86 people said that they manually searched for devices in AirBnBs, and 8 actually found undisclosed devices. As you might imagine, manually searching is hard because devices are small, but also because you don&#x27;t always know if you&#x27;ve found everything, and because it looks socially awkward too.<p>People also reported on how they looked for devices, ranging from manual search (most common) to using WiFi &#x2F; Bluetooth scanning tools. Here is an excerpt from our paper as to what people said they did.<p><i>11 (13%) tech-savvy participants used special tools to help search, such as using a phone camera or flashlight, scanning Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi network, and using an infrared scanner. For example, participants reported that they turned off all the lights and used their smartphone flashlight to shine around the area and look for reflections that might indicate a camera lens. Some participants reported that their smartphone cameras did not have an infrared filter, and so they could detect invisible infrared light emitted by cameras. Other participants reported using smartphone apps, such as Fing and iNet, to detect suspicious devices connecting to the network. Two participants brought RF signal detectors to scan the room for the source of RF signals (cameras). However, these methods require a strong technical background, and the devices might not be cheap (e.g., over $100 USD on Amazon for a popular RF signal detector).<\/i><p>The main point of the paper, though, is to look at ways for IoT device manufacturers to help physically locate devices. We called these IoT Locators. An example might be to have devices blink or beep. It&#x27;s trying to address the physical layer of privacy, to help people have more awareness of what&#x27;s nearby and where these devices are. The logical layer might tell you that there&#x27;s a camera nearby, but we also wanted to help people find those devices and see (for example) where those cameras might be pointed. There&#x27;s a big difference between a camera in an AirBnb that is pointed toward the living room versus pointed out the window, something that isn&#x27;t captured just by knowing that a camera is nearby.<p>There&#x27;s lots of limitations, for example needing lots of standards among device manufacturers and how to incentivize them to install things like these in devices. I would say the main idea, though, is that we need to really think more about the physical dimensions of privacy (which has been underlooked in research and industry), and that we need to think more about how to help hotels, AirBnBs, and device manufacturers that do want to do better on privacy w.r.t devices, but don&#x27;t know what to do."],"time":["2020-08-30 21:00:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["filleokus"],"id":[24325409],"kids":[24325494],"parent":[24324300],"text":["How costly are these cameras?

I think these are decent call-outs from the point of the interviewer, so I&#x27;ll add a couple of my own from the point of a candidate:<p>1) not screening the company during the interview\n2) not preparing by doing &quot;warm-up&quot; interviews for roles you won&#x27;t be too sad about if you don&#x27;t get\n3) not doing enough interviews to get multiple offers for negotiating leverage<p>For my first point, you&#x27;ll learn a lot about the company and how they work from the interview process. If the company has dysfunctional elements to its corporate culture, depending on the size, it&#x27;s quite likely they&#x27;ll be surfaced here. Not only is this one of the first impressions of you for them, but it&#x27;s one of the first impressions of them for you. Pay attention to what your gut and intuition tell you here. Every time I&#x27;ve broken this rule, it&#x27;s bitten me.<p>For my second point, I think that people often forget that the only way to get better at interviewing is to just do it over and over again. It&#x27;s a little hard to do that in a synthetic environment because it&#x27;s hard to trick your brain into behaving as if it is real unless it actually is. But wait, you may say, treating an interview like practice is unethical! But I&#x27;d disagree. After all, if you really do well on the interview but you&#x27;re not chomping at the bit to join, they might be more willing to negotiate and make you an offer that would make you reconsider. But, you likely know (and can force-rank) the roles you&#x27;d be most willing and least willing to take if you had the opportunity, so make sure to go through the sequence from least desirable to most desirable so that you have more leverage.<p>My third point is probably the most crucial. You need the BATNA (best alternative to negotatiated agreement) of accepting something else or staying where you are to be able to negotiate. Otherwise, you have much less leverage. This is part of why timing and interviewing for less desirable roles is preferable, because you are more likely to negotiate with an offer for your more desirable role by the time you get there."],"time":["2020-08-30 18:22:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rsecora"],"id":[24324040],"kids":[24324212],"parent":[24323579],"text":["Another of the most common errors is to lie or to exaggerate in a side work experience.

I wanted to be (among many other things) an inventor when I was a kid and this gives me that feeling and (c) the pay&#x27;s not bad (even though I make a European dev salary, so the pay&#x27;s quite modest relative to some here - my perk is a far more relaxed work environment).<p>I got started by working in tech support (no real job requirements besides being vaguely &quot;good with computers&quot;) and then coding some tools that made my team more efficient. Then I told my managers that I could be a full-time force multiplier instead of a single-unit contributor (in other words, generating more value for the company) and they liked that idea and what I&#x27;d done so far so they helped me transition pretty quick. I continued working in support tools development for a couple of years and really enjoyed it.<p>There&#x27;s a footnote here that I moved from the US to Europe because labor laws are more relaxed here so I was able to code for work for free on my own time without there being an issue, which I needed in order to show what I could do for the company to get that initial foot in the door for the support tools dev position. In the US, they told me they couldn&#x27;t let me work for free (I suspect because of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but I never asked) so I requested and got a transfer.<p>Now I work on anti-cheat software for games. I angled for this because I wanted to get closer to security-related work without being exactly infosec, and there was a clear need for this at the company. It&#x27;s a little more vanilla than I was expecting, but I have a ton of autonomy and voice in guiding my team&#x27;s work, so I&#x27;m happy.<p>My advice for anyone interested in making software full-time is to start by doing whatever you can quickly get hired for. Then make software to make you better at doing that. Don&#x27;t wait for someone to give you permission, because they won&#x27;t (and this continues to be a rule even after you &quot;make it&quot; - continue jockeying for what you want and don&#x27;t wait for permission unless there&#x27;s no other way). If you show (with actual live code) that you&#x27;re a force multiplier at your company&#x27;s thing using code and they&#x27;re in a position to hire someone for that work, then make your case for why you&#x27;re that someone to whoever has the power to make it happen for you. It doesn&#x27;t even have to matter if they don&#x27;t hire SWEs. You can negotiate contract work if you have to. Everyone needs software even if they&#x27;re not a software shop themselves."],"time":["2020-08-30 23:36:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mke"],"id":[24326451],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["As someone self taught, let me cut to the chase and say your number one problem is proving yourself in the professional world the first time. My advise assumes you have <i>a different<\/i> degree and you have some CS skills. Assuming this, you have to knock on ~100+ doors until one opens. I’m not joking about ~100+ doors. You will be ignored, rejected and laughed at - repeatedly. You need to search exclusively in your local market with a local address on your resume. Don’t use the major bot controlled job sites - check prospective employer sites directly. Check for entry level positions - or even internships - that’s your best path. Manual QA tester. Project analyst. End user phone support. Third shift operations. I’m not joking: you have to prove it. Once a door opens, it may not be the title you want, it may not be the technology you want, it may not be the boss you want, it may not be the benefits you want, and it definitely won’t be the pay you want. It may be unpaid. Don’t negotiate. Your one and only criteria should be: will this role allow me to prove myself. Will this opportunity grant access to greater challenges, future roles, broader networks. If so, take it! Then work twice as hard as the next person and <i>prove it<\/i>!<p>My advice surely sounds cynical but remember the hiring pipeline is populated 98% by non-technical folks whose assessment of your skills relies exclusively on a degree. That’s the system.<p>tl;dr if you are self-taught, learning CS is actually the easy part.
