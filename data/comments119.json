Chloroquine has been used since 1949 for treating a range of diseases including malaria, and is therefore a well known drug which causes complication only in rare cases because its side effects and use are well known, it&#x27;s even given in prevention to healthy people travelling in certain parts of the world<p>2. Pr Raoult has demonstrated 13 years ago its effectiveness against coronaviruses<p>3. The current CV19 pandemic is killing people at an alarming rate<p>4. In Europe hospitals are stretched beyond capacity meaning more are dying for lack of space&#x2F;equipment&#x2F;attention&#x2F;treatment, and not because of CV19 itself<p>5. As a world renown specialist Pr Raoult has been in contact with doctors in China who were the first to use it to treat CV19 and observe its effectiveness in greatly reducing the viral load<p>6. As director of a research hospital Pr Raoul is on the front line for handling CV19 patients and is responsible for making life and death decisions not just for his own life but for all patients arriving in mass to his door<p>7. There is no other alternative treatment to date for CV19, some other drugs are promising but are either much newer and less known, or heavier on side effects and cost<p>Now take into account the above facts, imagine yourself in Pr Raoult shoes, and realise that withholding the use of chloroquine in such dire situation, where the luxury of a full study cannot be afforded and the drug is very well known, can be considered not only immoral but also criminal. In other words when the choice is either to let people die with a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude, or to save lives by significantly reducing the viral load and infection with a well known drug, the choice is clear. Another way to view the situation: you are a policeman stopping an ambulance not respecting the driving code and driving too fast, and then learn there is a dying patient in the back, what do you do?<p>Also Pr Raoult does not claim he has done a full study. Those that get finicky and still want to have a full study before allowing its use are irresponsible people who have no idea of what&#x27;s it&#x27;s like on the ground. Those that criticise him as a lone advocate are really out of touch with reality: he is definitely not alone, he&#x27;s got 200 staff under his responsibility, 80 of which are researchers, he has been on the forefront of his field worldwide (see his wikipedia page), knows very well how to perform perfect academic studies, and is and has been constantly talking with specialists and doctors around the world since the earliest time of the pandemic."],"time":["2020-03-28 09:17:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chkaloon"],"id":[22709477],"kids":{},"parent":[22709227],"text":["Based on hospitalization rates of 7.5%-10%.

Parametric polymorphism is the default, too, so it also shepherds you into writing general purpose code. Haskell is full of these little decisions where it just won&#x27;t let you do something because it&#x27;s not &quot;correct&quot; code, and they kind of don&#x27;t care if that makes coding in it a fight against the compiler.<p>Rust took that philosophy and applied it pointers.

Haskell has a philosophy of &quot;make invalid code unrepresentable.&quot; The concept of a value being in a box, rather than null being a possible value makes it impossible to use that value without getting it out.<p>People who write Go love that concurrency is easy and Go fmt has enforced a single canonical style.

The data at the origin of this hypothesis are contradictory and mainly associative in nature, without it being possible to demonstrate a causal link. Interest in this theory has been renewed, however, by several recently published observations. In the section Viewpoint de la revue Nature Reviews Neurology, Ben Readhead, a researcher at the Biodesign Institute&#x27;s ASU-Banner Center for Research on Neurodegenerative Diseases, joined several distinguished colleagues to discuss the idea that bacteria, viruses or other infectious pathogens can play a role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.<p>First, it has been shown that the amyloid ß can act as an antimicrobial peptide and that selected microorganisms can seed the deposition of Aß in mouse models.<p>Second, genetic data has rekindled interest in the role of herpesviruses, in particular the human Herpes 6 virus (HHV6), in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.<p>Third, the epidemiological data from Taiwan suggests that antiherpetic drugs reduce the risk of dementia.<p>Preclinical data have indicated that microorganisms associated with periodontal disease may contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.<p>Finally, genetic, pathological and modeling studies of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have shown that the immune system plays an important role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.<p>A hypothesis that has never been favored by researchers\nThis hypothesis may have been rejected too quickly. For example, microorganisms do not only cause acute illnesses, in fact certain microorganisms can hide in the body for decades in latent form, causing damage intermittently or after long periods of silence.<p>In addition, being infected does not necessarily mean being symptomatic. For example, out of the millions of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, only about a tenth of them will develop tuberculosis. Likewise, most people infected with HSV1 do not develop cold sores so it is possible that asymptomatic carriers of this virus were often mistakenly included in the control groups. It should also be noted that many viruses of the Herpes family (HSV1, HSV2, VZV) live preferentially in neurons.<p>A role for an infectious agent - in particular the herpes simplex 1 virus (HSV1) - in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) was proposed about 30 years ago based discovery of HSV1 DNA in the brain tissue of a large proportion of the elderly, followed by evidence that e the virus confers a high risk of disease to carriers of the e4 allele of the gene apolipoprotein E (APOE * e4).<p>Shortly after the detection of HSV1 DNA, two different species of bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi and Chlamydia pneumoniae, were implicated in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and a third species, Porphyromonas gingivalis, was recently added to the list.<p>Doubts remain, however\nNevertheless, it is known that an acute end-of-life infection, such as pneumonia, can cause a dramatic increase in the amount of microorganisms in the brain. They will then be detected post-mortem but that does not mean that these microorganisms are at the origin of the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In addition, the issue of reverse causation is never really addressed: For example, clinical Alzheimer&#x27;s disease can lead to poor dental hygiene and, therefore, damage to the oral microbiome.<p>Indeed, there are many challenges to prove the theory of microbial origin of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A potential challenge is that each drug has a relatively narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity. However, since a large number of microorganisms have been associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease by a range of researchers, it would be difficult to interpret what a negative result in a clinical trial would mean, which would necessarily use a specific antimicrobial.<p>Another problem is the duration of the disease. We know that the underlying pathology of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease begins 20 years or more before the onset of symptoms. So, how to prove that an infectious process that occurred decades before the onset of symptoms, really contributed to the disease process?<p>One may also wonder why bacteria or viruses would escape the innate innate immune defense mechanisms, which are responsible for protecting the brain against such an invasion."],"time":["2020-03-27 22:06:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["litoE"],"id":[22707880],"kids":[22708307,22708600],"parent":[22705268],"text":["&gt; Preclinical data have indicated that microorganisms associated with periodontal disease may contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.<p>That shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to test: is the proportion of dentists and dental hygienists with Alzheimer&#x27;s significantly different from the general population?

It is NOT a ad-click-maximizing dopamine slot-machine like FB. When networks go down that path, i think they stop being communities altogether and become something more like TV.<p>4. It is more resistant to group think than e.g Reddit subs like &#x2F;r&#x2F;investing because it has a broader scope I think.. networks with a overly narrow focuses inevitably become echo-chambers the network converges on a consensus view.

I&#x27;ve seen it change a lot. Before then, I was a regular on Slashdot, on IRC, on various phpBB boards, and, before that, dial-up BBSs. I&#x27;ve got a fairly healthy offline life too and have been a part of climbing communities, business communities, and outdoor communities, and have had organizational roles in some of those. So my opinions aren&#x27;t worth more than anyone else&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time developing them nonetheless.<p>Whether a community, online or not, is &quot;healthy&quot;, or not, is largely a matter of perspective. You&#x27;ll see a lot of people say some community isn&#x27;t healthy, and then a lot of people say the same community is healthy for the same reasons that other people find it unhealthy. The only metric that makes sense to me is whether the community helps me to be a happier or better person. A community might have a lot of faults, but if the overall impact of the community on me is a positive one, then it&#x27;s healthy -- for me.<p>So from that standpoint, HN has been good to me. I learn a lot from it, it helps me stay sharp in my part of the industry, it challenges me to learn new things all the time. Some of the stuff I&#x27;ve learned here, I&#x27;ve gone on to teach others (as faithfully as I could) or just shown other people how to find it here on their own.<p>There are a lot of smart people here and a lot of interesting content on all kinds of subjects. Sometimes a subject matter expert shows up to point out everything that&#x27;s wrong with some content that I thought I was learning something from; from their perspective, that content made HN a little bit worse, but from my perspective, that content led to their participation and together that made HN a little bit better.<p>Sure, there are some &quot;personalities&quot; on here that some people disagree with from time to time, or maybe that a lot of people disagree with often. Well, those people are in every community and I don&#x27;t think HN would be more healthy without them. They could, maybe, benefit from a little more humility, but so could I.<p>I&#x27;m a bit mercurial and I&#x27;m passionate about some topics, especially those involving the health and welfare of the people around me. And, honestly, I&#x27;m just a bit of a jerk sometimes, a fault that I developed young and something I have to work on every day. That&#x27;s made me an &quot;unhealthy&quot; part of HN from time to time. It&#x27;s also my humanity, though, and I don&#x27;t think that the things I&#x27;ve written in a dispassionate voice have necessarily been better, or more impactful, or even received better, than the things I write passionately. But, I don&#x27;t want to become a part of the problem, so mostly I try to be quiet and let the smarter people lead the discussion.<p>One of the healthiest parts of HN is Dan Gackle (~dang). Okay, so some of this might be interpreted as boot-licking, so you&#x27;ll have to trust me when I say that nobody&#x27;s ever accused me of loving authority. I have never, in any of my communities, online or offline, seen a more even-handed, fair-minded, or restrained person in a moderator role. There have been some articles written about his work here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;the-beleaguered-moderators-who-keep-hacker-news-focused-on-intellectual-curiosity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;the-beleaguered-moderators-who-keep-h...<\/a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;letter-from-silicon-valley&#x2F;the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;letter-from-silicon-valley&#x2F;th...<\/a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;858124&#x2F;why-y-combinators-hacker-news-silicon-valleys-premier-news-source-is-halting-all-political-debate-for-a-week&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;858124&#x2F;why-y-combinators-hacker-news-silicon-...<\/a>). I keep hanging around here in part because he and the other moderators here do such a great job overall. So, anybody ever wants to get rid of me, there ya go.<p>Their positions necessarily mean that they&#x27;re going to piss somebody off now and again. They have the unenviable task of often asking people not to talk -- well, argue -- about the subjects they most want to talk or argue about. I&#x27;m amazed at how many people though instead say something like, &quot;You&#x27;re right, I was out of line, sorry.&quot; I wish this was a skill they could teach, I&#x27;d sign up for that class without a second thought.<p>I do wish we had a little more balance here. We need more outspoken women here for instance. I appreciated ~jl&#x27;s presence here and a few others early on and was hopeful there would be more. We need to hear more from people who are experiencing the industry, or life, in a different way from the rest of us.<p>I wish also that there were more opportunities for people here to be, well, a little more &quot;human&quot;, I guess. HN&#x27;s nature leads it to sort of discourage humanity in the discussions. You have to make an effort to get to know anyone here, and mostly that happens outside of HN, in email or elsewhere. So to that extent, HN often feels less like a real community to me. I knew much more about the people in my old IRC communities.<p>The only other weakness I think HN has is the really short-lived nature of its discussions. In the past, online communities all had software that would allow discussions to continue for a little while, so if you read something interesting and wanted to say something interesting about it, but needed time to compose it or maybe do a little research before saying anything, that was fine. You could take a little bit of time to write something better, and people would still read it. On HN, once something isn&#x27;t on the front page anymore, nobody reads it. If something is on the front page for a long time, then it usually gets so many comments that there&#x27;s no point adding to them, because nobody will navigate through hundreds of other comments to find the new thing you wrote, even if it&#x27;s good. And if something&#x27;s on the front page for a short time, you have to rush to add to the discussion before it disappears forever. It&#x27;s a bit like the whole forum is always doing a bit of methamphetamine, and that&#x27;s not great.<p>I never know what to put in the last line of comments like these."],"time":["2020-03-27 19:07:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rkangel"],"id":[22704804],"kids":{},"parent":[22704051],"text":["All judges of health are subjective obviously, and while HN has flaws I would judge it to be, yes.<p>The main thing I would point to justify that it is healthy is that the vast majority of the comments are informed, well written and productive.

As such, it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect the same sense of community here as you would with a smaller social group.<p>Last I heard, HN gets about 5 million unique visitors a month. The human brain can cope effectively with a community of around 150 members.<p>For a time, I was the lead mod for The TAG Project. Prior to my arrival, the founder had done some good internal research on her group of online communities (a set of email lists) and found that 20 percent of members were regular and active, another 10 percent posted once or occasionally and the rest were lurkers.<p>This seems to be roughly true for other communities I have participated in elsewhere.<p>If you do the math, that means you will have about 150 active members posting regularly when you get to about 750 members. In my experience, once you get to about 750 or 800 members, you start seeing splinter groups form and you start getting new things budding out of that.<p>Other small email lists began to spin off of one of those email lists once it got big enough.<p>So if you want a strong sense of community, you are talking about a small town atmosphere where you have about 150 active members and some number of lurkers.<p>I have passingly thought that the leader board of HN should maybe be 150 names long instead of 100 to help foster some sense of community -- to help foster that same pattern of &quot;there are 150 people whom we all know and can follow all the relationships and so forth&quot; that you get with a smaller online community.
