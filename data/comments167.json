To clarify, I don&#x27;t mean anyone is lying or selling snake oil - what I mean by bullshit is that the vast majority of these services are cooked up by software developers without any background in mathematics, selling adtechy services in domains like product recommendation and sentiment analysis. They are single discipline applications accessable to devs without science backgrounds and do not rely on substantial expertise from other fields. That makes them narrow in technical scope and easy to rip off (hence no moat, lots of competition, and human reliance and lack of actual software).<p>The next generation of Machine Learning is just emerging, and looks nothing like this. Funds are being raised, patents are being filed, and everything is in early stage development, so you probably haven&#x27;t heard much yet - but these ML startups are going after real problems in industry: cross disciplinary applications leveraging the power of heuristic learning to make cross disciplinary designs and decisions currently still limited to the human domain.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the kind of heuristics which currently exist only as human intuition expressed most compactly as concept graphs and, especially, mathematical relationships - e.g. component design with stress and materials constraints, geologic model building, treatment recommendation from a corpus of patient data, etc. ML solutions for problems like these cannot be developed without an intimate understanding of the problem domain. This is a generalist&#x27;s game. I predict that the most successful ML engineers of the next decade will be those with hard STEM backgrounds, MS and PhD level, who have transitioned to ML. [Un]Fortunately for us, the current buzzwordy types of ML services give the rest of us a bad name, but looking at <i>these<\/i> upcoming applications the answers to the article tl;dr look different:<p>&gt;Deep learning costs a lot in compute, for marginal payoffs<p>The payoffs here are far greater. Designs are in the pipeline which augment industry roles - accelerate design by replacing finite methods with vastly quicker ML for unprecedented iteration. Produce meaningful suggestions during the development of 3D designs. Fetch related technical documents in real time by scanning the progressive design as the engineer works, parsing and probabilistically suggesting alternative paths to research progression. Think Bonzi Buddy on steroids...this is a place for recurring software licenses, not SaaS.<p>&gt;Machine learning startups generally have no moat or meaningful special sauce<p>For solving specific, technical problems, neural network design requires a certain degree of intuition with respect to the flow of information through the network, which both optimizes and limits the kind of patterns that a given net can learn. Thus designing NN for hard-industry applications is predicated upon an intimate understanding of domain knowledge, and these highly specialized neural nets become patentable secret sauces. That&#x27;s half of the most - the other comes from competition for the software developers with first-hand experience in these fields, or a general enough math heavy background to capture the relationships that are being distilled into nets.<p>&gt;Machine learning startups are mostly services businesses, not software businesses<p>Again only true because most current applications are NLP adtechy bullshit. Imagine coding in an IDE powered by an AI (multiple interacting neural nets) which guides the structure of your code at a high level and flags bugs as you write. This, at a more practical level, is the type of software that will eventually change every technical discipline, and you can sell licenses!<p>&gt;Machine learning will be most productive inside large organizations that have data and process inefficiencies<p>This next generation goes far past simply optimizing production lines or counting missed pennies or extracting a couple extra percent of value from analytics data.

But McIlroy, as the inventor of Unix pipes and a representative of the Unix philosophy (at that time not well-known outside the few Unix strongholds: Bell Labs, Berkeley, etc), decided to point out (in addition to a good review of the program itself) the Unix idea that such special-purpose programs shouldn&#x27;t be written in the first place; instead one must first accumulate a bunch of useful programs (such as those provided by Unix), with ways of composing them (such as Unix pipes). A while later, John Gilbert described this episode this way:<p>&gt; <i>Architecture may be a better metaphor than writing for an endeavor that closely mixes art, science, craft, and engineering. “Put up a house on a creek near a waterfall,” we say, and look at what each artisan does: The artist, Frank Lloyd Wright (or Don Knuth), designs Fallingwater, a building beautiful within its setting, comfortable as a dwelling, audacious in technique, and masterful in execution.

However it resonates because it fits well with an ongoing dynamic.  Which is that programmers naturally want to build perfect tools while the business need tends to be for a quick and dirty solution that can be assembled out of prebuilt pieces.<p>Except that this one is extreme.  It is hard to find any programmer who builds a more perfect tool than Knuth.  There isn&#x27;t a better known problem where the discrepancy between the perfect and the good is this dramatic.  Therefore this became the poster child for this ongoing type of conflict retold by those who see themselves as on the side of the quick and dirty solution built out of preassembled pieces.  Who, of course, slant the story to further fit their prejudices.<p>This kind of slanting is common.  Take a famous WW II example where they were looking to improve bomber durability by putting more armor plate where the bombers were coming back hit.  A wise statistician advised them that those were the spots that didn&#x27;t need armor, they should put it on where the bombers were hit and <i>didn&#x27;t<\/i> come back.

But the retelling of the story almost never admits that the advice didn&#x27;t really make a difference.  The actual solution to the rate at which bombers were being destroyed was to drop chaff - strips of aluminum cut to half the length of the German radar - so that the radar systems got overwhelmed and the Germans couldn&#x27;t find the bombers."],"time":["2020-02-24 18:57:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bonyt"],"id":[22406365],"kids":[22406446,22408357],"parent":[22406070],"text":["Site is down, but it looks like archive.org got it.[1] But the entire page is blank, because javascript.

In the second language, most of the value of writing documented and well-structured code is so that it takes you 30 minutes when someone asks you to modify it.

Liang&#x27;s hash trie), but noted that more practical, much faster to implement, debug and modify solution of the problem takes only six lines of shell script by reusing standard Unix utilities. McIlroy concluded:\n&gt;&gt;Knuth has shown us here how to program intelligibly, but not wisely. I buy the discipline. I do not buy the result.

Paypal --- a big company for sure, with a large and talented application security team --- is not interested in stiffing researchers out of bounties. They have literally no incentive to do so. In fact: the people tasked with running the bounty probably have the opposite incentive: the program looks better when it is paying out bounties for strong findings.<p>Here are the vulnerabilities in their report:<p>1. They can suppress a new-computer login challenge (they call this &quot;2FA&quot;, but this is a risk-based login or anti-ATO feature, not 2FA).<p>2. They can register accounts for one phone, then change it to another phone, to &quot;bypass&quot; phone number confirmation.<p>3. There are risk-based controls in Paypal that prevent transactions when anomalies are detected, and some of them can apparently be defeated with brute force.<p>4. They can change names on accounts they control.<p>5. They found what appears to be self-XSS in a support chat system.<p>6. They found what appears to be self-XSS in the security questions challenge inputs.<p>None of these are sev:hi vulnerabilities, let alone &quot;critical&quot;. 2 of them --- #4 and #6 --- are duplicates of other people&#x27;s issues. Self-XSS vulnerabilities are often excluded entirely from bounty programs.<p>For the last 3 hours, the top comment on this thread has been an analysis saying that, because Paypal is PCI-encumbered, and HackerOne reports can function as &quot;assessments&quot; for PCI attestations, Paypal is in danger of losing its PCI status (and the fact that it won&#x27;t is evidence that they are &quot;too big to fail&quot;). To put it gently: that is not how any of this stuff works. In reality, formal bug bounty programs are a firehose of reports suggesting that DKIM configuration quirks are critical vulnerabilities, and nobody in the world would expect any kind of regulatory outcome simply from the way a bounty report does or doesn&#x27;t get handled. It should, I hope, go without saying that nobody is required to run a bounty in the first place, and most companies probably shouldn&#x27;t.<p>The login challenge bypass finding was actually interesting (it would be more interesting if they fully disclosed what it was and what Paypal&#x27;s response was). But these reporters have crudded up their story with standard bug-bounty-reporter hype, and made it very difficult to judge what they found.

I have a medical exemption because for anxiety. Trust me, I know just as much as any candidate how stressful it is to be in that room.<p>3. I interviewed candidates for software engineering jobs.<p>4. I was an intern 8 years ago and 7 years ago, then flipped to full time 6 years ago.<p>5. I _do not believe I would pass the interview process cold_. As an intern, I got to use feedback from my internships to count for half of the interviews I would normally need to take. This was clutch: I&#x27;m good as a software engineer but would tank most Google interviews. I studied hard and I took mock interviews with my team while I was an intern. I knew my way around the campus and the rooms weren&#x27;t alien to me, so I felt more comfortable.<p>6. None of this is meant to be a defense or repudiation of the OP&#x27;s experience, nor is it meant to be a defense of Google or Google&#x27;s hiring process. It&#x27;s just meant to offer my explanation of why things are they way they are (other people may have difference perceptions of course).<p>With all that out of the way...<p>I&#x27;ve never met anyone at Google who is under any illusion that the hiring process is where the company would want it to be if anyone in the process could wave a magic wand. Even 8 years ago this was true. From the outside looking in, the process is byzantine and the experience of the OP is not as uncommon as one would hope.<p>The only way to make sense of it in your mind is to pretend to be on the inside looking out. Think of the interviewing process as a result of a set of constraints:<p>* Constraint 1: Google skews very heavily for no false positives, thus increasing the number of false negatives.<p>* Constraint 2: Google wants to hire as many people as it can that meet the bar in order to grow the way it wants, and it gets an enormous number of applications each year. But &quot;Google&quot; the company still grounds out to actual people running the show, and juggling this enormous candidate load is unenviable at best.<p>* Constraint 3: Because of how many people are being interviewed and the high bar, each interviewer somehow need to judge a candidate&#x27;s quality within just one hour. This leads interviewers to ask hard&#x2F;really hard questions about things you likely won&#x27;t ever code but candidates who did good in school (or were good at studying for the interview) would have a shot at. I would never do this as I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good signal at all; I would always ask questions that were basically about standard coding. I&#x27;d even print out a sheet of code that worked but had a number of code health failures and would ask candidates to do a code review of it.<p>Google has two main goals:<p>1. Hire the right people.<p>2. Knowing that the false negative rate is so high, make sure the process is pleasant enough that candidates will come back again.<p>I think 1 is doing pretty well, 2 is not, and 2 is not because it&#x27;s buckling under the constraints. I would always try to help on a micro-level by doing things like checking if the candidate needed water, food, bathroom, testing out the whiteboard pens and replacing the bad ones (if I was nervous and I found my pen wasn&#x27;t working straight off, I&#x27;d be thrown for a total loop), giving them 5 minutes to recenter themselves quietly, whatever. But those micro-level interactions don&#x27;t help the macro-level experience.<p>You can imagine many ways of interviewing that would be better if you didn&#x27;t have those constraints. If I was CEO of a startup, candidates who passed basic screening would be given access to the code base and asked to work for a day or two on an open bug. That would give you signal on their coding ability, ability to see through the ambiguity in the bug, work through an alien code base etc. etc. It would be great. It isn&#x27;t possible here because there&#x27;s so many candidates to work through.<p>There have been multiple initiatives over the years to try and make the process better, each one small nudges rather than global overhauls to avoid rocking the boat too much. After all, the process does kind of work: I work with smart people who I like being around and have done across all the teams I&#x27;ve been on, so something is working in the results. I think interviewees can now use a laptop for writing code in a room, for example (don&#x27;t quote me on it, I stopped interviewing before that).<p>So, that&#x27;s that.

Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>163 pg PDF [last updated: February|21|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

You don&#x27;t want to hire cheap devs because they usually suck, and great developers will cost you quite a bit regardless of where they live.<p>While it may be difficult to compete with the huge corporations in places like SF, NYC, Seattle, where these competing corporations offer huge salaries, great benefits and have brand recognition, there&#x27;s quite a lot of value to be had with setting up shop somewhere remote, where there&#x27;s lower competition and where you can offer above average salaries to attract top talent in the area. Ultimately, every company says that they only hire the best, but unless you&#x27;re paying top dollar in your area, you&#x27;re most likely not hiring only the best.<p>I believe that most good developers will want to be part of a stable company that is actually building amazing things, instead of being part of an outsourcing company where they get passed around from project to project, and their resume will perpetually read &quot;Software Engineer at Outsourcing Company Ltd.&quot; - most would trade that in a heartbeat for one of the FAANG companies.<p>If you want to have the best kind of success with remote devs, don&#x27;t outsource, invest a bit more and set up an actual office and hire the people directly, people that want to have a career with your company, and not a contract for an unknown period of time, which they likely won&#x27;t be able to put on their resume."],"time":["2020-02-24 21:56:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shruubi"],"id":[22409114],"kids":[22412291],"parent":[22406359],"text":["I just came out of being forced into running an offshore team from the Phillipines for roughly six-ish months, my experience was that they were very affable with good english skills and worked hard, there was a noticeable problem with technical skill which caused a number of bugs to occur to the point where I would just spend the time fixing them myself than throw them back at the team where they would cause more problems.<p>The biggest problem however, was that no matter how many times I asked or provided documentation&#x2F;feedback, they would ignore established coding standards and established processes and just do things their way, and when I would ask about this, I would just get shrugs.<p>Finally, we got saddled with a &quot;Project Manager&quot;, which I put in quotes as their contribution to the process was giving daily excuses as to not turn up to our daily progress calls, and the ones he did turn up to, he would visibly fall asleep.

Let me explain why.<p>Dating markets are lemon markets. The classical example of a lemon market was the used car market - most people who bought &quot;lemons&quot; (unreliable cars) would exploit information asymmetry and sell them on the used market, and over time the reputation of the used car market deteriorated to the point where it was affecting the value of new cars. The car manufacturers solved the problem by introducing gatekeepers - certified used car programs, that certified that the cars weren&#x27;t lemons.<p>So who are the &quot;lemons&quot; on dating markets, which bring down the reputation of dating markets for the rest of the players? People who aren&#x27;t in an emotionally healthy place to make commitments; people who are &quot;players&quot;; people who are violent; etc. It is our experience dealing with the lemons who stay on the dating market that ruins the reputation of the entire dating market and makes dealing with the market difficult.<p>So the solution is to introduce a gatekeeper. What does a gatekeeper look like? A clinically trained psychologist-cum-matchmaker (pun not intended) who can certify that the matches you are set up with are people with a track record of dealing honestly (for your personal definition of honest) in the dating market. Don&#x27;t like your gatekeeper? Pick a different one.<p>So far as I can tell, healthy dating markets are limited to scale by the need to hire such competent human gatekeepers.

Therefore, a dating site should be a platform with highly varied filtering solutions.<p>Create a broad, uniform spec for dating profile content (bio, interests, etc), and a great UX for populating it. And then open it up as a platform. Restrict nothing. Want to filter by height? weight? race? Have at it. Give users a few basic, somewhat customizable frames for searching and filtering the userbase.<p>But search filters are like microapps &#x2F; facebook games: developers can build their own search plugins, so one global userbase can serve as content for a million different kinds of dating apps. Hikers, metalheads, people who are afraid to eat fruit, whatever.<p>Queries cost money (perhaps as low as a fraction of a penny), and the first message from each party costs a bit more (but still trivially cheap, probably sub $1). There&#x27;s a base monthly cost like $5. If you don&#x27;t use your whole budget, credits roll over. If you overspend, you get charged pro-rata. A portion of these fees go to developers to incentivize building useful applications. There is no free plan.<p>There are interesting things to be done with rate-limiting&#x2F;sliding scale pricing.

I was told by the 30 something women in the group the only thing important is the person&#x27;s face. Nothing else matters on a dating site.<p>Of course that&#x27;s only a few data points (small meetup) but was very frustrating to hear and if true then all this is pointless. It&#x27;s certainly not true for me personally though.<p>Random thoughts<p>* video: In the 80s there was video dating. You&#x27;d go into the dating service office, look through notebooks of profiles, then ask for the videos of the people you were interested in. Is that just not possible anymore? I get that people were shy of the internet before but in 2020 with Instagram and TikTok are videos not viable?<p>* AI video interviewer: could you make some interview system where a selection of pre-recorded videos of an interviewer asking questions asks you interview questions so you actually get a reasonable interview out of the user? (vs just having a &quot;record button&quot; and leaving it entirely up to the user)<p>* Encouraging better profiles: Similar to the AI video interviewer, how can you encourage users to create an interesting profile? I have no idea for the men but for women, making these numbers up but it feels like 30% write nothing. They just put their picture (Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, CoffeeMeetsBagel). 65% write something so generic as to have no value like &quot;I do yoga, like travel and eating out, dancing, and movies&quot;. I have no idea how to fix this. One is use TalkToTransformer.com to make up a random profile and tell them to fix it or else. another might be text-to-speech from the AI video bot (yes I know that&#x27;s not likely to work). I also know most people or at least some large percent of women don&#x27;t want to put in the time to fill out a profile. They just want to sign up and look around. Maybe their profile should stay private until they&#x27;ve added enough content. Maybe some deep learning could rate how unique their profile is and they stay private below some threshold or tell them it sucks and they aren&#x27;t going to get any good matches unless the level it up with lots of suggestions.<p>* Better Interests: One service (probably patented) lets users create public interest groups. An interest group = name of group and single photo (icon). Example of groups &quot;Raspberry PI Lover&quot;, &quot;Fan of George Clooney&quot;, &quot;Chocolate is the 5th food Group&quot;, &quot;Seeking Soulmate&quot;, &quot;Dad jokes are hilarious&quot;, &quot;Zelda Love&quot;, &quot;Dogs &gt; Cats&quot;, ... The plus is a user can just select 5 to 500 of these interests which many find easier than writing a profile. So, on the user&#x27;s profile a list of these icons show up. Clicking an icon also shows all the other profiles that added that interest. Most dating sites have a boring and useless set of 10 to 50 categories. The user created ones are much better at helping find people with similar interests. I suspect this feature would need serious moderation though so people don&#x27;t make trolling or rude interests.<p>* separating services into DTF, LTR, etc...: Right now it feels like on all the major systems everyone is mixed together, both the people that just want something for tonight and the people looking for a soulmate. The mix doesn&#x27;t work IMO because the DTF men disgust the LTR women and so the LTR women leave. How to fix that I have no idea. One idea is if you&#x27;re on the LTR site and someone asks DTF you can flag them and get them moved to the DTF site (with enough flags and&#x2F;or moderation).<p>* better activities: There was a service &quot;How about we...&quot; were your profile was just suggestions of activities &quot;How about we go to disco bowling together&quot;. &quot;How about we try stinky tofu&quot;... etc. How can that be expanded? Partner with AirBnB experiences to sign people up to local event? Partner with entertainment venues for live performances? There&#x27;s a service called &quot;Dine&quot; which was supposed to be &quot;pick a restaurant, one of 3, from a person&#x27;s profile, which then automatically sends them a message, so-and-so would like to take to you (name of restaurant), choose a time...&quot;  In my experience the site lacked any women even close to my age but it did seem like you could charge a premium and potentially partner with restaurants to try to making actually meeting in person in a safe venue as frictionless as possible.<p>* group activities? I know match.com had their stir.com initiative. I don&#x27;t know if it went anywhere. I tried a couple of events. Too few people. Not good matches (odds of matches low). Still many people say they really only have had relationships with people they&#x27;ve known for a while so how do take that feedback into account?<p>* How to get people to pay and take it serious and still get users. Most of the dating services are free or free for women. This fills the site with non-serious people which is not actually helpful for those that actually want to meet someone. On the other hand any paywall = no users? Although I know that&#x27;s not always true.

You can be so intrinsically motivated that you never really encounter this problem in the first place (1). You can play psychological games to try and make it harder to lose interest (2, 3, 4, 8, 9). You can alter the workload in a way that makes it more interesting, but may cause quality to suffer (5, some 7, 10, 11, 12).

It sounds really interesting, but the image next to it just looks like what you&#x27;d get in Go (except for nullability checks), C#, Kotlin, and many other languages.  Yes, static typing (especially with nullability checks) can make life difficult.  You have to make create-request objects that don&#x27;t have an id in them or you have to make the id nullable.  Responses might include different fields like an updatedAt.  How do you convert between those types without requiring lots of boilerplate conversion code that you&#x27;re likely to mess up.  But it doesn&#x27;t really say what it&#x27;s solving.  The saying about being liberal in what you accept and strict in what you send is nice, but doesn&#x27;t tell me anything.  <i>How<\/i> does it achieve that without lots of code and checking?

Claims are easy, but for many of these problems there&#x27;s a reason why someone else hasn&#x27;t solved them.  Maybe you have figured out a better way, but the site hasn&#x27;t said what that better way is.  The example image for &quot;Structural, Open-by-Default Typing&quot; doesn&#x27;t look different from a Kotlin data class: it has statically typed fields, some are nullable.

Like, how do you abstract away the fact that the network is unreliable?  The quick tour shows a client requesting from an API, but the only thing I see is a `check` keyword which is similar to the `?` operator in Rust which just returns the error if there is one and unwraps the result if it succeeded.  It&#x27;s a short-cut over Go&#x27;s `if err != nil` and more explicit than runtime exceptions, but it hasn&#x27;t shown me how it&#x27;s different from other languages.<p>I guess I just need to know how someone solved a problem if they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;ve solved it.

Is the advice perfect? No, but it will probably bring some new perspective to some problems you&#x27;ll have along the way. There is no one size fits all management strategy that works in every situation, but every manager should be aware of the common pitfalls on the growth path of engineering managers.<p>In my personal experience as an engineering manager and in mentoring new engineering managers, this is the tipping point where managers either succeed or spiral into burnout:<p>&gt; I found myself and our product manager becoming the bottleneck in planning out who will work on what project, next, and who will be the lead.<p>If you find yourself bottlenecking the team, you&#x27;re either micromanaging or your team has grown too large for a single level of management. You need to take the time to develop a new system that removes you as the bottleneck. Don&#x27;t try to push through the issue by putting in more hours. That&#x27;s not sustainable. Find a new system.<p>The &quot;everyone is a leader&quot; strategy described in this article is a good perspective on what every manager should be doing: Clearly defining ownership boundaries and expectations, while avoiding micromanagement. It&#x27;s a common mistake to assume that because the manager is responsible for the success and failure of a project, the manager should also micromanage the critical decision making. That&#x27;s the first trait that needs to be trained out of almost every engineer promoted to manager in my experience.<p>Some engineers instinctively reject anything that feels like a management responsibility. Others will demand promotions or raises for taking on basic ownership tasks. Often, these engineers started their careers in toxic environments where accountability was synonymous with &quot;you&#x27;re going to be fired if this fails&quot;. It&#x27;s important to show these engineers that your environment really is safe, and that good things come from taking ownership. You have to back up your words with your actions, of course. IME, most engineers truly enjoy autonomy, ownership, and leadership once they can reasonably expect that it won&#x27;t be used against them.<p>And of course, it&#x27;s important to screen for these traits during the hiring process. It&#x27;s also important to filter out engineers who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t learn to take ownership of their work."],"time":["2020-02-24 15:46:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nunez"],"id":[22400974],"kids":[22404775],"parent":[22399547],"text":["The challenge with this is when you have a team with members that, by and large, wants to be led for various reasons (lacking motivation, does not want to lead, distracted with other priorities, etc.).

People are okay with balances going up, but never going down. Thus banks are offering consumers a risk-less return.<p>Banks do this by themselves investing in a broad &amp; diversified set of investments. The baseline is government bonds. Next comes government backed home-loans. Finally banks lend to businesses or investment loans. Everything beyond the government bonds requires the bank to take on the risk using their own money.<p>If you want to offer a &quot;bank&quot; account which exposes their money to risk, what you have invented is a brokerage account. Allowing people to auto-sell their investments is widely considered a bad idea because it leads to regular people leaving and entering the market often. It means incuring transations upon every purchase, and fails to help regular people with their fears.<p>The number 1 issue facing regular people is a lack of starting-to-invest. The number 2 issue is regular people attempting to time the market, which the surveys show they will do at the worst times.<p>Trading off issue #1, for issue #2 is an interesting question. I suspect the net result will be worse for consumers. They will see their balance dropping by hundreds of dollars a day on bad days, pull out, then panic buy in the next day.<p>In the real world such a bank account cannot be offered by a bank, as it is not a bank account. Banks already &quot;invest&quot; all the regular bank account money, the issue facing regular people now is that the world&#x27;s risk-less rate of return is approaching zero. As such any such auto-investing &quot;bank&quot; account is going to be regulated like the brokerage accounts, at which point we&#x27;ve failed to solve issue #1, the hurdles stopping people are the same open-new-brokerage-account hurdles."],"time":["2020-02-24 04:11:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["patio11"],"id":[22402322],"kids":[22402906,22403657,22403739,22402552,22403714],"parent":[22401128],"text":["Most people on HN who are optimizing interest&#x2F;etc to the penny, and I count myself among this number, have a hobby with similar economic returns to World of Warcraft but poorer graphics. The biggest lever you have available, by orders of magnitude, is optimizing the returns to your career or business. That disclaimer out of the way:<p>One of the folks who works at M1 Finance pitched me on the following, for folks who have similar cashflow characteristics to the median HNer. (They&#x27;ve essentially productized this, and with slightly more work you could get it out of Interactive Brokers. It&#x27;s hard to do with most discount brokers due to prevailing margin rates.) It captures most of the advantages of the &quot;hybrid&quot; account and is actually available in the status quo, which is an advantage.<p>Deposit your paycheck. It is automatically invested. Spend on margin; repay it the next month on payday, when you repeat the cycle. Change this only if you experience long-term unemployment, which you a) probably will not and which b) savings is the least effective financial product to prepare you for it.<p>Their theory is that the ~3% impact of margin is less than the fundamental return of an equity-heavy portfolio measured in small increments over a long period of time, so you should prefer to be perpetually ~100% invested in your taxable accounts rather than &quot;materially less than totally invested&quot;, which is what most well-paid professionals are given usage of a checking account and poor decisions embedded in their financial products. (e.g. If you have $50k net worth, $8k in post-tax payroll per month, and are saving $2k per month, you&#x27;re no higher than 86% invested and if you are following common financial advice you with a six month buffer in a non-investment emergency fund you are ~24% invested.)<p>This sounds strikingly plausible to me, for what it is worth, again contingent on one being a well-compensated professional with predictable cashflow in and out and a temperament amenable to discipline and commitment.

It leaves out a lot of other important projects in this space like PinePhone, LineageOS, and even the proprietary alternative of Sailfish.<p>I also take issue with a lot of articles talking about data collection as the boogeyman without actually explaining how data collection happens and how to minimize it.<p>You don’t have to actually get rid of Apple or Google, which can massively handicap the usability of your device, to gain some semblance of privacy. There are a lot of simple changes to be made:<p>- Turning off location history in Google and Apple Maps<p>- Auditing Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;social media account privacy settings<p>- Make sure you’re on a recent&#x2F;the latest Android version<p>- Audit and minimize app permissions<p>- Uninstall apps that you don’t need or have web alternatives<p>- Installing content blockers on web browsers<p>- Set up a PiHole<p>- On Android, you could switch to an alternative App Store like F-Droid<p>I suggest these sorts of thing only because these projects, while very admirable, are years away from being viable alternatives. Most smartphone users outside the technically inclined would absolutely not make the trade-offs required to live with something like a Librem or even giving up Google Play on LineageOS.<p>The other issue I take with articles like this is that they fail to understand the value that data collection <i>can<\/i> provide to consumers as well. A lot of useful features  actually depend on using your data. The assumption that the consumer is unhappy about this trade-off is not necessarily correct.<p>A great example of that concept is how Google and Apple use aggregated location information to determine traffic conditions. This is a highly useful feature to most smartphone owners. It would be impossible to implement without collecting location data.<p>That’s just one example of many. In many ways the utility of the smartphone outshines the personal computer precisely <i>because<\/i> it can gather more data from more sensors to be put to use.<p>Fighting Apple and Google with alternatives is a losing battle if you ask me - privacy will never be protected until strong regulations with real teeth become universal.<p>In reality, there will never be more than two smartphone operating systems that any significant number of the public use. If you don’t believe me just look to the personal computer world - in 30 years has any operating system gained any more traction than Windows or macOS? Sure, Desktop Linux is more usable and popular than ever, but the fact remains that 95%+ of the general population still doesn’t use it. While me and my technically inclined friends can finally use Linux as a daily driver and even play AAA commercial video games on it, something of a pipe dream 10 years ago, that doesn’t help the 90% of people that are still on Windows. That desktop computing situation is a lot like the future of smartphones - Apple and Google aren’t going anywhere. That’s why I say that regulations and laws are going to be the only way to reign in mass data collection, because getting people to switch to alternatives will never be more than 5% effective."],"time":["2020-02-24 14:07:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ThePhysicist"],"id":[22405162],"kids":[22406221,22405255,22407088,22407617],"parent":[22402662],"text":["Ars Technica recently tested the current version of the Purism Libre: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;librem-5-phone-hands-on-a-proof-of-concept-for-the-open-source-smartphone&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;librem-5-phone-hands...<\/a><p>It seems that it&#x27;s still more a prototype than a functioning phone, where even basic functionality like replying to a SMS is not implemented yet.

Throughout the 2000s (remember this was post-dot com) I got told software was a bad field to get into for two reasons:<p>1) The advent of advanced tooling would make software engineers unnecessary. Tools like Visual Basic and UML diagrams were the tip of the iceberg of &quot;visual coding&quot; where a business person could just specify requirements and the software would be automatically created.<p>2) Jobs were all going to go overseas. There is no reason to pay a programmer in California 10x what you can pay someone in Mumbai. It&#x27;s better to study something like finance where the secret domain knowledge is held within the chambers of ibankers in Manhattan. The future of tech startups is a few product managers in NYC outsourcing the coding work to India.<p>There&#x27;s also a 3rd argument that gets floated around that the field will be oversaturated, &quot;everyone&quot; is learning to code, etc. In 2015 I asked a startup for 125k and they told me, while that did seem to be market at the time, they thought salaries had peaked and were going in the opposite direction. In 2020 you probably can&#x27;t hire a bootcamp grad for 125k.<p>Since then the field has exploded and wages have gone off the charts, but I still hear the same type of arguments over and over.<p>In 2020, you hear stuff like:<p>1) AI is the future, it&#x27;s going to automate away all of the menial programming jobs.<p>2) Bay Area is overcrowded, all the jobs are going remote. The future of tech startup is a few marketing execs in SF outsourcing the menial tech work to flyover states.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t believe the hype then and don&#x27;t believe the hype now. I find it amusing that the author questions the wisdom of Google for not using AI to automate development, as if that&#x27;s never occurred to Google.<p>Of course the author is right that tech is a treadmill, new skills move into the spotlight while old ones become outdated, although even then the mass of legacy code means consultants will have lucrative jobs taking care of it for a long time.<p>In my experience, new tooling always creates more software jobs, not less. Software is not like high frequency trading, the more people that compete to make software, the more people we seem to need to make software.<p>Sure, Bay Area is getting insanely expensive, but Google still tries to fit as many as it can into Mountain View, Facebook still crams as many as it can into Menlo Park. Every 3 months some VC will have the bright idea that, what if we just pay people to do the lowly engineering work somewhere else and just have execs in the Bay Area? And 99% of those startups go nowhere and Google is worth a trillion dollars.<p>There is a very intuitive line of reasoning that goes, software can be done my machines and software can be done anywhere. There is a thread of truth to both those narratives, but it leads people to very incorrect conclusions that there won&#x27;t be as many software jobs in the future and they will be done in cheap places.<p>Despite all intuition, and all the logical narratives about costs and automation, a group of people dedicated to technology in the same physical room have defied that intuition. Virtually every extremely important software company grew in the West Coast of the USA, in some of the most expensive places in the world, and the more software tools have improved the more headcount these companies have had.

Usability tests where developers literally sit down and watch someone install and use your library from scratch (I find a lot of developers do not like to do this). Things like, seeing where they have to look up documentation (and how they do it), what bugs they hit, and how often they make common mistakes. I think a lot of this could be logged e.g. A developer signs up, you have their email + API key, you can connect the dots between what doc pages they view, how often, and what errors they commonly run into.<p>2. Doing whatever it takes to minimize the time to aha moment. This is absolutely critical for any product design effort, but not many companies measure this if any at all when it comes to DX. I think Twilio and maybe Stripe are the only ones that may have had this as a key onboarding KPI.<p>Ultimately I think a majority of developers that are capable of implementing these things are quite technical and used to the general state of DX so they don&#x27;t view bad DX as much of an issue unless its really terrible.<p>Lastly, I really wish error messages would just be super informative. For example getting something like this &quot;undefined method `my_method_name&#x27; for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)&quot; still feels a bit cryptic to someone newer to programming, if you can also tell me the human readable variable that I used that caused this issue, the one that was nil, and the exact line (the stack trace purely by itself can be confusing) that little touch would go a long way. For example compare that error message to something highlighted in a different color that says &quot;The variable you used called &quot;contact&quot; on line 87 was found to be nil, this is likely causing this issue&quot;.

And this is one of the great advantages of haskell.<p>By the way, now that I know some haskell, I see this edge case sloppiness all the time and it is really annoying. For example, here is something that annoyed me just recently. You go to yahoo finance and there they will show you the revenues of a company as well as the revenue growth from past year. But sometimes this revenue growth number is not available. For example, the company may not have existed past year, or perhaps it was not public past year and thus it did not publicly disclose its revenues. When they cannot compute revenue growth for these reasons, yahoo finance will helpfully show revenue growth as &quot;N&#x2F;A&quot;, i.e., not available.<p>That seems all nice and logical, but I noticed that yahoo finance tended to show that revenue growth was not available for many established public companies for which they should have the data. I looked at it more closely and noticed with shock that if the revenue growth of a company was about 0%, yahoo finance would still show it as &quot;N&#x2F;A&quot;! So some programmer just decided to use 0 as not available and just erased a lot of useful information from their system. Now when I see a company that has N&#x2F;A as revenue growth on yahoo finance I have to go and check whether the revenue growth was zero, or it was truly unavailable. As I said -- really annoying.<p>This is of course a textbook case for Haskells Maybe concept. You can have a type that is a Maybe Int, and that means it have a value or it can be Nothing. Thus, you encompass the edge case of not having the value available, without using an embarrassing hack that deletes real data. But of course Haskell gives you more power than just using Maybe. You can create a type that can encompass all kinds of edge cases and information about them. For example, you can embed a reason why the revenue growth data was not available, if that is the case."],"time":["2020-02-24 17:57:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ken"],"id":[22406096],"kids":[22406286,22406493,22406271],"parent":[22403625],"text":["They say that, and then turn around and show an example using IEEE-754 Doubles.

The tooling for integrating an editor or IDE with the container process is pretty poor (so one often ends up just setting up everything on the host anyway), image rebuilds are frequent and slow, and most language ecosystems already have tools for installing and switching between different versions. They are useful if you want to more closely replicate your CI or production environment for specific debugging, though.

When I was a junior programmer I was all over it.<p>Over the years I have come to reject some things that are seemingly fundamental to software engineering in the industry. One of them is unit testing. I don&#x27;t believe that unit testing is harmful in itself, but excessive use of it is a sign of weakness in another area.<p>- if your code relies on unit testing for correctness than your coding methodology (or language) is error prone. A good programming methodology where the domain is well understood usually does not need a single unit test.<p>- If your code base utilizes dependency injection to make the code more &quot;testable&quot; with mocks, you are making the code 10x worse. There are other ways to make your code more modular without injecting new scope, logic and apis into an object.<p>This logic sort of applies integration tests which is basically testing the same thing as unit tests but touching functions that have IO. However it is a little different. If your program does Not need unit tests but needs integration tests it means things like:<p>- your type checker does not extend across systems<p>- the programming methodologies become more error prone as you move to other systems and you have no control over it.<p>- you lack understanding of the foreign system.<p>The thing with integration tests is that all of the above is largely inevitable and integration testing really becomes the only way to correlate (not verify) the entire system with correctness when you lack the integrated approach of a single programming language. Therefore because of this I am not against integration testing.<p>I recently green fielded a small micro-service at my company and I did not write a single unit test. It had one logic error and that was largely due to a flaw in the type checker. I can imagine many engineers being aghast at the whole concept.<p>So essentially I&#x27;ve had the opposite conclusion.
