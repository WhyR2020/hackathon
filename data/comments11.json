Maybe it&#x27;s to always eat a specific breakfast before or while you write.

I started blogging a long time ago -- more than 20 years, really -- but I was highly scattershot for a long time, and I&#x27;m not proud of a lot of the material I put out until about a decade or so ago. Focusing on a few topics of deep personal interest helped.<p>3. See last sentence of #2.<p>4. My biggest struggle was not feeling like I had nothing to offer anyone in terms of insight or whatnot. Eventually, I decided whatever it was that was <i>mine<\/i> would be more than enough.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genjipress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genjipress.com<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-02 01:43:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geerlingguy"],"id":[23384322],"kids":{},"parent":[23382385],"text":["1.

I started writing in high school, just posting journal-style updates. In college I started posting some of these on a Xanga blog. Then I switched to a generated HTML blog, and for the past 8 years I&#x27;ve been using Drupal so I can easily edit on my phone as needed and have comments built in. The hardest part is writing, it&#x27;s always hard to put down words that I&#x27;m okay with publishing. And choosing whether to actually publish what I write or not. It&#x27;s also hard to keep comments from being horrible spam mess, which is why most people don&#x27;t allow them. I think they provide a ton of benefit (especially for old content that would otherwise get stale and worthless) if you moderate them like I do, though, so I keep them.<p>3. I stay motivated by finding my own blog posts in Google Search after Google Search—so many times I have to solve the same problem over and over again.

What&#x27;s your process?<p>Whenever I come across something that I find especially interesting (for me!) at work, I just write an article. I actually have a backlog of interesting stuff I&#x27;d like to blog about, so the subjects are not in short supply :-)<p>2. How did you start? What was hard? What was easy?<p>Started 3&#x2F;4 years ago. It&#x27;s been always easy, although, I&#x27;m quite obsessive about the precision and depth of the subjects I write. In edge cases, I can pour dozens of hours into an article.<p>Also, sometimes it happens that research for an article leads to nowhere, for example because the article would end up being nothing interesting. Or because I&#x27;m not knowledgeable enough, and it&#x27;s not practically possible to gather the knowledge required to write a consitently good article.<p>Some stats: almost 50 articles, around 74k words, currently 6k pageviews&#x2F;month.<p>3. How do you stay motivated? Do you?<p>Generally speaking, I do enjoy writing, although I definitely need to handle: 1. the stress of writing subjects that take dozens of hours to research and write 2. the loss of attractiveness that happens to subjects over time.<p>My best strategy for 2., has been to write <i>immediately<\/i> about a subject, if I decide to write about it.<p>Definitely, rather than thinking &quot;how to motivate myself to write an article&quot;, I think in terms of &quot;how to remove the demotivating factors&quot;.<p>Regarding the external motivations, seeing the traffic growing is very satisfying, and it also brought me as a speaker to a famous conference, but it wouldn&#x27;t motivate me if I wouldn&#x27;t like to write.<p>4. What were the struggles you had to overcome to develop a regular writing habit (e.g. shyness, self-consciousness, poor time management skills, etc...)? How did you do it?<p>Wrote in this in point 3. Something that may be worth adding, is that I write an article more or less once a month. It&#x27;s quite comfortable as a rhythm, although of course, spending 8+ hours on something, even once a month, may be too stressful in the long term for some.<p>A consideration worth pointing out, after a quick glance at other posts, is that there are different article styles. I can&#x27;t write an article in an hour even when I fully know the subject, because when I write 1. I extend the breadth and depth of the subject, 2. I may experiment for the fun of it 3. but also because there&#x27;s lots of &quot;padding&quot; due to creating a path for the reader to make them easy to fully understand the subject."],"time":["2020-06-01 23:50:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["softwaredoug"],"id":[23428441],"kids":{},"parent":[23382385],"text":["There&#x27;s two kinds of blogs I write.

If I can&#x27;t write a draft in 30-60 mins, it&#x27;s something I abandon it and don&#x27;t stress about abandoning it.

Imagine instead of coding projects, you had writing projects. You had to write persuasively with lots of deadlines. My interest in history since high school really drove a lot of writing.<p>The best course I had was a senior touchpoint where we had to write our opinions on a single page. Very challenging experience to persuasively make your point in one page!

If I go back and read my old material, it really comes off as pretentious and just overall atrocious, so to probably echo what everybody else is saying here, the trick is to just write as much as possible and don’t try to focus on things like length or flow on the first time through. In fact don’t even worry about editing anything, the editor will highlight any misspellings or grammatical errors, so let your mind go into stream of consciousness mode, just to get ideas down on paper.<p>Oh! And a recent tip for something that I’ve started doing a few months ago (typically while writing down initial thoughts while I’m playing a game for the first time), I leave Notes open on my phone so I can easily tap the microphone and speak sentences straight into a first draft. I realized that I spent the most time trying to figure out how to phrase certain things on the first draft, so by getting out actual well formed sentences as they came to me while I was playing a game, I was essentially removing the hardest part of writing from the equation.<p>I’ve been running this blog for about five or six years now, and also did some longform game review writing I’ve been running this blog for about five or six years now, and also did some longform game review writing on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thewellredmage.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thewellredmage.com<\/a> a few years back, and getting started on a blank canvas is always the hardest part.

Process:<p>I usually write about things that interest me or things that I think will be useful to someone else.  For example I have a series of articles that supplement an existing learning tool for a popular programming language.  I wrote the articles as I worked my way through the tutorials as a way to solidify my own comprehension.<p>2. How I got started:<p>I used to write a pseudonym blog on a subject that was controversial at the time but no longer is.  That was with Blogger.  I haven&#x27;t touched in a decade but it&#x27;s still out there.<p>For my blog under my own name I set up a WordPress site with Bluehost initially because it was easy and inexpensive.  The low cost hosting on Bluehost leaves a lot to be desired and I eventually migrated to my own self-hosted solution.  My self-hosted solution works well, but every now and then there is an issue to troubleshoot.  Most people will consider my self-hosted solution to be overkill and I can&#x27;t really disagree.  I used a small Kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean.  The setup was easy enough.  But I already had a lot of Kubernetes ops experience so there wasn&#x27;t much of a learning curve.  I would not recommend this to others.  My reason for doing this is that my blog is just one of the apps hosted in the cluster.  I kind of use it as a show piece for my work.<p>The hard part is when things go wrong.  It can be kind of stressful to know that you traffic is suffering because of an issue that you are trying to resolve.  Luckily, I&#x27;ve never had a traffic interruption to my blog, but I&#x27;ve borked things up with other apps a time or two.<p>3. Staying Motivated:<p>I&#x27;ll be honest this part is difficult.  I really don&#x27;t have that much content.  I posted my 49th article yesterday and I&#x27;ve been at it since 2016.  Some years I only published a couple of articles.  So far I&#x27;m at 44,936 words total.  I try to focus on quality over quantity.  I write some short posts but usually my posts are 1500 words or more.<p>One thing I do is write down ideas for blog articles in a journal.  Every now and then I actually write one of those.  I have far more unwritten articles.<p>4. Struggles:<p>Since my blog is under my real name I find that I am much more self-conscious compared to writing under a pseudonym.  I generally tend to be selective about what articles I share because I don&#x27;t really care for getting lit up by rude comments on social media sites.  I&#x27;ll usually try to seek out feedback in niche areas and small groups before I share with a larger audience.  I&#x27;m always surprised by when an article becomes popular and I&#x27;ve had it happen a couple of times.  It&#x27;s always nice.<p>I&#x27;m also generally selective about what topics I&#x27;ll write about.  I rarely write opinion pieces or about controversial subjects because I don&#x27;t want a potential employer to get the wrong idea.

And there were other languages like Visual basic (late 90s). A lot of Unix shell scripting. I still think, I am at my best. But do have occasional self doubts.

There are _a lot_ of forensic methods to reverse blur techniques.<p>3) Be weary of other things in the photograph that might identify someone: reflections, shadows, so on.<p>4) Really a subset of 2 and 3, but be aware that blocking out faces is often times not sufficient to anonymise the subject in the photo.

Why only two astronauts? and<p>2. How much is Crew Dragon costing?<p>For (1), it&#x27;s stated [1] that Crew Dragon has a capacity of seven astronauts but only 4 for NASA? How does that work? Does that mean the NASA configuration only has 4 seats? I found this [2] saying seats 1 and 4 were empty.<p>Why not 4 astronauts? The answer seems to be that this is technically a test flight (Crew Demo-2). Passing this will fully certify Dragon. I guess it&#x27;s better to risk 2 astronauts than 4. It probably also depends how many people you want to have on the ISS.<p>As for (2), I found this [3], which states the cost at $55m per astronaut. This seems... high? A full complement of 4 would cost $210m. Falcon 9 launches cost a fraction of that. Even Falcon Heavy is ~$90m.<p>For some reason I thought SpaceX was enabling sending up 7 astronauts for &lt;$100m.<p>Compared to Soyuz [4], which cost NASA $80m&#x2F;astronaut, that&#x27;s a saving but not as much as I would&#x27;ve thought.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dragon_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dragon_2<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nasa.gov&#x2F;commercialcrew&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;all-aboard-astronauts-ingress-crew-dragon&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nasa.gov&#x2F;commercialcrew&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;all-aboard-...<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;spacex-boeing-commercial-crew-seat-prices.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;spacex-boeing-commercial-crew-seat-pri...<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;spacex-launched-two-astronauts-changing-spaceflight-forever&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;spacex-launched-two-astronauts-c...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-31 17:46:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ape4"],"id":[23370272],"kids":[23370404,23370443],"parent":[23369817],"text":["Watching now.. they were unable to get the &quot;hard line&quot; voice working.

It&#x27;ll be hugely dependent on exactly how the PDF-generating application&#x2F;tool went about things.<p>One simple example: suppose your PDF uses a specific font (not one of the standards like Times or Helvetica), so the PDF-generating tool embedded the font. (This is common.) Further, suppose the generating tool embedded a re-encoded subset of the font, including only the glyphs that were actually required. (This is also common.)<p>Now, suppose the edit you wish to make involves adding a character that was not present in the original document -- let&#x27;s say you want to change the date from &quot;May&quot; to &quot;June&quot;. But the original document contained no occurrences of capital J (in this particular font&#x2F;style), and so the capital J glyph is not present in the embedded font. No &quot;PDF text editor&quot; can get around this; the best you can hope for is a &quot;J&quot; in some fallback (such as Times) that may look terrible alongside the intended custom font.<p>And as for edits that would require reflowing multiple lines of text, maybe inserting a new paragraph in the middle of a page, etc.... not much chance of this working out well.<p>Yes, a tool like this can (in many cases) make it possible to make <i>minor<\/i> changes (perhaps fixing a typo or updating a word here and there).

That they were able to convince wealthy donors to pony up $ is something I&#x27;m sure many aspire to.  And who are we to complain if someone can get others to believe in an idea with private funding?   VCs, anyone? Kudos to them for their persuasiveness.<p>And separately, on the apparent quantities of material -- much of that was pretty completely recycled (metal, plastic), so it was chiefly the manufacturing and installation labor that was really spent.  You could equally say that it also produced jobs wherever their art went.<p>2.<p>I think the thing that leaves the more dissatisfied taste in my mouth is that much of it didn&#x27;t seem like very innovative or even subjectively amazing art.  It only seemed to be self-fulfilling.  In the sense that it was like the Kardashians -- they only seem to be popular because everyone says they&#x27;re popular.   Yet I don&#x27;t get why they&#x27;re popular.  And similarly, looking at the art itself, if you didn&#x27;t know better, nothing would say, &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;world changing&quot;.  (personal taste, of course)<p>You almost suspect that Christo&#x27;s beginnings were spaghetti thrown against the wall, seeing if anyone would buy into some silly idea of wrapping something in colored plastic, like he was grasping for artistic straws.  And it was only because he proposed something so large and crazy that it was different.   And then when the first or 2nd one got some odd traction, it turned into an unexpected snowball.  If he hadn&#x27;t gotten any early success, you wouldn&#x27;t look at the ideas and retrospectively say they were stunning, and what a shame they didn&#x27;t get built.<p>I will say that the NYC gates and others that people were able to walk through and enjoy en masse were fun.   But people like walking around in colorful new things anyway -- occupy the family for a couple hours.  You wouldn&#x27;t call Disneyland &quot;art&quot; exactly.<p>And it never shook me out of the nagging thought that there was something disproportionate -- maybe even &quot;unfair&quot; or overhyped about the popular success of the guy -- much like if the boss&#x27;s son were to be winning a bunch of art shows sponsored by the family.  Or that he was only an &quot;artist&quot; by virtue of being able to get people to pay for his experiments and the bigness of them.<p>Anyway, at least we have the memories to think about."],"time":["2020-06-01 12:13:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wavefunction"],"id":[23374130],"kids":[23374240],"parent":[23373507],"text":["he came to a part of my state that was probably not too famous for one of his projects\nat first I questioned the value but then I relaxed and came to appreciate the work he had created, the dialog, the introspection and the choice of place\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christojeanneclaude.net&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;projects?p=over-the-river\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christojeanneclaude.net&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;projects?p=over-the-r...<\/a>\nit was an impoverished place from a capitalist perspective, but a place rich with stark beauty he acknowledged and leveraged into his art"],"time":["2020-06-01 01:47:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["js2"],"id":[23375578],"kids":{},"parent":[23373507],"text":["I lived in Miami when he wrapped the islands in Biscayne Bay:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christojeanneclaude.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;surrounded-islands\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christojeanneclaude.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;surrounded-islands<\/a><p>It was cool."],"time":["2020-06-01 06:59:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["polynomial"],"id":[23376384],"kids":{},"parent":[23373507],"text":["Nice to see the HN crossover here, he wasn&#x27;t all that involved in, or connected to technology sectors.<p>He has always seemed underrated to me, I wonder what history will have to say about that."],"time":["2020-06-01 10:28:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hoseja"],"id":[23376469],"kids":{},"parent":[23373507],"text":["Huh, didn&#x27;t know there was a real world Zima Blue."],"time":["2020-06-01 10:45:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anm89"],"id":[23374253],"kids":[23374517,23374353,23374366,23374296,23374311,23375837,23374304,23374277,23376735,23375223,23377363,23374851,23375850,23375885,23374752,23374457,23374382],"parent":[23373507],"text":["Am I the only one who looks at this massive installations and views them as a massive waste of resources and intentional littering?<p>These are multi-ton plastic monuments to some guys ego.<p>Certainly not celebrating his death, he seems like a nice, interesting guy but it&#x27;s hard for me to get behind the work."],"time":["2020-06-01 02:04:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fsckboy"],"id":[23374569],"kids":[23376460,23377023],"parent":[23373507],"text":["For some reason I&#x27;m reminded of Bette Davis&#x27;s famous remark on hearing about Joan Crawford&#x27;s death: &quot;You should never say bad things about the dead, only good… Joan Crawford is dead.

(he was a mixed kids growing up with 3 languages which might also have altered how he performed on the test). Long story short he had a difficult first year in school with the teachers telling us that either a) he is too smart and should be moved forward a class, or b) he needs to go to a special school because he is dumb, or c) he should probably be tested for both autism and ADD. We decided to do none of the above and give it another 2 years to see how it play out. Eventually he settled into his surrounding and turned out one of the best students in class.<p>another case: my best friend&#x27;s kid is diagnosed with autism (&quot;somewhere on the spectrum&quot; they say). He is incredibly active for his age and more than other kids. His parents who are both very ill (ALS and MS) are used to seeing a doctor every few weeks to get injections, ... they have more exposure to doctors than to any other grown ups in their life, and meanwhile their friends are also all people who have &quot;sick&quot; kids. Whenever I play with the kid I think he is pretty normal, except for that he is a lot smarter than anyone else. Like a smart boy stuck in a smaller childs body.<p>Another example: my gf is a nurse and occupational therapist. she literally works with disabled kids who are on the spectrum, have down-syndrome, cerebral palsy (to name the most common problems). She says if somebody has autism you can sure as hell tell. There is no &quot;maybe&quot;, or &quot;somewhere on the spectrum&quot;- yes some cases are milder but she thinks that some doctors just diagnose and presribe solutions for things they don&#x27;t fully understand themselves.<p>could it be that a lot of these kids simply go through stages in their childhood at different speeds? like not every kid fits into our &quot;systems-thinking&quot; model and maybe totally grows out of it a year later? The horrid thing here is that the moment way start treating their behavior as a disease it has good potential to actually become one, ... which brings me to the last example.<p>I worked with a US company remote. we were all on Jitsi every day even we weren&#x27;t meeting so the mgmt could keep tabs (this was the rule for some reason). The assistant to the CEO a mid 30ies lady insisted that her child had autism. She constants forgot to switch her mic to mute and I could see how she talked to that child. He would get regular slaps in the face and get screamed at - then he would be told to take his meds. Also I think they might have been on some deal where they get benefits because their kids was &quot;disabled&quot;.<p>idk what to make of this but the whole medical profession seems like a racket to me. especially in the US (where this disease seems more of a fashion than anything) ... I hope these kids don&#x27;t wake up one day and realize the crimes that have been committed against them.<p>I&#x27;m glad I put my foot down and not put my child on pills (just to put money in some idiotic Dr. med. pocket).

I think it’s pretty sleazy to be using signal to evade record keeping requirements. I also think it’s important to have transparency into things governments do.<p>But I also worry that such requirements can lead to worse results. Generally in a well run organisation, you want people to be able to speak their mind and disagree about things, but if the organisation makes a bad decision and those disagreements are recorded, they will be used against them.<p>For an arbitrary example, look at the Boeing 737 max. There were some internal emails claiming that the system which turned out not to be safe wasn’t safe (the problem with these was probably that they didn’t seem to make their way up to anyone who could change the decision), and probably the fallout from them will be worse than if there were no such emails and Boeing just appeared to not have considered the possibility of failure. This gives the message that one shouldn’t have these discussions through email because that gives the impression that known issues were ignored if they turn out to have mattered. But no one asked about the cases where people had raised concerns by email and they were corrected by redesigning things or where concerns were raised but deemed to not be significant and turned out not to be significant. It seems better to me for people to be able to voice disagreements.<p>Another example is in healthcare: I suspect people get worse outcomes because if anyone has a different (potentially better) opinion about how a patient may be treated, they are incentivised not to voice it because any disagreement in a hospitals records will make for a much stronger case in any litigation against a hospital.<p>Perhaps the issue is that the media or public inquiries (or maybe courts or juries) will look at any such record as a sign of negligence rather than an ordinary thing which happens all the time in cases that go wrong and right.<p>But maybe signal is really being used for political scheming and some public business overflows onto signal unintentionally."],"time":["2020-05-31 12:46:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tomhoward"],"id":[23368785],"kids":[23370176,23369926,23374412,23374322],"parent":[23368346],"text":["Some points to consider:<p>- From the article: “Starting in late 2004, before the FOIA came into force in early 2005, Downing Street implemented an automatic 90-day deletion of emails aside from those specifically selected by civil servants as relevant for storage in the National Archives”<p>- Since the invention of the telephone, it&#x27;s never been an expectation that transcripts of telephone calls between MPs or officials should be recorded and made available under FOI.<p>- Indeed, it&#x27;s never been an expectation that private face-to-face conversations between MPs&#x2F;officials be recorded and made available under FOI.<p>- At least according to FOI laws I&#x27;m vaguely familiar with (in Australia), an FOI request can only be made for an item of information that is known to exist.

CS is a hard, but not impossible, major. Depending upon the school it will be perhaps easier than a Physics degree and maybe a bit more work but easier than a Math degree.<p>There is too much CS to learn in four years so every program leaves something out. For example, some schools will require a class in Artificial Intelligence while others may not but will instead require a course in Data Science. So it&#x27;s hard to know exactly what you will be studying, but I can make a few suggestions that should be helpful for someone heading off to college and planning to study CS.<p>Generally, there is a lot of useful math that you may be required to learn. Usually one year of calculus, one semester of differential equations, one semester of linear algebra (matrices, etc.), one semester of statistics or probability, and one or two semesters of discrete math. It&#x27;s easy to end up with a math minor on your way to a CS degree, and I recommend getting one if you are reasonably good at math. The good thing about this selection of math subjects is that they are all in different areas and are consequently to some degree &quot;introductory&quot; or lower division. The trick at this level for doing well in math classes is simply to put in the time to do all the homework, attend all the lectures, and prepare for tests by doing every problem (even the ones not assigned as homework) from the text book sections covered in your class. If there are problems (even unsigned ones) that you can&#x27;t do, meet with the professor and get help. This is a pretty simple formula for getting A&#x27;s in math classes. This really works I&#x27;ve done it myself; I was always good at math in High School, but it took me a while to understand that doing just the assigned homework was going to result in B&#x27;s not A&#x27;s. Doing extra practice by taking a couple of Saturdays to solve every problem in the book resulted in getting the highest grades in the class. No matter where you start out, extra practice will make you better. Great athletes achieve success the same way, through more practice than others.<p>CS homework often involves programming. In your web-design class, you will write programs that implement web-sites; in your data structures class you will write programs that implement different data structures. This kind of homework has a special property unlike history homework or chemistry homework. One can be short on time and do a crappy job on a history paper or maybe get only four out of five of the chemistry homework problems done, and this might get you an 80 on the history paper or chemistry homework. In CS, the programming assignments, sometimes called labs, are different. Doing 80% of the work required to finish a program generally means a program that isn&#x27;t finished and a program that isn&#x27;t finished often doesn&#x27;t run at all or runs and produces the wrong answer. This could result in a 0 or maybe a 25 on the homework, not an 80. This means that you have to adopt a different approach to tackling labs. To avoid a disastrous grade, <i>start early<\/i>. If you finish your program a couple of days early you can go out and party, but I predict that you will almost always feel a lot of pressure as the deadline approaches because these labs will take more time than you think they will, so <i>start early<\/i>. Start on the first day, and put some time in on these projects every day.<p>Some of your classmates won&#x27;t start projects early, there are two possible consequences. They won&#x27;t be able to finish and will get a bad grade or they will realize that they aren&#x27;t going to finish and will cheat by seeking the solution on the internet. There are only so many suitable labs for the subjects you will be studying so the programs can mostly be found on the internet. You will be making a grave mistake if you take the route of starting late and then making up for it by copying someone else&#x27;s work. You have to practice programming on your own to develop your abilities and prepare yourself for a career in CS, so <i>start early<\/i>. By the time you are in your third or forth year, you will know which of your classmates have been doing it by themselves and which have been taking the easy way. By starting early and doing it yourself you will gradually become one of the best, and your professors and even your classmates will know it.<p>When I taught undergraduate CS classes while in grad school, I noticed two categories of students. Students that never came to see me during office hours for help and students that did come by for help. I was always happy to see someone that had obviously tried to solve a problem but was stuck or didn&#x27;t understand. Go see your professors outside of class, they will be far less scary after you get to know them. Eventually, you should get to know two or three of your professors well enough that they can be of help when applying to grad school or when looking for a job. They may be able to help you get an internship or real job during the summer. If you have a question about something that comes up in lecture, sometimes you can get a quick clarification by just walking with your professor after class on the way back to another part of campus.<p>Sadly, books are very expensive. I&#x27;ve frequently used my text books after the course is over, so I don&#x27;t recommend renting books. Used books are often almost new so I recommend keeping your books and saving money finding used books in good condition (make sure they are up to date). I have found few CS books that are as good online as the hardcopy books, so I recommend hardcopy books.<p>Team projects will come up in every CS program I&#x27;ve heard of. I hate these. (1) don&#x27;t trust your teammates to get their work done on time. (2) don&#x27;t trust them to turn the project in on time, (3) don&#x27;t trust them to do their part correctly. So, start early! Give yourself time to straighten things out if you or your teammate doesn&#x27;t get their part straight. If you have given yourself time, you can recover.<p>You are probably one of the best programmers amongst your peers if you are planning on going into CS. I was like that. There will be a great temptation to produce a fancy, faster, better, more feature-full solution in your programming assignments. That&#x27;s a great goal, but remember, when programming, things will take longer than you anticipate. So in addition to starting early, make your goal the simplest program that will satisfy the requirements of the assignment. If you&#x27;d like to do more, add it at the end if you finish early. Don&#x27;t add optional features at the beginning. Get the assignment done in time to add additional features at the end. For example, if the assignment is to write a program that will play legal chess moves, make your first goal a program that plays legal chess moves. Once that works perfectly, you can think about it making good moves.<p>If you can swing it, get yourself a second monitor in addition to the laptop you are likely planning on using for college. Having your work spread out on one screen and the assignment or java or python library documentation open on the other screen really helps. Don&#x27;t program with social media open. Don&#x27;t have your laptop open for lectures. So many students do it that it is widely accepted, but studies clearly show that hand written notes during lectures results in better retention and better grades.<p>Something you can do this summer is if you don&#x27;t touch-type yet, get one of the touch typing games and learn touch typing. Just learn the standard US keyboard layout--don&#x27;t bother with alternative layouts like Dvorak you will have to use other people&#x27;s keyboards or keyboard in the library or in the computer labs and they will all be the standard US keyboard layout.<p>In college you will have to write some papers, for CS you may have to use LaTeX. This is a very old, but very good program for writing academic papers. Almost every serious paper in CS or Math or Physics is written using LaTeX instead of MS Word. Unfortunately, LaTeX is hard to learn. So, if you want to, try learning LaTeX. There are lots of free resources on the internet. Because it produces professional results, lots of the information is very technical and applies more to people writing math books. However there are simple tutorials and you can get by with a moderate set of features to write college papers. If you look at LaTeX and it looks like something you would rather not learn this summer, try a tool called markdown. There are free markdown programs available and you can write nice papers using markdown as long as they aren&#x27;t too complex.<p>In addition to LaTeX or markdown you will need to get comfortable with a text editor of some kind. Emacs is free, old, has hundreds of built in commands, uses weird keys for things, and can do absolutely anything. Vim is also free, old and weird, but more programmers use it and it is very powerful. More modern alternatives, that you will be able to pick up faster because they do less and are not weird are Atom and Sublime Text. Each of these has it&#x27;s advantages, I like Emacs. Pick one and start using it for your programming. You will eventually have to start using a professional text editor, one of these four will be fine. See [1] for a professor&#x27;s Emacs lessons for his students, but there are many other YouTube tutorials on Emacs and these other editors.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&amp;list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&amp;list=PL9KxKa8NpF...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-01 05:16:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aloukissas"],"id":[23373572],"kids":[23373987,23373738,23375925,23373802],"parent":[23371530],"text":["1.

A lot of the computer science classes you take will be boring AF, or you&#x27;ll start to bang your head against the desk wondering why you have to know how operating systems work when you just want to make iOS apps (or vice versa!). Some of the classes will be deeply math heavy. It can and will seem overwhelming at times. So minor in something fun. Pick something that has no bearing on your chosen career path. Minor in Theater or Music or Art or Literature or Physical Education. The best part about minors is that you generally get to take all the fun classes and not the terrible ones! You&#x27;ll meet a whole bunch of people with diverse interests that aren&#x27;t solely computer nerds.<p>As far as the CS stuff is concerned, focus on absorbing as much as you can. Contrary to what other people said, don&#x27;t sweat the details. You should have a fundamental understanding of all the big areas (databases, languages, algorithms), but you don&#x27;t need to be an expert in any of those things to get a job. In fact, 90% of the subject matter you learn in college won&#x27;t be relevant to whichever job you get. BUT... the act of learning is important, and the fact that you have fundamental understandings of those things will get your foot in the door<p>Think of your college degree as a ticket to an interview, and your first job as the real education. Your degree is proof of two things: 1) that you can learn, and 2) that you can start, stick with, and complete a large, multi-year project. Nobody expects someone with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree to be an expert programmer, but they _do_ expect critical thinking skills and the ability to learn. You&#x27;ll learn more on the job in the first 6 months than you will in 4+ years of college education... so don&#x27;t put too much stress on yourself there.<p>So... take it seriously, but not too seriously. Study hard, but take fun classes too. Make connections in your computer classes, but make friends across a wide variety of interests. Learn the fundamentals, but don&#x27;t sweat the details.<p>(Also, pro tip: nobody gives a shit about your GPA. A 4.0 doesn&#x27;t get you anything in the real world except a rude awakening. By all means, try to get all A&#x27;s if you can, but don&#x27;t burn yourself out by trying to get perfect grades.)"],"time":["2020-05-31 22:19:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dehrmann"],"id":[23372993],"kids":[23373883],"parent":[23371530],"text":["Be mindful of your program&#x27;s retention rate.

A lot of science and math classes are graded on curves, and professors don&#x27;t want to see too many (or any) perfect scores. I had one class where 25% was the lowest passing score on an exam.<p>Especially at research universities, professors are often more interested in research than teaching.

In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to get a 75% on an exam and understand that 75% well as opposed to getting 95% on an exam but only because you &quot;remembered&quot; things without really understanding them.<p>When you study, spend time deeply thinking about the concepts. Yes you&#x27;re going to learn CS, but it&#x27;s not just about learning data structures, algorithms, compilers, etc. etc. College is an opportunity to think critically. It&#x27;s okay to be wrong or to not understand things. Use the internet to reinforce concepts you don&#x27;t understand well, or go speak with your professor or TA&#x27;s in office hours.<p>Okay... with that out of the way, here are some other thoughts:<p>1. Don&#x27;t index too heavily on advice folks give you on learning any specific programming language. Focus more on the concepts that translate from one language to another.<p>2. In the first year or two, do invest in understanding object oriented programming principles, as OOP is quite common today. You&#x27;ll probably cover this in one of your introductory CS&#x2F;programming courses anyway. Note: OOP is not the end all&#x2F;be all.<p>3. If you&#x27;ve used Windows your whole life, great. I would encourage you to spend some time learning a Unix-based operating system. This isn&#x27;t so much related to your CS degree&#x2F;course work, but I will bet it comes in very handy later on.<p>4. Do take a compilers course if it&#x27;s not required in your degree program. Many universities who have ABET accreditation require it but I recall at least one (several years ago) that didn&#x27;t.<p>5. Do pay attention in your Operating Systems course.

I got very screwed over from that mentality -- like, knowing C still didn&#x27;t guarantee an A in a C class. That kind of thing. \nIn no particular order:\n- Get social! Make friends. You&#x27;ll need them when college gets hard and they can be invaluable for the rest of your life. Student clubs and hanging around the CS building are great ways to do this! Also ask around your dorm for fun things to do. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try new things!\n- PROJECTS. INTERNSHIPS. Your first internship will be nearly impossible to get no matter how good you are unless you get very lucky. It takes a lot of determination: keep at it! Best way imo is to do projects outside of class. Also, in terms of a tech stack, something ppl like and get REAL GOOD over time. Note that certain internships are much harder to find than others; iOS and Backend in particular. \n- As a former dual degree seeker (BS CS and BM Music composition) I&#x27;m biased, but definitely take classes outside of CS. I took around a year of non CS classes and I have NEVER regretted a single one. (Maybe chemistry.) Things like economics, music theory, intro to law, philosophy -- these are what will pay dividends later on in your career in totally unexpected ways. \n- Embrace chaos! And embrace change. Think of college as your time to try shit out and fail. If you fail... so what! Get good at getting over failure. Invest in yourself and figure out what you want to change. \n- Finally, please dear god have fun.

I.e. do something 100% top-to-bottom where you not only design &amp; write a bit of software then hand the assignment in, but actually set up a server, install what you need, deploy the software, monitor it etc etc - bonus points for getting your friends to try and use it have them file bugs for you to fix.  Some suggestions - write a clone of Wordpress&#x2F;StackOverflow&#x2F;HackerNews or whatever and do the <i>whole thing<\/i> yourself, right down to database schemas and installing and configuring nginx yourself.  You will learn so much if you have never done this. Too much at school was compartmentalised so that you only had to &quot;focus on the problem&quot; and the other stuff was provided for you.<p>- Source control: Git&#x2F;Mercurial and other distributed ones, plus also still-in-use dinosaurs like Perforce&#x2F;SVN. These days with Github everyone probably knows this, but I&#x27;ll say it anyway since at school it is often just you working on your own.<p>- Unit testing :-) Bonus points for continuous integration&#x2F;deployment.<p>- Basic project management: how things are run in teams, code reviews, bug handling etc.<p>- web + networking fluently (answer the &quot;what happens when I enter example.com in the browser&quot; question from the initial DNS lookup through to the DOM rendering and everything in between)<p>- fundamental *nix familiarity.  Don&#x27;t need to be l33t, but at least be able to get basic grunt work done with pipes and the like instead of having to resort to dumping data to excel and filtering it there.  Sed, awk, grep, wc, uniq, sort, vi etc etc etc.<p>- the obvious algorithms + data structures stuff.<p>- These days: Cloud: the 12 Factor App thing is quite a good thing to read and internalise - it may change your perspective of how you think about approaching things.

This is the most important thing to know, and you should consider that you&#x27;ll need between 3 and 6 depending on your program.<p>(2) Keep your GPA above ~3.5 (landing something lower won&#x27;t break your application, but it will make your life harder).<p>Lots of the career advice I&#x27;ve seen maps to getting SWE jobs in industry, where things like your undergrad GPA, research experience, and letters of recommendation don&#x27;t matter as much. You can be a phenomenal engineer at a &quot;prestigious&quot; company (whatever that means to you) with a huge variety of undergrad track records (including not even going to college!). But just like getting a referral from someone who works at a certain company is a higher-signal (and easier) way to select an applicant to interview than trying to sort through a stack of resumes, getting a &quot;referral&quot; from a professor in the form of a letter of recommendation is a higher-signal way to filter applications than basically anything else. For research, grad school admissions committees tend to not care too much about internships &#x2F; work experience, unless they&#x27;re tied to research in some way. If you&#x27;re interested in this, read the link at the end of this post [0].<p>Also, considering COVID-19&#x27;s impact on engineering hiring right now, if you&#x27;re having trouble finding an internship, doing a summer of undergraduate research can be a great backdoor to getting some hands-on experience, work with a professor, and<p>Generally, on the career side of things, I&#x27;d say spend a good chunk of time exploring what types of work you enjoy and find engaging. It&#x27;s hard to predict what this will be when you&#x27;re coming in, so do lots of small experiments to try to figure this out. Build small projects, reach out to professors and try your hand at research, join clubs and find other students who share your interests.<p>The last thing I&#x27;ll say here is realize that there might be a whole set of career options you didn&#x27;t even know existed coming in. Amongst my friends, the most common &quot;discovered&quot; post-graduate plan was (management) consulting, which virtually none of my friends knew existed coming into college, and many ended up getting excited about while there.<p>Overall, you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find another space where you&#x27;re surrounded by thousands of other people your age who are excited about learning, meeting each other, and working on ambitious stuff. There&#x27;s way more to do and discover than there was in high school, but you&#x27;ll also have to be much more active in finding and leveraging opportunities instead of waiting things to come to you. Work hard and explore, but also remember to make friends, let loose, find some parties, go on dates, stay healthy, and keep an open mind throughout. It&#x27;s a wild ride, and it can be an incredibly rewarding handful of years.

I would say find an internship or programming job ASAP. Practical experience in the field is generally more beneficial than classroom learning.<p>Pro Higher Ed: Programming classes are great for repetition and rote memorization. I had one class that was 70% Bash and VI (not VIM) - just the basics. Labs were agonizingly mundane, drilling the same commands over and over, but now at my job I&#x27;m considered an SME (subject matter expert) on random Linux servers because the basics were drilled into me. I was hired as a developer, but my general understanding of system led me to become more valuable<p>Pro Maybe Not Higher Ed: My sophomore year our IT department was hiring for two student programmers, and I was accepted (though including me, only two applied). However in my first 3 weeks of training I think I learned, in the field, 90% of what was taught for my junior and senior years (Web design, database design, SQL, data structures, and the most important (since I was hired after my senior year): institutional knowledge.<p>Working in a professional environment, even as an intern or student, you get to learn how project timelines and management work, how businesses calculate&#x2F;expect returns on their requests (and maybe react to critical successes of failures), analyzing and modifying legacy code bases, integrating, deployment workflows, source management, how frustrating it is when vendors have terrible APIs, bureaucratic nonsense and pace, etc. All of this is critical knowledge you need at some point, so get it early (and pad that resume). If you can publicly contribute or distribute code&#x2F;solutions via GitHub or whatever, that&#x27;s an asset for sharing with employers (if it&#x27;s semi- decent).<p>I will and ask you a question I ask student developers in interviews: &quot;In what field do you want to be working in in 10 years&quot;. I get answers like &quot;Machine Learning&quot;, &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;Web Development&quot;, &quot;Networking&quot;, etc. All CS categories. So I push back and say: &quot;Ok, but for what purpose?&quot; and list off some broad options &quot;education, health, entertainment, gaming medical, financial, legal, political, industrial, environmental, etc?&quot;.<p>Very few have a good answer to that question. They &quot;like to code&quot;, or say &quot;anything really&quot;. I encourage everyone to look at CS a tool towards a cause or a goal.

The interviewers were impressed that I&#x27;d already written &quot;real code&quot; and that set me apart, because one question they&#x27;re trying to answer is &quot;what will the candidate be able to do&quot; and a good answer is &quot;here&#x27;s examples of what I&#x27;ve done already&quot;.<p>2. Learn how to build a web-based database front end application properly. This is a kind of bread-and-butter job that&#x27;s not the most interesting thing in the world on its own, but is fundamental for a lot of things that create business value. There&#x27;s a whole stack of technology behind this, and it pays to know what&#x27;s going on &quot;under the hood&quot; of tools like ORMs, &quot;reactive&quot; JS frameworks, dependency injection etc.<p>3. Spend some serious time on at least one thing that is not CS.<p>4. On the CS knowledge side, algorithms&#x2F;data structures and compilers are two things to take seriously to the point where you&#x27;ve achieved mastery, not just passed the class (even with a good grade).<p>5. Learn and use tools. At a not-too-bad uni I&#x27;ve still seen students in their penultimate year e-mail ZIPs of their code to each other ... version control, continuous integration, unit testing, linting etc are all things that happen in professional software development, but (mayby I&#x27;m just being Europe-centric here) especially at some good unis, they think this stuff isn&#x27;t worth teaching and students can just find it out themselves. Knowing all this stuff is a huge plus in an interview, but even before then, it will make your life easier when you&#x27;re doing coursework projects.<p>6. There are situations where an IDE is the right tool for the job and you shouldn&#x27;t turn your nose up at it. Find one that suits your taste and learn how to use it, things like debugging, &quot;go to declaration&quot; or &quot;find usages&quot;.<p>7. Finally, decide where your personal moral compass lies. Some people want to write AIs for self-targeting missiles, other&#x27;s don&#x27;t; same for &quot;ad tech&quot;. You want to work in a sector and company that&#x27;s a good culture fit for you."],"time":["2020-06-01 10:29:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["flaque"],"id":[23373652],"kids":{},"parent":[23371530],"text":["You should take a serious look right now to make sure you&#x27;re going to a college with a good program for getting a job.<p>From someone who went through a school with effectively no program, I definitely wished I&#x27;d considered this before devoting 4 years and 100k to one particular school.<p>So here&#x27;s some actionable questions you can ask your career center right now to see if you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth.<p><i><\/i>Does the university protect you against exploding offers?<i><\/i> An exploding offer is when a company offers you a job offer, but you have to decide immediately or within a short time period (like a day or two). In the &quot;real world&quot; this can make sense because the company may actually need someone immediately. For students though, this practice is a bit scummy, since no company immediately needs an intern. Typically it&#x27;s just manipulating someone who might not know any better. To prevent this, any college worth it&#x27;s tuition will require all companies recruiting students to follow some form of [offer guidelines](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecs.engineering.illinois.edu&#x2F;career-resources&#x2F;offer-guidelines&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecs.engineering.illinois.edu&#x2F;career-resources&#x2F;offer-...<\/a>).<p>If they _don&#x27;t_ have this sort of guideline, it likely means they don&#x27;t have any leverage or industry connections. For example, most schools will just blacklist companies from their career fairs that don&#x27;t follow their guidelines. If the companies don&#x27;t care, then the career program is pretty bad.<p>And on that note, <i><\/i>does the school have regular career fairs attended by tech companies you&#x27;ve heard of?<i><\/i><p>In some schools the vast majority of students get their internships or new-grad jobs from career fairs. In others, there won&#x27;t be a technical career fair. Or if there is, there won&#x27;t be any CS&#x2F;programming jobs that show up.<p>One hack to figure this out is to check if the school is _charging companies_ money for STEM career fairs. For example, San Jose state charges $850 a table the last time I checked. If a school isn&#x27;t charging, it often means they can&#x27;t actually get anyone to come. (though obviously YMMV)<p><i><\/i>Does the school have course offerings for technical interviews?<i><\/i> Many, many schools these days are creating classes specifically to help students pass their technical interviews. For example, here&#x27;s [Boise State&#x27;s class](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BoiseState&#x2F;CS-HU390\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BoiseState&#x2F;CS-HU390<\/a>).<p>If the school _doesn&#x27;t_ have a course like this at some point, it may mean they are disconnected to the real world and have little to no support for you in general. It is not a hard thing for CS professors to setup a class for extra practice with algorithms &amp; data structures.<p><i><\/i>Do students have access to investment capital or startup support?<i><\/i> Many schools have some form of a &quot;student startup&quot; program specifically around CS students. If they don&#x27;t, there may also be a &quot;college student&quot; specific VC fund nearby, such as [Contrary Capital](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contrarycap.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contrarycap.com&#x2F;<\/a>), [Dorm Room Fund](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dormroomfund.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dormroomfund.com&#x2F;<\/a>), or [Rough Draft VC](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roughdraft.vc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roughdraft.vc&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>_You_ may not start a business, but one of your peers might, and that creates a network that can help you get a job in the future. Plus, this opens up opportunities you may not have considered before.<p>It&#x27;s important for you that these are heavily associated with the computer science program and not uniquely available to the business students. Some schools only allow biz kids to do these; the money comes from a grant that&#x27;s only allocated for biz students.<p><i><\/i>Does the school have access to hackathons?<i><\/i> Hackathons may be for you, or they may not be. (I personally dislike them) But you should seek out a place where they exist or you have access to them. They encourage students to actually build things, which is the type of environment you want to be in. You should surround yourself with other people who are actually using their CS skills rather than just passing their classes.<p>Does the university host a hackathon? If not, is it in the local area? If not, does it sponsor students to go? If not, have _any_ students gone?<p>You&#x27;d be surprised how many schools with a CS program where all of those answers are &quot;no&quot;.<p><i><\/i>In general, you should a baseline goal in your university.<i><\/i> There&#x27;s obvious benefit to learning as much as you can in many different subjects while you have the time. But get a job at the end."],"time":["2020-06-01 00:51:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Ologn"],"id":[23372649],"kids":{},"parent":[23371530],"text":["In recent times I have been taking night and weekend classes to finish my CS bachelors along students half my age, so I will tell you what I told them.<p>One thing is we took CS classes, and also some English courses in writing.  Even on the job, those writing classes are important.  You will be writing e-mails, documentation etc. and being able to be clear and to the point is helpful.<p>Also, in my eyes, some students were not doing enough to get an IT job out of school, never mind a good IT job with an upward trajectory.  One guy told me &quot;I don&#x27;t study for quizzes since they are only 10% of the grade&quot;.  I studied for quizzes because they were 10% of the grade, but also because I wanted to keep up with the subject and know about it for the future.  Then part-way through a semester, or after a semester, I would often manifest whatever I learned.  So if I learned Java, I would write a project in Java for myself.  Or at least go on Github or somewhere and fix an issue on a Java project.  Or if I learned graphics programming I would write a graphics program, or at least contribute to a free&#x2F;open-source one.  Through this, I would take all the theory I had learned over some months and ground it and manifest it in real work.<p>Also you would probably do well to get on CS department mailing lists, and check the bulletin board or whatever for internship listings.<p>I was surprised how lackadaisical some kids took it.  Maybe it was their youth.  I have seen many people parlay their CS skills into everything from a well-paying job, to parlaying it into an enormous amount of money.  So I went above and beyond.  I recall one homework where we had to talk about process schedulers, something I was always interested in but never stopped to read about.  I figure in the first half hour of work, I already had gotten an A, but I spent hours and hours reading about process schedulers before turning in my homework.<p>I recall speaking to a bunch of the brighter CS seniors, and I mentioned something about version control.  &quot;Version control?&quot; one said.  I said, &quot;Yes, you know, like git&quot;.  &quot;Git?&quot; he said.  None of them knew what version control was.  You should know things like that before your first job interview, taking classes is not enough.  It&#x27;s good to know what algorithms are linear big O, and which are exponential, but you are going to have to learn some things they won&#x27;t teach you in class to get a job.  I would suggest going to Github, finding a project that has merged pull requests from a number of contributors recently, and looking at contributing a pull request to that project.  Then at least you&#x27;ll get an idea of what work is - someone posts a bug to issues, you look at it, you fix it and put up a pull request, then someone with more (or equivalent) experience looks at it and either gives you some pointers, or merges your changes.  At work you will be doing similar stuff."],"time":["2020-05-31 22:54:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["temp0531"],"id":[23374480],"kids":[23374905],"parent":[23371530],"text":["Do as many drugs and have as much sex as possible"],"time":["2020-06-01 02:39:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["paulcole"],"id":[23374281],"kids":[23376667],"parent":[23371530],"text":["The best advice I can give is <i>do not<\/i> take advice from anyone who graduated college more than 10 years or so ago.

A Wonderlic score of 20 is intended to be equivalent to an IQ score of 100 (e.g. the median), although it&#x27;s questionable how well it aligns with IQ which is tested using a pretty significantly different methodology - most significantly, completion time is a major factor in the Wonderlic (it is designed to be too long to complete within the short allotted time and the number of questions the candidate completes is a major factor in scoring), which is much less the case for IQ tests.<p>The use of the Wonderlic is actually surprisingly widespread if you haven&#x27;t been exposed to the world of industrial psychology.

First, it is available in a set of multiple test forms and it is well-known that some of the test forms are more difficult than others, so you cannot really compare scores between test forms like you would expect. There are probably still employers doing this even though the vendor now recommends against. Second, several of the questions are specifically related to uncommon vocabulary, and the questions further date back to the 1940s so a couple of them are somewhat archaic. This creates a strong preference against non-native English speakers. More generally, the Wonderlic is thought to emphasize literacy over numeracy or other areas of intelligence.<p>Intelligence measurement is a complex topic as many ways have been tried to measure intelligence and it&#x27;s not always understood how they relate to each other, as they do not necessarily correlate across people.

This was monitored by a light sensor on the screen and a circuit that monitored that area of the video signal going into the display device. A timer circuit started counting when the button was pushed and stopped when the change to the display was detected. We also automated out the human to collect mass data on the simulator latency.

It&#x27;s only recently that we&#x27;ve had the ability to think of UI elements as functions that automatically get called when their arguments update.<p>This article also doesn&#x27;t delve into why Facebook supports React so much. Or why Twitter, Reddit and the rest are switching to React. The answer being that React lets developers make really smooth, really addictive websites. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there was some studies showing that any flash of unstyled content, i.e. a server render round trip, lowers conversions by x%. Therefore having a client side app is imperative if you care about having your users on your site. Multiply it by Facebook&#x27;s revenue and paying the few million to fund a team of developers is a really good deal."],"time":["2020-05-31 23:49:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["satya71"],"id":[23371280],"kids":[23372189,23372141,23371472,23371751,23380806],"parent":[23366041],"text":["The only reason I choose React today is the immense ecosystem around it.
