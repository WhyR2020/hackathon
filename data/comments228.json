But often enough it&#x27;s faster to just eagerly materialize a list result.<p>Some other good tips: %timeit, ^C, sort -nk3, Numpy, Pandas, _sre, PyPy, native code.  In more detail:<p>• For benchmarking, use %timeit in IPython. It&#x27;s much easier and much more precise than time(1). For super lazy benchmarking use %%time instead.<p>• The laziest profiler is to interrupt your program with ^C. If you do this twice and get the same stack trace, it&#x27;s a good bet that&#x27;s where your hotspot is. cProfile is better, at least for single-threaded programs. Others here suggest line_profiler.<p>• If you have output from the profile or cProfile module saved in a file, you can use the pstats module to re-sort it by different fields. But you probably don&#x27;t, you have some text it output. The shell command `sort -nk3` will re-sort it numerically by column 3, which is close enough. In Vim you can highlight the output and type !sort -nk3, while in Emacs it&#x27;s M-| sort -nk3.<p>• You can probably speed up a pure Python program by a factor of 10 with Numpy or Pandas. If it&#x27;s not a numerical algorithm, it may not be obvious how, but it&#x27;s usually feasible. It requires sort of turning the whole problem sideways in your mind. You may not appreciate the effort when you are attempting to modify the code.<p>• The _sre module is blazingly fast for finite state machines over Unicode character streams. It can be worth it to transmogrify your problem into a regular expression if you can.<p>• PyPy is probably faster. Use it if you can.<p>• The standard advice is to rewrite your hotspots in C once you&#x27;ve found them. Maybe this should be updated; Cython, Rust, and C++ are all reasonable alternatives, and for invoking the C etc., you have available cffi and ctypes now. In Jython this is all much simpler because you can easily invoke code in Java, Kotlin, or Clojure from Jython. An underappreciated aspect of this is that using native code can save you a lot of memory as well as instructions, and that may be more important.

Thanks a lot for the work and for sharing! I subscribe to a lot of your premises and hypotheses.<p>So I thought I&#x27;d return the favor, some humble food for thought. Disclaimer: it&#x27;s all personal research[1].<p>On to the meat. Forgive the imperative tone sometimes, it&#x27;s all in good spirits and for brievety.<p>&gt; <i>The processing of feelings often includes thought processes<\/i><p>That&#x27;s possibly idiosyncratic imho.<p>Feeling and thought evolved, in this order, as general processing systems for the bodymind (feelings originate simply as &quot;the language of the body&quot;, neither good nor bad in nature but mostly communication of internal states; thinking is more correlated to sensory perception it seems — literally could have just been selected initially to process signals e.g. visual or auditory, then evolved from there).<p>They both now work in concert but there is no definite telling which dominates &quot;generally&quot;, it seems to differ a lot between individuals; e.g. men seem to have a stronger awareness of their internal state (&quot;thinking their emotions&quot;) whereas women tend to require strong physical states to reach awareness, and conversely report much more about &quot;feeling their thoughts&quot;, their mental state. This is just one statistical example among probably many variations of that order.<p>Stephen Covey in the famous <i>7 Habits<\/i> conveys this point: <i>“Between stimulus and response there is space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”<\/i> Great advice in itself, it hints at the fact that untrained people tend to respond <i>without<\/i> thinking, thereby promoting their emotions from &quot;guidance system&quot; to &quot;decision-making system&quot;.<p>I think that &quot;letting go&quot; and &quot;being spontaneous&quot; — what we do to dance <i>well<\/i>, emotionally — are positive modes (or rather balancing acts, responses) that strongly suggest a need to prefer emotions over thoughts at time. It&#x27;s certainly necessary on the way to survival (mating, hence dating, seduction; but also politics from the house to the office, etc.).<p>So I humbly suggest:<p>- everytime you framed analysis implying thought <i>after<\/i> or <i>in response to<\/i> emotions, it&#x27;s worth investigating a &quot;thoughtless&quot; direct response (note: in this context everything is a response, even in inaction we make a choice, e.g. to &quot;keep on listening&quot;).<p>- De-correlate the two poles of thought and emotion, seen independently as different types of parallel processing, different &quot;kinds&quot; of machines (different I&#x2F;O too).<p>- Consider operating modes where &quot;emotions = thoughts&quot; in the final output, in full agreement with one&#x27;s thoughts, to voluntarily &quot;stop thinking&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>To fully understand how this could be possible, we need to analyze all the differences between music and dreaming.<\/i><p>Actually I would look into testing physiological responses first (and notably not neglect the long-term benefits, the lasting psychological qualia (or its consequences, like soothing, or energizing) over hours, days, months even (as possibly counter-evidenced by cases of severe deprivation of dreaming).<p>&gt; <i>Dreaming is Much Older than Music<\/i><p>I think it speaks to the evolution of brain structures indeed, it seems that interpreting &quot;music&quot; is a rather advanced feature. It&#x27;s also largely possible that other species would hear &quot;music&quot; that sounds like random gibberish, noise to us — and vice-versa. We know <i>almost for sure<\/i> that other species don&#x27;t recognize human music, but there&#x27;s little in the way of telling what <i>could<\/i> actually be music to their ears.<p>&gt; <i>Within dreams, the content and the emotions are provided as a single fixed package.<\/i><p>I&#x27;m not sure about that. The systems involved in making the images&#x2F;story, and those involved in their perception and the feelings thereof might be largely distinct structures (assuming the brain keeps working generally the same regardless of wake state).<p>What I mean is that in both dreams and music, to my perception, the content is provided; whatever I <i>feel<\/i> or <i>think<\/i> about it comes after as an internal response&#x2F;state; finally I respond (whether suppressed or not by the body as when dreaming). Note that this is all in parallel, new data has entered perception by the time I respond to the last input.<p>I think it strengthens your case: the two processes are even more comparable in this view.<p>A word about imagination, which as I see it always takes off in-between &quot;processing results&quot; (from inputs) and &quot;call for a response&quot; (our final output) — this even tiny moment of hesitation to <i>validate<\/i> action before we do, which in some cases is temporally absent from perception, especially in heightened emotional states (e.g. adrenaline has a way of blurring&#x2F;blinding perception to the limbic low-level, the pains, the fears, etc.)<p>- For these physiological reasons, music (and any emotion-inducing activity) acts as a temporary &#x27;limbic painkiller&#x27; of sorts. Sorta occupies the mind, focus, perception.<p>- Imagination is both a crude low-level &quot;feeling&quot; about &quot;what <i>could<\/i>&quot; (be, have been, happen, etc) and rises up to high-level full-fledged &quot;thinking&quot; powerhouse specialized in creation. Again, this feeling-thinking dichotomy. In this I think we may observe how &quot;low-level emotions&quot; are swamping dreams whereas &quot;high-level thinking&quot; of the kind we invoke to process imaginary images upon music is much more controlled, indeed &#x27;aware&#x27; of its virtuality — it&#x27;s almost as if thinking was a higher-level processing system able to differentiate between reality and fiction, which emotions at a lower-level of processing don&#x27;t seem able to!<p>&gt; <i>This difference may be directly relevant to explaining why music is human-specific – because actively thinking about long-term goals is (as far as we know) a specifically human endeavour.<\/i><p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure about this whole long&#x2F;short-term dichotomy in this case; I think it&#x27;s more of a consequence of the above physiological systems that we are more <i>immediately<\/i> concerned with feelings in dreams and more <i>laid back<\/i> about a non-threatening wake situation — you have to realize how dramatically different both these moments are to the brain, below any form or degree consciousness.<p>Bluntly put, when survival is at stake, we see the deepest&#x2F;oldest structures emerge back in full-force (unsurprisingly low-level layers tend to be strongest at &quot;overriding&quot; general functioning).<p>&gt; <i>Strangeness<\/i><p>Really interesting take! I wonder if it&#x27;s also a matter of system (low&#x2F;high level, or thinking vs feeling, or a fluke of perception that switches off in dreams or is too complex to properly work at that level.<p>I&#x27;ve long identified &quot;familiarity&quot; as one of the big determinants (in humans as in animals, it&#x27;s one of those really low-level deeply refined mechanisms, that just appears about as soon as memory is possible, even ROM from DNA that produces unaware biological structures). Things just move &quot;towards&quot; the familiar &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;away&quot; from the &quot;unfamiliar&quot; or &quot;familiarly bad&quot;.<p>Which, when you think about it, can also be expressed in terms of strangeness, the reversed polarity of familiarity.<p>Regardless, your observations on strangeness do fit my current model&#x2F;view quite well[2].

The &quot;unconscious&quot; is yet another (sits below everything else as the proto-mind, the earliest processing system), and what I call &quot;will&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot; is about the highest-level, most developed (it roughly corresponds to the prefrontal cortex, biologically, and &quot;philosophy&quot; in our ontology). This is where long-term awareness happens, e.g. our ability to delay gratification — a clear case of thoughts totally overriding emotions.<p>I&#x27;ve observed a sort of &quot;tension&quot; (I really mean both the common term, and the math concept of tensors) between the unconscious and my node of &quot;will&#x2F;wisdom&quot; — it seems that both act as &quot;impulse drivers&quot;, sources of volition and willpower (which is notably in finite quantity for a day and tends to replenish after sleep&#x2F;dreaming, it also seems about the same for everyone but with significant differences which apparently are rather hard to change, train, de-train).<p>I&#x27;ll end it there unless you want more, but in general terms it seems that &#x27;wisdom&#x27; is the seat of our &#x27;informed and valued knowledge&#x27;, that is an integration of emotions and thoughts in a way that &quot;is right and feels right&quot;, it&#x27;s pretty much &quot;system 3: aggregator&quot; if you call the other two system 1 and system 2 like Daniel Kahneman.<p>That might be an angle worth looking at to frame&#x2F;model&#x2F;explore some of your questions.<p>Edits: typos and clarifications"],"time":["2020-01-14 05:00:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fg6hr"],"id":[22042435],"kids":{},"parent":[22036473],"text":["Connection between music and dreams is a very deep rabbit hole from which there is no return (in a good sense). This article does a good job at bringing attention to the topic, although ideas presented there are naive."],"time":["2020-01-14 07:42:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sudosteph"],"id":[22042086],"kids":{},"parent":[22036473],"text":["To expand on a comment reply I made earlier elsewhere in this thread, I think that the author is correct about there being a connection between music and dreaming. However, I&#x27;d venture there is another fundamental reason that is not mentioned in the content above.<p>I posit that both dreaming and music listening (including listening via imagination, like a song stuck in your head) are both actually fundamentally processes of pattern recognition and pattern generation happening together in real-time. In a dream, our mind is generating visual, auditory and mental&#x2F;emotional stimuli based on the real stimuli we&#x27;ve experience in our waking lives. It&#x27;s not purely replays of real life jumbled up, because many of us have experienced dreams where we&#x27;ve created passable imagery of imaginary individuals we&#x27;ve never seen before and probably don&#x27;t exist.<p>I think music is fundamentally the same thing. We hear a song once that creates mental&#x2F;auditory stimuli, and our brain is able to recognize the general patterns and compress it into pieces of data we can replay at a later time. We don&#x27;t listen X different times to a song per X individual instruments being played, but often if we hear a prominent part of an individual the song out of the context we will immediately recognize it as part of another song. For a well-known example, imagine the bass line from &quot;under pressure&quot;&#x2F;&quot;ice ice baby&quot; and how just imagining that bass line lets you conjure up totally seperate parts from either of those two songs in your memory. You can now sing back those different parts of those songs and people will easily recognize it, even if you are technically singing in a different key, a slower tempo, and you flub some words.<p>So in this hypothesis, even listening to music is not a passive action because your brain is engaged with recognizing and real-time generating the next parts of it (ie singing along). So when the author says:<p>&gt; Nevertheless... music is often accompanied by a non-specific desire to engage in some level of active behaviour. Because this desire is very non-specific, and because musical feelings are more strongly bound to things that match the rhythm and&#x2F;or melody of the music, the end result is that the desire to engage in such activity can be satified either by dancing or by joining in with the performance of the music.<p>It&#x27;s clear that dancing and joining in make sense because listening and&#x2F;or imagining music itself is a generative process of imagination + memories (or perhaps &quot;delusional&quot; to use the term in the article).<p>As an somewhat interesting aside: I mentioned that I have ADHD in the other comment. One of the interesting, though very under-studied things I&#x27;ve discovered about myself and some others with ADHD is that many of us end up with songs playing in our head constantly (see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ADHD&#x2F;comments&#x2F;7tu8jz&#x2F;music_is_constantly_running_in_my_head&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ADHD&#x2F;comments&#x2F;7tu8jz&#x2F;music_is_const...<\/a> ). Some studies talk about getting a particular song stuck in someone&#x27;s head as an OCD type thing, but this type of &quot;head radio&quot; as I call it, doesn&#x27;t necessarily stick to the same thing forever and really isn&#x27;t very mentally distressing. Sometimes even I&#x27;ll get unique tunes stuck in my head that I end up writing out later. Until high-school I assumed everyone had music playing in the background of their heads at all times, but when I started taking medication I noticed it became less frequent. So I&#x27;m of the opinion that the &quot;head radio&quot; was mostly a form of mental fidgeting, part of the hyperactivity component of ADHD."],"time":["2020-01-14 06:22:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22041735],"kids":{},"parent":[22036473],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-14 05:01:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["FailMore"],"id":[22043044],"kids":{},"parent":[22036473],"text":["Quote:<p>Dreams can contain strange and altered realities. However dreams are never about the strangeness or the alteration of reality.<p>If people with bad intentions are chasing you in a dream, you don&#x27;t start thinking about why your life changed so much that now you have people wanting to kill you. All you think about is what you need to do to prevent those people catching up with you and killing you, which might involve running, or attacking your attackers, or perhaps calling out for help.<p>Given that dreams are often seem very strange when we wake up and remember them, but don&#x27;t &quot;feel strange&quot; when we are dreaming them, it is plausible to suppose that our sense of &quot;strangeness&quot; is actively suppressed when we are dreaming.<p>End quote.<p>This is correct. During REM dreaming the executive functions on the brain are shut off. Why is this?<p>We can remember some of our dreams, and in our dreams we behave. This means we get to examine our unconstrained behaviours and judge them for their suitability to the situation.<p>The situations our brains construct during REM dreams are formed in incredibly neurologically biased conditions. Norepinephrine levels, a stress related neurotransmitter, are 85% below <i>base<\/i> waking levels during REM dreaming (Norepinephrine levels spike after a stressful event, but it&#x27;s 85% below resting levels!). And there is plenty of evidence to show, low Norepinephrine levels mean a relaxed mind.<p>Think of the fantasies that the brain creates during moments of fear when awake. Say you have a fear of flying, the fantasies all urge avoidance - &#x27;the plane will crash&#x27;, &#x27;the wheels will fall off before we land&#x27;, etc... That is how the brain builds fantasies when Norepinephrine levels are high. When they are low fantasies urge the opposite of avoidance - they urge action. You are being attacked -&gt; you need to fight back. Someone is trying to steal your things -&gt; stop them. Someone has upset you -&gt; tell them.<p>So we find ourselves in situations in our dreams which demand action, and we get to see how we behave on a solely emotional level (because executive functions are off). If we are not behaving in accordance to what the action-demanding situation requires, then we have learnt something about a fear we have. Something present at an emotional level which is stopping us from taking useful action.<p>Correcting that is a matter of consciously breaking this pattern in your waking life. Taking action when you were previously scared to and discovering you are ok, and did not need to be scared.<p>From my experience working with dreams in therapy (mine and with others in theirs), good dream analysis acts as an incredibly astute method to diagnose unconscious anxieties.<p>I got very interested in dreams after their usefulness in my therapy, so wrote a paper on the above with 13 examples of dreams in (5 are mine if I remember correctly).

It is much simpler to build a correct text&#x2F;string CRDT on top of a predictable, stable, graph CRDT that is understandable.<p>Another example is, in our blog editing tools, despite having spent years researching &amp; implementing (+ others in our community) precise character-by-character CRDT resolution schemes, I found I personally had a much better offline &amp; local first user experience with a predictable per-paragraph sync scheme.<p>This is a stupid simple approach, but what it means is that I as a user, can easily predict whats going to happen, so if I&#x27;m offline I know I should just copy a new paragraph and fiddle with things there, cause it isn&#x27;t gonna get &quot;auto delete regrammar merged&quot;.<p>Generally speaking, me and colleagues don&#x27;t &quot;fight&quot; over the same paragraph, we&#x27;re usually concurrently writing different &quot;sections&quot; at the same time, it is pretty rare to grammar fix their edit same paragraph as they&#x27;re typing it - that is also just kinda, rude looking.<p>Anyways, finally, is that the majority of text styling and DOM edge cases can be handled by having a deterministic canonical DOM hierarchy that always gets applied at the editing layer, BEFORE any CRDT operations even occur.<p>So for instance, re-arrange the DOM tree such that &lt;i&gt; is always inside &lt;u&gt; inside &lt;b&gt;, or something like that.<p>We built this into a library called normalize, and it instantly eliminated so much complexity, especially at the CRDT level.

They delegate as much of it as possible to people who bill at lower rates, like assistants, paralegals and junior associates. So you&#x27;re not really automating much of the attorney&#x27;s work at all. Even if you build an ergonomic software platform for routine tasks (like Atrium&#x27;s glorified Dropbox), the amount of time&#x2F;money it would save over the course of a large engagement is de minimis.

And the tools don&#x27;t contribute meaningfully to the legal side&#x27;s pitching for work in part because they don&#x27;t save the prospective client much money. Meanwhile, the software side can&#x27;t sell the tools to other law firms because the software side is tied to a law firm. Ultimately, they end up with a bunch of lawyers and software developers who can&#x27;t help each other.

The history leading up to this article is relevant. His modus operandi is to severely criticise clinical trials to an audience that is only peripherally or not at all involved in the field. You can see why this works - being extremely shrill about something to people that don&#x27;t have any idea tends to garner agreement, since they can&#x27;t evaluate your claims and you seem so adamant about it. It creates the illusion of someone that is &#x27;telling it like it is&#x27; and not just following the norms of the profession.<p>The problem is that this doesn&#x27;t generate anything of actual value, except for Prasad. It is easy to criticise medicine. It is easy to criticise any complex and difficult human endeavour. He takes the practice of critical thinking about studies and results and what they mean, something which all doctors do and are taught to do, and turns it into a blood sport which plays to the masses. There are plenty of academics who do what he does, and publish in well respected journals. At any conference where a major result is presented, people in the audience get up and ask questions about the value of the intervention, the conduct of the study etc, just the kind of things Prasad rants about. The difference is that Prasad has monetised this practice by pretending that he is the only one doing it. He writes books, publishes endless articles which are mainly reviews and rehashings of other&#x27;s work and the person that hired him to a faculty position openly admits they chose him because of his propensity for scathing criticism.<p>This article therefore, I find largely self-indulgent and in some parts sheer nonsense. The authors style themselves as custodians of some higher art, a priesthood of common sense and clear thinking. They pull the trick of trying to cement their importance by defending themselves against a bogeyman, the force of &#x27;commercialisation&#x27;. Of course, there is no single person or group who is causing this commercialisation, so there is nobody to question them.

The experience was like taking acid, and I have never replicated it since.<p>The notation is a red herring, like parentheses in Lisp. APL succeeds by intensively plumbing an extraordinarily limited domain of multidimensional arrays. It conquered a much wider scope because distance from a problem is countered by the intensity of the light; compare the sun to a flashlight in your hand. And the limited domain allowed the combinators to reach critical mass, like the fusion fueling the sun.<p>APL was intended for mathematicians, who are used to fitting the tools that they have to a problem. Since APL, we have never accepted general purpose languages built on such a limited scope, making it that much harder for our combinators to achieve critical mass.<p>At 64 I daydream at what could have been, stunned that computer languages haven&#x27;t developed further by now. I&#x27;ve chased the promise here in every Lisp, finding experiences lost in other languages but the promise ultimately elusive. Haskell comes closest to a practical language realizing my early soaring with APL; one experiences a fluid algebra of combinators even as other aspects are as calcified and off-limits to manipulation as C.<p>At their best, the parser combinators of functional languages are indistinguishable from the notation in one&#x27;s mind for parsing. Most programmers see clumsy parsing in college and never master the idea. If one could imagine a world where all programmers are fluent in parsing, a suitable domain for a language could be the application of parser combinators to strongly typed trees. One gains the critical mass advantages of an APL limited domain, but with a domain better suited to modern computer science. In particular, one could achieve the homoiconicity of Lisp, with the hope of better macro tools. Ever stare in amazement that all life on earth developed from the same impoverished code base? Now look at how all macro systems resemble each other.

If they do want scientists to be free to investigate the genetic and other bases of IQ further in order to find better answers, then it seems like they want scientists to first find a way to talk about it publicly without specifying the categories or where members of a category tend to fall on the scale.<p>There is a chilling effect on various lines of inquiry. For now, you can claim the information is out there, but any further writings could become more esoteric or limited. In the case of IQ, I don&#x27;t think certain people want scientific answers as to why. They would rather assume IQ is highly malleable while they run social and economic experiments to find ways to equalize it and other factors that predict success."],"time":["2020-01-15 07:46:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["robomartin"],"id":[22050657],"kids":[22050741,22051026],"parent":[22049951],"text":["Not saying for a moment that this conference is authoritative at all.

It&#x27;s a mess of indescribable proportions.<p>Why are deniers right?<p>Well, they are not.  There&#x27;s no denying this.  Where they are right is in the outcome they are helping create:  Taking action to &quot;save the planet&quot; is going nowhere.<p>How are deniers wrong?<p>Well, their belief system is completely skewed and devoid of scientific support.  They believe in a fantasy they have woven over time.<p>OK, then.<p>Why are proponents right?<p>Well, because climate change is real.  We have irrefutable data going back 800,000 years to show how things used to be on earth and how we influenced things in the last, say, 200 years.  One look at atmospheric CO2 concentration and it is impossible to argue against it.  And that&#x27;s just the start.<p>How are proponents wrong then?<p>Well, because they have turned this thing into an ugly combination of politics and religion.  It&#x27;s as irrational as can be and EVERYONE is lying through their teeth.<p>The greatest lie is that we can actually &quot;save the planet&quot;.  It&#x27;s an absolute pile of manure.<p>Politicians are the worst.  They are using climate change as a battering ram to drive votes.  And 100% of what they say are lies.  And 100% of what they want to do is pointless and maybe even dangerous.<p>OK, you might say:  That&#x27;s crazy!  What proof do you have to support this?<p>Easy:  Exactly the same proof we have to show climate change is real.  That is 800,000 years of atmospheric CO2 data resulting from ice core sampling.<p>This is the point where people don&#x27;t bother to do the work and either dismiss or attack the messenger (rather than to think, follow the argument and actually apply a bit of critical thinking).<p>Step 1:  Check out the graph for the last 800,000 years of CO2 fluctuation.

This is beyond silly now.  It&#x27;s tragic.<p>We know that the natural down-slope rate of change is in the order of 50,000 years for 100 ppm without humanity, factories, cars, planes, etc.<p>What politicians and zealots are talking about is achieving somewhere in the order of 1000x better performance while all 7 billion people, our cities, factories, technology, etc. remains on the planet.  I mean, you don&#x27;t need to do any math to understand how silly this is.<p>All you have to do is look at these graphs, look at the rate of change and ask:  How are we going to do 1,000 times better?  How are we going to do that without using unimaginable amounts of energy and resources to the point that we are far more likely to kill everything on the planet than fix it.<p>These are planetary scale problems that require beyond planetary scale energy and resources to &quot;fix&quot;.  The sooner we start talking about the realities of climate change --that we can&#x27;t fix it or &quot;save the planet&quot;-- and stop being hysterical about it, the sooner we can start talking about how to live with it and improve things to the extent possible.  Which also means both sides will meet somewhere in the middle.<p>BTW, this does not mean we should not clean-up our act at all.  We should.  All we have to do is stop lying about the reasons for it.  There are plenty of legitimate reasons to live in cleaner cities with renewable power sources, climate change and saving the planet just happen to not be among them, not if we want to talk about reality vs. fantasy.<p>BTW, don&#x27;t take my word for it.

Indeed, the available empirical evidence now suggests that there are deep problems across the board with these ideas and approaches (here, here, here, here, here, here, here for more on this point). However, these frameworks and interventions are already so deeply entrenched – including within institutions of higher learning — that the empirical research is now almost entirely beside the point». Of course, this open-mindedness was more than matched by extreme suspicion and demand for rigour in the other direction[3], which we also see here.<p>Also consider that personal views of experimenters affect what results they get, with a very large effect size – larger than most effect sizes actually discovered in social science[4], which, given political leanings in sciences such as psychology[5] and the replication crisis, makes one wonder how much trust should be given even to actual long-standing scientific arguments against politically unpopular ideas. But such arguments make an incredibly small contribution to the intellectual rejection of this research.<p>To people who argue on the topic of race &amp; intelligence (which is indeed the most obvious, the most politicized, but not the only point of contention), bringing up arguments like &quot;research did not control for environmental differences&quot; or &quot;g factor is meaningless&quot; or &quot;IQ tests are not fair&quot;, I want to say: you know almost nothing on the issue, you don&#x27;t understand how little you know[6], and the fact that you perceive yourself as knowing enough to make confident judgements is precisely the testament to the power ideology has over popular reporting. But it does not yet have equal power over science, which is why actual researchers have views very different from yours[7], and of course all these criticisms were understood, and many addressed, decades ago, e.g.: «A 1999 literature review re-examined the conclusions of Bias in Mental Testing using new data. It concluded that empirical evidence strongly supported Jensen&#x27;s conclusion that mental tests are equally valid measures of ability for all English-speaking people born in the United States. The review further argued that misinformation about bias in IQ tests is very pervasive, and thus it is important for the empirical data in this field to be clearly conveyed to the public»[8]. If you wish to learn about it, better read «The Neuroscience of Intelligence» by Richard J. Haier from Cambridge University Press, 2016[9], it&#x27;s an excellent summary. Don&#x27;t rely on Youtube videos and opinionated blog posts.<p>I could go on and on.

Where a lot of the time if you are explicit all the “mystery” goes away?<p>So when you say an ought statement “A should do B”, what you really mean is “A should do B if A wants C to happen” which expands to “If A does B and C doesn’t happen, then any D can’t blame A if D wants to be rational”. It’s a bit self referential like that.<p>Ok so now everything suddenly becomes clear and you find you can’t formulate a single basic question about morality in English that doesn’t have an obvious answer. “You should do your homework! Unless you don’t care about your grades.” or “You should be consistent! Unless you don’t care about being viewed as a hypocrite.”<p>What if things simply were, and scrupulously including unspoken clauses made all basic questions about consciousness have obvious answers?<p>“What is it like to be a bat” is not a well formulated question.<p>However, try including the subject and object of the sentence all the time.<p>The bat saw the phenomenon<p>The bat’s body experienced a feeling<p>And so on.<p>Then the question comes down to two things:<p>1) Identity. That is a mental construct that organisms develop. It can have a lot of layers, such as how you see yourself, how you choose to express yourself, etc. But the biggest one is how you identify with the person you were a few years ago and with who you will be in the future. If you were gonna go on a vacation for 2 weeks but later not remember anything about it, does it matter where you go? Do you do things just to make your 80 year old self proud to remember them? And so on.<p>2) Existence. Yes actually the word existence has no well-defined meaning without resorting to conscious observers. Consider the question of whether the Harry Potter World exists or not. How is it different than not existing or a made-up work like blabladeblaa? The sentence “the Harry Potter World Really Exists” has almost no meaning without resorting to consciousness, we are just used to saying that word. Be thorough and you’ll always invoke yourself and your conscious awareness.<p>Now what if life never arose in the universe? In what sense would the universe exist any more than a Harry Potter world?<p>So in a way, the concepts of existence of consciousness are duals of each other!<p>People often think that the concept of existence is something fundamental.

The concept of something having &#x27;not happened yet&#x27; really means &#x27;we haven&#x27;t experienced it yet&#x27; - it&#x27;d be like saying that the house 5 blocks away isn&#x27;t on fire &#x27;yet&#x27;, simply because we haven&#x27;t walked 5 blocks over and seen it yet. If we were able to move through time as freely as we move through other dimensions, then a house that catches on fire &#x27;tomorrow&#x27; is really on fire &#x27;now&#x27;(&#x27;now&#x27; really isn&#x27;t the right word here, but I don&#x27;t think a better one exists) - we just have to walk down the street into tomorrow and see it.<p>In this way, we also exist as infants and as old men and women at the same time. We experience on infinitesimally small slice of ourselves at a time, each slice being a moment in time. Why don&#x27;t we experience this all at once? Our body IS existing in the past and the future and the now, we are all tasting our 60th birthday cake right now, but we don&#x27;t experience it yet.<p>There are two possibilities: \nConsciousness is the one thing that exists outside of time, such that instead of existing throughout our whole lifespan consistently and experiencing our whole life at once and constantly, we move through time experiencing one moment at a time, and maybe move into and out of time via birth&#x2F;death. If you start thinking about memory this gets very interesting(as does the other possibility) in so far as memory is represented by the physical state of your brain and memory stores &#x27;past&#x27; events. Basically implying that for some reason the 4D shape of your brain is such that on the &#x27;future&#x27; side of your brain there are neurons arranged in such a way to describe what the state of your brain is on the &#x27;past&#x27; side.<p>OR, consciousness does exist within 4 dimensions as our bodies do, and we ARE experiencing our entire lives at once. I don&#x27;t know about you, but for me it FEELS like I&#x27;m only experiencing this single moment right now. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not also experiencing every other moment right now. At this moment in time, my brain is in a certain state(in terms of neurons and neurochemicals), that state encodes my memories and feelings that I have at this moment, personally I think that state encodes all the qualities of my consciousness, but I know this could be argued. So if I were experiencing all moments at once, then this moment would feel exactly like it would feel if this were the only moment I was experiencing. I would also be experiencing moments in the future, and in those moments this moment would be just a memory. So how do I know whether I&#x27;m experiencing those other moments as well right now, this current moment clearly feels unique to me and it seems like the only moment I&#x27;m experiencing, but maybe that&#x27;s how all moments feel. Maybe there is a different &#x27;me&#x27; experiencing every other moment right now, and I happen to be in this moment typing this message BECAUSE this moment IS the one where I happen to be sitting here typing this message. The me that&#x27;s eating my 60th birthday cake is also doing that right now, and not thinking about the nature of consciousness, but maybe has a vague memory of this moment because the physical structure of my brain encodes &#x27;previous&#x27; brain states as memories in &#x27;future&#x27; brain states for whatever reason."],"time":["2020-01-14 21:31:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["empath75"],"id":[22044966],"kids":{},"parent":[22044749],"text":["This is textbook God of the Gaps<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;God_of_the_gaps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;God_of_the_gaps<\/a><p>It adds nothing to our understanding of the universe, but it gives some people a warm and fuzzy feeling."],"time":["2020-01-14 15:28:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gaius__baltar"],"id":[22048306],"kids":{},"parent":[22044749],"text":["Do you remember when this philosophy was called animism?"],"time":["2020-01-14 20:26:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["philodelta"],"id":[22048047],"kids":{},"parent":[22044749],"text":["Broadening the definition of consciousness to the literal limits  seems pointless, it dilutes the already difficult to manifest definition of consciousness to complete uselessness."],"time":["2020-01-14 19:57:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xamuel"],"id":[22045116],"kids":[22045218,22045665,22045550,22045279,22045273,22045135],"parent":[22044749],"text":["This is the exact wrong direction we should take if we want to have any hope of understanding consciousness.

I thought that it fit reasonably well under the term &quot;panpsychism&quot;, but this article is making me think it may be something slightly different.  Under the expectation that it has already been studied, I&#x27;m now curious what it is named.<p>In short, I am a computationalist[1]: consciousness is a pattern that may appear in physical processes.  I expect it can be translated into different physical processes.  I think the definitional boundary separating conscious processes from other processes is subjective, even if there are common landmarks we generally agree are on one side or the other.<p>That seems all well and good.  However I am not a hard materialist[2]: I do not believe that physicalism addresses the hard problem of consciousness[3].  I like to note this by the absence of timelessness in my experience: the present moment seems to be distinguished from the perceived past and future only because I am experiencing it.  Contrast this to a physical description or model of myself and my surroundings that seems sound without reference to a specific &quot;present&quot; moment.  To see that such a model does not contain a &quot;now&quot;, think about simulating it: you would need to choose a moment on the timeline to start, to insert a &quot;now&quot;.  Physical models don&#x27;t seem to capture the notion of &quot;present moment&quot;.  Attempts to shoe-horn it in (with e.g. consciousness particles or what have you) seem simultaneously untestable and offensive to Occam&#x27;s razor.<p>Subjective experience then seems to be unaccounted for. I am content saying it is not found in any model of physical processes, only in the physical processes themselves.  Notice I am no longer talking about consciousness: the computation and brain state is still susceptible to description.  Only the subjective experience, whose toe we can catch with the present moment, escapes.<p>Odd as it might sound, I find it tempting to say that the subjective experience is not personal.  It seems incommunicable, but what I mean is that there is no aspect of myself in it: that&#x27;s all over in the computation (incidentally I am reminded of one of the objections to &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot;[4].)<p>At this point, the idea of &quot;Atman&quot;[5] is starting to look pretty good (thank you those who found the Adviata link, I would not have.)  However, besides Prof. Grim&#x27;s touch on the topic I know nothing about it (haw).  My impression of Atman is that it is ineffable, primitive and pervasive.  It does not have a location because it is not a thing: it is an aspect of reality.<p>And now we arrive at panpsychism, or at least what I thought panpsychism is.  Subjective experience, but not the computational content that gives rise to the more visible parts of consciousness, is a fundamental aspect of reality.  Rocks have subjective experience.  Rocks are not conscious, unless they include physical processes we choose to recognize as consciousness.  A rock&#x27;s subjective experience is a lot like your subjective experience of the IR spectrum, assuming that you are like me and have no qualia affected by it.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegreatcourses.com&#x2F;courses&#x2F;mind-body-philosophy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegreatcourses.com&#x2F;courses&#x2F;mind-body-philosophy...<\/a>\n[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computational_theory_of_mind\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computational_theory_of_mind<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Materialism\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Materialism<\/a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hard_problem_of_consciousness\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hard_problem_of_consciousness<\/a>\n[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cogito,_ergo_sum#Use_of_%22I%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cogito,_ergo_sum#Use_of_%22I%2...<\/a>\n[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advaita_Vedanta\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advaita_Vedanta<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-14 22:58:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anentropic"],"id":[22047234],"kids":{},"parent":[22044749],"text":["no-one knows..."],"time":["2020-01-14 18:50:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Altheasy"],"id":[22047724],"kids":{},"parent":[22044749],"text":["Pure nonsense theory"],"time":["2020-01-14 19:27:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwawaymanbot"],"id":[22047558],"kids":{},"parent":[22044749],"text":["We are just electrons effecting electrons."],"time":["2020-01-14 19:15:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["Veedrac"],"id":[22047305],"kids":[22047521,22047441,22047754],"parent":[22044749],"text":["Panpsychism is incredibly silly.

The RFC defines two datetime string formats - &quot;UTCTime&quot; which has a two-digit year, and &quot;GeneralizedTime&quot; which as a four-digit year. The two-digit one is parsed as 0 &lt;= YY &lt; 50 implying 20YY and 50 &lt;= YY &lt; 100 implying 19YY. For not-before and not-after times, certificates are required to use UTCTime for datetimes before 2050 and only use GeneralizedTime for times after that.<p>So there can be applications today that parse ASN.1 datetimes manually (1) but only expect the UTCTime format.

If a local regulation diminishes the value of land by imposing new limitations on the use of the property— such as increasing the minimum lot size or changing the zoning to lower-value uses—the jurisdiction must compensate the property owner for his loss.

Despite this, he published sparingly. He hated to commit himself to arguments unless he was certain of them. What he did produce however were numerous, and lengthy, drafts of papers and books (at least two of which never saw the light of day) that were widely circulated amongst the philosophical community and even more voluminous comments and responses to other philosophers on how they could improve their arguments.

Upon first glance I noticed the recycling of the old trope the iPhone, which I&#x27;ve seen before in this essayist&#x27;s prose.

I recall with equal love and loyalty my Creative Zen Mosaic mp3 player, circa 2009, which led to no such outcome for Creative, not for lack of my extreme love and admiration.  And let it also be known that the essay commits no shortage of fallacies, most notably the straw man fallacy, in which we are led to believe that most investors think only about the current size of the market.  Either we are supposed to believe that those in positions of wealth, power, and influence, have no concept of how markets might change in size over time, or might not have a concept of time altogether.  Both equally unlikely.  Instead, we tell ourselves smugly, that investors must all be robber baron caricatures like the oilmen of yore or the real estate tycoon who now inhabits the white house, completely unaware of the changing and dynamic nature of the world, and that we, though we may be poor, might be able to create fabulous wealth with this secret knowledge."],"time":["2020-01-13 21:51:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xs"],"id":[22037091],"kids":[22037131,22037147],"parent":[22035997],"text":["Anyone know anything about investing in podcasts?

It would be perfectly fine to convey the same thoughts by just being a bit more humble and make it clear that these are just his (unfounded) opinions.<p>&gt; I look for founders who are scrappy and formidable at the same time (a rarer combination than it sounds); mission-oriented, obsessed with their companies, relentless, and determined; extremely smart (necessary but certainly not sufficient); decisive, fast-moving, and willful; courageous, high-conviction, and willing to be misunderstood; strong communicators and infectious evangelists; and capable of becoming tough and ambitious.<p>&gt; The spectral signatures of the best companies I’ve invested in are remarkably similar.  They usually have most of the following characteristics: compelling founders, a mission that attracts talented people into the startup’s orbit, a product so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, a rapidly growing market, a network effect and low marginal costs, the ability to grow fast, and a product that is either fundamentally new or 10x better than existing options.<p>This reads like a bad Tinder profile. It becomes problematic when aspiring entrepreneurs (I certainly have been guilty of this when I was just starting out) start believing they should now optimize for a certain founder profile that a particular investor (especially a well-known one, like Sam Altman) is looking for. Other investors have other profiles, I know of one who supposedly only invests in GSB graduates, even though his investment track record has very little to do with GSB. When you believe this as a young founder, you&#x27;ll work hard to fit that profile and will reach out to them when you think you&#x27;ve finally marked off all the check marks, only to find out that the investors will back track on their thesis and find another reason not to fund you. The truth is that most investor theses, no matter how well formulated, break down in the face of FOMO, and will not matter much when it comes to writing checks.

IMO, the Python community found a middle ground and made it work."],"time":["2020-01-13 21:15:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mikl"],"id":[22038285],"kids":[22039111],"parent":[22036773],"text":["There’s no doubt that the 2 -&gt; 3 transition was rough for the Python community.

In Python 2, a &#x27;&#x27; string literal is a sequence of bytes. In Python 3, a &#x27;&#x27; string literal is a sequence of Unicode code points. These are fundamentally different types. And in Mercurial&#x27;s code base, most of our string types are binary by design: use of a Unicode based str for representing data is flat out wrong for our use case. We knew that Mercurial would need to eventually switch many string literals from &#x27;&#x27; to b&#x27;&#x27; to preserve type compatibility. But doing so would be problematic.<p>&gt; In the early days of Mercurial&#x27;s Python 3 port in 2015, Mercurial&#x27;s project maintainer (Matt Mackall) set a ground rule that the Python 3 port shouldn&#x27;t overly disrupt others: he wanted the Python 3 port to more or less happen in the background and not require every developer to be aware of Python 3&#x27;s low-level behavior in order to get work done on the existing Python 2 code base. This may seem like a questionable decision (and I probably disagreed with him to some extent at the time because I was doing Python 3 porting work and the decision constrained this work). But it was the correct decision. Matt knew that it would be years before the Python 3 port was either necessary or resulted in a meaningful return on investment (the value proposition of Python 3 has always been weak to Mercurial because Python 3 doesn&#x27;t demonstrate a compelling advantage over Python 2 for our use case).<p>As a general rule, this seems like good practice, but surely b-strings, print_function, etc are a trivial upfront cost, and one that would have to be paid sooner or later anyway?"],"time":["2020-01-13 19:45:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j88439h84"],"id":[22037584],"kids":[22037713,22038884,22038778,22038023],"parent":[22036773],"text":["A lot of Mercurial&#x27;s issues would have been resolved much easier if they&#x27;d used the common tools for maintaining polyglot 2&#x2F;3 code instead of trying to invent everything themselves.<p>Futurize and Pasturize in particular provide essentially all of the features that this post laments missing.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python-future.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python-future.org&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-13 20:17:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mbar84"],"id":[22040668],"kids":{},"parent":[22036773],"text":["I guess this is as good a time as any to pimp my work in this area: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;lib3to6&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;lib3to6&#x2F;<\/a><p>lib3to6 is a Python compatibility library similar to to BableJS.

At least in Python 3, if your string only contains ASCII, then the underlying representation will use one byte per character, so ASCII-only strings are stored just as efficiently as ASCII-only bytes instances.<p>I think there are two mental models for how to approach the str&#x2F;bytes split:<p>1.) A `str` is for unicode use cases, and a `bytes` is better for cases that don&#x27;t support unicode.<p>2.) A `bytes` is an array of numbers between 0 and 255. A `str` should almost always be used when your value is conceptually a sequence of characters. `str` doesn&#x27;t imply that arbitrary unicode is allowed, and it&#x27;s fine to have a convention that a particular `str` is ASCII-only, just like other conventions you might have on variable values.<p>My impression is that #1 is the Python 2 mental model and is tempting for Python 3, but that #2 often works better when writing Python 3 code. Under mental model #2, asking for &quot;%s&quot; formatting is really asking for a replacement strategy that detects the number 37 followed by the number 155 in an array of numbers and fills in a sub-array, which seems more strange and likely to get false positives if you&#x27;re really working with binary data like the bytes of a .jpg file.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure the devil is in the details, and maybe a project like mercurial has to stay backcompat with bytes data that is neither ASCII nor valid UTF-8, or some other compelling reason to stick with bytes everywhere."],"time":["2020-01-13 20:25:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gfxgirl"],"id":[22043194],"kids":{},"parent":[22036773],"text":["I wish more devs cared about backward compatibility not just in python but in general.
