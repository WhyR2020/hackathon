What a great way to cut my teeth professionally!<p>Yeah, it was a big deal. Pretty much all dev work was done by me and one other guy. How much dev work could a school district have back then? Oh, lots. Every school, and in some cases individual educators, would send in requests for various reports, and each one required configuring a mainframe job, running it, and doing some kind of thing with the output (conversion to a &quot;modern&quot; format on a 3.5&quot; disk or printing it or something). Every payroll cycle required a lot of manual labor, every report card cycle, there were daily student attendance jobs, and this particular district had a rather advanced, for the time, centrally-managed network across the entire district with Solaris DNS.<p>So on top of all this regular workload, we had to go over pretty much every single line of COBOL in that mainframe, visually, and search for Y2K-related bugs. There were many. The Solaris box needed to be patched too, and the first patches that came out weren&#x27;t great and I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing yet either.<p>So we started on this in earnest in Summer of 1997, while everyone was out of school. We ran a lot of test jobs, which involved halting all regular work, monkeying around with the mainframe&#x27;s date, and then running a payroll job to see what blew up. By late 1999, my mentor there was pulling multiple all-nighters. He had a family of his own too and it really impacted his health.<p>There were mountains of greenbar printouts in our little office, all code, with bright red pen marks. Such was life when working on a mainframe at the time. The school district also brought out of retirement the guy who had written much of the key operating system components for our mainframe. I believe he came on as a consultant at rates that would be pretty nice even by today&#x27;s standards.<p>In the end, school restarted after winter vacation and most things ran okay. A few jobs blew up where we had missed something here or there, but everyone by then had got sort of accustomed to the chaos and it just needed a phone call to say, &quot;it broke, we&#x27;re working on it, call you tomorrow&quot;.<p>Rough estimate, there was probably over a thousand hours&#x27; worth of labor to fix it all. Had that not been done, virtually nothing in that school district would have worked correctly by the beginning of 2000. (Some things started failing a month or two in advance, depending on the date arithmetic they needed to do.)<p>And these weren&#x27;t just &quot;year 100&quot; printer errors; a lot of things simply barfed in some fancy way or another, or produced nonsense output, or -- in the most fun cases -- produced a lot of really incorrect data that was then handed off to other jobs, which then produced a lot of even more incorrect data, and then saved it all to the database."],"time":["2020-03-12 20:04:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stretchwithme"],"id":[22561376],"kids":{},"parent":[22556156],"text":["An avoidable problem can become real if you don&#x27;t take the actions required to avoid it."],"time":["2020-03-12 21:29:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wrmsr"],"id":[22564554],"kids":{},"parent":[22556156],"text":["Was the cold war real?"],"time":["2020-03-13 04:50:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mywittyname"],"id":[22557992],"kids":[22558219,22558498,22558690],"parent":[22556156],"text":["We are lucky that the Y2k issue was so understandable by the public.

Arthur Whitney&#x27;s daughter worked at the sponsoring company, and he agreed to come tell us about K.<p>In retrospect, I don&#x27;t think we gave him the welcome he deserved.  No one was rude or anything, but it seemed there was a disconnect:  Arthur was keen to show off how <i>fast<\/i> K (and Kdb) was, over zillions and zillions of rows.<p>But the thing that the Clojurists were all searching for (that got them into Clojure in the first place) was <i>expressivity<\/i>.  Is Clojure fast?  I don&#x27;t know, generally the problems I face come down to avoiding balls of mud rather than performance bottlenecks.  And I think that was true of most there.<p>So Arthur got something of an underwhelming reception.  I remember someone asking &quot;Does K have the ability to self-modify, a la Lisp macros?&quot;  When Arthur said no, you could see most people in the room just sort of mentally shrug and move on.<p>And this was too bad.  Because recently I&#x27;ve been playing around with J (another APL descendant) and been very impressed by some expressivity&#x2F;readability benefits.  Some small things that have very big effects on the codebase you actually end up with.<p>The first thing is the avoidance of abstraction.  To use a Twitterism:<p>Broke:  Just write your code and don&#x27;t divide it into functions, creating one long main method<p>Woke: Divide your code up, naming parts that get reused<p>Bespoke:  If your code is made up of <i>really really short<\/i> things, it ends up being shorter than <i>the names you would use<\/i>, so you can just <i>write the thing<\/i> rather than your name for it. An analogy would be:  there is no human-comprehensible way to communicate the idea of &quot;picosecond&quot;  in less time than an actual picosecond.<p>The other thing I didn&#x27;t expect was the benefit of multiple dispatch being baked into e v e r y t h i n g.  In Clojure I might write (map + a b) to add each index together; in J I could just write a+b.<p>This is neat stuff!  Best practices for keeping complexity down in APL&#x27;s tend to be the <i>opposite<\/i> of what they are in other languages.  Aaron Hsu gave a talk about this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=v7Mt0GYHU9A\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=v7Mt0GYHU9A<\/a><p>It&#x27;s too bad!

Like the author of K, I decided to not be bound to the restrictions of APL, and want it to be more functional. As I am also doing a lot of Lisp, a lot of ideas come from there as well.<p>The biggest difference in my language (which as of yet does not have a name) is that it is immutable, and function results are lazy. This means that it can be highly parallel, and the laziness means that there is much less synchronisation needed when parallelising computations.<p>I&#x27;m also making some of the syntax more traditional, in order to make large programs more manageable.<p>It&#x27;s implemented as a Kotlin multiplatform project, which means that I can build the interpreter for the JVM, native and Javascript.<p>Why am I talking about this? Well, it&#x27;s because my biggest issue with APL is that it&#x27;s not really suited for large programs (where large means on the order of 100 lines of code or more). Dyalog provides some extensions that make imperative programming easier, but the syntax is really ugly.<p>Thus, I&#x27;m trying to merge the idea of concise APL syntax together with typical functional programming. So you&#x27;ll be able to write code like this:<p><pre><code>    if (foo = bar) {\n        a<U+2190><U+2349>b\n    } else {\n        print &quot;debug message&quot;\n        a<U+2190>x°.+y\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nEven though the core syntax is still APL, the structure of the program is much easier to understand, compared to the way you&#x27;d write it in APL.<p>I still don&#x27;t know if experiment will actually lead to something good, but at least it&#x27;s a fun project where I can play with Kotlin multiplatform support.<p>The code is on my Github, but I&#x27;m not linking it here since it&#x27;s quite early, and it&#x27;s not really usable yet (there are a lot of functions missing).

I used to know a bunch of folks that used both J and K.  I still use APL - the old APLWin 3.5 from APL2000 (Manugistics&#x2F;STSC).<p>APL was the first language I learned as a tiny child.  I write my pseudo code in it.  I live in a ranch house out on the tundra, with a 50ft transponder antenna behind the place which links me to the &#x27;net.  I&#x27;ve used C, c++, Python with all the numpy stuff, etc and a few flavours of TensorFlow.<p>But it&#x27;s APL that gets it done.   I&#x27;ve heard of K, and I knew a guy who worked for Arthur Whitney.  Languages like K and J and APL can be fast, if you use them right.  And it is almost tragic-comical, that the genius of the APL glyphic character set was given up, just as wonderful devices were created which could paint any character at all on the screen.  My girlfriend uses Japanese Kangi and Hirogana on her iPad, no problem.  In a GUI environment, the original APL characters are easy and clear - no need for silly ASCII overloading.<p>See, I have these simple GUI apps, written many years ago in Windows, using APLWin 3.5.    They still run, and I use them daily.   They keep track of financial time series data, and I can use them in a variety of ways.  The APL stuff can convert tables of various formats into conformable vectors, which can be transformed into input for GNUplot or TensorFlow or even (my favourite), Hinton&#x27;s original Xerion product, which I have running on some Linux boxes.<p>APL is simply a wonderful, easy, useful language that can allow one single person to support some mission-critical production-grade software.\nExample:  This AM, I discovered that all the data tables that my data-table downloader had got last nite, had a new format, with a zero-row of data, and today&#x27;s date.<p>This meant when I updated the database of time series data, I got tables where every series had a bogus, zero-valued most recent date.<p>It was 7:30 AM, and markets would open at 9:30.  \nA bit of code inspection, and a simple fix:\nUpdate the MERGETABS function with two lines of code:<p><pre><code>       ZEROROWS &lt;- 0 = +&#x2F;PNEW[;(1 downarrow iota 1 downarrow rho PNEW)]\n       PNEW &lt;- ( tilde ZEROROWS)&#x2F;[1] PNEW\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd this solved the problem.  Update the runtime version\nof the workspace by changing QuadLX latent expression to \nstart the GUI when the W&#x2F;S is loaded, and roll out the new\nW&#x2F;S to a few different boxes.   All done before Mkt open.<p>The code above just takes the new table PNEW, selects the\ndata columns, finds those that are zero valued and removes\nthem using a boolean vector reduction along the highest \ndimension (the table&#x27;s rows).   Easy peasy.  Done quick,\nand done right.<p>With my data updated and correct, I run some stuff against\nit, and get the courage to hold my positions - concluding\nit will be an up day, as the stuff I run helps me make that\ndecision.   I close the day up, just under $40,000 to the good.  (Crazy day...)<p>And oh, btw, the APL stuff runs on both Linux and Windows\nboxes - and the Linux is both 32-bit and modern CentOS 64-bit.   I still run the old 32-bit boxes because they are very\nfast and very reliable.  The APL stuff runs on the Linux\nboxes under WINE, which works amazingly well.<p>It&#x27;s old school stuff, but it just works.  APL is the magic that lets me do the other magic, that pays the bills.  I gather that K can provide something similar for big corporate environments, when the datasets and timeseries get crazy large.  \nYou can write anything in any language - but one must not lose sight of the objective, which is to make the business side of things work well.  One can write APL - or any language - in a way that is unclear and confusing.  But you don&#x27;t have to do so.  If you are careful, you can build APL solutions that are fast, easy to maintain, and smoothly flexible.  Maybe this is possible in K as well?"],"time":["2020-03-14 03:59:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22572726],"kids":{},"parent":[22561121],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-14 03:39:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["computerphage"],"id":[22558318],"kids":[22558342,22563676,22558888,22559462,22558776],"parent":[22557491],"text":["Better line numbers is huge.

I&#x27;ve done work on both. I also have every major VR headset, which I have also written software for each. I&#x27;ve been working in AR for about 10 years, and VR for almost 6.<p>And honestly, with the latest OS updates, the HoloLens 1, even today, is still the better device. You can compare specs on a sheet of paper all day long, but there are fundamental flaws in the Magic Leap hardware and software that prevent it from being a good user experience. The HoloLens, on the other hand, is just old.<p>Magic Leap&#x27;s battery&#x2F;compute pack turned out to not give it an appreciably longer battery life, while also making the device uncomfortable, as the cable constantly tugs on the back of your head. The HoloLens isn&#x27;t comfortable, either, but that&#x27;s mostly because the vast majority of people completely ignored the little, rubber strap that came in the case that you attach across your to take the bulk of the weight of the device.<p>The WiFi and Bluetooth an my ML are constantly failing. I&#x27;ve used three different units and have had the same experience on all of them.<p>The controller <i>constantly<\/i> loses tracking. It uses magnetic tracking and it just doesn&#x27;t do well. Also, the sensor is on the right side of the headset, and it is legitimately worse to use the controller in your left hand. It&#x27;s also way too complicated for just-a-pointer, while not being complicated enough for a bespoke user input device. HoloLens has a clicker instead. It&#x27;s superfluous, but it does the job and doesn&#x27;t fail.<p>The hand tracking is too broken to actually use. HoloLens&#x27; hand tracking isn&#x27;t anything to write home about, but I&#x27;ve never encountered it doing something <i>blatantly wrong<\/i>. It&#x27;s just slow. Magic Leap&#x27;s is similarly slow <i>and<\/i> often wrong.<p>This goes hand-in-hand with the ML SDK being poorly documented and rather incomplete. One way HoloLens gets around its rather limited user input capability is by giving you voice recognition out of the box. And in writing software, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to setup. It&#x27;s also relatively easy (though takes some thoughful design) to create a speech-based UI that works reliably. Magic Leap, on the other hand, talks about how great it would be to have speech-recognition, but offers nothing in their 1st-party demos to demonstrate it and nothing in their SDK to implement it.<p>The operating system on ML is a hacked-up Android system. I&#x27;m sooooo over trying to do 3D graphics on Android systems. All the standalone VR headsets are also a gigantic pain for developing software. If you&#x27;ve ever developed software for the HoloLens, it&#x27;s a joy in comparison.<p>And Microsoft did a lot to make 2D applications an integral, usable, and useful part of Windows Holographic. While Magic Leap has its own version of that feature, they bury the documentation and don&#x27;t provide any good samples. Whereas, on HoloLens, you can basically run any pure UWP app, whether it was made for the HoloLens or not."],"time":["2020-03-12 15:02:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ausjke"],"id":[22553692],"kids":[22555047],"parent":[22552632],"text":["The writing was on the wall for a few years, to me it is the WeWork version of VR."],"time":["2020-03-12 05:09:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["floatinglotus"],"id":[22554492],"kids":{},"parent":[22552632],"text":["They’ll be lucky to get $500M"],"time":["2020-03-12 08:05:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TheMagicHorsey"],"id":[22557843],"kids":{},"parent":[22552632],"text":["I&#x27;ve got news for Magic Leap.

Otherwise you are stuck with the types built into the language, which are not designed to help ensure correct program state, logic, and behavior. When you use classes in this way, I call it type oriented programming (TOP). Why would I compare classes to types? Just pass in the initial value at construction time, define the &quot;operations&quot; on that type by creating methods for your class, and define which other types those operations work with by setting the types of parameters those methods work with. Make the class immutable, always returning a new instance with the new updated value passed into the constructor. Why did I mention these types helping the program be more correct? This should be used as the primary form of contracts. But these contracts are very simple to use, you just specify the relevant type in the parameters and return values, and you are done defining the contract for any given method. For example, let&#x27;s say a method should only work with integers larger than zero, instead of either accepting an Int or an UnsignedInt, which would allow 0, you could define your own class called PositiveInt. It would be designed to throw an exception if you pass anything smaller than 0 into the constructor. Then instead of writing code inside the method that makes sure the user of the method is following the contract, you just specify PositiveInt as the parameter type. If the contract is violated, the exception will be thrown as early as possible, before the method is even called, helping programmers catch the original source of the problem. This also makes your code more readable, because you can see exactly what each method accepts and returns just by looking at the method signature. When you start thinking this way, you will notice many core types are missing from the language, that should have been there from the beginning.

So, instead of modeling a bunch of different types within some namespace, the type itself represents the entire extent of that business concern, including any business facts as instance properties. Complex types are modeled as nested classes within each context. Nothing is shared between contexts except for trivial domain-wide concerns in the outer scope. This allows for very easy serialization of business state in and out of a database (among many other things). Consider the power that a method override might have in this realm if you wanted to construct a hierarchy of such contexts.<p>An example of one of these concrete types might be SelfCheckoutContext (if you were working in a retail business domain). This type could be derived from a wider CheckoutContext which could be simultaneously shared other concrete contexts like HumanCheckoutContext.<p>In our approach, there is also a lot of stuff that exists outside of each context (Views, Services, Repositories, etc).

The bay area was pretty hard, but I switched to a room at someone&#x27;s place (instead of the whole place) and I ended up staying in insanely nice places. (I definitely recommend trying this, it&#x27;s always much nicer and I seldom run into the people living there.)<p>* AirBnBs have a kitchen<p>* I overall find hotels to be dirty.

In most countries &quot;government&quot; is a collection of agencies, staffed by individuals, not completely in sync on all levels (micro, meso, macro).<p>You see that playing out when measures on one level (most prominently medical advise) are not in line with broader approaches to managing events, groups, tourism and travel. We all notice the disconnect, and some might think of &#x27;dark conspiracies&#x27;. There are none (rule of the most kind interpretation). It&#x27;s the dispersion of institutions in action.<p>Another one is my assertion, as a former public servant with friends in places that &#x2F;should know&#x2F;, that there is no structured economic analysis of possible outcomes of various scenarios of intervention. There are no models, there is no time, there is not enough collaboration between agencies. On the one hand you have the medical staff and agencies doing what they can where they can on a medical level, on the other hand you have bureaucrats making decisions with limited information and way more limited understanding. Politicians probably get in the way more than they support.<p>My thought: Governments are acting. They are just not acting in a way that we, the public, can understand is internally consistent. That&#x27;s because the acts aren&#x27;t internally consistent. That is due to the fact that governement is made up of institutions with different levels of understanding, information, scope and time to act.<p>In a pandemic, this is all very unfortunate and a more singlehanded style of governement could help. China got it quite right after an initial denial. Nobody in the West is equipped to both think about and act on China-style measures.

In many cases, 256x256 would be fine. It would generate 16x faster, which is important for e.g. video thumbnails. But you can&#x27;t generate 256x256 images with stylegan FFHQ. You can only generate 1024x1024, then downsample.<p>Suppose you wanted to train a StyleGAN 256x256 on FFHQ. (FFHQ is just &quot;what people normally think of as stylegan&quot; -- the human faces model.) You can do this now, and in fact we recently did a 512x512 model in &lt;24 hours on a TPU pod: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sheminusminus&#x2F;modelbattle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sheminusminus&#x2F;modelbattle<\/a><p>The problem is the latent space. You know how you can change your age, gender, etc with stylegan &quot;sliders&quot;? Those are directions discovered in stylegan&#x27;s latent space. You train a classifier to predict &quot;older&quot; or &quot;younger&quot; faces, then classify ~50k images, and fit a straight line through the latent space. Now you have an age direction that works on any photo.<p>If you retrain the model from scratch, every single direction you discovered in 1024x1024 stylegan is immediately invalid. Bye bye, effort. And yes, you could rediscover the directions in your new model. But now if you want N resolutions (and perhaps M different aspect ratios of each resolution?) you&#x27;ll need to keep track of NxM latent vectors, one for each model. This is a pain, to say the least.<p>The training process is modified as follows. Generate a random latent, Z. Pass this latent through your new model, and through the original StyleGAN 1024x1024 model. Minimize the perceptual distance between the images.<p>Done.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s really that simple. And somewhat shockingly, I&#x27;ve run it by a few 4+ year veterans and they can&#x27;t really see why it wouldn&#x27;t work, nor can they think of other projects that have already done that.<p>There are a few close ones, but I&#x27;m not trying to claim this is <i>novel<\/i>, just that it&#x27;s <i>effective<\/i>. You&#x27;ll end up with a 256x256 FFHQ model with identical latent structure. All the directions on 1024x1024 will work fine on your new model. At least, I think this is what will happen – it&#x27;s hard to predict anything in ML.<p>There are a bunch of interesting variations on this, too. You can train two models simultaneously, on two different datasets. Then at each training step, force the weights of both models to average together. i.e. force them to learn both objectives simultaneously. What will happen? Who knows? Something will happen, and it&#x27;s sure to be interesting.<p>Another neat variation would be to train a single model, conditioned on two different datasets. Suppose you have an animefaces stylegan model and an FFHQ model. You can do the training process described above, but pass the latent through both models, then add a label to the latent (0 = animefaces, 1 = ffhq) and minimize the perceptual distance to each class, in a single model. You should end up with a final model that can generate both animefaces and ffhq faces just by toggling the labels.<p>This isn&#x27;t quite the same thing as simply training on two different datasets and using labels to classify them. You&#x27;re memorizing the latent structure of two existing models. When you set label to 0, you&#x27;re saying &quot;the rest of the latent vector is identical to the animefaces model&quot;. When label is 1, ditto, but for ffhq.<p>So the neat question is, what happens when you try to interpolate label 0 to label 1? Something will happen. And it&#x27;s sure to be interesting. Not necessarily useful, but interesting."],"time":["2020-03-12 12:23:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hardmaru"],"id":[22555864],"kids":{},"parent":[22544309],"text":["Should check that the repo has code before posting..."],"time":["2020-03-12 13:01:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hooch"],"id":[22556938],"kids":{},"parent":[22555992],"text":["The artist describes this piece as &quot;The final part to my pointless trilogy&quot; and links to these works in the comments:<p>Still Life\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;ivorjetski&#x2F;pen&#x2F;xMJoYO\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;ivorjetski&#x2F;pen&#x2F;xMJoYO<\/a><p>Portrait\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;ivorjetski&#x2F;pen&#x2F;dBYWWZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;ivorjetski&#x2F;pen&#x2F;dBYWWZ<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-12 15:02:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dylan604"],"id":[22557363],"kids":[22557883,22557431,22557877],"parent":[22555992],"text":["I see CSS examples like this, and just want to cry that I can barely make a UI that works.

I have been in a basement for the last 18 months and I have been upstairs for about 5 minutes today. I have a bathroom and fridge and microwave down here.<p>But I have a feeding tube. That is how I ended up down here. We thought it would be the safest place to be while I was going through chemo. For six months while my immune system was garbage I just stayed down here and would only go up to get groceries or go to chemo&#x2F;radiation. So I always joked that I think I could deal with solitary. I prefer being alone.<p>All that changed about a month ago.<p>The balloon on my PEG tube (DDG it) had deflated. And one night I went to change the gauze and while I pulled the gauze out it just started pouring out blood. In a matter of seconds my boxers had blood all over them. I was terrified. This much blood on the outside, how much blood is going into my stomach? Am I going to bleed to death? On the ride to the ER I was feeling faint..<p>I am getting to the solitary part.<p>But I saw a nurse right after checking in. And she determined I wasn&#x27;t bleeding to death. I was going to have a bit of a wait to see a doctor. 4 hours to be exact. But they wanted me out of the ER waiting room due to being on pembro and there had just been a case of C-19 8 hours away.<p>So I was being walked to a room and she said they were low on places to put me. I was going to be in a &quot;mental health&quot; room. But they got a bed in there for me. White walls, a bed, no problem..<p>Huge problem!<p>It is so hard to describe. It was basically a cinder block box and a massive metal door. Everything tucked away so you couldn&#x27;t kill yourself. And it was so loud since the air had to be pumped in. And I had a bed they wheeled in for me. And the door was open so I could go to the bathroom when I wanted. If that door was closed and I couldn&#x27;t get out I would have lost my shit. And I nearly lost it anyway. Something about that room was just unlike anything you can imagine. It was like being buried alive.<p>I would imagine solitary is about a million times worse. I would classify it as torture.<p>And my feeding tube had slipped between my stomach and the &quot;outside skin&quot; tearing up everything making it bleed.

Rust doesn&#x27;t seem to get away from either of those.<p>As someone who doesn&#x27;t really use Rust, does anyone who does find the complexity detracts from it a bit as a language? Is there effort to reduce complexity with the language or does it mostly embrace it?<p>At this point I find myself mostly looking at modern C alternatives—ones which manage to stay relatively simple the way C does, but with a few additional features and better designs (Zig, Odin, maybe Jai, etc).<p>All that said, I work with C++ and so I could see myself potentially working with Rust in the future, so I&#x27;m curious how people feel about its complexity, especially given that its complexity will presumably only increase with time."],"time":["2020-03-12 23:16:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["billconan"],"id":[22562666],"kids":[22563306,22562702],"parent":[22561373],"text":["I am researching a backend programming language for a future project.
