The component model should account for this and offer some guidance.<p>Web components do this with the `:host` selector that styles the component from within its shadow root. The styles applied with the `:host` selector can be overridden by the outside styles, without the component needing to weaken encapsulation by allowing styling from the outside via JS properties. This means it&#x27;s not really bad for a component to give itself default outside styling like block vs inline display, or even margins, because the user can always reset them as needed, much like built-in elements.<p>For instance, a web component might have these styles:<p><pre><code>    &lt;my-element&gt;\n      #shadow-root\n        :host {\n          margin: 1em;\n        }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd at its use-site, the margins can be set differently:<p><pre><code>    &lt;style&gt;\n      my-element {\n        margin-botton: 0;\n      }\n    &lt;&#x2F;style&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;\n    &lt;my-element&gt;&lt;&#x2F;my-element&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nShadow DOM also helps with specificity fights, as the cascade goes: shadow style -&gt; light style -&gt; light !important -&gt; shadow !important. This way a component can define which styles are only defaults.<p>Edit to clarify: one of the big problems with the article is the use of inline styles.

You can&#x27;t just make it &quot;flex&quot; and have the parent decide whether it is inline, a block or whatever.<p>The consequence of this is that a parent component cannot properly layout a child component without knowing its internal layout structure.

So long as this limitation exists, there will <i>never<\/i> be true layout encapsulation on the web platform.<p>For a while, the CSS Working Group planned to address this problem through the introduction of separate `display-inside` and `display-outside` properties.

We called this the &quot;golden rule of components&quot; in that reusable components should be entirely responsible for rendering everything within its outermost bounding box (outside of delegating certain parts&#x2F;properties of it through explicit APIs), and should render nothing outside of it (including empty space, i.e. margins).

I worked with Ben Shneiderman at HCIL, and when he sent me a copy of this article to review, I was inspired by the &quot;Dynamic Queries&quot; of his &quot;Dynamic Home Finder&quot; demo, to implement something like that for SimCity (the Frob-O-Matic window). [Video and transcript below.]<p>Here are some of the main points of his article:<p>Don&#x27;t label machines as &quot;intelligent&quot;.<p>It limits the imagination. We should have greater ambitions.<p>Enable humans to accomplish tasks that weren&#x27;t before possible, instead of trying to enable machines to accomplish tasks people can already do.<p>Predictability and control are desirable qualities. Give users the feeling of mastery, competence, and understanding, sense of accomplishment.<p>The &quot;intelligent machine&quot; label limits or even eliminates human responsibility.<p>If you treat machines like people, you&#x27;re likely to end up treating people like machines.<p>Ben Shneiderman called his lab HCIL instead of CHIL, to explicitly put Humans before Computers.<p>Here&#x27;s his description of &quot;Dynamic Queries&quot; and the &quot;Dynamic Home Finder&quot;:<p>&gt;Dynamic Queries. These animations let you rapidly adjust query parameters and immediately display updated result sets, which makes them very effective when a visual environment like a map, calendar, or schematic diagram is available. The immediate display of results lets users more easily develop intuitions, discover patterns, spot trends, find exceptions, and see anomalies.<p>&gt;Figure 2 shows a screen from Dynamic HomeFinder, a prototype interface for real-estate agents that uses dynamic queries, written by Christopher Williamson of UM. Users can adjust the cost, number of bedrooms, and location of the A and B markers, among other characteristics, and points of light appear on a map to indicate a home that matches their specifications. Clicking on a point of light brings up a home description or image.<p>&gt;Users of Dynamic HomeFinder can execute up to 100 queries per second (rather than one query per 100 seconds as is typical in a database query language), producing a revealing animated view of where high- or low-price homes are found-and there are no syntax errors.<p>&gt;Our empirical study of 18 users showed Dynamic HomeFinder to be more effective than a natural-language interface using Q&amp;A from Symantec (C. WIlliamson and B. Shneiderman, The Dynamic HomeFinder: Evaluating Dynamic Queries in a Real-Estate Information Exploration System,&quot; Proc.

This is the &quot;Dynamic Zone Filter&quot;.<p>So we are going to set this to be dynamic.<p>Now it&#x27;s going to show all the zones, but it&#x27;s not going to show the ones that don&#x27;t pass this filter.<p>So this filter is currently all the way open.<p>Now we&#x27;re going to change population density.<p>This is a two-ended slider.<p>This is the segment of the population density, from zero to 81.<p>So everything else will disappear.<p>Say I&#x27;m looking for a home. I want low population density. But I want high rate of growth.<p>And now, these are the places that have low population density and high rate of growth.<p>And then you can just interactivally ... So each of these filters out some of the places.<p>So you can look at ... I don&#x27;t want high traffic density. I don&#x27;t want any pollution. I don&#x27;t want any crime. I want land value to be high.<p>I&#x27;m getting pretty picky. So maybe I&#x27;ll deal with more people. Lower rate of growth. I&#x27;m too picky about pollution. I&#x27;m too picky about land value. That&#x27;s it.<p>So basically, Ben Shneiderman demonstrated this as the &quot;Dynamic Home Finder&quot;, and I realized that SimCity has all these layers of information that it can draw on, as fictitious as they are, to do that kind of real time, interactive, smooth database query.<p>It&#x27;s just a much higher bandwidth way to query a database than is conventionally used.<p>Anyway, that was the dynamic zone finder.<p>Also: Here&#x27;s some email I wrote to Ben about this article, after re-reading the article again in 2009:<p>Date: 28&#x2F;02&#x2F;2009 18:51\nSubject: Re-reading &quot;Beyond Intelligent Machines&quot;<p>A long time ago, you sent us (me, Brad Myers, Jack Callahan and Mark\nWeiser) a preview of your IEEE Software article &quot;Beyond Intelligent\nMachines&quot;, which I ran across and have re-read.<p>It&#x27;s still delightful, inspiring and relevant today.<p>Speech synthesis and recognition has come a long way, to the point where\nthe &quot;talking car&quot; scenario is quite common (TomToms that speak and\nrecognize street names and addresses).<p>But I think the development of user-customizable user interfaces has\nbeen dreadfully stalled since HyperCard died.<p>An &quot;Interactive Learning Environment&quot; is a great description of what I&#x27;m\ndeveloping SimCity into.<p>Remember when you visited CMU and I showed you the version of SimCity\nwith the dynamic query feature, an &quot;homage&quot; to your Dynamic Home Finder?\nYou could dial a series of filters on spatial properties like population\ndensity, pollution, traffic, land value, police coverage, etc.\nThat code is now open source, and I&#x27;m redeveloping it!<p>It&#x27;s now very easy to write Python code to dynamically query and filter\nthe map and data layers, and visualize with transparent colored tiles\nand pixel overlays, depending on arbitrary Python functions over the\nstate of the map and its data layers.<p>And it&#x27;s also possible to script agents in Python!<p>Here&#x27;s a picture of SimCity with the traffic overlay enabled (showing\nyellow&#x2F;orange&#x2F;red haze over high traffic areas), with some PacMan\nagents, which are programmed to follow roads, go towards high traffic\nand eat the cars!

I generally agree with him that the US needs a focused Industrial Policy but analyses like this one seem relatively weak.<p>A few things that I feel should be addressed but weren&#x27;t:<p>1) If Newport had this huge deal (40,000 ventilators * $3,000 price = $120M), why would Covidien not continue it? What about this would have been against their interest? It seems like if it&#x27;s both better AND cheaper, they would dominate the market globally. Unless Newport had a novel invention under patent for a few years, presumably competitors could have also done this. Even if they were concerned with significantly decreased margins at the $3k price tag, why not try an $8k price tag using the same, better machine and still steal the global market? It&#x27;s hard for me to understand why Newport was this advanced but Covidien just destroyed their product and this isn&#x27;t even questioned in the article. I don&#x27;t think these are unreasonable questions.<p>2) Matt talks about a monopoly on purchasing. There&#x27;s actually a standard term for this, &quot;monopsony&quot;. I would love to see Matt write about how unions end up with monopsony power selling their labor and how bad that is. I don&#x27;t expect it any time soon. That said, he does make interesting points on how monopsony works against producers. The weird contradiction here, though, is that this drives down producer surplus and profit of the exact same big businesses that Matt is usually upset about having too high of producer surplus&#x2F;profit. This seems to me a bit to be arguing against his general purpose.<p>3) &quot;The contracting officers in government should have mandated as a part of the contract that Newport Medical give the government all its research and proprietary information on the product, and put in safeguards to ensure that the product would be delivered.&quot; I totally agree with the latter half of this statement, ensuring the delivery of the product is a must. However, the first part that Newport hand over its research and proprietary information on the product seems like a huge governmental overreach. What can justify this? Now, it may be that the government funded this research directly (ie a grant or loan to specifically develop the product). If this were the case, then I understand that. However, it seems, according to the article, that the US government was simply contracting to procure the new ventilators. Demanding a company hand over their entire IP portfolio as a part of purchasing their product at market prices seems ridiculous to me. What&#x27;s to stop the government from then taking that IP to another producer and getting them to produce it for them. That producer has way better margins what with not having to do anywhere near the same load of R&amp;D. Not, that said, I may be misunderstanding this particular case.<p>4) Matt repeatedly calls the merger illegal. He does a bit of describing his theories for why it should&#x27;ve been found illegal but until a court or someone with the oversight authority makes this determination, this is opinion."],"time":["2020-04-01 23:31:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hpoe"],"id":[22753473],"kids":[22753865,22754233],"parent":[22753128],"text":["So in my younger days I was a full blooded libertarian especially economically, I was 100% against all government regulation. &quot;You don&#x27;t want lead in your meat, well then you do your research and stop buying meat with lead in it&quot;, I took positions that were pretty extreme by most standards, and I would stay I am probably still a little more out there than most people when it comes to opposing government regulation.<p>My reason for this was rooted in a deep and abiding belief in the supreme importance of individual liberty, &quot;the government should only stop me from doing something that directly hurts somebody otherwise all government power leads to tyranny in one form or another at the end of the day&quot; was the train of my thoughts at the time. I extended this to the economy because I viewed the government regulating business as a violation of my right to conduct my business however I want, &quot;I own the business, I own the assets, it is my money that has been used to build up this business and some useless paper pushing bureaucrat can go shove it all for telling me how to run my business, its my property to use how I want.&quot; and I still hold to that to a large extent.<p>However recently I have been reflecting on the situation of powerful corporations recently, especially monopolies (which are more often aided and abated by government involvement than kept in check) and I think that I have discovered a fallacy in my thinking.

Specifically, in each round, the full contents of the password is concatenated with the previous round&#x27;s hash result as the input to the next round.  This means that the processing complexity of password hashing is proportional to `number of rounds * password length`.  Because the implementation has to tune the number of rounds to their authentication server&#x27;s performance, and because the tuning is performed on &quot;normal length&quot; passwords, this opens the authentication servers up to a DOS attack by overwhelming them with very long passwords which is only a problem because password hashing has quadratic complexity thanks to this design.  Thus, in response, administrators are forced (!) to limit password length just so their authentication servers can&#x27;t be attacked.<p>This design flaw (imo) could be pretty easily solved by hashing the user provided password <i>once<\/i> first, and then using <i>that<\/i> hash to concatenate each round.  This changes the complexity to `number of rounds + password length` (note the &quot;+&quot; !).  As a secondary benefit, the multi-round hashing step actually becomes <i>constant time<\/i> because all inputs are the same length!  In fact, I wonder if the current design makes it possible to infer a user&#x27;s password length from timing attacks on the authentication servers while a user is logging in.<p>I&#x27;ve not got any satisfactory cryptographic reason why we still use this design for password hashing besides platitudes like &quot;don&#x27;t roll your own crypto&quot;, appeal to authority &quot;It&#x27;s been designed by the experts&quot;, or stupid reasons like &quot;but network bandwidth!&quot; -- as if an http authentication request that&#x27;s 4kb is gonna slow down the network vs a 3kb request (and this is a worst case of a relatively huge 1kb password!).  Availability is an important part of security, and sacrificing both availability (vulnerability to DOS) <i>and<\/i> security (admins forced to limit password length) seems like a doubly whammy argument against the current design."],"time":["2020-04-01 19:50:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sneak"],"id":[22749924],"kids":[22750063],"parent":[22749706],"text":["PayPal actually limits a password’s maximum length(!) to 20 characters.<p>(I finally deleted my account there yesterday after close to 20 years; I should have done so years ago.)"],"time":["2020-04-01 17:47:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidg109"],"id":[22749962],"kids":[22750377,22749995,22750140,22750181,22750440,22750153,22751759,22750052,22750020],"parent":[22749706],"text":["You think that’s bad?

Most left-wing academics just take dialectical materialism and the primacy of the dialectic method of achieving truth as being a given (though Plato&#x2F;Socrates is responsible for the latter error not Marx). They don&#x27;t even see how authoritarian that the dialectical method can be.

Furthermore, it decentralizes the very basics of medical care, builds&#x2F;reinforces community bonds, gives everyone a potential way to help out once they&#x27;ve recovered, and will likely increase the quality of medical care for everyone by decreasing the severity of overwork our artificially constrained supply of fully trained medical personnel causes.<p>Short of doing something like that, I don&#x27;t see any way to avoid losing a hell of a lot of skilled, hard-working, and invaluable people during this time of crisis. Hell, if I knew I&#x27;d already had the stuff and developed immunity, I&#x27;d volunteer. Throw in some modest compensation, and I bet you&#x27;d get even more. Or better yet, enstate a program of cost of care deferral by putting in hours after recovery.

But he&#x27;s right.<p>&quot;Interaction should be used judiciously and sparingly, only when the environment and history provide insufficient context to construct an acceptable graphic.&quot; -Bret Victor, Magic Ink<p>This is a critically important lesson to apply to automotive user interfaces. It&#x27;s much safer if, as much as possible, instead of being interactive, the user interface predicts and infers from context and history what the user wants, when or before they want it, and presents it to them without them asking, so it&#x27;s there when they need it.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;MagicInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;MagicInk&#x2F;<\/a><p>Interactivity considered harmful<p>Chris Crawford defines interaction as a three-phase reciprocal process, isomorphic to a conversation: an interactant listens to her partner, thinks about what was said, and speaks a response. Her partner then does the same.<i><\/i> See Crawford’s book The Art of Interactive Design (2003), or his essay Fundamentals of Interactivity (1993). For manipulation software, interaction is perfectly suitable: the user views a visual representation of the model, considers what to manipulate next, and performs a manipulation. The software, in turn, inputs the user’s manipulation request, updates the model, and displays the updated representation. With good feedback and an effective means of “speaking” to the software, this process can cycle smoothly and rapidly. It mimics the experience of working with a physical tool.<p>Information software, by contrast, mimics the experience of reading, not working. It is used for achieving an understanding—constructing a model within the mind. Thus, the user must listen to the software and think about what it says… but any manipulation happens mentally.<i><\/i> Except possibly for signaling a decision, such as clicking a “buy” button, but that concludes, not constitutes, a session. The only reason to complete the full interaction cycle and speak is to explicitly provide some context that the software can’t otherwise infer—that is, to indicate a relevant subset of information. For information software, all interaction is essentially navigation around a data space.<p>For example, Amazon’s data space consists of their catalog of items. For a yellow pages directory, the data space contains all business listings; for a movie guide, all showtimes and movie information; for a flight planner, trips to and from all airports. In all of these cases, every interaction, every click and keystroke, search term and menu selection, simply serves to adjust the user’s view into the data space. This is simply navigation.<p>Alan Cooper defines excise in this context as a cognitive or physical penalty for using a tool—effort demanded by the tool that is not directly in pursuit of a goal. For example, filling a gas tank is done to support the car, not the goal of arriving at a destination. Cooper goes on to assert that software navigation is nothing but excise:<p>…the most important thing to realize about navigation is that, in almost all cases, it represents pure excise, or something close to it. Except in games where the goal is to navigate successfully through a maze of obstacles, navigation through software does not meet user goals, needs, or desires. Unnecessary or difficult navigation thus becomes a major frustration to users. In fact, it is the authors’ opinion that poorly designed navigation presents the number-one problem in the design of any software application or system…<i><\/i> Alan Cooper and Robert Reimann, About Face (2003), p143.<p>If all interaction is navigation, and navigation is the number-one software problem, interactivity is looking pretty bad already. However, when compared with the other two sources of context, interactivity has even worse problems than simply being a frustrating waste of time:<p>The user has to already know what she wants in order to ask for it. Software that infers from history and the environment can proactively offer potentially relevant information that the user wouldn’t otherwise know to ask for. Purely interactive software forces the user to make the first move.<p>The user has to know how to ask. That is, she must learn to manipulate a machine. Donald Norman’s concept of determining a user’s “mental model” has become widespread in the software usability community, and is now considered a core design challenge.<i><\/i> See Donald Norman’s book The Design of Everyday Things (2002), p9. However, Norman described this concept in the context of mechanical devices. It only applies to software if the software actually contains hidden mechanisms that the user must model. A low-interaction, non-mechanical information graphic relieves both user and designer from struggling with mental models.<p>Navigation implies state. Software that can be navigated is software in which the user can get lost. The more navigation, the more corners to get stuck in. The more manipulable state, the more ways to wander into a “bad mode.” State is the primary reason people fear computers—stateful things can be broken.<i><\/i> The only state kept by a book is which page it is open to, which is why “getting lost in a book” describes a pleasurable experience!<p>Beyond these cognitive problems are physical disadvantages of interaction. The hand is much slower than the eye. Licklider described spending hours plotting graphs and seconds understanding them. A user who must manually request information is in a similar situation—given the mismatch between mousing and reading speeds, most of her time may be spent navigating, not learning. Further, the user might prefer to learn information while using her hands for other purposes, such as writing or eating or stroking a cat. Each time software demands the user’s hands, this activity must be interrupted. Finally, the growing prevalence of computer-related repetitive stress injuries suggests that indiscriminate interactivity may be considerably harmful in a literal, physical sense.<p>Unless it is enjoyable or educational in and of itself, interaction is an essentially negative aspect of information software. There is a net positive benefit if it significantly expands the range of questions the user can ask, or improves the ease of locating answers, but there may be other roads to that benefit. As suggested by the above redesigns of the train timetable, bookstore, and movie listings, many questions can be answered simply through clever, information-rich graphic design. Interaction should be used judiciously and sparingly, only when the environment and history provide insufficient context to construct an acceptable graphic.<p>It is unfortunate that the communities concerned with human factors of electronic artifacts have latched onto the term “interaction.”<i><\/i> Most professional communities and academic programs use the term Human-Computer Interaction, or HCI; the ACM special-interest group is CHI, the converse. Many practitioners, following Cooper and Bill Moggridge, refer to their profession as “interaction design.” For information software, the real issue is context-sensitivity. Interaction is merely one means of achieving that. And as long as “speaking” is constrained to awkwardly pushing metaphors with a mouse, interaction should be the last resort.<p>The working designer might protest that interaction is unavoidable in practice, and may even consider my ideal of interaction-free software to be a scoff-worthy fantasy. This is only because the alternatives have been unrecognized and underdeveloped. I believe that with the invention of new context-sensitive graphical forms and research into obtaining and using environment and history, the clicking and dragging that characterizes modern information retrieval will be made to seem laughably archaic. But every condonation of “interactivity,” from the annals of academia to the corporate buzzvocabulary, postpones this future."],"time":["2020-04-01 05:00:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SN76477"],"id":[22739180],"kids":{},"parent":[22738415],"text":["difficult to operate intuitively is exactly right."],"time":["2020-03-31 18:22:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["everdrive"],"id":[22739582],"kids":{},"parent":[22738415],"text":["Welp, looks like Honda&#x27;s back in the running for my next car!"],"time":["2020-03-31 18:56:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DonHopkins"],"id":[22745742],"kids":{},"parent":[22738415],"text":["There&#x27;s another Hacker News discussion about a related topic, a paper Ben Shneiderman wrote in 1993, &quot;Beyond Intelligent Machines: Just Do It&quot;.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22742100\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22742100<\/a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;trs&#x2F;93-03&#x2F;93-03.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;trs&#x2F;93-03&#x2F;93-03.html<\/a><p>&gt;It seems that you can hardly go to a computer conference without seeing a videotape of a futuristic computer system that talks to you from a wall, desk, or some random appliance.

The Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) framework clarifies how to (1) design for high levels of human control and high levels of computer automation so as to increase human performance, (2) understand the situations in which full human control or full computer control are necessary, and (3) avoid the dangers of excessive human control or excessive computer control. The methods of HCAI are more likely to produce designs that are Reliable, Safe &amp; Trustworthy (RST). Achieving these goals will dramatically increase human performance, while supporting human self-efficacy, mastery, creativity, and responsibility.<p>&gt;Introduction<p>&gt;This paper opens up new possibilities by way of a two dimensional framework of Human-Centered Artificial\nIntelligence (HCAI) that separates levels of automation&#x2F;autonomy from levels of human control. The new guideline is to seek\nhigh levels of human control AND high levels of automation,\nwhich is more likely to produce computer applications that are\nReliable, Safe &amp; Trustworthy (RST). Achieving these goals, especially for complex poorly understood problems, will dramatically\nincrease human performance, while supporting human selfefficacy, mastery, creativity, and responsibility. This paper\nfocuses on the three RST goals, which may help to achieve\nother important goals such as privacy, cybersecurity, resilience,\nsocial justice, human dignity, and environmental preservation.<p>&gt;The traditional belief in computer autonomy is compelling\nfor many artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, developers,\njournalists, and promoters. I assume a broad definition of AI\nto include automated&#x2F;autonomous systems using technologies\nsuch as machine learning, neural nets, statistical methods,\nrecommenders, adaptive systems, and speech, facial, image,\nand pattern recognition.<p>&gt;The goal of computer autonomy was central in Sheridan\nand Verplank (1978) ten levels from human control to computer automation&#x2F;autonomy (Table 1). Their widely cited\none-dimensional list continues to guide much of the research\nand development, suggesting that increases in automation\nmust come at the cost of lowering human control. Shifting\nto HCAI could liberate design thinking so as to produce\ncomputer applications that increase automation, while amplifying, augmenting, enhancing, and empowering people to\ninnovatively apply systems and creatively refine them.<p>&gt;Sheridan &amp; Verplank’s ten levels of automation&#x2F;autonomy\nhave been widely influential (Sheridan, 1992), but critics\nsuggested refinements such as the four stages of automation:\n(1) information acquisition, (2) analysis of information, (3)\ndecision or choice of action, and (4) execution of action\n(Parasuraman et al., 2000). These stages refine discussions of\neach of the levels, but the underlying message is that the goal is\nfull automation&#x2F;autonomy.<p>&gt;Even Sheridan (2000) commented with concern that “surprisingly, the level descriptions as published have been taken more\nseriously than were expected” (see Hoffman &amp; Johnson (2019) and\nKaber (2018) for detailed histories). However, in spite of the many\ncritiques, the 1-dimensional levels of automation&#x2F;autonomy, which\nonly represents situations where increased automation must come\nwith less human control, is still widely influential. For example, the\nUS Society of Automotive Engineers adopted the unnecessary\ntrade-off in its six levels of autonomy for self-driving cars\n(Brooks, 2017; Society of Automotive Engineers, 2014) (Table 2).<p>&gt;Critics of autonomy have repeatedly discussed the ironies\n(Bainbridge, 1983), deadly myths (Bradshaw et al., 2013;\nMindell, 2015), conundrums (Endsley, 2017), or paradoxes\n(Hancock, 2017) of autonomy. A common point is that humans\nhave to spend more effort monitoring autonomous computers\nbecause they are unsure of what it will do, often leading to\ninferior performance (Blackhurst et al., 2011; Strauch, 2017).<p>[...]"],"time":["2020-04-01 06:39:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["delfinom"],"id":[22738969],"kids":{},"parent":[22738415],"text":["Yesssssss"],"time":["2020-03-31 18:09:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justlexi93"],"id":[22746199],"kids":{},"parent":[22738415],"text":["All I want is to turn the radio volume up&#x2F;down with a knob and turn it off&#x2F;on with a big physical button.

It&#x27;s the little telcos that connect to them.<p>But is this all too little too late? I think we&#x27;ve discovered over the last 20 years that we&#x27;re all pretty much over open networks.

This type of optimization is much easier if the service provider can see everything because it’s unencrypted... This isn’t impossible, though, Green said, as demonstrated by Apple’s FaceTime, which allows group video conferencing that’s end-to-end encrypted. “It’s doable. It’s just not easy.”<\/i><p>Group videoconferencing is inherently centralized through a server that needs to analyze video&#x2F;audio not only for signals as to who&#x27;s talking, but also mix normalized audio and re-encode streams not just for lower thumbnail resolutions, but for clients with different bitrates.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that FaceTime finds a way to do this, but everyone is using Zoom instead because its performance is way better. I&#x27;m not entirely sure that <i>all<\/i> the necessary signal processing can be done performantly client-side, especially when you&#x27;re allowing for a wide variety of endpoints (WebRTC, phone calls, etc.). You certainly can&#x27;t mix encrypted audio (at least to the best of my knowledge?), for instance, which means increased bandwidth to everyone to handle overlapping speakers (someone interjecting &quot;could I just say something?&quot; while two other people are talking).<p>Also, handling key management for <i>groups<\/i> of people where you don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to re-encrypt the stream separately for each receiver is very complex too, and in the end you&#x27;re basically just going to have to trust that Zoom itself can&#x27;t access the keys. Because usually Zoom <i>will<\/i> be able to, so that it can handle phone dial-ins.<p>But regardless... while Zoom should absolutely advertise full encryption, Zoom should absolutely <i>not<\/i> advertise <i>end-to-end<\/i> encryption. That&#x27;s bad, and harms user trust in security overall when advertised technical terms become meaningless."],"time":["2020-03-31 16:42:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jtdev"],"id":[22737773],"kids":[22738014],"parent":[22735746],"text":["Fuck these guys.

WebRTC). TL;DR summary: they want to do their own thing, outside of what the WebRTC standard allows, that&#x27;s all (and enough reason for not using WebRTC?)<p>Zoom doesn&#x27;t want to use the stock H.264 encoder as provided by the browser for WebRTC communication. Instead, they use their own video encoders and decoders (which while still being H.264, it is presumedly better optimized for their use case). WebRTC forces you to use either the H.264 or the VP8 encoder&#x2F;decoder that the browser provides.<p>How they do this is by having their own custom application that you have to install. Still, some users have noticed that there is a well hidden web-based version of Zoom, which works by again running their custom encoders, thanks to WebAssembly. Also it seems that their video is transmitted via DataCahnnels [0].<p>They are not alone. Companies want to provide additional &quot;value&quot; by innovating outside of what the WebRTC standard offers.
