It greatly increases the risk of deanonymization. The question is less how this hosting service was discovered and more how it ever stayed up long enough to become so notorious. Here&#x27;s why:<p>1. Each hidden service chooses a &quot;guard&quot; relay to serve as the first hop for all connections.<p>2. A server running multiple hidden services has a guard for each of them. Each new guard is another chance to choose a guard run by the adversary.<p>3. An adversary running a fraction p of the guards (by bandwidth) has a probability p of being chosen by a given hidden service. A hosting service with k hidden services is exposed to k guards and thus has ~kp probability of chosen an adversary&#x27;s guard. With, say, 50 hidden services, an adversary with only 2% of guards has nearly 100% chance of being chosen by one of those 50 hidden services.<p>4. The adversary can tell when it is chosen as a guard by connecting to the hidden service as a client and looking for a circuit with the same pattern of communication as observed at the client. Bauer at el. [0] showed a long time ago this worked even using only the circuit construction times.<p>5. The adversary&#x27;s guard can observe the hidden service&#x27;s IP directly.<p>The risk of deanonymization with onion services in general (i.e. even not using an onion hosting service) is significant against an adversary with some resources and time. Getting 1% of guard bandwidth probably costs &lt;$500&#x2F;month using IP transit providers (e.g. relay 8ac97a37 currently has 0.3% guard probability with only ~750Mbps [1]). And every month or so a new guard is chosen, yielding another chance to choose an adversarial guard. Not to mention the risk of choosing a guard that isn&#x27;t inherently malicious but is subject to legal compulsion in a given jurisdiction (discovering the guard of a hidden service has always been and remains quite feasible with little time or money, as demonstrated by Øverlier and Syverson [2]).<p>[0] &quot;Low-Resource Routing Attacks Against Tor&quot; by Kevin Bauer, Damon McCoy, Dirk Grunwald, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Douglas Sicker.

Just might be something like the brains, a founder even (his name is what circulates but he may be a brand user so people follow and buy what he does, like pirate roberts),  his actual crime is not under investigation. They are trying to get him to do some of his own counseling between them so they can take over it, but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s what. It isn&#x27;t the FBI. It&#x27;s the local PDs, local to Marques, and while most have convincingly removed themselves from the situation, so Marques should be released, the socialist republic running Ireland doesn&#x27;t actually congratulate losers on their appeal, and his ex-girlfriend, some reporter somewhere, is attempting to use prostitution in court to single out the property rights of what is happening, intellectual property, so she can&#x27;t be seen as guilty, but she is guilty so we have just to arrange her release and she&#x27;ll turn herself in. He will then be released and the FCC and other regulatiry facilities will be asked to release a filing of his release and some funding for a Federal grant that would remove him from fault, for any double jeopardy scams coming further out of Ireland, but there aren&#x27;t any PD coming out to release him since any arrest made was on them and so was all the paper work. Convincingly enough, he may still have his own journey in place and as a young man still he could live off the lamb the moment he&#x27;s released, and he will be released, if he ever makes a start on something criminal they pretty much have him guaranteed a slot in the kingpin category and no one will look for him without a full Federal front. They accidentally made an attorney but they don&quot;t really have to borrow his time, so he&#x27;s essentially Franzese without any crime to him, and he can just afford to offer people help for now and he&#x27;ll pay them back later.\nWhen he can&#x27;t arrange his release, the FBI may look to activism with a surge in what is probably vigilanteism and it isn&#x27;t fun to say that any killing that occurs there will be on local drug dealers assuming his name so he remains kingpin.<p>This is probably why the surge in drug knowledge AGAINST cartel. There&#x27;s a false judge&#x2F;commissioner (he controls most of the phones, last time I was there, 3 weeks) in Compton courthouse, on floor 9 (Family Law and Civil Law) named Victor M Acevedo and he is literally known by like 90% of PD and all government agencies as a corrupt clerk that is planting himself in drugs to kingpin himself using Marques&#x27; wrongful imprisonment but no one can do anything about it because no one knows how to describe the situation without breaking laws and giving other cartel mark-up, as a punishment for overlooking it so long. It&#x27;s a blank slate to Marques and just another way to point pistols at people on the street and get away with it for people like Acevedo (he has pointed his pistol, twice, at me, specifically, out of his white mini van on Rosecrans Ave. for not being willing to let him continue). No one likes him in the area and his kids, about 200 of them, are constantly the victims of physical retaliation and their realty is the target of many random shootings.

Feel free to borrow&#x2F;edit it:<p>I oppose Amendment 3 to the .COM Registry Agreement. I believe that allowing wholesale prices for .com domains to rise 72% over 12 years, which is far more than the rate of inflation and also far more than Verisign&#x27;s underlying costs of maintaining the registry could possibly increase by, will dramatically hurt the internet ecosystem. It will especially hurt small website operators, like myself, and will discourage internet users from creating blogs and personal pages, with the end result of reducing democratization of the internet.<p>Verisign reported a 69.4% operating margin in Q1 2019, so they clearly do not need the extra revenue from this price hike. ICANN has granted a monopoly over .com to Verisign and ICANN has a duty to every internet user on the planet to carefully regulate this monopoly to prevent abuse by Verisign. The only conscionable thing to do right now is to freeze wholesale .com prices and re-evaluate 5-10 years from now. A policy that allows price increases tracking the rate of inflation (but no higher) may make sense in the future, but right now Verisign is already collecting far more from their .com monopoly than any company would be able to in a competitive market [1]. It&#x27;s simply not right to allow them to raise prices at this time.<p>- Kerrick<p>[1] For example, Alphabet, a highly successful player in a very high-margin industry, has an operating margin of around 25%.

This is a topic I have thought about greatly.<p>Left-handed writing, as a core difference from which all other differences stem, has you pushing on the page, which would make a right-handed writer feel uncomfortable since it is never a muscle that needs to be used for the latter. This results in shaky or crooked writing.<p>Another experience I have from pushing during left-handed writing is that my hand tires faster, as I try to switch between &quot;bent-inward&quot; index finger and relaxed index finger, which I use interchangeably depending on how much fine control I need. Using the bipod or &quot;index and thumb&quot; grip helps for fatigue, but it loses precision.<p>Finally there is the angle of the palm which varies greatly among left-handed writers, which is how do I rotate the paper so that I don&#x27;t smudge my writing, or so that I can see my writing as I go? The more the paper is rotated, the more uncomfortable it gets, but it has utility. Here are some nice diagrams on the variations: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musanim.com&#x2F;mam&#x2F;lefthand.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musanim.com&#x2F;mam&#x2F;lefthand.htm<\/a><p>For right-handed writing, most of these are never a concern for me. My right hand &quot;pulls&quot; on the page in the rightward direction and I never have to rotate the page in order to align with the writing line. Writing comes by pointing the pencil where I want  it to go and then &quot;moving&quot; it right, rather than for left-handed writing I have to push &quot;right and forward&quot;.<p>The rise of writing on tablet computers has improved the writing experience for left-handed writers by a significant amount because it can pan, zoom, and rotate as necessary. Still there remains the issue of having to push.<p>So if I can choose to use my right hand to write at all, why would I use my left hand? This may be a placebo effect, but I find that using my left hand to write allowed me to soak in concepts and let them ruminate as I write the notes. It becomes a more &quot;personal&quot; attachment to the notes I&#x27;m taking, whereas right-handed helped produce as much writing as needed.<p>One advantage with left-handed writing comes when using a tablet. Many notetaking apps such as &quot;Goodnotes 5&quot; do not present a color wheel to appear at where your pencil is pointing. The color palette stays fixed at the top right corner. Having to change color rapidly but keep the pencil in the same place is possible by using my right finger to change the color. And if I have to use the tools stuck at the top left corner, I switch to writing with my right hand and use my left hand for tool selection.<p>Finally, one nichr benefit from using both hands to write is simultaneous two-handed writing. Once can produce writing faster by using both hands to write at the same time if you can visualize ahead fast enough. It also helps when using two different pen colors (red + blue) simultaneously. It would be great if I could think in parallel and write notes in two different topics or languages at once.<p>I wonder if there are any other ambidextrous writers on here who can also weigh in with their experience."],"time":["2020-02-10 16:19:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["leg100"],"id":[22287463],"kids":[22288104,22287524,22288584],"parent":[22287174],"text":["Seem likes an awfully laboured equivalent of GCP&#x27;s OSLogin [1].

I can SSH to an instance (turning on agent forwarding, etc.) or SCP files back and forth, all the same way that I&#x27;d do it with a regular host. But that host doesn&#x27;t need to be exposed to inbound SSH traffic!<p>I was also able to get the ProxyCommand working in a Docker container, so I don&#x27;t have to install the AWS CLI or the SSM plugin on my (Linux) host system, with an .ssh&#x2F;config entry like this:<p><pre><code>  Host i-*\n    ProxyCommand docker run -i --rm -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -u 1000:1000 -v ~&#x2F;.aws:&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;.aws -e HOME=&#x2F;tmp -e AWS_PROFILE &lt;docker image ref&gt; ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters &#x27;portNumber=%p&#x27;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA few problems in practice:<p>* We often use our bastions to do port forwarding, e.g. to connect to an RDS instance inside VPC. As far as I know, we can&#x27;t accomplish this with just SSH over SSM, so we still keep our bastions.<p>* User management: SSH over SSM doesn&#x27;t do any user or key management for you (which makes sense). It establishes the SSH connection and you&#x27;re on your own from there. We use Keymaker [1] to dynamically create user accounts on the EC2 instances, and populate SSH keys according to the user&#x27;s IAM profile. This works fine, but maybe there&#x27;s room for simplification.<p>* Connecting based on instance ids (`ssh i-...`) can be awkward. It would be amazing if we could alias these somehow, like set up a CNAME that points to `i-...`. I wasn&#x27;t able to get OpenSSH to follow a CNAME and then use the ProxyCommand.

I genuinely did not understand that was a weird&#x2F;socially unacceptable thing to do.  Anyways, I&#x27;m digressing a bit.

The entire school was dragged into our gym, sat on the bleachers while the football team ran into the room through a paper banner and various students on the pep squad would juggle, dance and force everyone to make some noise. It felt like a gigantic waste of time. Nearly 30 minutes for 450+ people.<p>When I joined in the corporate drudgery I hated all of the equivalent rituals. I worked at a game company that did a literal equivalent of a pep rally for the 100+ employees who were in the process of finaling a game.

Looking at the observations presented I&#x27;m inclined to side with the university president.<p>1. The university staff were mostly sullen at a culture workshop, enthusiasm was low.<p>2. Disney is an entertainment world leader.<p>3. Disney attributes its leadership position to its corporate culture, evidenced at Disney sites which are in a world of their own compared to other entertainment sites - if you&#x27;ve ever been to a Six Flags (USA) or Alton Towers (UK) you&#x27;ll know that they don&#x27;t compare to the all around experience at Disneyland.<p>4. Disney is selling a consulting service to other enterprises to improve cultural coherence, it costs millions.<p>5. The author objects to the suggested focus of culture. In their words:<p>&gt; We were introduced at the beginning of the workshop to the university’s brand new slogan:  “Only at GW, we change the world, one life at a time.” Hold on. We change the world only at GW? And we achieve this absurd ambition how? The answer, it turns out, is pretty vacuous—by being nice. “Care,” we were told, is one of our three “Service Priorities.”<p>The author shows no evidence of understanding the purpose of a mission statement, which is a guiding principle that cuts across all aspects of an organization&#x27;s basic deliverables, to help guide all staff on what service delivery would look like if more than the bare minimum service were to be offered. &quot;Only at GW, we change the world, one life at a time&quot;. How is this not vacuous? i) it helps you understand you are looking to create change that is remarkable and identifiable to GW, not just any old university, ii) it reminds you the changes being made are to change a young student&#x27;s life, it&#x27;s not just to teach them factoids, iii) it reminds you that the goal of GW is to change the world through it&#x27;s teaching, not train people to pass exams and get certificates.<p>6. The author is combating the university&#x27;s efforts to get a common aspirational purpose, instead they are trying to create a common rebellion against leadership, so they must want something else that leadership is offering.

Or worse, we’ve got a negative culture. This was the verdict of the Disney Institute, which the president of our university commissioned last year to assess the culture on our campus. Fortunately, the institute, which is the “professional development and external training arm of The Walt Disney Company,” has a remediation plan. It has designed workshops to teach us the cultural “values” and “service priorities” we evidently require.<p>The culture that Disney has crafted for us is not, it should be said, the high culture of the arts that the poet Matthew Arnold described as “sweetness and light.” Nor is it the anthropological notion of culture—a system of meaning that shapes social behavior. Rather, it is corporate culture, a creature that has become all the rage in the business world—and now, it seems, is burrowing its way into universities. Its professed aim is to instill a sense of shared purpose among employees, but its real objective is far more coercive and insidious.<p>Our president is rumored to have forked over three to four million dollars to the Disney Institute to improve our culture (he refuses to reveal the cost). A select group of faculty and staff, those identified as opinion leaders, are being offered all-expenses paid trips to the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando “to gain first-hand insight into Disney’s approach to culture.” For everyone else, the university is conducting culture training workshops that run up to two hours. All staff and managers are required to attend. Faculty are strongly “encouraged” to participate, and some contract faculty, who have little job security, evidently have been compelled to do so.<p>I attended one of these workshops. It was a surreal experience. About a hundred mostly sullen university employees—maintenance workers, administrative staff, faculty members, and more—filled a ballroom. Two workshop leaders strained to gin up the crowd’s enthusiasm with various exhortations and exercises, supplemented by several slickly produced videos. The result was a cross between a pep rally and an indoctrination camp.<p>We were introduced at the beginning of the workshop to the university’s brand new slogan: “Only at GW, we change the world, one life at a time.” Hold on. We change the world only at GW? And we achieve this absurd ambition how? The answer, it turns out, is pretty vacuous—by being nice. “Care,” we were told, is one of our three “Service Priorities.” We were given “Service Priorities” table-tent cards, conveniently sized for our pocketbooks and billfolds so we can whip them out whenever we needed to remind ourselves how we change the world. These cards offer a series of declarative statements—pabulum, some might say—about our “care” priorities. Here’s a sample: “I support a caring environment by greeting, welcoming, and thanking others.” To help us care for others, the university has established a “positive vibes submission” website, where we “can send a positive vibe to someone.” It was hard to detect many positive vibes in the workshop itself.<p>The other two “service priorities” give us a clearer idea of the culture initiative’s real agenda. One is “safety;” the other, “efficiency.” Both exhort employees to improve their work performance. The very first “safety” recommendation is an injunction to “keep areas clean, well-maintained, and inviting.” An important measure of “efficiency” is a willingness to “embrace change and [be] open to new ways of working.” One might wonder whether work efficiency would be enhanced by redirecting the millions of dollars that are going to the Disney Institute into staff salaries or bonuses instead. But that misses the point. The main purpose of this corporate culture initiative is to create a more disciplined and compliant workforce. Our workshop leaders actually acknowledged that “compliance” is a central pillar of the project.<p>Lastly, we were introduced to “Our GW Values”—“ours” only in the sense that they were being imposed on us. One might think that our president would be interested in promoting and honoring the values that are specific to our mission as a university, such as innovative research, teaching excellence, critical inquiry, and new ideas. Think again. As crafted by the Disney Institute and its administrative acolytes, “Our GW Values” are “integrity,” “collaboration,” “courage,” “respect,” “excellence,” “diversity,” and “openness.” All worthy values, to be sure, but is it possible to offer a more generic and innocuous set of standards?<p>The GW culture initiative can be summed up in two words: Mickey Mouse.<p>Guest blogger Dane Kennedy is the Elmer Louis Kayser Professor of History and International Affairs at George Washington University."],"time":["2020-02-10 19:39:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["treebornfrog"],"id":[22291738],"kids":{},"parent":[22290580],"text":["Site seems to be down?"],"time":["2020-02-10 19:24:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DrNuke"],"id":[22291331],"kids":{},"parent":[22290580],"text":["I would call that spade a spade and say Cretinisation but hey, I’m technically a boomer, so who knows..."],"time":["2020-02-10 18:41:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22291478],"kids":{},"parent":[22290580],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-10 18:58:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["lisper"],"id":[22287373],"kids":[22287427,22288497,22290150,22287586,22294937,22287417,22287541,22290287,22288913,22287594,22287422],"parent":[22286475],"text":["I am writing this from a cruise ship in the south china sea.

By October of this year, the city had counted 25 crash-induced fatalities, already higher than last year’s total.<p>The most notable change in SF has been the delayed light cycle after pedestrian crosswalk comes on. There was a spike in deaths after that change and I understood why immediately - drivers were timing the light by watching the crosswalk countdown and&#x2F;or the cross traffic&#x27;s light cycle. Your light used to turn green just as the other direction&#x27;s light turned red. When they suddenly changed all the light I noticed a fair number of cars jolt forward then stop, confused, until their light actually changes 4 seconds later.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this change results in deaths directly, but it definitely added to road rage out there. When the light does change and a car is turning, the expectations are different now. Pedestrians are in the middle of the street already and are less wary of cars jumping out because before there was a moment when everyone would figure out the situation before moving (ideally). Now people are mid-crosswalk and have no idea when the cars&#x27; light is going to change which leaves pedestrians more vulnerable.<p>Another issue I imagine is cars that are making a legal right turn on a red light. The driver looks to see if they can go and have their head turned the exact opposite direction of the crosswalk and wouldn&#x27;t be aware of when the crosswalk symbol changes. Meanwhile, pedestrians aren&#x27;t expecting a car to suddenly turn into them 2 seconds after they step into the crosswalk and it is a recipe for disaster. I don&#x27;t see how they can fix that now without banning all turns on red.<p>There is also a particularly ugly intersection at Laguna and Geary where they instituted a delayed green when crossing over Geary. People were getting run over in the crosswalks because there is an extra long crosswalk on both sides and cars were turning from both directions with other cars getting backed up and unable to go around them. Because there isn&#x27;t room for dedicated turn lanes, they have one side go then the other side go, but people lose their shit when they see the southbound cars coming at them for 15 seconds while their light is still red because all prior experience at other lights indicates they should also have a green light when other cars are going... I have seen multiple cars simply drive through that red light and one time 3 cars in a row just decided to go despite the red. They finally put up a sign that says &quot;delayed green&quot; which seems to be helping, but it is an imperfect solution and another counter-intuitive solution."],"time":["2020-02-10 09:34:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sliken"],"id":[22295466],"kids":{},"parent":[22286539],"text":["I live in a &quot;bike friendly city&quot;, competing for the friendliest bike cities.

I don&#x27;t think this is true.<p>Our eyes are very sensitive to color shades and we&#x27;ll easily notice if something is off. Colors are carefully picked by designers to fit together in quite subjective and non-mathematical manner. From observing some well constructed palettes, I derived the basic process used to create them. Pick the approximate colors you want, arrange them so they are all visible, and then tweak color shades so that all of them could exist under same lightning conditions in physical world. If some color seems jarring or wrong, that&#x27;s because it could only exist under different lightning from rest of palette.<p>The text seems to neglect the vast amount of information lost when we use just a single point in color space to represent the whole light spectrum. For example, magenta signifies presence of both bluish and reddish wavelengths. If your math is not based on spectrum components, how do you hope to arrive to correct color when mixing two spectrums? Linear interpolation between two points in color space?<p>I think HSL is huge improvement over RGB model for designers, but other color spaces aren&#x27;t really worth the effort.

I made the move to iOS 5 years ago and regret it for a few reasons.<p>1. I became &quot;stuck&quot; doing iOS development. I recently had to switch jobs, and even though I have some server and web experience, it was more scattered and dated than my iOS experience. I was looking for senior software engineer positions and with my track record of iOS development, the only positions that gave me an interview were the iOS ones of which there were a lot less.  If I had a history of server work, I have a feeling I would have gotten a lot more interviews even for jobs that didn&#x27;t use the specific stack my experience was in.  At this point, if I want to get back into full stack dev, I would either have to convince my current job to switch teams, or take a cut in seniority and pay.<p>2. iOS development is behind on modern UI dev concepts. Developing for iOS feels like going back to jQuery or Backbone.js from React.  Things like a declarative user interface, automatic DOM re-rendering and UI Bindings are in their infant state in iOS, while they have been core concepts of web frameworks for a decade. As a result, a lot of iOS code out there is very messy.  While the web moved towards light user interface components and centralizing business logic in the Redux state, iOS stayed with the MVC pattern which in practice often results in giant, untested view controller files very reminiscent of the big jQuery script files of the early 2000s.  You can try to fight this by adding your own architecture and external libraries, but such approaches will always be second class citizens, not the default.<p>(SwiftUI is going to address some of these issues.  However, its a newer technology and most existing iOS apps will be slow to adapt to it)<p>3. It will be harder to pass a FAANG interview.  One of the crucial interviews is the &quot;system design&quot; interview which is almost always server related. As opposed to the algorithm questions which are easy to study for from a book, the only good way to answer these system design questions well is by having experience in designing and building such systems. If you stay on the client side doing iOS or front end, you won&#x27;t be able to answer such a question effectively.<p>The reason I moved to iOS from front end was because I wanted to get outside of the browser to a more full feature platform.  In retrospect though, the obvious platform to transition to is not iOS or mobile dev, its the server.  The server is a full feature platform which gives you the ultimate freedom to do whatever you want.  And while frameworks like Ruby on Rails or React come and go, I found that job openings were pretty indifferent between the specific framework you worked on as long as you have server experience in general."],"time":["2020-02-10 18:09:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nyxtom"],"id":[22290243],"kids":{},"parent":[22288217],"text":["React Native and then you don&#x27;t have to :D"],"time":["2020-02-10 17:03:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["swiley"],"id":[22289903],"kids":{},"parent":[22288217],"text":["The only thing native really gives you is notifications and performance (and better sensor access) at the cost of high coupling and having to use a specific OS for development.<p>Church-Turing yadda yadda"],"time":["2020-02-10 16:28:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dzonga"],"id":[22289686],"kids":{},"parent":[22288217],"text":["nope. iOS market reach is limited, as you&#x27;re likely to reach more potential customers via web.

Rather than specifying object ownership as a reference owns an object, we generalise this a little to a reference can own a region, where a region is a group of objects. Within a region, any object can refer to any other object in that region. There is no restriction on the topology. When the owning reference to a region goes away then the entire region is collected.<p>In Rust, objects referenced by owning pointers form a tree--there is a unique pointer to each object. In Verona, an owning pointer references a sub-graph of the heap that is disjoint except for the path through the owning pointer. The sub-graph can be reclaimed when the owning pointer goes out of scope. Within the sub-graph, there are no restrictions, so you can have cyclic structures like doubly-linked lists. In Rust, by contrast, having a doubly-linked list requires either raw pointers and unsafe, or some sort of reference-counted pointer.<p>You can use regions to statically enforce the property that other pointers into a region, for example from the stack, cannot outlive the owning pointer for the region (and thus the region itself). Allowing such temporary aliasing of objects potentially eliminates or at least reduces the need for a borrowing mechanism. In Rust, for example, you run into borrowing as soon as you try to iterate over a linked list. If you allow temporary aliasing (and ensure that the iterator pointer cannot outlive the region by restricting its scope to a context where the region is live) you don&#x27;t need a borrowing concept.<p>Using regions this way addresses one of the vague dissatisfaction I have with Rust, which is you need to introduce borrowing just to iterate over a singly linked list, and you need raw pointers and unsafe, or a special mechanism that uses unsafe under the hood, to have doubly linked lists. On the other hand, this creates problems as well. For example, <i>within a region<\/i>, you can&#x27;t delete an object when the pointer to it goes out of scope, because it may be referenced from another object. So while you can always safely reclaim a region when the owning pointer goes out of scope, you can produce unbounded memory use by creating objects within regions. (As far as I can tell, Verona doesn&#x27;t attempt to address that issue, yet.)"],"time":["2020-02-10 20:38:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dang"],"id":[22290871],"kids":{},"parent":[22290108],"text":["Two related discussions in the recent weeks:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22074707\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22074707<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21682867\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21682867<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-10 17:58:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["atombender"],"id":[22291926],"kids":[22291944],"parent":[22290108],"text":["When I first heard Microsoft was working on Rust-style safety, the context was adding it to C#.

His campaign hasn&#x27;t exactly taken off, but it&#x27;s certainly struck a nerve with at least some folks. I expect we will start to see this sort of left-populism continue to grow, with UBI specifically becoming more popular as a counter to the perceived unfairness of means tested.<p>One particular subject that this article mentions, and that I didn&#x27;t initially agree with until I read one of Yang&#x27;s books - is the notion that human labor markets are actually very inelastic, and don&#x27;t self correct easily. People choose jobs for reasons that are often based on identity, not on economics. I may not agree with this particular author&#x27;s point on masculinity being why Hillary lost - I do agree that is the root cause for many working men not taking pink collar jobs even if desperate. The reverse happens too - many women would never work construction or truck driving even if it pays well. With that in mind, it is fundamentally much easier to craft policy that provides alternative jobs and income opportunities than it is to change a person&#x27;s sense of identity or society&#x27;s sense of masculinity. So again, it comes back to economic policy (like UBI) needng to be front and center.<p>One last thing - many working class people are enterprising and do want to start businesses, even if that&#x27;s impractical. Min wage increases and paid time off don&#x27;t help you do that, and they also dont mean anything for people who work gig jobs &#x2F; contract to pay the bills.

Now there is a chasm between them. As of 2005, 85 percent of children born to upper-middle-class families were living with both biological parents when the mom was 40. Among working-class families, only 30 percent were. According to a 2012 report from the National Center for Health Statistics, college-educated women ages 22 to 44 have a 78 percent chance of having their first marriage last at least 20 years. Women in the same age range with a high-school degree or less have only about a 40 percent chance. Among Americans ages 18 to 55, only 26 percent of the poor and 39 percent of the working class are currently married. In her book Generation Unbound, Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution, cited research indicating that differences in family structure have “increased income inequality by 25 percent.” If the U.S. returned to the marriage rates of 1970, child poverty would be 20 percent lower. As Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, once put it, “It is the privileged Americans who are marrying, and marrying helps them stay privileged.”<p>I think this paragraph has a lot to say about how marital cooperation helps wealth creation. I&#x27;ve seen statistics (a long time ago) that a married couple only consumes 1.4 times the living expenses of a single person. The rest can go in the bank or into a higher standard of living.  This also has the economic benefit of diversification, where the family can still make ends meet if one income is lost.<p>&quot;Marriage inequality&quot; does not seem to be a category of inequality that can ever be addressed through government led redistributive efforts."],"time":["2020-02-10 14:30:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["downerending"],"id":[22291566],"kids":{},"parent":[22288351],"text":["This title is pretty misleading.

(I have since switched to anonymous handles). I can only imagine what it&#x27;s like for Tim Ferriss himself.<p>If you&#x27;re not familiar with Tim Ferriss, there are several reasons why he&#x27;s more attractive to dangerous followers than the average influencer:<p>- He was among the first to crack the &quot;influencer&quot; code, gaining fame and popularity through book publishing and early social media websites (pre-Instagram). Back then, there weren&#x27;t nearly as many influencers to know about, let alone follow.<p>- He rose to fame via punchy self-help books like &quot;The Four Hour Workweek&quot; and &quot;The Four Hour Body&quot;. He talks about having chosen those topics to give solutions to the average problems faced by modern people. He makes calculated moves to target the widest range of people who are looking for answers to life&#x27;s basic challenges.<p>- He has moved toward more respectable topics over time, but his early work tended toward fantastical claims and unrealistic promises. It was more fantasy than practical, but always grounded in an inspiring shroud of &quot;What if he&#x27;s right?&quot; This leaves the hopeful readers hooked while filtering out the rational skeptics. I joke that he applied the Nigerian prince scam filtering mechanism to self-help books.<p>- In the past, he dabbled in pure clickbait that wasn&#x27;t grounded in reality. For example, consider his famous blog post about gaining 34 lbs of muscle in 28 days with only 4 hours of total gym time using secret techniques of the &quot;little-known Colorado Experiment&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;from-geek-to-freak-how-i-gained-34-lbs-of-muscle-in-4-weeks&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;from-geek-to-freak-how-i-gained-...<\/a> If you&#x27;re at all familiar with weightlifting or exercise science you&#x27;ll understand how impossible this is, yet it circulated for years on message boards from beginners who were convinced that Tim Ferriss was a guru who could help them achieve the impossible.<p>- One of Tim&#x27;s books has a section about contacting famous people who you wouldn&#x27;t normally expect to respond to you. He encourages readers to contact famous people as an example of achieving what you previously thought was impossible. This is intertwined with his stories about life hacking or using clever tricks to achieve impossible goals. It&#x27;s not surprising that his fans have chosen to apply those techniques to Tim Ferriss himself, by following his social media and calling around at hotels to find him. He all but encouraged this behavior in his first book.<p>- Recently, Tim has been pushing Psychedelic medicine as a miracle cure for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. He has made some very respectable and noble efforts to raise money for proper scientific research. He also gives pseudo-warnings on his podcasts to not attempt DIY psychedelic treatment for psychiatric issues, but his disclaimers have a very &quot;wink, wink&quot; after we&#x27;ve received fantastical advice about getting rich, traveling the world, getting fit, and so on from Tim over the years. I have no doubt that many of his fans have begun experimenting with psychedelics to treat their severe depression and anxiety without the help of psychiatrists, which is not a recipe for healthy outcomes.<p>In other words, Tim Ferriss almost defines the modern &quot;Guru&quot; archetype. Fame and publicity always come with a risk of stalkers and negative attention, but I believe Tim&#x27;s position as a self-help guru and psychedelic medicine pusher has amplified uniquely amplified his reach among the most vulnerable individuals. I feel truly sorry for him, of course, but it&#x27;s helpful to understand the larger context of how he arrived in this position if you&#x27;re wondering how this could apply to other internet-famous people."],"time":["2020-02-09 15:46:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["okareaman"],"id":[22284501],"kids":[22285847],"parent":[22280753],"text":["The irony of this blog entry is that Tim Ferris is a relentless self-promoter who continues that practice for the entire first half of this essay before finally getting to the drawbacks of being a successful self-promoter.

It was discontinued 10 years ago or so, they asked me to revise it for the modern world, and it didn&#x27;t really make sense: rewriting it for what assembly language is and is used for in today&#x27;s world would be a ton of work because it&#x27;s a qualitative difference, and if I added an extra chapter explaining 32-bit and 64-bit changes and letting the publisher stamp a &quot;2010 edition&quot; logo on the cover would just be scamming people, which I don&#x27;t want to do.

If you don&#x27;t know what that means, you need to master this first. So much of assembly is built to support higher-level programming, things like segments, indirect references, system calls, etc., so it pays to know the WHY of all of it (e.g. do you know what a frame pointer is? why it&#x27;s useful and can sometimes be omitted)? Learn this stuff first.<p>Once you have a good handle on C, you need to start learning how operating systems and memory management work, at least the &quot;client side&quot; of them accessible from userspace.<p>Then you might want to dip your toe into how CPUs are built, with pipelines, registers, caches, all of that.<p>If you&#x27;ve mastered those things, gcc -S will provide everything else you need (another comment suggested this).<p>I learned this stuff in a traditional university computer engineering program. It helped a lot. But for context, this question feels a little like, &quot;can someone explain quantum physics&quot;? It&#x27;s a huge topic but only like 5% is the actual thing you&#x27;re asking about, the other 95% is the conceptual machinery (calculus, probability, mechanics) it&#x27;s built on. Mastering all the other stuff is actually the hard part. For all intents and purposes, assembly is just a notational convenience for expressing program structure in the only way a CPU can understand it. At least 90% of the difficulty is understanding how CPUs work, and how to think at sufficiently low level that you can express human-useful work at such a low level of abstraction.<p>It would also be nice to know why you want to know this. Writing a device driver is going to be different from writing an operating system, which will be different from writing tight numerical loops in assembly.

Setting aggressive HTTP timeouts can be quite informative in finding &quot;interesting&quot; HTTP endpoints.  Set them, enable tracing, and search for timeouts every morning.  At my last job, I found an interesting &quot;charge_cards&quot; endpoint and learned that someone logs in every day, clicks &quot;charge cards&quot; and all billing is handled in the frontend web process instead of the event queue.  It was idempotent so it wasn&#x27;t a problem (just click reload until it returns), but was an interesting bit of visibility into a large system.  Knowing that that&#x27;s how it works makes it less surprising when someone wonders &quot;I noticed cards didn&#x27;t get charged&quot;.  Is the person who normally does that on vacation?  Aha, that&#x27;s why.  This never caused us any problems so we didn&#x27;t rewrite it, but it&#x27;s always nice to have weirdness exposed front and center so you are less surprised when it starts causing an issue.<p>It was also interesting to read about a wide deployment of circuit breaking.  That&#x27;s a relatively new concept to me (never ran into it at Google, for whatever reason), but it&#x27;s another way to prevent weird outages.  Last week I upgraded something in my k8s cluster and the API server stopped responding.  With the API server unresponsive, I couldn&#x27;t kill the workload (or even determine if that&#x27;s what was causing it).  I had to kill all the nodes before I could get back in.  If the job were communicating to the API server through a circuit breaker, it would have popped after requests started taking too long, and I would have been able to just kill the job instead of having downtime.  But, I guess it&#x27;s still a relatively esoteric concept.<p>I know this article is about not doing dumb things in production.  I just assume those are a given.

Once you learn from the material presented (unless extremely complex or required to keep as reference), you rarely go back and study and appreciate this kind of writing repeatedly.<p>Stage 2) Someone who has done the analysis and exercise enough that the writing evolves into not just instructions or rote description, but narration through the reasons <i>why<\/i> they did it this way, the pitfalls to watch out for, what <i>not<\/i> to do.  Starts you thinking about what to do next.<p>Stage 3) Someone whose telling of the technical detail is so fluid and practiced that the basics are unquestioned -- the writing now includes well-informed opinions and jokes about past attempts at the outcome, why they failed and their historical context in technical terms.  Gives advice on the difficulties that will be encountered and the limits of the method.   The writing is so informative that you may return to read it again and again throughout your career.<p>One of my favorite texts that reaches Stage 3 is <i>Numerical Recipes in C<\/i> (which unfortunately I don&#x27;t have much occasion to refer to nowadays), and the way that programming philosophy, advice, and technical instruction combines in that work is very impressive.

This might also be used for having some format for delivery info, and for purchases.<p>- For replies to customer service tickets, you could use a part of the message ID.<p>For &quot;Elements Represent Themselves&quot;, note that different users may use a different desktop environment and some none at all (I do not use a desktop environment on my computer). X selections could be used. For example, if the user clicks on a filename in another program, it could take the FILE_MANAGEMENT selection; if a file manager is running, it will notice that it has lost ownership of that selection and can use that to trigger a menu or something. In many cases, even the PRIMARY selection is good enough; the user selects the text and then enters some global key command which causes it to execute another program to do something with the selected text, whether it is converting a unit of measurement, ping a IP address, etc.<p>You could also have a similar idea for HTML documents; this is another use of the &lt;widget&gt; element I have described before that I think would be a good idea. For example, you could use &lt;widget&gt; to mark some text as representing a measurement. Since &lt;widget&gt; normally acts like &lt;span&gt;, the text is visible and you can still use document JavaScripts to provide this functionality too (just like any other &lt;span&gt;), although if the user has their own implementation, then it might provide more units to convert to (even if document scripts are disabled). And if neither &lt;widget&gt; nor scripts are implemented, it still works as static text!<p>Standard format for defining keybindings seems like it could work, although some programs may need their own extensions to the format due to various things, but even then, many common commands will be able to be copied without a problem, so it may still be helpful anyways.<p>I agree about 66 &quot;Wizards and Forms Request Data&quot;. Furthermore, it should be possible to write the file locally and send it using a command-line interface, or even automatically convert data entered together with an uploaded file, for this purpose. (A scriptable interface makes this possible to do.)<p>For &quot;Right Click Outsource&quot;, that may be good for a desktop environment; for people such as myself who use command-line interface, in some cases it can work. You could have one command which outsources audio, one which outsources directories, etc. (You could also have a FUSE to represent these things and then use a single interface with all of them, including a GUI if you want to.)<p>Mounting email attachments seems a good idea. A program could be made which allows mounting a mbox file in this way.<p>For 90 &quot;Views of Data&quot;, SQLite has a virtual table mechanism, and also supports in-memory databases. These features could be used to do some of this stuff (and SQLite includes an extension to access JSON data in this way, actually; the command-line interface also supports importing CSV, too). But sometimes I want to be able to access remote data in this way and (and even make a join query between multiple remote data sources, such as movie times and weather, or any other combination that you might want). However, there are some deficiencies in the virtual table mechanism, such as the inability to have indexes on expressions (including nondeterministic expressions, which in the case of virtual tables, is sometimes useful), partial indexes, consuming LIMIT&#x2F;OFFSET clauses, etc. (If it supports these things, the client could then understand such a thing as &quot;ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1&quot; and have it automatically convert into the request to access a random record.)"],"time":["2020-02-09 04:58:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SeekingMeaning"],"id":[22279957],"kids":[22279975,22281256],"parent":[22265541],"text":["I’m on mobile and when my finger touches the screen, the page zooms out, and when I let go, it zooms back in—but off center.

I figured this out because i had a new phone that wouldn&#x27;t accept the SIM size, so I carried both that and the working phone with the sim for a short time. Google Maps and Open street maps works offline, but you need to be online to, say, get driving directions. Google will still give turn-by-turn directions offline, though. It simply won&#x27;t have the same features of your choice of maps.<p>I think facebook still works so long as you have signed up from a computer, but I might be wrong. I&#x27;ve only considered having it on my tablet (that has never had a sim), but never bothered to install it on my phone.<p>So many things depend more on the device being on the internet (through whatever means) than having the sim card. The main thing you need it for is phone calls, SMS, and roaming internet - and sometimes, banking, but not always. I&#x27;ve realized this because my phone has roaming internet turned off by defaut - I use wifi as my primary phone internet and as it turns out, I pay minimal amounts for the phone (I&#x27;m not willing to go without, even though it is rarely used)."],"time":["2020-02-09 10:45:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TimTheTinker"],"id":[22282510],"kids":{},"parent":[22282150],"text":["Fascinating article!
