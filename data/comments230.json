While the point of the article seems lost in it’s nonsense and meandering story, there are a couple of good points:<p>1) The one person who says “I go 80 anyway so I like it”. People drive whatever speed they want regardless of speed limit. Case in point, the person who said “I still drive 70 because 75 is too fast”. There’s nothing inherently dangerous about speed until you hit something. Cars hitting each other is much more likely when the speed differential increases.<p>2) The person who talks about the economy having more of an impact on driving behavior than speed limits. I’d love to see more data on that, but regardless of if it’s true, we know that the speed limit doesn’t have the biggest impact on driver safety, and we know that thanks to<p>3) The Autobahn referenced at the very end of the article, and other no-limit freeways that exist even in America. I had an opportunity to drive on some unrestricted sections of the Autobahn this past summer and even with the huge differentials in speed, drivers managed to not crash into each other.<p>I don’t know what the problem is so I don’t know what the solution is, but I can make a couple more observations. First, Germany has a law that your car has to be in proper working order and it’s taken off the roads if it’s not. Having spent a lot of time in Northern Michigan where this article takes place, there is no guarantee that cars on the road are working. As long as the car can move, people will drive it. Doesn’t matter how long they’ve been using the same brakes or tires. So when it comes time to avoid an accident, their car is not capable of stopping or maneuvering in time.<p>Secondly, drivers training in the US is abysmal. You’re expected to learn how to avoid collisions by yourself, and you’re expected to learn how to drive in bad weather (wind, snow, rain) by yourself, on public roads, with other drivers around you.<p>An extra five miles per hour on a limited-access freeway in an amazingly rural area should not impact anything at all, ever.

There are many that are proponents of Universal Basic Income (UBI). However, many state that one problem with UBI is that it comes at the expense of personal gratification and economic productivity.<p>I am of the opinion that low wage jobs are a form of UBI. In this manner, individuals are paid a basic income in exchange for their productivity. However, these jobs are not meant to create wealth. They&#x27;re meant to provide subsistance. This is much the same goal of UBI.<p>For those that say that benefits (health, retirement, sick pay, family leave, vacation) are necessary in addition to low wage income which often does not supply many or any of these benefits, I would say that is the case for UBI as well.<p>For UBI to work, there must be a base of benefits to support the UBI. As such, I see UBI and low wage as fairly synonymous except that UBI is seen as providing income without any productivity required of the individual, and low wage being UBI with required productivity.<p>In many ways UBI and low wage work come at odds. The more that UBI is offered, the less that individuals would want to do low wage work. Rather than pushing up wages for low wage work, dis-incentivization of low wage will push employers towards automation. As such, low wage is a support of employment generally. The more that employers move towards automation, the more that low wage jobs are eliminated, the more that UBI becomes the only alternative to low wage.

There seems to be no amount of provisos or hedging my bet that adequately protects me from ridiculous personal attacks for speaking at all.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical that articles like this one are at all a reasonable picture of what&#x27;s going on with the economy. I&#x27;m skeptical because I&#x27;m one of those poor people that makes too little money in the new economy and I&#x27;m quite clear this is the happy, shiny version of my life where unicorns fart rainbows.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m certainly sick to death of being poor, struggling to make ends meet, etc. I&#x27;m sick to death of the classism and gender issues that help keep my financial problems alive.<p>But the reality is that I&#x27;m supposed to be dead.

It&#x27;s been possible because of doing low paying gig work and my income is as low as it is in part because I don&#x27;t work that much.<p>I hesitate to admit that because I know from long experience that people are quick to latch onto a detail like that and use it to justify making zero effort to address other issues, like classist and sexist BS that is also part of the problem.<p>Many years ago, I read a study that measured real world things like how many meals per day someone got. The conclusion was that less than one half percent of Americans were <i>poor<\/i> by the standards of less developed countries like India.<p>Similarly, I was a military wife for many years and found that it was nigh impossible to compare military compensation packages to civilian ones. A large part of the value of military compensation is in &quot;benefits,&quot; not cash pay. It&#x27;s very much an apples to oranges comparison and it&#x27;s damn near impossible to articulate.<p>I&#x27;m unconvinced that we have a good means to adequately measure and understand current quality of life as compared to historical norms. I&#x27;m dirt poor and I&#x27;m currently broadcasting to the globe via a cheap ass smartphone and free membership on a public forum. That same smartphone holds multiple games, serves as my personal library and more.<p>When I was a military wife, we had multiple bookcases lining the walls of our living room. They held hundreds of books and, later, dozens of boxes from software that came with a paper booklet and a CD or floppy to install it.<p>I currently live in an SRO. My life could not work at all if I still needed hundreds of books and physical storage for software<p>It wouldn&#x27;t work because I don&#x27;t have the money for more space. It wouldn&#x27;t work because papers make me sick. It wouldn&#x27;t work for a long list of reasons.<p>I don&#x27;t think we have any idea how to measure how much of our lives have moved from physical goods to virtual ones and how that presents itself to the eyes of the world as seeming poverty because we own so much less physically. To my mind, it&#x27;s like magic. It&#x27;s like having a DnD bag of holding for books, software and more.<p>Life is different these days. We don&#x27;t have any idea how to incorporate that fact into our metrics for measuring things like poverty.<p>I desperately want the US to fix its health care issues and housing problems. These are very real problems that very negatively impact the country and weigh especially heavily on the lower classes who have less money.<p>But I am less convinced that the trend of low paid work, whether from jobs or gig work, is really some kind of evil, malicious, abusive trend where rich people are being intentionally awful to line their pockets at the expense of everyone else. I think it&#x27;s far more complicated than that and I don&#x27;t think it gets acknowledged at all. I don&#x27;t think we are even discussing that angle, in part because no one wants to suggest that poverty isn&#x27;t really a problem or be accused of implying such by wondering out loud about some of this stuff.<p>I can afford to occasionally comment on it because I&#x27;m already a social outcast that everyone thinks is crazy.

It&#x27;s actually on page 6 and 7 that we finally get the definition:<p>&gt; While there is no universal definition of a low-wage worker, we use the often-employed threshold of two-thirds median wages for full-time&#x2F;full-year workers, with slight modification. When determining median wages, we consider only wages for males. This raises the threshold, since men earn more than women on average, but using the typical male worker as the benchmark limits the extent to which gender inequality in wages effects our definition. While this is a less common approach to take, we are not the first to do so.<p>...<p>&gt; The average of the national threshold across our five years of data, in 2016 real dollars, is $16.03, and the adjusted thresholds range from $12.54 in Beckley, W.Va. to $20.02 in San Jose, Calif.<p>They should probably include some of this info without sending you through 3 different links to track it out, but whatever.<p>Moving on:<p>&gt;However, imagine that everyone without a college degree suddenly earned one. The jobs that pay low wages would not disappear. Hospitals would still need nursing assistants, hotels would need housekeepers, day care centers would need child care workers, and so on.<p>If everyone had a college degree, and assuming in the hypothetical that they had higher human capital (since the hypothetical doesn&#x27;t really make sense under signalling theories of education), then productivity would be higher in other jobs, which would increase pay for their example jobs due to the Baumol effect.<p>&gt;Wages for most workers (except those at the top) have stagnated or declined in recent decades, even as costs for basic inputs to a stable life—such as health care, housing, and education—have skyrocketed.<p>For the stagnation claim, their own source disproves them:<p>&gt;After adjusting for inflation, wages are only 10 percent higher in 2017 than they were in 1973, with annual real wage growth just below 0.2 percent.<p>Those numbers are themselves somewhat misleading, there&#x27;s nuances with measures of inflation, total compensation vs wages, etc, but even their source is sufficient to disprove the claim that &quot;Wages for most workers (except those at the top) have stagnated or declined in recent decades&quot;<p>The other half is a weird claim. &quot;health care, housing, and education&quot; are part of the inflation index. If your wages are higher after adjusted for inflation, then you can afford more &quot;health care, housing, and education&quot; than before. Yes, they will cost more, but by definition other parts of the inflation index will have gone down, and your total cost to purchase the same basket of goods is now lower as a percentage of your wages."],"time":["2020-01-12 17:04:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dvduval"],"id":[22026905],"kids":{},"parent":[22026667],"text":["In this global economy, much depends on the quality of education&#x2F;training our workers are getting compared with other countries.

In the case of a read-ahead you get READ|REQ_RAHEAD which tells I&#x2F;O driver this is a read-ahead.  In this case, if there are insufficient resources at the time this request is received, the driver is permitted to terminate the operation with BLK_STS_IOERR status.  Here is an example in Linux md&#x2F;raid5 driver.<p>&gt; In case of Unraid it can definitely happen under heavy load that a read-ahead comes along and there are no &#x27;stripe buffers&#x27; immediately available.  In this case, instead of making calling process wait, it terminated the I&#x2F;O.  This has worked this way for years.<p>[...]<p>&gt;  What I suspect is that this is a bug in SQLite - I think SQLite is using direct-I&#x2F;O (bypassing page cache) and issuing it&#x27;s own read-aheads and their logic to handle failing read-ahead is broken.

This should not be an area of focus - There are better climate change opportunities to put money towards<p>2. The project is ineffective and introduces a lot of other environmental problems<p>For the first point it seems like people are arguing as if it is a binary problem. It isn’t - The threat of climate change &#x2F; environmental damage is an incredibly complex one that will not be fixed by a single technology &#x2F; focus&#x2F; policy change. For me the questions are a. ’Are existing plastics in our ocean a problem? (yes) b. If someone is passionate about this should they have a crack at improving things? (yes) This is not consuming all the worlds available financing for environmental action so I don’t think wasted resourcing is a particularly good argument. Several commentators also talk about focusing on other ‘lower’ hanging fruit but this is not an objective measure - For a team made up of excellent engineers, oceanographers, fluid dynamics experts etc this may be a lower hanging fruit than trying to implement large scale policy change.<p>For the second point it comes down to the motivations of the team and their capacity and capability to improve the product. I would presume the team are incredibly passionate about improving the environment and so things like danger to floating marine life, use of diesel in boats etc would absolutely be something they are aware of and actively looking to mitigate. The fact this is (at least) the third iteration demonstrates they are working to improve on what they know is a currently flawed solution - This is development cycle!<p>This is not to say that critique is bad. Hopefully the team are humble enough to absorb the critique and continue to iterate on their solution to resolve the real issues raised but as long as there is a continued focus on the goal of environmental cleanup and good governance surrounding this I think this is a fantastic project and hopefully it is joined by many more ambitious activities."],"time":["2020-01-12 21:35:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gizmo"],"id":[22026702],"kids":[22026747,22027136,22028989,22026979],"parent":[22025482],"text":["Unfortunately the approaches taken by Ocean Cleanup make no sense.

One thing that is annoying is you get half way through your line and realise you need an opening paren several terms ago. It can take a load of time to find the place to put it and a load of effort to make sure things are correctly balanced. I feel like the operator I wish I had is something like “extend the left operand leftwards” e.g. go from this (with cursor represented by a bar):<p><pre><code>  a + b * x + c &#x2F;|\n  to this:\n  a + (b * x + c) &#x2F;|\n  And apply again to get this:\n  (a + b * x + c) &#x2F;|\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt (e.g.) let’s you write fractions without needing to use loads of parens (which have a cost as they must be balanced) or needing to think about whether the numerator will have more than one term.<p>I guess with rich input I’d also want to see the output in “big” mode.<p>Another way to try to make input easier is to use rpn. This has advantages and disadvantages.<p>Currently the calculator I most use is gnu Calc (I also use R occasionally for calculating quantiles). GNU Calc is the calculator built into emacs. It has an rpn interface and an algebraic one. A nice feature of the algebraic interface is that you can use $ to mean “the top entry on the stack” and so you can incrementally build up an equation. A second feature is selections. Their internal implementation is weird (based on hidden “functions” and rewrite rules) but they work fantastically well for modifying and manipulating the inside of a formula or equation. It also has a “big” display format which looks a bit like this one except that it predates Unicode symbols being common and so is pure ascii. (It also has tex output and emacs has image support but no one has put the two together yet)<p>Mainly I use Calc because I’m in emacs anyway and it has a ton of features that are easy to access (eg arbitrary precision floats, bignums, modular arithmetic support, complex numbers, interval arithmetic, vectors, matrices, algebra, curve plotting&#x2F;fitting, unit conversions, ...). I feel like the variable support isn’t great. I feel like I want to eg have some set of variables, defined to be various input numbers, and write formulae in terms of them and then get the formula on the left without variables substituted and it’s numeric evaluation (with them substituted) on the right. There’s something weakly like this using =&gt; but it doesn’t compose well. If you add a =&gt; 1 to b =&gt; 3, you don’t get a + b =&gt; 4, you get (a =&gt; 1) + (b =&gt; 3). (I think.

On the number argument: Even the author acknoweldges that R6RS is twice as large. Regardless of the fact that the standard library is the other half, the fact is that the standard library is a requirement for R6RS. Because of the controversies about it (the condition system, record system, hash table library), the R7RS standard was purposely split into 2 parts, the R7RS-small and the R7RS-large. The R7RS-large standardization is an ongoing project.<p>2. On the condition system: The fact is that horse already left the barn. Most major implementations already had their own condition hierarchies. The only way to reconcile their existing conditions would be to have a translation layer which would be inefficent. Conforming to R6RS condition system would mean throwing out most of the code that people who use those implementations depend on. R7RS focused on providing a basic error system with a purely procedural interface, which combined with cond-expand and the library system, can allow people to write portable code. So the idea that the standard committee doesn&#x27;t believe &quot;Safety is not a desirable language feature&quot; is unwarrented.<p>3. On Optional is better argument: Sure you can have an R6RS with restrictions, but then it isn&#x27;t R6RS, it is a R6RS-like scheme. Using feature identifiers is at least a better way to create portable code. If you have a library that requires unicode, you can specify that in the code.<p>4. On syntax-case, one of the costs of having it is a more complicated library system, with import and export levels. Read it yourself, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.r6rs.org&#x2F;final&#x2F;html&#x2F;r6rs&#x2F;r6rs-Z-H-10.html#node_sec_7.2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.r6rs.org&#x2F;final&#x2F;html&#x2F;r6rs&#x2F;r6rs-Z-H-10.html#node_se...<\/a> . R7RS-small decided to be more conservative in this area.<p>Overall, I think that the way that R7RS standardization has worked to evolve the standard was the right approach. They focused on the most important needs for scheme ( The library system, a basic record system, basic error handling) while avoiding adding features that were overly controversial."],"time":["2020-01-12 18:12:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["haolez"],"id":[22023659],"kids":[22023754,22023697],"parent":[22023266],"text":["I thought that the whole point of Scheme is for it to be easy to implement.

I especially agree with the point regarding error signalling and the lack of effective facilities for that in R7RS.<p>I should also say that my perspective is that of an outsider, a user, not someone who is involved in implementing scheme, or in the standards process. With that said, I feel like this post does not capture the social context of R7RS vs R6RS and without that you can&#x27;t really understand the overall picture.<p>Scheme has been around for decades and there are probably dozens of implementations. Almost every one of them supported R5RS.  Unfortunately this standard didn&#x27;t specify enough to allow for easy interoperability of scheme programs between implementations, depending on what you were trying to do. So everyone ended up just picking their own scheme and running with it.<p>R6RS tried to offer enough of a standard to allow for interoperability between implementations, particularly in offering a module&#x2F;library syntax, and a bunch of the other things listed in the post.  The main problem, and really the one that triggered R7RS, was that it was a large enough standard and required enough work that not many implementations updated to conform to it. The standard was ratified in 2007 and when I was looking around for conformant implementations I didn&#x27;t find a lot.  There was Ypsilon scheme, which has since become abandonware.  Ikarus scheme by Abulaziz Ghoulum was super fast but was also abandoned. Larceny scheme was compliant I believe but I didn&#x27;t use it much. Kawa scheme worked to get there but was still not conformant by 2012. Guile never fully implemented it. PLT Scheme implemented it, but 2 years after was already making announcements about leaving Scheme behind and became Racket in 2010. MIT Scheme of SICP fame basically said they&#x27;d never implement it.  The crown jewel was probably Chez Scheme, still to this day one of the best language implementations period.  But it was proprietary in 2007 and cost money. You could use the interpreter based implementation Petite Chez Scheme, but it still had other restrictions I believe. Committing to R6RS as the standard going forward meant abandoning <i>most<\/i> of the existent implementations, and thus most of the body of code people had written for them.  In trying to unify the Scheme world going forward, R6RS was potentially asking for a large schism.  Please note that the previous sentence isn&#x27;t a value judgement.  Maybe Scheme would be in a better place given the technical merits of R6RS. I can&#x27;t deny that. But that is how the world looked (in my view) when R6RS was the scheme standard of the day.<p>In comparison after R7RS was ratified, many implementations worked to be conformant. Guile is close, Kawa is conformant, Gauche Scheme implements R7RS, Ypsilon is another, Chibi Scheme, Larceny, etc, etc.  In terms of standards adoption there&#x27;s no contest.<p>Writing this post from 2020, where Chez Scheme is open sourced and free, Akku scheme is a great implementation of R6RS, and we are starting to get package repos for Scheme, maybe R6RS would have been the better choice. Maybe all those other implementations should have fallen by the wayside and we&#x27;d all use Chez Scheme, much like CPython is the canonical Python (except Chez Scheme is incredibly well implemented). But at the time the decision was made to make a new standard, a very explicit decision was made to abandon the &quot;easy for users, hard for implementers&quot; motto of R6RS, because what is a language standard without implementations?<p>My hope is that ongoing work can build on R7RS and get us to the level of excellence and ability to build things that R6RS gave, and maybe we can end up having our cake and eating it to."],"time":["2020-01-12 04:57:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimbob45"],"id":[22023634],"kids":[22024400],"parent":[22023266],"text":["I was struggling to find a concise summary of the debate between R7RS vs R6RS earlier this year.

I went into it wanting to simply understand the drive and the motives of people who could sustain the kind of extraordinary sense of duty and altruism that some of us have some of the time, moved maybe by a poignant photograph or somebody in front of us, but can’t sustain without those cues in front of us. But there are other people who can, and I wanted to know what made them tick.\nBut in my first foray into this field, I was writing about people who donated one of their kidneys to a stranger, and I discovered . . . I was talking to people about the people I was meeting, and they would say, “Well, those people surely are all mentally ill, right? Or they have some problem, or they are probably very, very censorious or judgmental.”\nIt was very surprising to me. I understand, of course, that not everyone is going to be an extreme altruist, but I didn’t realize the extent of the hostility and suspicion of them until I started writing about them.

I regularly talk about this with friends and family. As an example, today I learned new things about palliative care that would apply to anyone who contracts a terminal illness, which is a lot of us. Another impactful episode was (translated) &quot;Was the holocaust a predetermined plan?&quot; (from UvNL) which was about how it developed from the Jews being the blame of everything through multiple intermediate steps to attempting to kill all Jews. Rather than having been a single man&#x27;s hate for those people, it was more about society&#x27;s mindset combined with that those people were seen as highly likely to be saboteurs.

A future that plans on everything going right so no one has to think about what happens when things go wrong.<p>Many organizations have one of two perspectives on customer service:<p>A) It&#x27;s an opportunity to ensure customer happiness and repeat customers.<p>B) It&#x27;s a cost to be externalized to the customer as much as possible.<p>The organizations in group A are often like the local appliance shop nih mentions in another comment: small, with an interest in repeat business, and relying on word-of-mouth as the primary customer acquisition channel. They may be in a competitive marketplace nominally (i.e., there are big chains around) and so they know they can&#x27;t compete on price, so they compete on convenience, attitude, help-when-things-go-wrong, advice, etc. Customers are often not so price-sensitive that they&#x27;ll always go with the cheapest option. This used to be many businesses, but technology grants advantages to those in group B --<p>The organizations in group B compete on price, or exist in a local environment in which they don&#x27;t really to compete for customers. Movie theaters, insurance companies, FAANGs, etc. -- they know that most customers are not <i>really<\/i> there by choice (at least anymore, perhaps they used to be) -- they&#x27;re there because that&#x27;s where their friends (F), the best stuff (A, A), their favorite movies (N), or the quickest results (G) are. They&#x27;re there because their employer has a contract (insurance companies), they&#x27;re there because it&#x27;s the only theater in town, they&#x27;re there because it&#x27;s the strictly cheapest flight from SFO to YYZ.<p>For group B organizations, a dollar spent on customer service is a dollar lost; when things go wrong, it&#x27;s up to the customer to resolve it, and the customer incurs basically the entire cost of this &quot;fixing&quot; it, even if the organization nominally issues a refund. The OP here was not reimbursed for any of the costs incurred by the theater&#x27;s screw-up. When insurers deny claims spuriously and force their customers to do the leg work to show they&#x27;re in the right, and the insurer doesn&#x27;t reimburse the customer for the cost of time, energy, missed work, etc -- and would almost certainly laugh at an invoice for work the insurer <i>should have<\/i> done, but didn&#x27;t.<p>After all, what&#x27;s the customer going to do about it? They probably can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to switch to another vendor.

The cost is spread across all customers, but the benefit only accrues to those who have something go wrong, or who want smiles -- except of course it also accrues to the customers who value the knowledge that <i>if<\/i> something goes wrong, there&#x27;s an insurance policy for it.<p>Few people pay for insurance when they don&#x27;t have to, so perhaps it&#x27;s no surprise we see a trend towards group B."],"time":["2020-01-12 23:43:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j88439h84"],"id":[22029436],"kids":{},"parent":[22028726],"text":["typo: reins not reigns"],"time":["2020-01-12 22:15:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["notatoad"],"id":[22029281],"kids":[22029286],"parent":[22028726],"text":["So the author had a poor customer service experience, and blames it on &quot;the future&quot;.<p>This is the sort of rant I expect from my grandpa, not the blog of a tech company."],"time":["2020-01-12 21:57:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rhacker"],"id":[22029315],"kids":[22029505],"parent":[22028726],"text":["When all of you damn people eventually move to a small town, please drive slow, turn down your damn car audio system.

Here&#x27;s the closest it gets to some evidence:<p>&gt;I know several people at Google just like that.<p>But OK, maybe the study actually offers good evidence that the author article missed?<p>From the HBR summary, the first study had ~100 engineering students fill out a questionnaire, do either a 15-minute guided meditation or stress relief video, and then either &quot;list as many alternative uses for a brick as possible&quot; or &quot;list all the factors they would consider in designing a retaining wall for a river flood scenario&quot;. They found that self-reported mindfulness in the questionnaire was positively correlated with &quot;the number and the originality of ideas that participants wrote down in the idea generation task and with the number of factors considered in the engineering design task&quot;.<p>In the second study, they looked at survey data from ~1400 and found that self-reported mindfulness is positively correlated with self-reported &quot;confidence in one&#x27;s ability to be innovative&quot;.<p>But neither of these things demonstrate that engineers are narrow-minded. They don&#x27;t even demonstrate that mindfulness meaningfully affects creativity. They just suggest that <i>self-reported mindfulness<\/i> is positively correlated with producing ideas for a small toy task and confidence that one is creative.<p>It&#x27;s a big jump from those conclusions to &quot;mindfulness should help engineers be more creative&quot;.

Engineers lack creativity and they also tend to lack analytical skills. There&#x27;s a high focus on &quot;best practices&quot; and design patterns without the critical thinking on &quot;why.&quot; So you tend to see the over-application of these kinds of things everywhere in code. If I were to describe the style of thinking engineers tend to have, the best word is &quot;religious&quot; with grand delusions of being &quot;analytical.&quot;<p>I work in a golang shop where engineers were stupefyingly trying to port Java Design patterns over to the language. I literally told them straight up that most of these design patterns are horrible and bad for code. I told them about the huge pitfalls of dependency injection and Nobody even wanted to listen or believe me.<p>One guy tried to have all init functions that create structs replaced with a builder pattern. Literally can people not see how the builder pattern enables the creation of structures with invalid state? Why? Why? Why? I think because the builder pattern is prettier and more elegant looking. Overall though these engineers are miss applying their analytical thinking.<p>It&#x27;s only when I referenced quotations by Rob Pike (creator of golang) on how Rob Pike designed Golang to get away from OOP did people start to actually listen to me. Appeal to authority rather than logic, that&#x27;s how &quot;analytical&quot; engineers think.<p>Obviously these engineers love OOP as a language they also like Golang which is the antithesis of OOP. The fact that these engineers can exist with conflicting beliefs tells me that their isn&#x27;t an analytical bone in their body.

It often disrupts their workflow, it causes them to have to learn things again, and worst of all it can lead to unintended consequences because you didn&#x27;t understand why things were being done the way they were and the pitfalls of your clever solution.  Alternatively it can be the case the creative DOES have a better solution but for some reason such as communication people cannot understand WHY the solution is superior and reject it perticularly when the creative is fairly new or in a fairly junior position.<p>The creative finds themselves in the position of either underperforming their peers through overconfident cleverness, or overperforming their peers and in the process threatening their peers because they have depreciated the knowledge of their peers while positioning themselves as the only ones who know the new system at least in the short term.  So regardless of how well they perform there is reason to try and beat them down.  The creative employee has incentives to try to downplay their creative instincts or at least to limit their creativeness to their personal workflow where it causes less disruption.<p>Additionally if you take two engineers of equal ability, one by the book and relentlessly uncreative but never breaks anything, and one which breaks as many things as they improve coming out about even, the former is almost always preferred simply because the latter causes a lot more stress and distraction and more need for training.  There is a cost to creativity that often goes unaccounted for and a creative solution has to be meaningfully superior to be worth implementing.<p>Probably the only consistent reasons I&#x27;ve seen creatives being favored is 1: Outright superiority perticularly when conservatism has gone unchecked for too long 2: Collective boredom and a desire for staff to learn different ways to doing things to round out their skills 3: Management wanting to put pressure on complacent mediocre employees who &quot;go through the motions&quot;.
