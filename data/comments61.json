Intelligence is not necessarily a critical factor in whether founders will be successful or not. In fact, it can be counter-indicative! The more intelligent you are, you more likely you&#x27;re one of the people like the author mentions. I&#x27;ve also read that it&#x27;s not the geniuses, necessarily, that make it. Most times it&#x27;s just the slow plodders. A genius may become overly-attracted to one of their own ideas. They may stick with it too long, or they may be overly-defensive when they receive honest feedback. A plodder just keeps trudging along, happy to take whatever feedback comes their way, happy to change if needed, happy to learn from others.<p>I captured this concept in my first book with a phrase I call &quot;profound ignorance&quot;. It&#x27;s not just admitting you&#x27;re ignorant, it&#x27;s admitting you&#x27;re probably ignorant about everything. And that&#x27;s fine. Ignorant people don&#x27;t know yet, and if they&#x27;re curious, they go try to find out. Even when they do find out, they&#x27;re still quite open to being wrong. They are, in fact, ignorant.<p>I found this had a profound impact in my programming and consulting career. Frankly, it&#x27;s bad for your career and good for your life. People want to hire people that know a bunch of stuff, and to be open, honest, and curious about being profoundly ignorant is not reassuring. Other programmers many times want to play posturing games. It is, after all, part of our social programming. Ignorant people usually don&#x27;t do so well in these games. But on a personal level? It was liberating. I could find whatever I wanted to and deep dive in it. Since I didn&#x27;t know much of anything, I was able to talk about topics I have a ton of experience in without feeling like I had to attack or defend any pre-held opinions. It was, in fact, what I consider &quot;growing up&quot;, both as a human and as a professional.<p>When we think of how much programming is skewed towards youth, we should keep in mind that most really young people have not had this growing up experience. We should wish them well and cut them a bit of slack if they&#x27;re acting like we did when we were their age.

She was able to meet folks and socialize, and they forced her to go out and do things. But I don&#x27;t think it did too much to help her loneliness from losing my grandad. She didn&#x27;t die from suicide, but I think at one point she just lost the will to live, which I think that finally took her.<p>I don&#x27;t have answer to that.

Shareholders are not gonna understand your vision every time you decide to engage in a long term strategic shift in priorities, so they will react when they find out, and that reaction can swiftly damage a company&#x27;s value.  If shareholders can still trade over short-terms, then you will still have large scale short-term fluctuations that CEOs will be forced to address, as more and more potential buyers will be influenced by the low price of a stock caused by other skittish short-term thinking investors.<p>The problem is with investors in stocks, not with the companies unwillingness to think long term.

This is why so many 5G base stations have to be deployed; the coverage just isn&#x27;t as good. But the improvements in base station handoffs and spectral efficiency will increase a carrier&#x27;s total capacity, even if the end user doesn&#x27;t see a massive benefit.<p>There are scenarios where you might see massive speeds, though. 5G heavily leverages Carrier Aggregation, where a client can connect to multiple channels at once, increasing bandwidth, and beam-forming, where the &quot;shape&quot; of the signal is modified to steer maximum power to the physical location of a client. If you happen to be near a base station with good Signal to Noise Ratio while downloading something large, the base station can allocate multiple channels and use beamforming to finish your download at Gbps speeds and get you off the network faster, freeing up spectrum time for more users at lower SNR&#x27;s and bandwidths.<p>There is potential for much more impactful deployment of 5G cellular in rural areas where there aren&#x27;t many buildings or walls blocking high frequency signal. The same goes for point-to-point links such as inter-building WAN or low latency self driving car to self driving car communication."],"time":["2020-09-09 19:19:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thelazydogsback"],"id":[24423735],"kids":[24424881,24423907,24426275,24424145,24423901,24426199,24426162,24423746,24424541],"parent":[24422472],"text":["I&#x27;m constantly amazed at how fast my 4G&#x2F;LTE service is.\nI had to run my house off of my tethered phone the other day, and browsing seemed faster than cable -- obviously slower overall bandwidth, but good enough and very low latency.<p>I have no desire for my phone to be faster in either processing power or bandwidth -- it would give me absolutely no benefit.<p>I wish 5G, 8K video (and even 4k in many cases), etc., were not thrust upon consumers.

It&#x27;s designed to be fast, lightweight, and use a minimal amount of disk space. Mimestream&#x27;s advantages over using the Gmail web interface includes features like multiple accounts, a unified inbox, system notifications, swipe actions, dark mode, (some) offline support, tracker prevention, multiple keyboard shortcut sets, and more.<p>Mimestream differs from other email clients because it uses the Gmail API rather than IMAP, so it supports more Gmail-specific features like categorized inboxes, Gmail&#x27;s search operators, first-class labels support (apply multiple via <U+2318>L, set colors, etc), synced aliases, synced signatures, etc. I&#x27;m planning a lot more work in this area, including server-side filter configuration, Google Drive support, G Suite directory autocomplete, and more.<p>The app is a traditional email client that makes direct connections to Gmail and stores your data on your Mac. There are no intermediary servers with access to your account or copies of your messages. Mimestream is free for a limited time during the public beta, but will eventually be a paid app by the time it gets to the Mac App Store.<p>I hope you enjoy trying out the beta, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!"],"time":["2020-09-09 18:04:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dugmartin"],"id":[24426291],"kids":[24428985,24429652],"parent":[24422432],"text":["Interesting to see the Gmail API being used for a general purpose email client when Google has a very visible note on the overview page that says:<p>&gt; Note: The Gmail API should not be used to replace IMAP for full-fledged email client access.

For examples...<p>Most intro astronomy content, K thru undergrad, gets the color of the Sun either simply wrong, or handles it misleadingly.  Resulting in even first-tier astronomy graduate students likely knowing it wrong.  Clips from Tappity show false color photos and art of the Sun.

Do you know of any context where that gets discussed?<p>Similarly, the Tappity &quot;exploded&quot; layers of Earth graphic[3] is variously misleading and aphysically colored (better than many).  Which is pervasive for such graphics.  Do you know of any community which might say &quot;variants of this common graphic abound, variously wrong - let&#x27;s put in the collaborative effort necessary to create one correct, and open license it&quot;?<p>Education content for kids often says the Sun warms the Earth.  But that&#x27;s only half the story, and I&#x27;ve never seen content which does the whole.  Earth is doing a bbq roll between too hot Sun and too cold deep space.  Even young kids might grasp the concept that with something uncomfortably hot, and another uncomfortably cold, you can attain comfort by alternating.  But we don&#x27;t say that.  Does anyone know of a setting for &quot;here is a commonly taught story that&#x27;s incomplete - let&#x27;s create exemplar content that fills it out&quot;?  Cold at night, at altitude, with cloudless skys, especially when dry... it&#x27;s a story that&#x27;s actionable, if not cut short.<p>Chemistry education content is famously bad.  Chem ed research describes it using adjectives like incoherent, leaving both teachers and students steeped in misconceptions.  But now XR content is coming.  And some of it is nifty.  But much of it is the usual wretched, now in 3D.<p>There seems a body of <i>badly<\/i> needed effort and work, very poorly incentivized, that&#x27;s not getting well addressed.

And I&#x27;ll answer 2 questions, not 1.<p>1. Why do we need Bayesian estimation? Can&#x27;t we just all use MLE, and live in harmony? If MLE was good for Gauss and Laplace and Fisher, why isn&#x27;t it good for me? Answer: for many problems the likelihood function is unbound. In fact the cases where the likelihood function are bounded, so the MLE makes sense, are few and far between. But if you think of the likelihood as a function with a hump somewhere, you have several choices for a single number that best describes the function: mode, mean, median for example. MLE corresponds to mode, can we use the mean instead? Also, does it not even make better sense to use mean rather than mode? Sure it does, and if you use mean you become a Bayesian. But can the likelihood be unbounded and have a finite mean, you ask? Yes, it happens quite often, sufficiently often that in practice people don&#x27;t worry about that.<p>Once you start using mean instead of mode (and therefore you can proudly call yourself a Bayesian), you get a number of side benefits: you get parameter uncertainty estimation for free, and you can start multiplying your likelihoods with various functions that make your life easier. You can interpret those functions as regularization functions, or prior, you can even start talking about expert knowledge, and delve into philosophical meanderings. No need to do that , there are enough people on the internet who do that.<p>2. Why Monte Carlo? Because calculating means of high-dimensional distributions is not easy. In most cases you are hit with the curse of dimensionality. Separately, the distributions that you work with are not known only up to a multiplicative constant. So the problem is how do you estimate the mean of a vector (v1, v2, ...., vn) when you know its distribution, but only up to a constant? The answer is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and if you learn that, you get special powers.<p>So why do Bayesians need Monte Carlo? Because they like to be like super-heroes and have special powers."],"time":["2020-09-10 00:02:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baxtr"],"id":[24418282],"kids":[24419136],"parent":[24416908],"text":["Any article with “Bayesian” in the title gets upvoted these days :)"],"time":["2020-09-09 09:27:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["abeppu"],"id":[24422084],"kids":[24422470],"parent":[24416908],"text":["I think maybe a more interesting question is how to explain the extreme disconnect between data volume and confidence in the two examples compared.  The election has a huge number of polls, analysts and subject matter experts focused on it. And yet our ability to make predictions about it is comparable to an A&#x2F;B test where 30 observations have been made total?<p>The only sense I can make of this is that:<p>- Predictions about stochastic dynamic systems are hard, especially when there can be these exogenous variables intervening from out of nowhere.<p>- Competitive situations are hard to predict, especially if they change based on the measurements produced about them (i.e. the campaigns strategize based on polling info). This effectively makes those measurements less predictive.<p>To me, this suggests that all the polling and analysis are a waste of resources and attention. The expected value of information is extremely low. We should kick off campaigns on Halloween, talk about them for a couple days, and vote immediately.

Putting some recent numbers [2] over the size of the MBS market would show that the Fed owns a little less than a 1&#x2F;5 of all US MBS.<p>Also, he mentions that the Fed has been purchasing roughly $100 billion per month in MBS securities since April, but this leaves out the fact that a non-insignificant number of MBS in their holdings are either i) reaching maturity, or ii) being prepaid.  The second issue is more prevalent now - with the low-rate environment that exists in the US many people are refinancing their mortgages to take advantage of lower rates, but in any case it isn&#x27;t uncommon for mortgages to be paid off before their maturity date.  I don&#x27;t know what the net figures are, but what I&#x27;m trying to say is that purchases of MBS != growth of MBS holdings.<p>I seriously think this author has somehow conflated the size of the SOMA assets with the size of the MBS market - continuing growth of MBS at $100 billion for the rest of the year, leaving all else equal, will give us about $2.4 trillion of MBS over a denominator of $7.4 trillion - which would give us about 1&#x2F;3.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sifma.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;research&#x2F;fixed-income-chart&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sifma.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;research&#x2F;fixed-income-chart&#x2F;<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;releases&#x2F;h41&#x2F;current&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;releases&#x2F;h41&#x2F;current&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-09 16:47:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["coronadisaster"],"id":[24421141],"kids":{},"parent":[24416807],"text":["The homes around here (suburb) fly off the shelves even if prices are higher then the last bubble (~2007)... not sure what is going on.

An officer who comes in for a 2-4 year tenure on low government salaries is incentivized to maximize his earnings during his short tenure.<p>The second is the lack of engineering involvement. The government sector doesn&#x27;t exactly attract the top talent at good salaries. The tenders on the other hand are awarded based on nepotism and personal gain.
