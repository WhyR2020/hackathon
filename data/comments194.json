For the most part, you could just &quot;loop at &lt;giant_table_name&gt;&quot; extract what you want and show it on a screen using one of their existing ui components. There was not much UI to worry about and you know the user is getting a proper input box (for example) with a working typeahead. Honestly, I thought it was a very decent developer experience. I could focus on what I needed to do and not worry about how pretty the thing looks or if I&#x27;m querying the database optimally. I ended up writing a very complex genetic algorithm implementation to calculate optimal schedules and it was a joy.<p>Yes, the table names were basically in german, and abbreviated, and most things were only 8 chars long for some legacy reasons, but it really wasn&#x27;t that hard to learn that VBAK was sales_orders and VBAP was sales_order_items and move on.<p>For the most part, the users were totally fine with SAP. It was hyper-focused for the tasks they needed. It was consistent and easily documentable. It didn&#x27;t crash, it loaded super fast, it didn&#x27;t eat up gigs of memory. You just load up the gui application and you don&#x27;t even need a mouse once you know the shortcuts.<p>Having spent the last 10 years building web and mobile apps, working with salesforce and others, I miss ABAP very often."],"time":["2020-02-05 16:00:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["buzzkillington"],"id":[22246145],"kids":[22246472,22246235,22246961],"parent":[22244750],"text":["I wanted to be angry at it.

The SAP consultants acknowledge this.<p>- Some of the solution pitch ideas they come up with signal they have almost zero knowledge of how some technologies actually work.<p>- Services we rely on with SAP frequently fail for no apparent reason.<p>- They are slow and uncooperative with setting up demo environments and responding to support requests.<p>- Their licences and consulting fees are outrageously expensive considering the lack of quality and performance when compared to alternatives.<p>- Tech leads in our own company frequently talk about how bad SAP solutions are.<p>- Their poor UIs are what they are known for in the market. They&#x27;ve tried to address this with things like UI5, Fiori and Fundamentals which feel like too little too late.<p>- Their attempts at acquiring startups (AI, chatbots, analytics etc) to stay on the edge provide hardly any real value besides propping up the credibility of the buzzwords they cram into their presentations.<p>Yet SAP remain entrenched in the market and companies still get into bed with them despite knowing the pain they&#x27;re in for. A lot of system integration companies have tried to attack this market with open source solutions and have failed to make any real dent. The only major player that has started to eat SAPs lunch recently is Salesforce.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something but surely it would be better for an organisation to have a solution that can be maintained by more than one company so that the company can be replaced if they aren&#x27;t performing?<p>The only example I can think of where this is being addressed is the UK&#x27;s GDS Service Standard which mandates that all government projects should use open source tools to avoid vendor lock-in.

It was one of the most successful IT projects I ever participated in, mostly due to the remarkably strong business leadership the project enjoyed.<p>It was the third time the company tried to implement SAP&#x27;s products.  I think I may have been one of the very few people who worked on all three attempts.  The winning recipe was having a business owner who threw up his hands at the failed efforts to get a larger scoped company-wide project underway and &quot;selfishly&quot; declared that the finance dept would do it for its own benefits.  And he tooks his best people out of their day jobs, put them on the project team, and made them move offices to sit in the same open plan war-rooms as the IT staff (which took some doing...Microsoft was pretty much all unshared private offices at that time) I think we reduced the time it took to &quot;close the books&quot; each month from something like 3 weeks to under one week.<p>And we absolutely changed the business to meet the way the software worked, that&#x27;s one of the key success factors for implementing any ERP software.  Your &quot;unique requirements&quot; for fixed assets accounting and accounts payable processes are not what makes your company successful, but they are what will tank your ERP implementation if you let them.<p>It was a fascinating project.  I especially enjoyed some of the travel to implement it in the subsidiaries, where the really big business wins were.  Most of the subs didn&#x27;t even have a &quot;purchase order&quot; process (they just paid invoices, and had no idea of their outstanding commitments) or any automation around things like employee expense reports.  And we got to come up with some decent creative solutions to things like Brazil&#x27;s requirements for hyperinflationary accounting, without breaking the software.<p>Fun fact, Concur&#x27;s expense reporting business was borne out of the Microsoft R&#x2F;3 implementation -- some of the best consultants and developers took what they built for Microsoft&#x27;s internal expense reporting and turned it into Concur&#x27;s expense reporting product."],"time":["2020-02-05 15:55:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lewisjoe"],"id":[22245731],"kids":[22246750,22246046,22246646],"parent":[22244750],"text":["SAP always is an interesting case.

For SAP’s original contract with ICI, SAP didn’t build software from scratch, as was the norm at the time, and instead built on top of a previous project. When SAP released their financial accounting software in 1974, their intention was to build additional software modules on top of it and sell them in the future. This extensibility was SAP’s defining feature. The interoperability across client contexts was considered radical at the time because other approaches started from scratch for every client.&quot;<p>SAP&#x27;s success can be attributed to something similar to what Facebook and Google did, locking the data and knowledge base to itself.

It was <i>so<\/i> bad that it was hard not to conclude that it was chosen <i>due to its horribleness<\/i>: making employees think twice about sending in expense reports.  And we did.  If it was a small dollar amount, the time cost exceeded the monetary cost.<p>The UI, at the time (2005...ish), actually looked pretty slick compared to most web-based tools.  It stopped there.  Date fields, upon clicking, reloaded the <i>whole page<\/i> (which you waited for), to display a pop-up calendar, which when the date was clicked, reloaded the <i>whole page<\/i>.  At least once while filling in the expense reports myriad of screens, the page would fail to load and you&#x27;d have to hit the refresh button, or you&#x27;d make a mistake and need to go back.  Clicking <i>any<\/i> of the usual buttons in the browser for those functions invariably lead to an account DoS feature.<p>I don&#x27;t remember the details, but it basically caused the system to get confused into thinking there were two of you and it gave priority to the &quot;you&quot; living in the alternate universe where you didn&#x27;t click &quot;Back&quot; or &quot;Refresh&quot; and were still filling out your expense report.  You had to wait for the first session to time out before you could continue, and the error message you received was placed in the &quot;status bar&quot; and appeared to be the name of a const variable &quot;APP_BOWEL_MVMT_ERR&quot; that gave no hint as to what the <i>fsck<\/i> was wrong.  There was admin &quot;unlock&quot; feature (help desk calls were met with &quot;just sit tight&quot;).  So you would give up and forget to return 3 hours later.  A few days of this and the expense deadline passed.<p>There wasn&#x27;t a more <i>hated<\/i> &quot;enterprise tool&quot; in our shop and we ran <i>every single one<\/i> of Microsoft&#x27;s early attempts at web-ifying the world (early Sharepoint is the only I recall, but we had others).<p>It was decided to shelve it after a last-ditch effort was made to fix it.  We&#x27;d put a job opening up to get a solid SAP developer and got ... someone ... after bumping the salary up several times.  The rumor is that the gentleman we hired was the highest paid developer at the company.  He lasted 3 months before taking a job at IBM at a substantially higher salary.  A look at his job history and the circumstances surrounding it made it not unreasonable to conclude that we weren&#x27;t the job he was ever interested in and talking to other SAP folks ... this sounded <i>extremely common<\/i>.  The joke was &quot;if you have to work with that crap, it better pay well&quot;.<p>We finally ditched it when we were acquired by another telecom; while most of the choices &quot;our side&quot;&#x27;s IT made were fought for, <i>nobody<\/i> advocated for keeping SAP ... even having no idea of what the acquiring company was using -- we knew if it <i>wasn&#x27;t<\/i> SAP, it <i>had<\/i> to be better.  It was Oracle; and it might be the only time I&#x27;ve heard a colleague speak positively about &quot;Oracle&quot; outside of The Matrix[1].<p>[0] Time sheet software always comes to mind.  Nobody likes doing &quot;time sheets&quot; at any job I&#x27;ve ever had, but at every company I&#x27;ve ever worked for, we&#x27;ve had a home-grown time tracking tool.  30,000 employees to 100 employees.  Every. Single. Company.  It&#x27;s such a necessary &quot;evil&quot; that even at those places where executives had known deadly-allergic reactions to building anything in-house, somehow a case was able to be made to build a completely custom time tracking tool tailored precisely to the businesses perceived needs. Death, taxes and time sheets, I guess.<p>[1] My experience with Oracle up to that point was Sun&#x27;s acquisition and a perception-backed-by-coincidence that when the Oracle sales guys couldn&#x27;t land a deal, their software auditors would step in to give the necessary motivation."],"time":["2020-02-05 15:20:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unixhero"],"id":[22246201],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["ERP and SAP is a goldmine if you know how to provide consulting for it."],"time":["2020-02-05 13:35:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pcmoore"],"id":[22247624],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["One early forerunner was LEO <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LEO_(computer)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LEO_(computer)<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-05 16:36:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gadders"],"id":[22245639],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["I recently worked on SAP as a PM, having never worked on it before.

ETL + data lakes are on the rise...&quot;.<p>This is a mistake I see made a lot; not because of naivete tho&#x27;: usually because the concerns cut across each other so much.<p>The economic and efficiency incentives around integration are very delicate. SAP is so complex that (assuming you can hire great engineers, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a given outside the tech sector) you can probably build most of what you need with a small team that&#x27;s much cheaper than SAP. However, you can&#x27;t successfully (even with good access to great tech sector talent) grow that software as quickly or as broadly as what you&#x27;d get from SAP. You also carry a lot more risk. ...and that&#x27;s risk outside of the core focus of your business. The article even includes one quote, &quot;competitive advantage in this industry might just come from doing the best and cheapest job at implementing SAP.&quot; which recognises this as an operational rather than capital problem.<p>...but even if you can accomplish it, it&#x27;s the <i>integration<\/i> that gives you the value. You&#x27;re always going to have higher operational costs for your thing if you build it out of something like Salesforce and Jira sewn together with APIs. ETL is hard to do well for anything other than reporting (and even then it&#x27;s not easy).\nData lakes are the epitome of loosely integrated data structures. Most of the time they&#x27;re a collection of files full of data in weakly-or-stringly typed formats such as CSV, JSON and XML. Getting at the domain models of the producing software is always a pain. For all these things, your talent pool for effective support is small and gets smaller as you add more products to the mix.<p>So the three options are:<p>1) Buy (+ professional services)<p>2) Build<p>3) Integrate (e.g. &quot;Salesforce + Jira&quot;)<p>3 (Integrate) is the mistake because it&#x27;s less than the sum of it&#x27;s parts. You carry all the risk of &quot;Build&quot; and don&#x27;t get the brand stability and integration of &quot;Buy&quot;. Multiple vendors gives you more risk than a single one in this scenario because you&#x27;re buying different things from different vendors. So now you have more chances for failure: failure or withdrawal of one of the vendors, API changes that you don&#x27;t control, etc, etc.<p>As the SaaS markets become more mature I&#x27;d hope to see consortiums of vendors who had products that they would certify as working together. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re quite there yet tho&#x27;.<p>2 (Build) is the Big Bet because you&#x27;re taking a capital expenditure approach to an operational problem. You&#x27;re investing in intellectual property outside of your core business. ...and you own all the risk.<p>1 (Buy) is difficult because it is expensive and loads of things you want are still only sold on a professional services basis, rather than as a product. It&#x27;s also a market designed for the large companies with between 6 and 9 figures to spend. It&#x27;s also one of those infrastructure projects that is usually shaped as something that doesn&#x27;t deliver any value until it has been rolled out everywhere. However, this is the option where you hold the least technical risk and most of the risk you do hold is related to abilities that are hopefully aligned with your existing skills of management and operational delivery."],"time":["2020-02-05 15:36:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["iso1210"],"id":[22246065],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["It&#x27;s a program built to prevent corporations from spending money"],"time":["2020-02-05 13:13:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arendtio"],"id":[22250320],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["Does someone know a good place to start learning SAP CAR?"],"time":["2020-02-05 20:42:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vangelis"],"id":[22248152],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["What isn&#x27;t SAP?"],"time":["2020-02-05 17:16:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zxienin"],"id":[22245321],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["Why not develop your own ERP if SAP forces one to change its processes?<p>AFAIK, Tesla is the only company I&#x27;ve heard to have done it. \nWould be useful to hear their experiences on this road."],"time":["2020-02-05 10:32:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wackget"],"id":[22247942],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["&gt; Article is titled &quot;What’s SAP?&quot;<p>&gt; Doesn&#x27;t actually tell you what SAP is, or stands for, until halfway through the article."],"time":["2020-02-05 16:59:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sparker72678"],"id":[22247847],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["This thread is depressing."],"time":["2020-02-05 16:53:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0xff00ffee"],"id":[22250947],"kids":{},"parent":[22244750],"text":["Having brought up an ERP solution with a team, this is no joke.

Prolog is nothing like the language described in this\n&quot;tutorial&quot;. The author has completely made up a bunch of programming language\nsemantics that have nothing to do with Prolog.<p>Just for the most blatant example of made-up semantics: unification is not\n&quot;essentially a combination of assignment and equality&quot;.<p>Unification is not assignment: Prolog predicates are immutable. You can&#x27;t\nassign to an immutable data structure.<p>Unification is not equality, either. For example, in Prolog 2 = 1+1 fails\nbecause &quot;2&quot; does not unify with &quot;1+1&quot; (and not because &quot;unification can&#x27;t do\narithmetic&quot;; it&#x27;s because unification is not equality).<p>Unification is an algorithm to decide whether two Horn clauses can be\n<i>resolved<\/i> with each other. Resolution is the inference rule used in Prolog&#x27;s\nautomated theorem proving. This is it:<p><pre><code>   ¬p <U+2228> q, p\n  ----------\n      q\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe horizontal line is read as &quot;entails&quot;. p and q are predicates. The rule\nsays that if we can show that p is false or q is true and that p is true, then\nwe can show that q is true. If ¬p and p unify, they can be resolved and q can\nbe shown to be true.<p>Resolution is used in Prolog to prove a query by refutation. Queries are the\ngoals that the author calls &quot;commands&quot;. These are not commands: they are\npredicates, just like &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;rules&quot;. Prolog tries to disprove a goal by\nfinding a clause with a head literal that unifies with the query (only &quot;facts&quot;\nand &quot;rules&quot; have heads, whereas goals only have bodies). If it can, it then\nrecursively proves each literal in the body of the clause, by finding a clause\nwith a head that unifies with the literal.<p>Unfortunately, none of this will make sense if you try to understand Prolog in\nterms of assignment and equality tests, and so on.

Yes, it is true that we don’t have causal relationships for a number of phenomena. But the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.

But leveraging empirical evidence that can’t be fully explained in situations where lives are at stake, should require a very high bar of regulation.

In today&#x27;s internet this makes so much more sense than everything being run by the same company.<p>For example, you could have a crawler that specializes at searching Medium.com. You could have another one that specializes in searching just computer game websites. The data from both are aggregated by indexer A and indexer B. Indexers would rank content using different algorithms.<p>When user opens some search website and types a query, the website pre-processes the query and sends it to both indexers. Both return the best results they can. The website then aggregates them into a single page and shows to the user.<p>With this system there will be competition at every level. And a startup could conceivably build a node in this infrastructure without tackling the entire thing at the same time (like you have to do right now).<p>You think website X has bad interface? You can build your own interface and buy information from existing indexers (which <i>you<\/i> chose).<p>You think you can do better job at ranking results?

For fast-moving financial transactions, that procedure is too cumbersome, so the collateral pledged in derivatives deals is granted an exemption from the usual queue of claims. In cases of bankruptcy, it is transferred directly to the counterparty, leaving unsecured creditors empty-handed.<\/i><p>I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is here.

How did they pull off this trick? Through a nimble tangle of contracts, carefully and complicatedly applied, as Katharina Pistor explains in her lucid new book, The Code of Capital: by mixing “modern notions of individual property rights with feudalist restrictions on alienability”; by employing trusts “to protect family estates, but then [turning] around and [using] the trust again to set aside assets for creditors so that they would roll over the debt of the life tenant one more time”; and by settling the rights to the estate among family members in line for inheritance.

And by that, I do not mean to be dramatic, portraying anything to the left of University of Chicago law &amp; economics as Marxist. I mean, it is literally Marxist, objecting to modern law&#x27;s emphasis on private rights:<p>&gt; On the one hand, the law codes the original violence of enclosure, such that something that was everyone’s becomes one person’s legally protected private property in perpetuity.<p>For those not familiar with Marxism, a recurring grievance is &quot;enclosure&quot;--the process by which the commons (hunting and grazing land) became turned into private property. It&#x27;s hard to respond to the article, given that doesn&#x27;t actually say much of anything, but I wanted to highlight one passage in particular:<p>&gt; In the liberal account of property rights, the crucial question is how far law and the courts can protect private property against the capricious, self-interested, and short-sighted acts of the government. Individual property must be protected, in this view, not only because of the inalienable right to enjoy what one owns without fear of damage or theft, but also because if there were no guarantee of this right, economic progress would be impossible. Few would make an investment in a business that couldn’t seek redress for major acts of vandalism or larceny.<p>The article is not wrong. This is the basic principle underlying American law and our Constitution. Where the article is wrong is to suggest that there is any problem with it. When the Soviet Union and China tried to undo &quot;enclosure&quot; and create communal farms, tens of millions of people died. To the extent these countries reduced inequality, they did it by making everyone poor. By contrast, country after country has gone from poor to wealthy through a simple formula: rule of law, protection of private property rights, and unleashing of capital.<p>I cannot emphasize enough that there are no proven alternatives to this legal framework. There are no wealthy countries that have legal codes that depart from this concept. Even &quot;social democracies&quot; like Denmark have Constitutions that provide:<p>&gt; The right of property shall be <i>inviolable.<\/i> No person shall be ordered to cede his property except where required by the public weal. It can be done only as provided by Statute and against <i>full compensation.<\/i><p>The Constitution of Sweden provides an even stronger guarantee, not only against expropriation, but against restrictions on use that significantly diminish a property&#x27;s value:<p>&gt; Art. 18. The property of every citizen shall be so <i>guaranteed<\/i> that none may be compelled by expropriation or other such disposition to surrender property to the public institutions or to a private subject, or tolerate restriction by the public institutions of the use of land or buildings, other than where necessary to satisfy <i>pressing public interests.<\/i> A person who is compelled to surrender property by expropriation or other such disposition shall be <i>guaranteed compensation for his loss.<\/i> Such compensation shall also be guaranteed to a person whose use of land or buildings is restricted by the public institutions in such a manner that ongoing land use in the affected part of the property is substantially impaired, or injury results which is significant in relation to the value of that part of the property."],"time":["2020-02-05 20:36:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["epicgiga"],"id":[22251777],"kids":[22252805],"parent":[22249759],"text":["Quite impressive, I didn&#x27;t know I was reading a Marxist gripe until half way through.

I agree with not allowing those modules to be published to the elm package site, but intentionally blocking people experimenting on their own is unnecessary in my opinion.
