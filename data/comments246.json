I think her comments are mostly pretty accurate. This one though jumped out as weird:<p><i>“He always said how much Google needs to be upfront and progressive in how it handles people and processes and HR,” Stapelton recalled. “He had such an optimistic view of technology and how Google could really transform how people live and free up humanity to pursue the arts.”<\/i><p>Was that really her interpretation of Larry Page? No wonder she&#x27;s now publicly crying her disappointment. It seems like the total opposite of the Page I saw, a man who never cared about the arts at all and in fact had to be browbeaten into caring about visual design by Steve Jobs himself.<p>Page back then was a man who cared deeply about science and anything sci-fi. The more sci-fi the better. His vision for Google was a machine that converted ad clicks into flying cars, the computer from Star Trek and so on. Amazing tech wasn&#x27;t a means to an end but rather, the end itself. I never heard or saw anything in Google&#x27;s mission about &quot;freeing up humanity to pursue the arts&quot;. I can imagine why a humanities person like Stapleton might have wanted to believe that as it would have given her own interests and background an anchor in what was back then a supremely engineering oriented culture. But it wasn&#x27;t true.

I think it was from nostrademons.  The gist was that one cannot be given a good place to work, one has to make an active effort to make it a good place to work.  When a lot of people come together with the same ideas, they can make a place that wins awards for being a good place to work, but there always has to be active effort from everyone to keep that alive.  You can&#x27;t just show up and hope that the &quot;make this place good to work at&quot; team makes this place good to work at.  You are that team!<p>That attitude, to me, kind of explains the downfall of Google.  People started to realize they could stop doing the things that made it a good place to work, and just focus on their project work.  No need to do a tech talk to share with the company what you&#x27;re up to.  No need to clean up tech debt.  No need to work with the teams whose products you consume to make them better.  Just take every shortcut to launch, get promoted, and get more power.  People saw that that worked better than being transparent, fixing tech debt, etc., and now THAT&#x27;S the culture.  People see that working, repeat it as fact (&quot;how to get promoted: don&#x27;t fix bugs!&quot;), and then that becomes the culture and that&#x27;s where Google seems to be now.  Now people think that there is nothing they can do to change the culture, and maybe that&#x27;s true.  There is just too much inertia and so YOU being transparent, YOU being a good steward of the codebase and shared resources, etc. just won&#x27;t matter.  They just get in the way of getting promoted.   So people fall back to the natural human fallback of &quot;appeal to authority&quot;.  They write open letters, they have protests... but it doesn&#x27;t matter.  That never worked.  The early engineers didn&#x27;t write open letters to management about having a shared codebase, or requiring code reviews... they just did it.  It is hard work, often with no reward, but over time the benefits accumulate.  But when you stop putting in the work, it stops working.  Now the company is too large to ever change, probably.  But it got there because people were lazy about protecting the culture, and now all that cultural tech debt piles up and results in the things that we read about on HN.<p>Next time, when you&#x27;re at a new company... realize that YOU have to set the objectives.  If you want transparency, be transparent about your work.  Do internal talks or write internal blog posts about what you&#x27;re up to.  Give curious people permission to look around and play with your service.  Give people peer bonuses and write them good reviews when they do menial tasks that help code health long term.  You have to make a conscious effort every single day, and remind others to do the same... or you&#x27;ll just end up with another heartless megacorp that is coasting on momentum from all this work that people put in in the early days.  And, you have to deal with the consequences of your positive culture.  Some jerk is going to break your service that has no rate limits.  Someone is going to walk off with your customer list.  You&#x27;re going to miss a deadline because someone was doing a big refactor instead of that last little cleanup before launch.  If you really value transparency, code health, whatever, you have to accept that they are going to conflict with other things you care about!  If you can&#x27;t accept that, you aren&#x27;t going to really have that culture that you want.<p>(Also, to be clear, I am not criticizing anyone mentioned in the article here.  I did not work with them at Google, but they were very transparent about what they were working on, so I know exactly what they were up to at any given time.  And I was also pretty transparent, so I bet they knew me despite having never worked with me.  A lot of people were doing a lot of good things, and that community certainly knew each other well, even if only in passing.  But there were tens of thousands of people that just existed without contributing positively to the culture, and the &quot;carrying capacity&quot; was reached and here we are.  It is sad to see.)<p>Anyway, I write this because it is something that everyone will need to think about in their next (or current) adventure.  You have to decide what you value, and if it&#x27;s a &quot;good culture&quot;, you will have to scrimp somewhere else to make that a reality.  Nobody is going to do it for you.  You have to be the &quot;management&quot; or &quot;promotion committee&quot; that enforces your values.  And it will come at a cost!"],"time":["2020-01-03 00:46:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cbanek"],"id":[21948478],"kids":{},"parent":[21939896],"text":["&gt; Stapleton said when she made a request to HR earlier this year, she was routed to a call center in Chicago, where she spoke to a young gentleman who had recently graduated college.

It had to do this to keep the stock in the stratosphere, which kept the mid-to-senior managers rich, and gave the ones who weren&#x27;t yet rich the possibility of becoming so. Some of these attempts were questionable ethically. Similarly, privacy invading changes were made in the core business.

Excellent work on managing the community, others should take note.<p>Second, both signal and matrix collect too much metadata. signal means you&#x27;re completely screwed by their dependency on phone  numbers. I expect little metadata privacy from signal because to me, it is practically the same as using my SSN or fingerprint as my user name,same for all my contacts, this key field is used by everyone and their mother to track everything we do like 1984 was target practice. For matrix, it&#x27;s the defaults and how easy it is for others to fingerprint you using your specific device (equivalent of a user-agent seen by everyone iirc?) and other profile details ,but none of this is easy to correlate and answer questions like &quot;which social network demographic micro-group does this user belong to so we can perform targeted infiltration of their device?&quot; or &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s use this phone number to look perform the equivalent of a background check on this person who is sending us a message because we now have their phone number&quot;. Oh and the best part is, you can&#x27;t just get a burner to use for registration, and to link a signal desktop,you need the mobile app. Matrix has none of these issues.<p>Third, consider your threat models carefully. As an individual, is it better if you have infrasructure diversity and protocol interoperability or is it better to put all your eggs in signal&#x27;s basket. I never liked their use of google infra at the begining for example because I consider google more of a threat to me than most other parties. I can see the argument both ways. I personally consider the set of parties that have the most to benefit from targeting me as an individual plus those who have the most to benefit from dragnet surveillance where I reside. To me, matrix is more flexible to adopt to various threat models by for example self hosting compared to using a popular matrix server. Signal is better than the competition, if your fear is being exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities and&#x2F;or if you are worried about metadata snooping (but you trust signal&#x27;s infra provider, still google??) Then Signal makes more sense. For dragnet, I think matrix is better for me because implementation vulns only apply to a few users,making reliable dragnet attacks less likely. For anyone that might target me, my mobile phone is completely defenseless, so my concern is someone identifying <i>my<\/i> specific device for targeted attacks, with matrix they need to compromise the matrix server and even then they might need to do a lot more work to correlate which matrix user is me (real life &quot;target worthy&quot; identity). Where as with signal,they can easily micro target a group ,find out everyone&#x27;s phone numbers (e.g.: hk protesters) and target their device for further exploitation via signal or any other pwnable app that is known to present on a device associated with that phone number.Practically, I am more worried about how each app fits in with everything else I do and matrix wins the security round for me.<p>Last but not least, I use signal for 98% of my comms because the phone number usage by Signal means I can easily connect to and invite people  who don&#x27;t have signal. If there is a Matrix client app that can be used as an sms client and can discover contacts&#x27; matrix account&#x2F;server over sms without communicating or collecting phone number&#x2F;name details of the contact, I think i might jump ship. The way I envision this to work is: the matrix client would have an invite button for non-matrix contacts and it will have an option to initiate discovery of contacts. Both options would do a challenge-response with each contact and instead of associating with a phone number they would ask to create a new martrix only contact."],"time":["2020-01-03 13:28:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["maqp"],"id":[21943689],"kids":[21958610],"parent":[21936929],"text":["Matthew outlined much of the Matrix problems but not in the context of the latter part of his idealistic thoughts.<p>Just going to point out that if agreeing on spec is six time slower, that&#x27;s just the first car of traffic jam slowing down. The next car has to slow down more: The feature needs to move into SDKs. Then the next car, the client vendors need to actually implement and test their implementation of the feature and write documentation. That&#x27;s even more slow.<p>&quot;HOWEVER: all of this completely ignores one critical thing - the value of freedom.&quot;<p>I really value freedom. To me freedom means a non-technical dissident doesn&#x27;t have to sit in jail when their messages weren&#x27;t E2EE. It doesn&#x27;t mean I can choose a value from a list of servers and have faceless entity #1, #2 or #3, or worse, Mike - the creepy IT guy from my peers - observe my metadata with everybody, and content with Karen who refuses to switch to Matrix client that supports E2EE.<p>&quot;Freedom to run your own server (perhaps invisibly in your app, in a P2P world).&quot;<p>Now this is something I can get behind. Which is why I&#x27;ve spent the last eight years working on P2P messaging system. Perhaps Matrix should move their efforts into being the change they want to see in the world instead of defending a bad solution of decentralization by saying they&#x27;re thinking about implementing a better solution of P2P.<p>&quot;Freedom to pick which country your server runs in&quot;<p>Which you can&#x27;t do if you&#x27;re running P2P server on your device. I think every faceless service provider from Signal to any XMPP server has the same guarantee of privacy in practice. The only difference is Signal has to abide by the GDPR, independent users hosting servers don&#x27;t. Before anyone screams about PRISM, I will point out that coercing insertion of a backdoor is the same as compelled speech, which would violate the constitution.<p>&quot;Freedom to select how much metadata and history to keep.&quot;<p>We have precedence of Signal keeping none of that. With Matrix servers the server has access to all metadata by default, the server program doesn&#x27;t attempt to hide anything, there&#x27;s no sealed sender etc. Your only hope is to run your own server, somehow convince your peers you&#x27;re the one they should trust with their metadata (there&#x27;s a third party on every decentralized server with more than two users), and hope you don&#x27;t grow enough to get hacked by nation state actors or criminals.<p>&quot;Freedom to choose which apps to use - while still having the freedom to talk to anyone you like. Freedom to connect your own functionality - bots, bridges, integrations etc&quot;<p>A nice idea, but everyone needs to have same features for it to work, so what you get is differences in UI, implementation language, and platform support. What matters most here is the programming language: Matrix client written in Rust is more secure that one written in C. But unless everyone uses the Rust version, the group chat is as secure as the weakest link. Same goes with bridges. You&#x27;ll never have security because of this guy who likes to re-live their youth through irssi: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1782&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1782&#x2F;<\/a><p>Also, what happens when Facebook implements their own Matrix client that steals your metadata from the endpoint, and what happens when they start bundling their app on every Samsung smartphone? Perhaps it&#x27;s not your idealistic Riot client that&#x27;s the problem, perhaps it&#x27;s the bundled spyware on every peers&#x27; device used by people who just, don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m not saying Signal fixes the problem of user laziness, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s better to know what&#x27;s on the receiving end.<p>&quot;Freedom to select which identifiers (if any) to use to register your account.&quot;<p>Which is kind of pointless considering the IP-address still leaks to the server by default. And the UUID means all your metadata can be tied together. The social graph is revealed to the server so unless everyone keeps rolling their IDs and exchanging them over some other channel, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to hide metadata from a malicious server running statistical analysis. Even if you&#x27;re not malicious, there&#x27;s no way to know if your server has been compromised. Or, if you somehow can harden your server against the NSAs of this world, please, go work for the Freedom of The Press Foundation or something.<p>&quot;Freedom to extend the protocol.&quot;<p>When the protocol fails to mandate BASIC security features like E2EE, it&#x27;s kind of pointless to talk about the possibilities of extendability. There&#x27;s always going to be maintainers and theyneed to prioritize, so there&#x27;s always going to be someone who decides whether something will be implemented by them. Signal doesn&#x27;t forbid pull-requests if you want something done. The nice thing is, it&#x27;s at least six times faster to do it for Signal.<p>&quot;Freedom to write your own client, or build whole new as-yet-unimagined systems on top.&quot;<p>So it&#x27;s the freedom of the developer we&#x27;re talking about. Reminds me of BSD vs GPL (BSD says developer has freedom to fuck over users with proprietary fork, GPL says user has right to not be abused like that, and that developers have the obligation to not do that). It&#x27;s the rights of the users that matter. That is, human rights. You can merge as-yet-unimagined systems to Signal. You might face initial criticism because it needs to be secure by default. But it&#x27;s not like Moxie will show you the finger for proposing something before it&#x27;s discovered or announced. I have first hand experience with this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;signalapp&#x2F;Signal-Android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4171\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;signalapp&#x2F;Signal-Android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4171<\/a><p>&quot;It’s true that if you’re writing a messaging app optimized for privacy at any cost, Moxie’s approach is one way to do it.&quot;<p>If you consider privacy is a human right, developer freedom isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s easier to see who has their priorities in order.<p>&quot;you end up thoroughly putting all your eggs in one basket, trusting past, present &amp; future Signal to retain its values, stay up and somehow dodge compromise &amp; censorship… despite probably being the single highest value attack target on the ‘net.&quot;<p>So which one is easier to subvert, community of experts constantly under scrutiny by peer experts trying desperately to make a name for themselves, or open work group on protocol that still isn&#x27;t secure by default, and that is much more susceptible to stagnation via bike-shedding and mission hijacking. OpenPGP work group still hasn&#x27;t agreed on v5 fingerprint, the SHAppening happened five years ago. I&#x27;m going to have to disagree and say I don&#x27;t have faith in unnecessarily large organizations.<p>I&#x27;m just going to say this FUD is worth being pointed out, but that it&#x27;s not worthy of dissection.<p>&quot;We owe the entire success of the Internet (let alone the Web) to openness, interoperability and decentralization.&quot;<p>A thought that was denounced in the 36c3 talk whether you watched the stream or not.<p>&quot;To declare that openness, interoperability and decentralization is ‘too hard’ and not worth the effort when building a messaging solution is to throw away all the potential of the vibrancy, creativity and innovation that comes from an open network&quot;<p>The worth was not addressed by this writing in any way, and the practical problems that far outweigh the idealistic goals were discussed by Moxie because what matters is the human rights to privacy of the users of the tool, not whether the infrastructure is based on idealistic ideas that don&#x27;t offer tangible security benefits in practice.<p>Like Moxie said, prove that decentralization works by doing the bare necessities of implementing E2EE, then it&#x27;s worth discussing whether the idealism part matters, and if decentralization has something useful to offer.<p>&quot;Sure, you may end up with a super-private messaging app - but one that starts to smell alarmingly like a walled garden like Facebook’s Internet.org initiative, or an AOL keyword, or Google’s AMP. &quot;<p>The negative connotations of these companies are about lack of respecting privacy. It&#x27;s really weird to essentially say &quot;you end up with super private app that shares other commonalities with privacy invading companies&quot;. Walled garden isn&#x27;t ideal, but for now, it&#x27;s more secure and that&#x27;s what matters more to users.<p>&quot;So, we continue to gladly take up Moxie’s challenge to prove him wrong - to show that it’s both possible and imperative to create an open decentralized messaging platform which (if you use reputable apps and servers) can be as secure and metadata-protecting as Signal…&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the attitude we need. Now go out there and use your preferred methods to make the idealistic protocol secure by default! Just don&#x27;t expect me or anyone else to recommend its use before that happens.<p>&quot;and indeed more so, given you can run your server off the grid, and don’t need to register with a phone number&quot;<p>Will you be getting rid of IP-address leak to servers too?

I was on a large government project where the decision was made to use event sourcing, and it was disastrous. It ended up being a big contributor to several years of time and cost overruns.<p>The reason is that for event sourcing to work, you have to have a pretty good idea of your application&#x27;s requirements up front. It&#x27;s simply not conducive to agile development, compared with using a traditional DB. The requirements were constantly shifting, and we were constantly realizing that we had the wrong semantics or structure for various fields, or that assumptions we had made about the coupling of different types of data simply didn&#x27;t hold. This led to a ton of rewriting and churn on the view code, and required constant decisions on how to handle existing data in the &quot;old&quot; format.<p>Some of the requirement churn even had ramifications for fundamental architectural characteristics such as support for atomic transactions, so there were several points at which we had to hack locking or other techniques to ensure consistency on top of the event sourcing approach. I do NOT recommend this, it turns everything into a huge mess.<p>The worst part is, ultimately, the data sizes ended up not being that big. We could have run the whole thing off of append-only tables in a single beefy Postgres instance.<p>Conclusion: if you are designing systems, you should definitely know what event sourcing is and the benefits it can provide.

I don&#x27;t post here that much. Just scroll if the list item is cut off.<p>TLDR; Use Redux-Saga-- it matches all the bird-eye view event sourcing concepts closely.<p>What is it?<p><pre><code>  - Structure: In its simplest form, an append only file (aka a log).\n  - Events -&gt; { type, metadata } -&gt; {type: &quot;UserUpdated&quot;, data}\n  - Projections -&gt; The read model. Think of them as .reduce() over your log. But because all they need to do is look at the newest event to perform a reduction, they act as “realtime” queries for aggregated data.\n  - Separation of read and write models aka CQRS\n  - Read Model: Projection\n  - Write Model: Event Dispatch\n  - You can have CQRS without event sourcing (GraphQL, etc) but you cannot have Event Sourcing without CQRS. Event Sourcing is implicit CQRS.\n  - Separation allows you to scale your reads and writes independently.\n  - Event sourcing, since it is just a log, allows you to replay your data\n  - For communication to a service that’s supposed to perform an action for you:\n    - Command (dispatch) -&gt; PresentTenseVerbNoun (UpdateUser)\n    - Event (write) -&gt; NounPastTenseVerb (UserUpdated)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe gist of what you do:<p><pre><code>  - You dispatch events to the event store and create contextual &quot;realtime&quot; data via projections that your services read.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhy do you want to use it?<p><pre><code>  - It scales and plays well with distributed infrastructure.\n  - You are already using bits of the concepts if you are scaling or doing logging.\n  - You have uniform communication between services.\n  - Event sourcing is extremely good at modeling state in your system. You’re forced to think of state (via events) and how those events “eventually” resolve. If you’re purely on SQL, on the other hand, you need a log or triggers on top of your commits to keep track of state. Eg — Customer goes down the shopping isle and puts an XBOX in their cart. Then they decide to put it back and put a PS4 in their cart. If you had bound that behavior to events, you would be able to run complex projections on them.\n  - ^ On that note, you essentially get free logging and metrics with Event Sourcing (though you need to build out the projections).\n  - Event sourcing actually makes writing sequence diagrams to optimize or design your system very easy.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhy don’t you want to use it?<p><pre><code>  - If it is overly “complex” for a small-mid sized CRUD project.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nMisconceptions<p><pre><code>  - Redux &#x2F; Elm did not “popularize” event sourcing. There was a small snippet in the “Prior Art” section in the old Redux docs that mentioned event sourcing, but no one was thinking “event sourcing, yay!” as they were using Redux w&#x2F; Thunks.\n  - Redux w&#x2F; Redux-Sagas is almost 1:1 the event sourcing model, however. If you want to learn event sourcing, instead of reading the article above, just learn how to use Redux-Sagas. Sagas, in event sourcing terms, is what is more generally known as a “Process Manager”.\n  - Event Store DB vs PG DB — No need to go one or the other. Use the best of both worlds. ES for your event sourcing, PG for your read model and fully scoped write models.\n  - “Event sourcing is so much more complex than using ORM” — No. The concepts are pretty standard whatever you use when you get into distributed systems modeling. Event sourcing is actually less complex but the tooling and verbiage we are used to is too highly focused on ORM, PG, etc.\n  - Acid-compliance and eventual consistency are not mutually exclusive. Eventual consistency does not refer to the DB itself. It refers to the infrastructure. If your infrastructure is not brain splitting and is always “eventually consistent”, everything will be OK for most applications.

Public blockchains use BFT consensus algorithm that’s very slow by design. Hyperledger, with its leader consensus model looks very similar to clustered event stores.\n  - Redux-Saga matches the event sourcing flow and implementation so closely that it is probably the best place to start.\n  - If you have really good modeling and event sourcing in place, you’ll start to see that Redux begins to disappear from your frontend; especially if you use GQL and caching.\n  - Domain-driven Design really helps model an event sourcing infrastructure.<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-01-02 03:10:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21932351],"kids":{},"parent":[21931323],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-02 02:57:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["_tkzm"],"id":[21934131],"kids":[21935421],"parent":[21931323],"text":["99,99% new people that come to event sourcing and 9&#x2F;10 of those who have been in the event sorucing already, make the huge mystake of taking event store concepts from other people that took it from other people and in the end that is where everyone fails. even big names like greg and his praised &quot;eventstore&quot; project. if you are new to ES, great, you have no baggage. do not read any technicalities about the event store or try to use any existing library for it(the underlying storage engine does not matter, mysql, postgres, rocks...). come up with your own solution and you will have zero ES problems. why? well, the entire concept of event store that is being flown out there is completely flawed and if you implement it, it will cost you a lot of money and time to unfuck yourself later on."],"time":["2020-01-02 11:03:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["samuel"],"id":[21934529],"kids":{},"parent":[21931469],"text":["A bit unrelated, but I&#x27;m surprised because of how second readings are performed.<p>_In the UK, each mammogram is interpreted by two readers, and in cases of disagreement, an arbitration process may invoke a third opinion.

The shape of the whistle is to emphasize a specific frequency in the hiss noise made by blowing into it. Polyphonic overtone singing is pretty much exactly the same thing, but using voice instead of hiss to generate the complex tones.<p>And just like learning to whistle, at first you&#x27;ll sound like a raving lunatic and maybe even come close to passing out from hyperventilating. But once you begin finding the ideal tongue placements for a pitch, you&#x27;ll very rapidly learn more, and it&#x27;ll be exactly as automatic as after you learn to whistle. They&#x27;re very very similar things to do, and the difficulty is identical.<p>If you are tongue tied (as I am) you probably won&#x27;t ever be able to do it right. But you should be able to coax out at least a bit of overtone.<p>Now go out and try it, and enjoy knowing your neighbours will be forever terrified of you."],"time":["2020-01-02 21:53:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amelius"],"id":[21939700],"kids":[21939968,21939841,21945888,21939765,21944795],"parent":[21938524],"text":["I have yet to see a real performance where this technique is used artistically <i>and<\/i> in a way that sounds pleasant."],"time":["2020-01-02 21:53:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TedDoesntTalk"],"id":[21944245],"kids":[21948183],"parent":[21938524],"text":["Why is she dressed like that?"],"time":["2020-01-03 09:34:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mymythisisthis"],"id":[21931684],"kids":[21932158,21932524],"parent":[21931337],"text":["From Restoration in 1660 (end of the war), to the fire of London in 1666, there was an incredible vibe in the air in England.

But thus far no killer-app of VR has been made. There is no excel, no word, no browser. But there could be, if more people thought about and identified what VR hardware can do that no other platform can. Moreover, its value needs to be a 10x moment. Minor improvements will not cause mass adoption.<p>So what can VR provide that other platforms can’t?<p>1) 3D Space<p>This is the first thing people think of, but is the least important. There are few business tasks that can’t be done on a 2D plane, and the value of going 3D (such as in industrial design) is not a 10x improvement over real-life prototyping.<p>2) Unlimited space<p>This also provides less value than it seems. A human can only be in one place, and our vision can only encompass so much area. There is a low upper-bound on how much space a human being can use.<p>3) Presence<p>The feeling of “being there” is something VR does 10x better than other platforms. This has been leveraged by entertainment software to good effect. However, the nature of recreational user experience — gameplay experience — doesn’t hinge upon presence in a location. VR games can induce strong presence while still not providing value with strong gameplay experience.<p>4) Social Presence<p>This is where VR hardware has the greatest possible leverage and impact. When you play poker in VR, you see this most clearly — people spend more time interacting with one another than actually playing poker. Even with cartoonish avatars, the feeling of being in the presence of another person is practically the same as being in the same room with them. There is large room for growth in improving social presence, but even the early state of VR software is 10x better than what exists elsewhere.<p>If there is to be a killer business app for VR, it will be akin to excel. But instead of transforming numbers and formulas, it will transform communication and relationships. Whatever replaces Facebook, video chat, JIRA, Reddit, Tinder, or even email will be done on VR&#x2F;AR.<p>The gold is there waiting to be picked up. It’s just up to some great company to do it."],"time":["2020-01-02 17:19:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Causality1"],"id":[21936227],"kids":[21936780,21936302,21939746,21936704],"parent":[21933031],"text":["My issue with VR has always been UX.

I respect the encryption technologies that Signal has developed, but I&#x27;m always frustrated with Signal as an app, platform and where it seems to be headed. Throughout this talk, the one quote that came to my mind for every point he was defending was this:<p><i>&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&quot; <U+2015> Upton Sinclair<\/i><p>I also found it amusing when he said that it&#x27;s easier to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram to Signal. The truth is that switching people from WhatsApp to Telegram, in my experience, will earn you brownie points because Telegram is a lot more feature rich than WhatsApp (let&#x27;s keep the encryption part aside for the moment). If you manage to switch people from WhatsApp or Telegram to Signal, again in my experience, you&#x27;ll lose credibility and trust because Signal, for all the money the foundation has, moves at snail&#x27;s pace. Moxie&#x27;s argument early in the talk about centralized systems being able to change fast just does not apply to Signal. It still lacks stability in delivering messages. Its UX for joining groups, re-joining groups after reinstalling your OS, etc., completely sucks. Don&#x27;t even get me started on Signal treating its users as if everyone uses a burner phone and doesn&#x27;t care about keeping their conversations when they switch devices or even have to wipe a device and get it running again (Signal on iOS still explicitly prohibits backups after so many years, and the Signal team&#x27;s most recent addition to the app was stickers!).<p>The example for switching from WhatsApp to Telegram to Signal being easy because it&#x27;s tied to phone numbers is disingenuous. Following how WhatsApp and Telegram identify their users may not be the best thing to do. Signal assumes that people always have the same phone number and that phone numbers are the best way to identify people.

Like Alfven, I am against the idea of frozen magnetic fields. Frozen fields were invented to explain how magnetic fields can exist, without the need for electric currents. At that time they thought that space was a very good isolator. Thanks to laboratories and satellites we now know different.<p>With my background in electromagnetism, I have to go one step further: frozen fields are physically impossible. The papers and text-books about them show false usage of induction laws. As if magnetism behaves like a current, like in a waveguide with electromagnetic waves. Sadly this is completely false.  \nInduction in gasses or plasma behave a bit like those in a fluid, and they disperse the magnetic field. A bit like eddy currents. That is also what we see in our laboratories.<p>But magnetic fields can easily be caused by electric currents instead, because any electric current creates a magnetic field. This field is stronger when we measure closer to the current. So we can get very strong magnetic fields as we see inside young galaxies.\nLink: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;weirdly-strong-magnetic-field-in-young-galaxy-perplexes-astronomers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;weirdly-strong...<\/a>  \nSo we have electric plasma currents, instead of &quot;magnetic ropes&quot;. Like in our laboratories. But I am not sure whether the community is ready to accept that..<p>Instead of the dynamo model, strong electric currents can easily come from nuclear explosions. These have been reported, but due to the secrecy they are not openly reported. Just a magnetic field can create a homopolar dynamo in an electric current. Currents are usually circular, but in a large space and very high speeds, the charge can take a long time to come around. It will be very interesting to actually measure the scale at which these occur.<p>Now if we have a black-hole like object in the centre of a galaxy, that spews out matter into 2 main directions. Because it also has a magnetic field, it is very likely that this matter has a certain charge. So this creates a current in the galaxy, which also generates the magnetic field. This how I think the magnetic field is generated.<p>The strength of these electric currents is in the order of 1&#x2F;R, where R is the distance travelled. That is because currents are usually concentrated into one direction, like lightning, and only resistance hinders it. Magnetic objects encounter a force of 1&#x2F;R^4 because magnetic objects have 2 poles. So these electric currents can transfer energy over very long distances.<p>As this matter-beam reaches the edge of the galaxy, it will turn around and go back to the galaxy. And because it has some charge, it will create a polarizing field in the halo.It would be interesting to see if there is also some sustained charge in these halos.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov&#x2F;science&#x2F;constellations&#x2F;pages&#x2F;bubbles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov&#x2F;science&#x2F;constellations&#x2F;pages&#x2F;bub...<\/a>\nI suspect that the Fermi bubbles might have an opposite charge."],"time":["2020-01-03 01:14:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mathiasrw"],"id":[21934872],"kids":[21936137,21934881,21935331,21936049,21937921,21934958],"parent":[21934447],"text":["This is no surprise if you follow the wave of evidence for the electrical universe model.

It will require\ncountries and institutions to re-allocate\ncapital from other endeavors to fight\nagainst a warming planet.  This is the\ndecade we will begin to see this\nre-allocation of capital.  We will see\ncarbon taxed like the vice that it is in\nmost countries around the world this\ndecade, including in the US.  We will see\nreal estate values collapse in some of the\nmost affected regions and we will see real\nestate values increase in regions that\nbenefit from the warming climate.  We will\nsee massive capital investments made in\nprotecting critical regions and\ninfrastructure.  We will see nuclear power\nmake a resurgence around the world,\nparticularly smaller reactors that are\neasier to build and safer to operate.  We\nwill see installed solar power worldwide\ngo from ~650GW currently to over 20,000GW\nby the end of this decade.  All of these\nthings and many more will cause the\ncapital markets to focus on and fund the\nclimate issue to the detriment of many\nother sectors.&quot;<p>there is an accurate one word summary --\nnonsense.  With two or more words, even\nworse than nonsense.<p>It&#x27;s time to drive a stake through the\nheart of this climate change alarmism.  We\ncan do a good job just in this little\npost.<p>In simple terms, there is no serious\nevidence that CO2 from human activities at\nanything like probable concentrations will\nhave any significant effect on the\ntemperature or climate of the earth.<p>Yes, CO2 is a <i>greenhouse gas<\/i>, but it is\na long logical path from there to any\nclaims of a significant effect.<p>We need just two steps:<p>(1) History.<p>There is NOTHING in the climate history\nfrom the present back to about 1 million\nyears ago that supports the idea that\nanything like realistic concentrations of\nCO2 from human activities will have any\nsignificant effect on temperatures.<p>(i) For the ice core records going back ~1\nmillion years, yes, both temperatures and\nCO2 concentrations went both up and down.\nBUT, if we just look carefully at the big\ngraph in Al Gore&#x27;s movie, with high irony,\nthat graph totally destroys his claims\nfrom that graph:  He misread the graph.\nThe main point is that there is an 800\nyear delay; CO2 concentrations changed 800\nyears AFTER the temperature changes, from\nwhatever cause.<p>Specifically:  (a) When temperatures\nstarted increasing, from whatever cause,\nCO2 concentrations were LOW, not high.\n(b) About 800 years later CO2\nconcentrations were HIGH, from increased\nbiological activity from the higher\ntemperatures.  (c) When temperatures\nstarted to fall, from whatever cause, CO2\nconcentrations were still HIGH, not low.\n(d) The high CO2 concentrations did not\nkeep the temperatures from falling.  (e)\nOnce the temperatures fell, about 800\nyears later so did CO2 concentrations.\nNet, CO2 did not cause the higher\ntemperatures or keep the higher\ntemperatures from falling.<p>(ii) In the last 2000 years we had the\nMedieval Warm Period and the Little Ice\nAge, and there is no suggestion that CO2\nconcentration changes caused either.<p>(iii) Starting in the 1940s and through\nabout 1970, we actually had some\nsignificant cooling, but in those years\nCO2 from human activities -- WWII, pulling\nof the Great Depression, and the economic\nboom after WWII -- increased.  So, we got\nCOOLING, not warming, with the additional\nCO2 from human activities.<p>Net, there is NO data from the historical\nrecord that supports the claim that higher\nCO2 will cause higher temperatures.<p>(2) Yes, CO2 is a &lt;i&gt;greenhouse&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; gas.\nThe absorption spectrum is at<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webbook.nist.gov&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=0&amp;Type=IR&amp;Large=on\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webbook.nist.gov&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=0&amp;...<\/a><p>So, CO2 absorbs in three narrow bands, one\nfor each of bending, stretching, and\ntwisting of the molecule, out in the\ninfrared.<p>No, Tom Friedman of the NYT:  CO2 does not\nabsorb sunlight, and anyone can confirm\nthis by looking at a source of CO2, e.g.,\nexhaling or the bubbles from soda pop, and\nsimply observing that the CO2 is not\nvisible and does not cast a shadow.<p>So, the theory has been that the CO2 warms\nthe planet.  Then there has been<p>ALARMIST CLAIM:  Extra CO2 from current\nhuman activities will soon cause\nsignificant extra warming and, thus,\n&quot;climate change&quot;, a &quot;climate crisis&quot;, etc.<p>Since the historical record can&#x27;t support\nthe ALARMIST CLAIM, we have to rely on the\ntheory based on the absorption spectrum of\nCO2 and computation.<p>Well the computations were done by dozens\nof teams, and the results are summarized\nin<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energyadvocate.com&#x2F;gc1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energyadvocate.com&#x2F;gc1.jpg<\/a><p>Net, as in this graph, nearly all the\ncomputations predicted rapid, significant\nincreases in temperatures soon.  Well the\ntime of predicted increases came and went\nwith no sign of anything like the\npredicted increases.<p>In science, when predictions are made and\nfound to be false, we junk the science.<p>No doubt, the failures in that graph are\nsome of the worst in all the history of\nscience.  GOOD science, e.g., the hunt for\nand finding the Higgs boson at the LHC\n(Large Hadron Collider), the observations\nthat confirmed the predictions of black\nholes, many other confirmed predictions of\nspecial and general relativity, the\nA-bomb, the H-bomb, the design of the\nHubble telescope, to the quantum mechanics\nin semi-conductors that are the core of\ncurrent digital electronics, the science\nwas just rock solid.<p>We are just awash in super solid science,\nand the global warming computations in\nthat graph are just a humiliation of\nanything scientific and just sick.<p>So, for the ALARMIST CLAIM, there is no\nscientific support.<p>For more there is the video documentary\n<i>The Great Global Warming Swindle<\/i> at<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg<\/a><p>there see (A) the remarks of MIT Professor\nR. Lindzen on (i) why any warming we might\nbe getting now cannot be from CO2 and (ii)\nthe huge pile of money that didn&#x27;t just\nbuy off the climate scientists but HIRED\nthe climate alarmists pretending to be\nclimate scientists, maybe 10 times more\nalarmists than real scientists.<p>Also that documentary argues that the\nMedieval Warm Period and the Little Ice\nAge were caused by variations in the rates\nof sun spots.  More sun spots increase the\nsolar wind which, from more links in a\ncausal chain, in the end slows cloud\nformation and has a net warming effect.<p>So, since both (1) history from ~1 million\nyears ago to the present and (2) the\ncomputations based on CO2 being a\ngreenhouse gas fail to support the\nALARMIST CLAIM, we have no scientific\nsupport or even meaningful evidence for\nthe ALARMIST CLAIM or the proposed very\nexpensive reductions in carbon, etc.<p>In this case and quite generally, if we\nare willing to go forward with big,\nexpensive changes without good evidence,\nthen we leave ourselves open to some of\nthe worst mistakes in all of civilization.<p>One current example of such mistakes is\nkilling off the rhinoceroses to get their\nhorns for use in Chinese medicine.<p>For another such mistake, there is from\npage 76 of<p>Susan Milbrath, <i>Star Gods of the Maya:\nAstronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars\n(The Linda Schele Series in Maya and\nPre-Columbian Studies),<\/i> ISBN-13\n978-0292752269, University of Texas Press,\n2000.<p>with<p>&quot;Indeed, blood sacrifice is required for\nthe sun to move, according to Aztec\ncosmology (Durian 1971:179; Sahaguin 1950\n- 1982, 7:8).&quot;<p>That is the Mayan charlatans killed people\nto pour their blood on a rock to keep the\nsun moving across the sky.  No doubt the\nsun actually did keep moving across the\nsky.<p>If we go forward with the Green New Deal,\nthe Paris Accords, carbon taxes, etc. we\nare making a mistake as irrational as in\nthe Chinese medicine and the Mayans.<p>Warning:  It appears that now the sun is\nentering the part of the 11 year or so\nsunspot cycle with fewer sun spots.  So,\nwe are in line for a few years of cooling.<p>So, don&#x27;t believe a claim of the global\nwarming alarmists that their efforts\ncaused the cooling.<p>At this point, continuing with\nentertaining the ALARMIST CLAIM is just\nnonsense, expensive nonsense."],"time":["2020-01-03 09:12:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aaron695"],"id":[21933947],"kids":[21934135,21933998],"parent":[21933561],"text":["&gt; The Australian Defense Force is sending ships to the Victoria town of Mallacoota on a two-week supply mission<p>Sums up the lies from Time etc pretty well<p>Using logic from primary school, exactly how could this happen?<p>Two-week supply mission?<p>Richest nation on earth, aka Australia.<p>How does a fire destroy the ability for trucks to get through a road?<p>Falling trees is the best fantasy I can think of.

Maker before planner. Trusted advisor.<p>I can bring 15 years of software experience (10 in the Bay Area) to help get your products in front of customers. Where I best support is in a role with tight communication loops with low management overhead. I&#x27;ve worked on products with millions of visitors, as well as helped get startups off the ground by being a contributor as well as a listener and faciliator of good practices such as training, retrospectives, and recruiting.

They were mostly gone when I quit drinking and became vegetarian. I can’t get through a Google-style interview right now, but I’ve done it 5+ times in my career. My experience goes back to 2003ish, and I got a CS degree in 2011. I am stuck in trauma from being homeless and have legal problems with a past employer that I don’t want to talk about. I perform well at every service and labor job that I take, few guess that I’m homeless or ask questions. I’m hoping to get off the street in a transitional job and ease into more specialized work, my plan allows for me to get off the street and save on $2,000&#x2F;mo.

The best example of this is Kubernetes -&gt; it has a hundred moving parts, and if you got an error it could be because of the problem in the kubelet, or in underlying Docker, or in Flannel, or in IPtables, or linux kernel settings, or in the settings of hypervisor, etc, etc.<p>Instead of creating productive division of labour, in IT we create UNPRODUCTIVE division of labour: Ow, this is written in .Net and that is written in Java, But I only know Golang, Javascript, C++ and Python!<p>The most elementary problems don&#x27;t have a standard solution: how many ways are there to format a settings file? Probably a few dozen. How many of them afford the user syntax highlighting?<p>I believe the root cause of bad quality software is accountability: an average android phone ships with dozens of bugs. You could not ship a car with a missing wheel. But if WiFi calling doesn&#x27;t work, nobody cares. Companies know that they can get away with it, and they do. If your management knows that shipping buggy software is fine, and so does the rest of the industry, actions of individual developer can only go so far."],"time":["2020-01-02 03:08:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["namuol"],"id":[21932347],"kids":{},"parent":[21932049],"text":["I don&#x27;t disagree that the ladder of abstraction is perilously tall, but every example of slower&#x2F;buggier software in this post is <i>assumed<\/i> to be caused by abstraction.
