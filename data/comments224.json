If he was using a smart-phone just lying on s seat of floor, the data are almost certainly (mostly) meaningless. If he was using a professional triaxial accelerometer that was rigidly or semi-rigidly attached to the floor, the data are more representative.<p>- With regards to comments about the data being related to track conditions. Passenger trains have two sets of suspension - the primary suspension between the axles and trucks (bogies for our European&#x2F;Asian friends) and the secondary suspension between the truck and the passenger car. The secondary suspension is typically very soft for ride-quality purposes and is mostly isolated from the track. The vertical vibration levels measured here are almost entirely a result of the ride-quality decisions made by the manufacturer and agency engineers, and less so about the track condition.<p>- As pointed out by nhf and inferiorhuman, the side-to-side jerkiness (lateral vibfration) is  likely related to track condition and is some combination of track alignment problems and wheel hunting (there the wheels on the solid axle bounce sideways back-and-forth between the parallel rails).<p>- Electrifying the line will have no affect on the cabin vibration unless Caltrains elects to purchase entirely new passenger cars with different secondary suspension design goals. If the new electric locomotives are pulling&#x2F;pushing the same passenger coaches, the vibration will be the same.<p>- From personal experience I can tell you that the TransRapid TR08 (German system, used in China) can gave similar subjective levels of jerkiness when the guideway configuration has a sudden change."],"time":["2020-01-17 15:26:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hnews_account_1"],"id":[22075988],"kids":{},"parent":[22072091],"text":["From the synopsis:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s important to use dynamic measures in a dynamic system.

You can account for changes in volatility in pure data analysis, but when developing mathematical models of time series, data stationarity <i>has<\/i> to be assumed for closed form solutions.

The meteorological year runs from December to November. During that period, 2001 temperatures were 14.51C. The record remains with 1998, when global temperature rose to 14.67C - the highest since records were first compiled in the late 1800s. The warm temperatures of 2001 and 2002 are especially significant when they are considered in the light of El Nino weather patterns that alter global climate, Mr Hansen said. &quot;The fact that 2002 is almost as warm as the unusual warmth of 1998 is confirmation that the underlying global warming trend is continuing,&quot; Mr Hansen said.<p>----------<p>August 25, 2011:<p>&gt; But Hansen and colleagues have estimated that Earth&#x27;s actual average surface air temperature between 1951 and 1980 was approximately 287 K (14 degrees Celsius) (Hansen et al. 2010).

You can’t have a series of backward passes into infinite, which is impossible. There has to be a first cause that doesn’t have a cause.<p>Also good is one of Avicenna’s biggest critics, Al-Ghazali. His view on occasionalism makes it easy to believe in miracles and is sunni orthodoxy in creed. Basically if you believe that God is the creator of causes, effects, and their relationship which is being upheld in every instance, then a suspense of such a relationship is possible. Al-Ghazali, unlike Avicenna, is also considered a heavy weight in sufism. For example, one critique I heard a while back from Neil deGrasse Tyson on Al-Ghazali was that his writings is basically what caused the end of the Islamic Golden age, because the focus became on more on spirituality than intellectual pursuits afterwards. There could be some truth in that. I got my first B in university when I started reading Rumi. This was probably just laziness and not some spiritual opening.<p>Also popular is Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. He said something a long the lines that if you hid behind a wall and threw a pebble in front of a baby, even a baby will turn around and see where the pebble came from. There’s a popular story that he was walking on the streets with a large entourage and some old lady asked “who is that guy?” and someone responded “Don’t you know! This is Fakhr al-Din al-Razi! He has 70 proofs of God’s existence!” To which the old lady laughed and responded “If he did not have seventy doubts for the existence of God he would not need seventy proofs!” Upon hearing this al-Razi said everyone should be like the old lady.<p>If you’re interested in islamic theology, Dr. Umar Faruq And-Allah is good.

One is to stay on L forever, and have a 50.1% chance of receiving... let&#x27;s call it `x` amount of reward, and a 49.9% chance of receiving nothing.  The other is to move back and forth (L, center, R, center), which has a 100% chance of receiving `x&#x2F;4` reward.  (In theory the robot could also stay on R forever, but that&#x27;s strictly inferior to staying on L, even if only slightly.)<p>The robot can also use a mix of these two strategies, e.g. by moving back and forth but waiting an extra turn every time it&#x27;s on L.  This increases the worst-case reward at the cost of reducing the best-case reward.<p>Let&#x27;s rephrase in gambling terms.  Suppose you have a one-time offer to bet any amount of money and then flip a fair coin (well, a 50.1&#x2F;49.9% coin).  If it&#x27;s heads, the money you bet is quadrupled; if it&#x27;s tails, you lose the money.  Then the first option above represents betting all your money; the second option represents betting nothing; mixing the strategies is equivalent to betting only some of your money.<p>What would you do?  The expected value of the money you come away with is 2x the money you bet, so if you&#x27;re optimizing for expected value, you&#x27;ll bet all the money you own.  But most people wouldn&#x27;t, because the risk of coming away with nothing is not worth the possible benefit.  Personally, I might bet some of my money, but there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;d bet nothing, because I care much more about the worst-case scenario than the average scenario – at least when the chance of a worst-case scenario is so high (almost 50%!).<p>You could argue that monetary gain is not the same thing as a reward function, and risk aversion should be modeled as part of the reward calculation, so that you can, in fact, optimize the expected value of the reward function.

You’ll be ok enough to go through the day, but with diminished focus and willpower. The few days I make sure to sleep more, I clearly get extra energy and focus.

My grandfather comes from a culture where you’d traditionally wake up very early, work the fields, then rest in the early afternoon because it’s hot outside, before doing another shift into the cool evening. My dad was lucky enough to invent a job for himself that allowed a similar routine, with 1hr or 2hr naps on most days. Unfortunately, the modern workday was “invented” in Northern Europe and follows different rhythms, so less people get that option than ever before.<p>Other ways I’ve found to increase the sleep-hours count:<p>— allocate a couple of hours during the night for actual work, then go to bed earlier. E.g. 21-3 sleep, then 1 or 2h awake, then another 3h sleep to wake up at 8. (I sleep better in cycles of 3h). This is actually more relaxing to me than doing 9h straight. Unfortunately it’s risky - if you get in the zone, the temptation to skip the second sleep-block is very high.<p>— when you wake up, 30mins physical exercise followed by shower, then back to bed. Surprisingly effective but not always an option (partner or kids in the house will not appreciate the noise).<p>— reducing caffeine. I don’t drink caffeine after 2pm, ever.<p>— losing weight.

Caffeine has a 12 hour half life.  12 hours after your last caffeinated drink, you will have 50% of the caffeine in your system.  Healthy adults should not exceed 400mg&#x2F;day regardless.<p>- Amount of D3 and B vitamins your gut bacteria are deficient in.  Your gut bacteria need energy to break down the foods you eat for the symbiotic relationship that break down fiber and other things required for your health.  If they do not have enough D3 and B (all B vitamins), they will give off proteins that will induce stress &#x2F; cortisol.  This becomes a cyclical problem if not addressed.<p>- Environmental stress.  If your mind has too many unresolved issues, your cortisol levels will be too high.  Delegate as many issues to other people as you can.  This is probably going to be a hard one if you are a founder.  It&#x27;s hard to let go, especially if you are passionate about your ideas and goals.<p>- Not enough sleep.  But wait, that is the problem, right?  Lacking sleep raises toxicity levels in your body, including your brain.  This creates a cyclical problem that will worsen with time.  Your brain keeps track of how much sleep it lost and at some point you will experience hallucinations or waking dreams when this catches up with you.  Deep sleep (all four stages) are required to allow your brain to purge toxic material.  Do not use sedatives &#x2F; drugs to sleep.  That isn&#x27;t real sleep.  D3, L-Theanine (amino acid), 5-HTP (amino acid) can help with hormones that can make you sleepy.<p>- Light.  A few hours before you intend to sleep, mute the light.  Use soft lights.  Avoid screens.

True insomnia may or may not be your problem, that&#x27;s up for you and possibly your doctors to figure out.<p>The basics for treating insomnia:<p>- exercise regularly<p>- eat healthily<p>- get enough sunlight at the right time of day. If you&#x27;re waking up too early then you want more sunlight in the afternoon and evening.<p>- practice good sleep hygiene. This means you only use your bedroom for two activities: sleep and sex. If you lie in bed for more than fifteen minutes without falling to sleep or wake up early and can&#x27;t get back to sleep, get up and go somewhere else until you are sleepy again. Don&#x27;t lie in bed trying to sleep. The brain becomes acclimatized to being awake in bed, and that&#x27;s bad.<p>Now, the medication-based approaches:<p>- consult with a neurologist if the above approaches don&#x27;t help.<p>- Personally I found a low-dose anti-anxiety medication to be extremely helpful. Many of these cause dependence and can be hard to get off of, but on the other hand chronic lack of sleep has significant medical risks of its own, so I felt the tradeoff was a good one.<p>- prescription sleep medications can also be helpful, although somewhat less so for someone who wakes up too early as opposed to someone who has difficulty falling asleep. If you go this route, you probably want to try Sonata, which has a short half life versus, say, Ambient and therefore leaves you feeling less drugged after three or four hours.<p>- I also found Rozerem to be very helpful. Unlike all other sleep medications, Rozerem is a melatonin receptor agonist. It does not sedate you; it reinforces your circadian rhythms. It does not leave me feeling drugged and does not affect my sleep architecture.<p>Now, the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approach:<p>- you can train your brain to associate &quot;bed&quot; with &quot;sleep&quot;. It ain&#x27;t easy, but for many people it works and doesn&#x27;t require medication.<p>- figure out how long you&#x27;re sleeping on average.<p>- for a week, do not go to bed at all until one full hour less than your average sleep duration. In other words, if you sleep six hours a night and wake up at 7, don&#x27;t go to bed until 2 AM. Keep this up for a week. The idea is to intentionally build up a sleep deficit, so your body will go to sleep quickly and stay asleep. Continue to religiously wake up and get out of bed at 7.<p>- the next week give yourself an extra fifteen minutes of sleep. Go to bed at 1:45 AM, or get up at 7:15.<p>- keep this up until you are getting the amount of sleep you need.<p>- If at any time you find yourself not going to sleep immediately or waking up too early, back up fifteen minutes.<p>- By the end of the process you hopefully have retrained your brain to associate being in bed with being asleep.<p>I personally found consulting with a neurologist and figuring an approach that worked for me to be very helpful."],"time":["2020-01-17 17:55:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["inkeddeveloper"],"id":[22075354],"kids":[22081928,22075392,22075847],"parent":[22074672],"text":["I have found that using a flag system works wonders.

It would be interesting to see if a small colony is equally resilient to small perturbations as a large colony is to large perturbations, keeping some adjusted ratio of the perturbationSize&#x2F;colonySize constant.<p>&gt; individual ants live at most a year.<p>This comes as a surprise to me."],"time":["2020-01-16 09:17:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tobinfricke"],"id":[22062602],"kids":[22063776,22062992],"parent":[22062472],"text":["Reminds me of the &quot;Tradition is smarter than you are&quot; article that was posted here a few days ago.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholars-stage.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholars-stage.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;tradition-is-smar...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-16 09:24:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mFixman"],"id":[22063305],"kids":[22064127,22063439,22063415,22064962,22063466,22063634,22063460,22072457,22067002,22063757,22064144],"parent":[22062472],"text":["Yesterday there was a link in HN regarding artificial intelligence, and a user raised an interesting question: if a ML algorithm can be considered conscious, could a group of people doing the equivalent calculations by hand be the same?<p>I think that ant example answers that question with a strong &quot;yes&quot;."],"time":["2020-01-16 11:38:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arnoooooo"],"id":[22062739],"kids":[22073459,22062980],"parent":[22062472],"text":["I recommend looking up Donald Hoffman&#x27;s theory of conscious agents.<p>He proposes that all sentient beings are networks of conscious agents, the simplest conscious agent being binary (it has a world, and can only act in two ways).<p>Any composition of conscious agents is itself a conscious agent.<p>Interestingly, &quot;the world&quot; of each conscious agent might be only other conscious agents."],"time":["2020-01-16 09:50:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ckastner"],"id":[22062652],"kids":{},"parent":[22062472],"text":["&gt; <i>Foraging in a harvester ant colony requires some individual ant memory.

Back in high school and college I would spend days or weeks trying to reverse random software packages I had installed on my system.  It was pretty surprising how, with a few tools like OllyDBG, 90% of the software I attempted to crack was actually crackable.  Most of Autodesk&#x27;s software was ridiculously easy to crack. (Don&#x27;t worry, I owned all that software already!  I was studying animation at the time.)<p>I didn&#x27;t realize this until later, but I got a skill out of reversing that&#x27;s actually pretty useful as a software engineer.  Granted, I work with JavaScript, but reversing actually taught me how to persevere with debugging.  I&#x27;ve been able to fix some bugs that other people couldn&#x27;t in a reasonable timeframe because I treated the problem like I would when reversing a program; it can be more expedient to perform a process of elimination by disabling or inverting parts of the code, observing what happens, keeping detailed notes on observed behavior, and lead yourself down to the key change you need to make.  A lot of people debug problems by trying to look at the code and reason about it while setting breakpoints, but there can be a lot of mental overhead in doing this.  When the problem is mysterious, I find that a process of elimination through experimentation can be more effective.<p>This actually happened recently, where we essentially had an infinite feedback look happening that was obfuscated by a lot of framework code.  It&#x27;s possible that the root cause could have been identified by debugging, but a few people tried to do so but couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  This is because setting a breakpoint somewhere in the process chain didn&#x27;t reveal anything obvious, and you&#x27;d be lucky to actually spot the problem in the application code just by looking at it.  I treated the problem like reverse engineering, and did exactly what I described above.  It took me a few hours, but I did succeed in narrowing down exactly where in the code things were going wrong.<p>Sure, someone could have stepped through the app and framework code enough times that they might have figured it out.  Perhaps there are also more advanced debugging techniques that none of us were aware of that would have helped.

He described the early stages of delusional thought as self-referential, over-interpretations of actual sensory perceptions, as opposed to hallucinations.<p>RimWorld: Contrarian, Ridiculous, and Impossible Game Design Methods<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VdqhHKjepiE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VdqhHKjepiE<\/a><p>5 game design tips from Sims creator Will Wright<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=scS3f_YSYO0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=scS3f_YSYO0<\/a><p>&gt;Tip 5: On world building. As you know by now, Will&#x27;s approach to creating games is all about building a coherent and compelling player experience. His games are comprised of layered systems that engage players creatively, and lead to personalized, some times unexpected outcomes. In these types of games, players will often assume that the underlying system is smarter than it actually is. This happens because there&#x27;s a strong mental model in place, guiding the game design, and enhancing the player&#x27;s ability to imagine a coherent context that explains all the myriad details and dynamics happening within that game experience.<p>&gt;Now let&#x27;s apply this to your project: What mental model are you building, and what story are you causing to unfold between your player&#x27;s ears? And how does the feature set in your game or product support that story? Once you start approaching your product design that way, you&#x27;ll be set up to get your customers to buy into the microworld that you&#x27;re building, and start to imagine that it&#x27;s richer and more detailed than it actually is."],"time":["2020-01-16 09:21:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unlit_spark"],"id":[22062254],"kids":{},"parent":[22061842],"text":["This is good, keep up the good work. \nAlso, from the creator:<p>&gt;I&#x27;m working on adding more content, more detail, more examples, and really just more everything.

Apple and Google get to free themselves of having to break ties between content curation and being a censor. Users who want use apps that are vetted by a third-party of their choosing to achieve some purpose would be able to do so e.g. apps for children. I’m not sure exactly what Apple or Google would have to accomplish this, but I think they could some of their organization app policy logic combined with a few other things e.g. forbidding side-loading, or adding additional content-blocker specific app signatures that an app could optionally have. There is a good chance that this would hurt advertising, so there would be the appropriate and proportional pushback. However, I consider that to be an expression of what the market wants.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;seedship&#x2F;id1340497640\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;seedship&#x2F;id1340497640<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.johnayliff.seedship&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.johnayliff...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnayliff.itch.io&#x2F;seedship\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnayliff.itch.io&#x2F;seedship<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philome.la&#x2F;johnayliff&#x2F;seedship&#x2F;play&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philome.la&#x2F;johnayliff&#x2F;seedship&#x2F;play&#x2F;index.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-16 19:44:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["casid"],"id":[22072635],"kids":{},"parent":[22063744],"text":["My contribution is a tower defense I&#x27;ve been working on over the last 7 years and that I&#x27;m still regularily playing myself: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mazebert.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mazebert.com&#x2F;<\/a>\nThe graphics are pretty bad (I&#x27;m drawing them myself, heh), but there&#x27;s a lot of depth and content to it.<p>There are three optional, one-time in app purchases, where you can tip me with a cookie, beer or whisky and get a cosmetic card in return."],"time":["2020-01-17 08:30:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mjevans"],"id":[22070427],"kids":{},"parent":[22063744],"text":["Are there more options for a Solitaire game that fit on this list?<p>My retired father could use something familiar (more like the Windows 95 solitaire, minesweeper, and &#x27;mahjong solitaire&#x27; tile matching) games that probably still occupy some floorspace in that grey-matter.<p>I&#x27;d also like some games that might help both younger kids and the elderly by exercising memory matching, pattern deduction, and basic math skills.

Almost all of them charge a fee up front and won&#x27;t have anything more than some DLC for their expansions. Like Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Through the Ages, etc.<p>I&#x27;m actually working on a mobile game in my spare time right now, and while I normally like to charge money for them I thought I&#x27;d try the IAP route this time, but I wasn&#x27;t planning on making it anywhere near as obnoxious as most IAP games.<p>Ads you can pay a few bucks to remove, then a couple of consumables that are optional and you can earn during a game anyway if you&#x27;re lucky, but can buy more if you want (it&#x27;s a push your luck game, so luck is part of the design), that&#x27;s about it.<p>I&#x27;m not looking to make all of the money in the world like these big companies are, just hopefully enough to make some side income and maybe eventually switch to making games full time.<p>I tried playing a Jeopardy game recently, and it just bombards you with screens of crap constantly. Here&#x27;s a screen where you can pay to add an item for a round! Use your items to help you answer a question slightly easier! Oh you won! Let&#x27;s update your win streak! (or Oh no! you lost, you&#x27;re about to go to 0 on your win streak, but if you pay, you can keep it up, and you&#x27;ll get a reward if you keep it going enough!), then here&#x27;s some special event that earns you some random nonsense for getting a question right! here&#x27;s a level up screen! here&#x27;s a screen that pesters you about something else (I don&#x27;t know, I lost track after awhile).

If your calves are tight, they will cause issues up the chain and it will&#x2F;can eventually lead to pain in the back. If your thigh muscles are too tight, same thing happens.<p>For those of us who sit often, we tend to get what is called an anterior pelvic tilt -- or in plain english a pelvis that is rotated or tilted slightly forward.

The author&#x27;s interview here[1] is a chilling survey of how the back pain industry extracts money from the population.  The article mentions back pain becoming independent of injury, and that idea is from Dr. Sarno[2] in the 1970s, and he was ridiculed for decades about that idea.  It is now recognized that a pain circuit can establish itself and run long after all physical injury is healed.<p>One reason back pain is tricky is that the intravertebral muscles spasm to protect the spinal core, and the spasms don&#x27;t stop for up to ten days.  By that time, the patient may have seen three doctors and had three different therapies.  When the spasms subside, they associate the last treatment as the one that &quot;healed&quot; their back, when in fact, 80% of all back pain resolves itself with or without treatment.<p>There is a growing body of evidence-based research into exercise and back pain.  The most studied device is the MedX lumbar extension machine[3][4], invented by Arthur Jones, the genius behind Nautilus exercise machines.

We do free trials; more on that later.<p>The sentences in the article that&#x27;s supposed to sum up the current state of the field is: &quot;A definitive physical cause—such as a fracture, a tumour, pressure on a nerve, infection or arthritis—is found in 5-15% of people with back pain. The rest is all labelled as “non-specific”, and there is increasing evidence that it is not mechanical in origin...Researchers who specialise in pain increasingly believe that, in most cases, chronic pain means that the [pain] system has become damaged in some way that keeps it switched on.&quot;  So, paraphrasing, researchers believe that most of the time the cause is not mechanical, yet there is something damaged that accounts for the pain.  Later on, it goes on to quote a doctor saying that, &quot;the reason they’ve got back pain is that they have financial problems, marital problems, disabled children, they are not sleeping at night.&quot; Notice the second doctor doesn&#x27;t stipulate that anything is &quot;damaged&quot; in the person&#x27;s pain system at all — he explains the pain as a response to the fact that the person has a lot of things going on in their life, any one of which may not feel completely handled or completely ok at any given time, there may be a whole slew of unresolved concerns.<p>So, sometimes, someone with persistent back pain has a pain-danger-alarm system that is working absolutely fine.  The pain system is not damaged.  The pain system a responding to a present understanding of the world that make a person feel not ok &#x2F; not safe &#x2F; in danger of some kind, or to past trauma that a person hasn&#x27;t completely processed, that is still lingering, and making the person feel unsafe.  It&#x27;s a map vs. territory issue, there&#x27;s not &quot;damage&quot; in as much as there is something about the person&#x27;s map that implies something about their current experience is dangerous.<p>Sometimes, when someone&#x27;s pain&#x2F;danger &quot;check engine light&quot; is stuck on, persistently creating pain as if to say &quot;hey something is not quite right&quot; — all that person needs to do is get information that physical pain isn&#x27;t a 1:1 indicator of physical damage, and to not worry about the pain.  Sometimes, they need to address current stresses and past trauma that are making them feel not ok, and then the pain goes away.  Howard Stern talks about a doctor who saved his life by telling him his tissues were fine.  John Stossel got relief from decades of back pain from the same doctor, and profiled him on ABC&#x27;s 2020. That doctor recently passed away, considered a pseudoscientist to the end of his days, and current research is just starting to catch up.  Expect a study in 2020 by Tor Wager, Dr. Howard Schubiner (one of our advisors), and Allan Gordon.<p>If anyone out there needs a white-glove concierge package that can assist you to figure out what&#x27;s driving your pain, and what you will be able to do to solve most nonspecific back pain in a year, book a free trial here: (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;adamjensen&#x2F;trial?month=2020-01\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;adamjensen&#x2F;trial?month=2020-01<\/a>) or check us out at www dot attunecarecoordination dot com."],"time":["2020-01-16 21:49:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["maremp"],"id":[22073435],"kids":{},"parent":[22067972],"text":["Not sure what&#x27;s the full story because it&#x27;s behind a paywall.

It&#x27;s awful. I&#x27;ve been dealing with 2-4 bulging discs and all the back pain symptoms you could dream of. The back issues that I have had have gone from the hamstrings all the way up to the ears - and seems to be different every week.<p>If you do not address your back pain, you will go down hill and it&#x27;s not a fun place to be. Chronic pain leads to suffering and leads to depression. If you don&#x27;t address it, the pain is going to break you. It will become the first thing you think about in the morning and before going to sleep. Take care of yourself!<p>I&#x27;m going to buy and read the 8 Steps to a Pain Free Back book - here are some things that have helped me<p>MASSAGE THERAPY HELPS. MUSCLE RELAXERS HELP.\nEspecially with bulging discs you are likely to experience muscle stiffness (a somewhat natural reaction of the body. Stiff muscles offload weight from the spine... but not a long term solution) The stiffness can be so severe that you will be unable to stretch it or relax it away. Heating pads and ice will not work. I&#x27;ve had erector spinae muscles so stiff that you&#x27;d honestly believe that they&#x27;re bones. You could rub your thumb along them and hear them pop and crack while the tight fibers rub against one another.<p>I was on muscle relaxers for weeks (3x a day, every 8 hours), and those also helped loosen up the muscles, but never fixed the pain. I stopped taking them because their effectiveness was wearing off as I took them longer.<p>Massage therapy has been fantastic to help loosen these up so that I can do other exercises and stretches more effectively. I actually got sick from my first 1 hour session - mild rhabdomyolysis) A good massage therapist will give you tips on how to loosen up and stretch things, as well.<p>I&#x27;ve been able to manage my lower back pain pretty well for a few months now, and recently had a breakthrough with my upper&#x2F;thoracic pain:<p>Lower Back:<p>- Mackenzie method exercises<p>- Hamstring stretches (hamstrings become over developed and tight from sitting)<p>- Glute exercises (strong hamstrings cause weak glutes, and cause the glutes and hamstrings to fire out of order. You need to target the glutes specifically to build them up, relieve the hamstrings and reduce pressure on the back muscles)<p>- I need to find and do more glute&#x2F;hip exercises. I&#x27;ve recently discovered this as a cause.<p>- Hanging from a pull-up bar (spinal decompression)<p>Thoracic:<p>- Foam roller<p>- Upper cross syndrome (any stretch to help this will help)<p>- recent breakthrough: MY THORACIC MIRACLE STRETCH! I recently discovered this and have been doing it a few days. I woke up without thoracic pain for the first time in months <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GcV1Qdt686E&amp;list=LL1B0cQt6-g-pq4RNHVO7Cow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GcV1Qdt686E&amp;list=LL1B0cQt6-g...<\/a> Watch the entire video before doing.
