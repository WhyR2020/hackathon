Decreasing the aerosol size to 3.4 µm resulted in the face shield blocking 68% of the inhalational exposure at 18 in (46 cm) immediately after the cough and 23% over 1–30 min post-cough (during which time the larger aerosol particles had settled out and droplet nuclei had formed and remained airborne so that flow occurred more easily around the edges of the face shield)&quot;<p>Seems like a face shield may be very good protection for a short term exposure - especially combined with a mask. e.g. walking by someone who coughs.<p>It also makes me wonder about a face shield fixed with something to blow filtered air in from the top of the shield. I assume that would make it less likely for air to come around the edges of the mask and possibly be more comfortable than a mask. You could have a shield blowing a constant cool breeze on you.

I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions here. I&#x27;ve also posted a slightly more technical explanation of how the test works and why it can scale here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dtsao&#x2F;status&#x2F;1247642005510873088?s=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dtsao&#x2F;status&#x2F;1247642005510873088?s=21<\/a><p>Edit: Since our site seems to be overwhelmed at the moment, here&#x27;s a recap:<p>We’ve been working hard at BillionToOne on a new COVID-19 test that scales testing to everyone in the US. Our test (1) re-purposes existing infrastructure, (2) eliminates time-consuming RNA extraction, and (3) enables a distributed system for COVID-19 testing.<p>We need 1 million tests per day to end the stay-at-home orders. Schools are still open in Iceland because they test 15x more than the US does, per capita (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;02&#x2F;free-coronavirus-test-anyone-this-country-its-possible&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;02&#x2F;free-coronav...<\/a>).<p>The first thing we figured out is how to run COVID-19 tests on existing automated Sanger sequencers. One sequencer can process up to 3840 samples per day. There are hundreds of sequencers of excess capacity because they were built for the Human Genome Project over 20 years ago.<p>It would take only 2 sequencers to surpass the current test capacity for all of California. There are far more than 2 sequencers in California (some individual labs have 10 or more).<p>We tweaked the protocol so COVID-19 could be detected from sequencing data using linear regression. Basically, we add ~100 copies of a known DNA sequence to help us calculate how much virus nucleic acid is in the specimen. It works just as well as gold-standard RT-qPCR.<p>Lab workflow for COVID-19 testing is traditionally 1. Specimen accessioning, 2. RNA extraction, 3. RT-qPCR 4. Reporting. RNA extraction, in particular, has been a huge bottleneck in terms of reagent shortages and labor-intensiveness.<p>We showed that we can skip RNA extraction entirely without affecting test sensitivity and limit of detection.<p>By skipping RNA extraction and using automated Sanger sequencers, we think we can get to an additional 200,000 samples per day test capacity in existing clinical labs.<p>A distributed system is often the only way to operate at massive scale. A fully distributed system could have different sites and labs responsible for each process and dynamically re-allocate resources based on availability and capacity.<p>The Broad institute COVID-19 lab has already started doing this. They are asking for specimens to be submitted in a standardized tube format and pre-barcoded. They have essentially distributed the specimen accessioning work.<p>Because there is a highly developed service industry for Sanger sequencing with &lt;24 hour turnaround, there is an opportunity to further scale up testing by distributing the work to their (currently) idle sequencers.<p>Distributed testing could scale from 200k to &gt;1 million tests per day, but would require a change in regulations that currently prohibit it.<p>Thanks to the BillionToOne team for pulling this work together! Next step is to start manufacturing test kits and obtain Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. We’re eager to work with clinical Lab Directors and contract kit manufacturers.<p>Edit 2: Link to scientific manuscript: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;07esyehsvfpmllc&#x2F;A%20Highly%20Scalable%20and%20Rapidly%20Deployable%20RNA%20Extraction-Free%20COVID-19%20Assay%20by%20Quantitative%20Sanger%20Sequencing-final.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;07esyehsvfpmllc&#x2F;A%20Highly%20Scala...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-08 00:39:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tbenst"],"id":[22808372],"kids":[22808433,22808642,22808747],"parent":[22808208],"text":["Thanks for your efforts!

I was 18... graduated high school and knew it all. I was going to get a good job, work my way up the ladder, get paid well, and live happily ever after with the girl of my dreams, wherever she was. Yeah... it didn&#x27;t end up like that at all.<p>I hated my job. I wondered why I did it. For the paycheck. Until one day, after 3 years of service with the company, I asked my boss for a raise. He gave me a penny. That day changed my life. I decided to go to college. During my time at college, I studied while I was a security officer on his payroll. I did my job but now I was getting paid to educate myself.<p>Eventually, I&#x27;d move on from that job, work others, live in another country, live in another state, go to college in another state, volunteer in different parts of the world, etc. I had stories to tell about my life, and how all these situations, including the bad ones, helped improve my life, such as working for a tyrant boss -- who helped unleash a hidden talent I had for programming. I will forever not like the man, but what he taught me, helped me stay focused and start a business.<p>Anyways, I eventually became a web designer. I went to school for psychology, which is what I wanted to practice, but I had student loans and no one was hiring, so I applied across the boards of Craigslist, and got a hit for a programming job, hence working for the tyrant boss above, but I was still fascinated with this question: why are some people so passionate about work while others just do their jobs? So I sought to figure it out and even landed my dream job, though it came with a lot of stipulation... almost like selling your soul to the devil.<p>I couldn&#x27;t pursue what I studied in college, which was a cross between social psych and IO psych... so I created the website, which keeps me connected to my passion and continues to improve my skills in web technology. The website has been a compliment to my life. If I had pursued my original goals, I wouldn&#x27;t be making as much as I am making in my field right now. So I keep doing what I do because that pays the bill, but the site keeps me connected.<p>It is 7 years old... millions of visitors from all over the world, and many people understood its mission and have kept it going.. i opened it up for anyone to &quot;confess&quot; .. no way I could have written over 2500 articles, helped evolve it to what it is today.. which is a lot of information about what we&#x27;re all doing at work, both professional and personal articles.<p>So the premise is: Tell me your story of what it is like to go to work as you, why you are there, why you keep going back, etc. I am fasinated with jobs and careers and how people make money. It has since evolved into much more, but that was the start.<p>Life happens... and you just go the direction you feel is the best for you. Sometimes you&#x27;ll make mistakes and have regrets, but it&#x27;s best you do something, then nothing at all. Live for today, hope for tomorrow, reflect on what you really want in your life.<p>Read more about my start here which explains the whole job situation: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confessionsoftheprofessions.com&#x2F;the-opportunity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confessionsoftheprofessions.com&#x2F;the-opportunity&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 06:00:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gautamnarula"],"id":[22800614],"kids":{},"parent":[22800136],"text":["Mine is www.gautamnarula.com (or, if it&#x27;s easier to remember, www.gautam.city, since my name is pronounced &quot;Gotham&quot;!).<p>My elevator pitch: I&#x27;m curious about many different topics and have had some unconventional experiences, and I share them through writing.

I can play Protoss in such a way as to &quot;force&quot; a vulnerability to DT&#x27;s, I can take a micro tactic and tell you how (or whether) it changes things at scale, and I can pick a trope and &quot;compile&quot; it to strategy so that it will be effective in-game.<p>There&#x27;s also a strong focus on Overwatch teamplay, drawing from system dynamics, control theory, and game theory.<p>Would always welcome readers!  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calmongames.wordpress.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calmongames.wordpress.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 16:52:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simplesleeper"],"id":[22800934],"kids":[22802199],"parent":[22800136],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;<\/a><p>I have worked in transport for over 5 years in software and have read most of the technical books in the internal London Underground library.

A lot of this comes from the proprietary nature of it, with NDAs on every corner and technology licensing processes that require months of effort to get access to even the basic documentation.<p>Over the past decade, ever-increasing standardization in the media industry has opened up DRM to a great degree, though much remains in the proprietary domain for legacy reasons. Even though standardization has helped a great deal, it is hard to find human-readable information about DRM. ISO&#x2F;IEC 23001-7:2016 does not make for easy bedtime reading!<p>I have worked in the field for 12 years and was recently motivated to share my knowledge and remove some of the unwarranted mystery from the field. I am currently writing up a new series of articles, to be published starting May, opening up the topic of DRM for a wider audience. You will find them at my website, though right now there are only a few old articles from ancient history there.<p>If you make solutions that aim to provide Hollywood grade content or just think this topic sounds interesting, this upcoming series might be a good introduction to the necessary content security universe for you.

A lot of people blog perhaps once a year, which is why the aggregation is useful.<p>I often blog as a form of longer lived documentation for ideas shared on social media. I&#x27;ll take some of the more inspired posts I&#x27;ve written up on StackExchange or Reddit and repost on my own blog. As I write this I realize I could polish up a few book reviews. In large part my goal is to reduce my role as a digital peasant, generating content for someone else to monetize.<p>I also blog as a low effort low cost homelab. Learn how to write CSS, learn how to use Jinja templates, learn how to write Chef and Terraform. Learn how work within constraints, to optimize results without straying beyond the free tiers. Learn how AdSense works, how referral systems work. The blog provides a platform for motivated experimentation, so even though I have yet to get my AdSense check, it&#x27;s proved valuable as a professional experience.<p>It&#x27;s also an exercise in hubris. I found out last week that my blog had been offline, and that system that I had set in place for monitoring that was also offline. Pingdom cancelled their free service and it seems I ignored their warning emails. And it seems that Chef, which is responsible for keeping services up, itself stopped working, presumably due to memory pressures from working within the free tier. A self inflicted wound really, since I know this happens and chose to live with the consequences."],"time":["2020-04-07 18:09:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["squeakynick"],"id":[22803375],"kids":{},"parent":[22800136],"text":["I write about math, coding, and general geekery in a style similar to Martin Gardner. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagenetics.com&#x2F;blog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagenetics.com&#x2F;blog.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 16:15:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nfrankel"],"id":[22802915],"kids":{},"parent":[22800136],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.frankel.ch&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.frankel.ch&#x2F;<\/a> aka a Java Geek<p>Mainly Java as I was a Java developer when I started\nNow a lot of Kotlin, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Testing, ..."],"time":["2020-04-07 15:17:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bor0"],"id":[22801831],"kids":{},"parent":[22800136],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bor0.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bor0.wordpress.com<\/a><p>I blog about math and programming.

A reasonably solid understanding of what the data could and couldn&#x27;t do. What can we actually expect our data to achieve? What does it do well? What does it do poorly? Will we need to add other data sets? Propagate new data? How will we get or generate that data?<p>2. The business case or user problem was understood up front. In our most successful project, we saw users continuously miscategorized items on input and built a model to make recommendations. It greatly improved the efficacy of our ingested user data.<p>3. Break it into small chunks and wins. Promising a mega-model that will do all the things is never a good way to deliver aspirational data goals. Little model wins were celebrated regularly and we found homes and utility for those wins in our codebase along the way.<p>4. Make is accessible to other members of the company. We always ensure our models have an API that can be accessed by any other services in our ecosystem, so other feature teams can tap into data science work.

Someone else&#x27;s experience could be totally different.  You have to know what to look for and what to avoid.  If you&#x27;re trying to find a DS job, one of your top priorities is finding out what the actual job consists of.  For instance, a Data Scientist at Facebook might be called a Data Analyst at many other places--no modeling required.<p>I know this because I&#x27;ve been on that journey.  But there&#x27;s no reason to expect some department head that&#x27;s never been exposed to DS to know this.  They just copy&#x2F;paste some other company&#x27;s job req.  If you&#x27;re more junior, here are my tips:<p>- If it&#x27;s a &quot;new DS team&quot; that supports a variety of teams:  beware.  Bolt-on DS doesn&#x27;t work well, as it&#x27;s really hard to build a meaningful solution that&#x27;s not deeply integrated.<p>- If it&#x27;s an old company or in a conservative industry:  beware.  There are likely to be data silos and difficult ownership models that make it nearly impossible to get and join the data you need.<p>- If it&#x27;s a small company:  beware.  You&#x27;re likely going to need a broad set of knowledge that&#x27;s won with several years of experience to be able to build end-to-end solutions that are integrated into the rest of the tech stack.<p>- If it&#x27;s not an engineering-driven culture:  beware.  DS will often be used to provide evidence to someone else whose already made up their mind and pretend they&#x27;re being data-driven, and you&#x27;ll be the disrespected nerd that&#x27;s expected to do what it takes to deliver the answer they want.  Most companies claim to be &quot;data-driven&quot;, few are, and even fewer understand data-driven isn&#x27;t always possible or desirable.<p>Industry is still trying to figure out how to use ML and are still learning that it&#x27;s not as easy as hiring someone that knows about all the algorithms, but rather it takes deep technological changes to data infrastructure to enable the datasets that can then be used by the ML experts.  But you don&#x27;t have to be the person that helps them figure this out the hard way (i.e. by being paid to not accomplish much due to problems outside of your control).

But my trajectory was slightly different - from being the only &quot;data science guy&quot; in 2016, to now leading an autonomous team of four, with quarterly meetings with the CEO, and monthly meetings with our tech leadership. I decide tech stack, workflow, and hiring. Execs decide priorities. Sure, some of it was dumb luck, some of it was actually having a CEO that cares about data strategy, but I like to think at least some of it was me.<p>So here&#x27;s what I think I did right:<p>1. Provide indisputable, obvious business value every month. You should consider yourself an in-house consultant to whichever cost center your salary is drawn from. If you&#x27;re product development, prove value to them. If you&#x27;re operations, or sales, or marketing, prove value to them. After about two months, you should be able to justify your existence in two sentences. Just remember, most of your company probably thinks of you as a optional add-on.<p>Your first few projects should attack high-impact pain points with the simplest solutions possible. My first projects were basically ETL into some basic regression into a dashboard. No machine learning required. But it was better then what they had (which was often nothing), and it was STABLE and RELIABLE. And that leads to the next point...<p>2. Build trust. With my dead-simple models, nothing ever blew up, there were no nonsensical answers, and there wasn&#x27;t much brittleness when new categorical features or more cardinality was added. It mostly just worked. And that built my reputation for me. They didn&#x27;t have to understand what was going on in the model, but they knew, from experience, that they could trust the result. Once I had the credibility, I could start building more complex, more elaborate models, and asked them to trust those as well. If they don&#x27;t trust your models, then no business value has been created, and your job is worthless.<p>3. Recognize that data science is being done everywhere in the organization, and respect it. Every department has someone who has built a monster spreadsheet that contains more embedded domain knowledge then you could hope to learn in a month. As data scientists, we like to think that we&#x27;re helping the organization by building critical metrics to improve performance. But here&#x27;s the catch. If the metric was truly critical, someone has built it already. It might be ad-hoc, use poor-methodology, and be somewhat wrong, but it works and is good enough. You have to find that person, learn from them, and improve on it.<p>4. Be as self-contained as possible. Ideally, your critical path should not depend on other teams doing things for you (except for IT setting up data access). You should be able to do it all. From front-end dashboards, to ETL, to DevOps. Remember, you&#x27;re an in-house consultancy. You should be able to take problems and just handle them, rather then be a perpetual bother and distraction to other teams.<p>There&#x27;s more, but if you do these four things, I think you can build the reputation in your company for creating useful, accurate data tools that help other people do their jobs better. After that&#x27;s achieved, people will breaking down your door to get your help. That&#x27;s where my team is now - we&#x27;ve got a backlog for at least 18 months, with our work priorities often being set directly by the CEO."],"time":["2020-04-08 03:59:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simonkafan"],"id":[22807966],"kids":{},"parent":[22806434],"text":["My feeling is that a lot of companies think: &quot;We need a data scientist because all the big players also have one!&quot;<p>In fact, they actually don&#x27;t need a data scientist.

Now what outputs to make?  The first cut, decades ago, was linear programming, and IBM sold some big blue boxes for that.  More recently the work has been nonlinear programming.<p>(3) The rumors are, and I believe some of them, that linear programming is just accepted, used everyday, in mixing animal feed.<p>No surprise and common enough, IMHO what really talks is money.  If can save significant bucks and clearly demonstrate that, then can be taken seriously.<p>But from 50,000 feet up, tough to get rich saving money for others.

The crucial enabling core of what I&#x27;m doing has some advanced pure math and some applied math I derived.  Users won&#x27;t be aware of anything mathematical.  But if users really like the site, then it will be mostly because of the math.  So, it&#x27;s some math -- not really statistics, operations research, optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or management science -- it&#x27;s just some math.  The research libraries have rows and rows of racks of math; I&#x27;m using some of it and have derived some more.<p>Generally I found that the best customer for math is US national security, especially near DC.  E.g., now some people are building models to predict the growth of COVID-19.  Likely the core of that work is continuous time, discrete state space Markov processes, maybe subordinated to Poisson processes.  Okay:  One of  the military projects I did was to evaluate the survivability of the US SSBN (ballistic missile firing submarines) under a special scenario of global nuclear war limited to sea -- a continuous time, discrete state space Markov process subordinated to a Poisson process.  Another project was to measure the power spectra of ocean waves and, then, generate sample paths with that power spectrum -- for some submarines.  There was some more applied math in nonlinear game theory of nuclear war.<p>Here&#x27;s some applied math, curiously also related to the COVID-19 pandemic:  Predict revenue for FedEx.  So, for time t, let y(t) be the revenue per day at time t.  Let b be the total market.  Assume growth via <i>virality<\/i>, i.e., word of mouth advertising from current customers communicating with remaining target customers.  So, ..., get the simple first order differential equation, for some k,<p>y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))<p>where\nthe solution is the logistic curve which can also be applied to make predictions for epidemics.  This little puppy pleased the FedEx BoD and saved the company.  Now, what was that, data science, AI, ML, OR, MS, optimization?  Nope -- just some applied math.<p>I have high hopes for the importance, relevance, power, fortunes from applied math, but can&#x27;t pick good applications like apples from a three."],"time":["2020-04-08 03:44:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tibyat"],"id":[22809619],"kids":{},"parent":[22806434],"text":["tldr \nOP has been raised by television to believe that one day he&#x27;d be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars and data science gurus, but he won&#x27;t and he’s slowly learning that fact. and he’s very very pissed off.<p>you mean you didn’t realize “data scientist” is just a sexed up “statistician”?<p>sorry you got hyped into shelling out for some bootcamp..."],"time":["2020-04-08 04:53:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["greatjack613"],"id":[22805366],"kids":[22805962,22805535,22806898,22805471],"parent":[22788584],"text":["&gt; It’s kernel-based which reduces attack surface and can be ran in virtually any device.<p>Excuse my ignorance, but can someone explain why a kernel based networking stack has less of an attack surface then a user-space based stack?<p>I mean logically user-space should be more secure no?"],"time":["2020-04-07 19:27:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["e12e"],"id":[22805778],"kids":[22807944,22808919],"parent":[22788584],"text":["Hm.

Another project called Compound took Dai and used it without asking anyone at Maker to create automatic loans where you can put in money and get interest automatically.

Placebo response is notoriously high in depression studies, so it&#x27;s unacceptable that they didn&#x27;t include a control group.<p>This technique is a variant of rTMS, which has been around for a long time. We&#x27;ve had years of positive rTMS study results that failed to replicate in real-world conditions. There&#x27;s some early evidence that it might do something positive, but it&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;s a viable treatment option. In most major cities you can usually find at least one obscure rTMS clinic somewhere, but they won&#x27;t offer the exact rTMS technique studied here. They also won&#x27;t give you 50 sessions across 5 days as used in this study.<p>It&#x27;s very disappointing, even suspicious, that they didn&#x27;t include a control group. It&#x27;s trivially easy to include a sham rTMS treatment because the patients can&#x27;t see the magnetic field. At minimum, they could have split the group into low-dose and high-dose to demonstrate a dose-response relationship. Yet they deliberately chose to avoid any control group or dose-response measurements.<p>I can&#x27;t access the full text, so I don&#x27;t know when they measured the patients&#x27; depressive symptoms. If they scored the depression inventory on the final day of the 5-day treatment, this wouldn&#x27;t be very promising as a long-term treatment. The real test would be how the depression remission holds up after the rTMS treatment is discontinued. If the remission persists for months, that would be truly impressive. On the other hand, if this only works with 50 in-office rTMS sessions per week, it&#x27;s not a practical outpatient treatment.<p>I would love to be wrong and for this to be the holy grail of depression treatment, but given the circumstances I think it&#x27;s best interpreted as an outlier study unless&#x2F;until someone else reproduces it.

The recruitment of students is predatory and eventually the saturation of subpar graduates from these university degrees would have eventually resulted in the fading of both cultural and brand name prestige of sending your kids to Australia for study.

You&#x27;re paying 150-250k worth of access to an F1, CPT, OPT, a more streamlined path into the H-1B world, followed by permanent residency. You get to work for a US employer for a few years without having to bother with the lottery, while also applying to an H-1B at the same time. I believe this is most viable in the STEM degrees.

The current model which Tony Blair in effect started and David Cameron completed removed this cap, and so opened the way for the current growth race.<p>Whether a university can survive under the new model, or even be better off than before without increasing student numbers depends on many things including the amount and kind of reasearch income, the proportion of international students they have and whether they&#x27;re city-centre or campus-based. I would say most UK universities were faced with a choice between masively increasing student numbers or massively cutting expenditure to survive - lots of them seem to be doing a combination of both, which is one reason we&#x27;ve seen so many staff strikes this year. At least in several decent (Russell Group) universities that I know a bit about personally, it was very much a case of we have to grow by x% a year just to carry on paying our staff and bills. At least in the UK, I make a case that it&#x27;s not just greedy unis and fat cat vice-chancellors driving this problem.<p>To give some numbers - the fees for home undergraduates are capped at £9250 a year and in a science or engineering degree with high equipment costs, it&#x27;s hard to break even on these fees.

Without going into specific criticism of western secondary school education, the broad point is most countries just don&#x27;t produce enough talent to fill demand. Also credentialism and educational inflation means many masters programs bend over backwards not to fail anyone. At least among my cohort who spans many types of masters and professional degrees, you get proportionally more unqualified locals getting pushed out of the program with just passing grades as foreign students who bought their way through. There seems to be pervasive pressure to hold graduation metric up because most people recognize, outside of some fields, what you learn is rarely applicable to what you do. And even fields where theres overlap, you have too much unqualified people getting the pass. Regardless, my point is, if we need to acquire talent, hedging against rich international students isn&#x27;t the worst bet. The odds are overwhelmingly in the house favour. They pay you. Some of them are slackers, but many also received the best education from their home countries but can&#x27;t make it to the top 1% cut off to enter extremely competitive and prestigious local institutions. Foreign students wanting to pour guaranteed money and potential talent into our society is something to be optimized for.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www150.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;n1&#x2F;pub&#x2F;81-599-x&#x2F;2016011&#x2F;c-g&#x2F;c-g02-eng.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www150.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;n1&#x2F;pub&#x2F;81-599-x&#x2F;2016011&#x2F;c-g&#x2F;c-g...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 11:32:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["twomoretime"],"id":[22804620],"kids":[22808308],"parent":[22799499],"text":["This is quickly spreading into the corporate sector.

Our team was formed because of the extremely high cost in dollars and time that IS&amp;T wanted to charge to develop some fairly straightforward tools. My team was taken from the departments that used the tools, and we developed things that were very custom-fit to what those departments needed.<p>Eventually politics overcame us, and IS&amp;T finally managed to take over our team. We all became contractors in order to support the migration to their infrastructure, and continue development of the tools. A bit later we all became fired as our project was outsourced to contractors in India, managed by IS&amp;T PMs who had no idea what our tool was used for and had never been inside a retail store.
