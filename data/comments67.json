This topic is a bigger deal than it seems to be perceived as. The responses here are exactly what they should be to any huge development:<p>&quot;why should this exist?&quot;<p>&quot;isn&#x27;t this our responsibility?&quot;<p>&quot;this is the parents&#x27; fault&quot;<p>&quot;people should get this from their friends&quot;<p>&quot;think of the children!&quot;<p>It sounds like how people concerned about radio, television, videogames, computers, and smart phones attacked those technological advances that carried with them huge societal impacts. While those may even be correct assessments and valid critiques, they are not effective arguments to stop use.<p>Conversational interfaces are not just a way to access information; they&#x27;re a (perhaps horribly stilted) way to introspect and fulfill our basic need to socialize. We as a society often lament our lack of socialization and our increased isolation from each other, and the right answer here might be &quot;prevent that isolation&quot;, but the easy answer may be &quot;put a band-aid on it&quot;. This is a very powerful band-aid and a tough genie to put back into the bottle.<p>Imagine a world where you aren&#x27;t lonely. You can talk to a variety of personalities about problems you have, about things you want to learn, about ideas and thoughts and fears. You can talk to something that&#x27;s receptive, something that&#x27;s combative, something that strives to motivate you, something that strives to soothe you. You could talk to a crowd of them, talk to them while playing games together, ask them about the news of the day, or anything. You can talk to someone new everyday, or one great friend for your entire life. They&#x27;re always there and willing to listen, willing to engage. They never get angry at you or sick of you.<p>That kind of capability might save a lot of lonely people from taking a lot of horrible actions that are driven primarily by loneliness. It also sounds like a horrific dystopian rejection of our real, basic social bonds. But, maybe fixing those for real is a bridge too far!<p>Of course this specific product&#x2F;idea is not &quot;the thing&quot; that brings those capabilities to the masses (it has pretty strong limitations), but it looks surprisingly polished and capable, and it&#x27;s a very specific wedge into the space. It might get rejected today for being creepy (see: google glass), or it might get rejected for just not really being ready (see: google glass), and kids might just hate it.

This includes investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, less efficient process paths that better allow for effective social distancing, higher wages for hourly teams, and hundreds of millions to develop our own COVID-19 testing capabilities<p>This seems huge.

Had Jeff and MacKenzie not gotten divorced in the recent past, Jeff would presently be listed right at about $200 billion today. As it is, Jeff is up to $150 billion and MacKenzie is at $50 billion. Jeff is nearly worth as much as Warren Buffett &amp; Mark Zuckerberg combined (#4 and #5).

However, logically only some split of that $100b should be exclusively credited to him, as he was of course married to Melinda, whereas Jeff is worth $150b alone. By contrast, Rockefeller was likely never worth more than $25 to $50 billion (inflation adjusted; at his peak it&#x27;s thought he might have approached $2b in his day; the historical record is certain he crossed $1b; the reasonable inflation adjustment back to the 1920s and 1930s is anywhere from 20x to 30x depending on how aggressive you want to be).<p>(ignore the stupid, yet persistent claims that Rockefeller would be worth $300-$400 billion today as an adjustment; those claims are not using any manner of proper inflation adjustment; instead, that&#x27;s based on taking Rockefeller&#x27;s wealth as a percentage of the US economy at the time, and then doing the same thing for the US economy today (eg if his wealth equaled 1.5% of GDP in 1928 or 1937, then 1.5% today would be $330b), a complete non-sense approach for numerous obvious reasons)"],"time":["2020-05-01 01:24:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foxknox"],"id":[23042326],"kids":{},"parent":[23036486],"text":["All the speculators saying Amazon should be making big from covid might be feeling a little low today."],"time":["2020-05-01 16:31:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dzonga"],"id":[23038003],"kids":[23038981],"parent":[23036486],"text":["aws is straight printing money. &amp; will likely continue to do so for many quarters to come. $10bn revenue for the qtr."],"time":["2020-05-01 02:44:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GoodJokes"],"id":[23039036],"kids":{},"parent":[23036486],"text":["lol all of you that believe this"],"time":["2020-05-01 06:07:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["ogre_codes"],"id":[23032194],"kids":[23032360],"parent":[23030920],"text":["There is a pretty big disparity between these numbers and the optimism in the stock market.

Its most famous practitioners often don&#x27;t have any medical training or background, e.g. Prof Ferguson who did his PhD in theoretical physics. The assumptions it uses are of the level of medical complexity that a small child can understand - essentially that people who spend time close to each other infect each other. The models don&#x27;t take as input the molecular biology or DNA of a virus that&#x27;s being simulated.<p>Arguably it&#x27;s not science. A basic characteristic of science is that it tells us something new about the world, something that can be proven true. Experiments are fundamental to science for that reason. Epidemiology is about the development of models. Models aren&#x27;t science because they cannot ever tell us something truly new or unexpected: a model is ultimately just a rendering of its author&#x27;s assumptions. When someone puts some formulas into R and copies the results into a paper, the model is acting as a kind of fancy PowerPoint. It&#x27;s useful to illustrate the conclusions that follow from the assumptions, but it no more lets us discover new things than PowerPoint does.<p>(n.b. Under this definition, a lot of what gets published as computer science also isn&#x27;t science but rather engineering. &quot;Data science&quot; on the other hand is a tautology. That&#x27;s a fine conclusion and one I&#x27;ll happily defend.)<p>It often gets described as mathematics. It&#x27;s not mathematics any more than economics or coding a search engine is mathematics. Mathematicians publish new theorems and proofs. The maths they develop may be of theoretical interest or it may find applicability in other fields, but it ultimately stands alone. Epidemiologists use maths as a part of their work but so do many other people.<p>As far as I can tell the field that resembles epidemiology most closely is actually video game programming. The models epidemiologists vary in their approach, but the most advanced ones attempt to simulate society by simulating the interactions between people. That&#x27;s why they can take into account things like school closures or novel social policies. 3Blue1Brown has done a good video where he implements an epidemiological model:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs<\/a><p>One of the top comments is <i>&quot;I&#x27;m a professional epidemiologist (generally focusing on modelling livestock diseases) and I&#x27;m angry at how amazingly good your graphics are compared to anything I&#x27;ve come up with!&quot;<\/i> - so what&#x27;s being done in that video isn&#x27;t much different to what they do.<p>If you play Cities: Skylines then you actually end up running an epidemiological model, because the inhabitants of your city are all simulated individually. They can get sick and die, they can overwhelm hospitals or even the road networks between them. For instance put a water intake pipe too near to a sewage outlet and you&#x27;ll have mass disease pretty quickly.<p>After watching epidemiologists flame each other in public for the last month, disagree on basically everything, constantly make unfalsifiable claims, have their few falsifiable predictions be indeed proven false and repeatedly publish papers through news outlets, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this field structurally has no way to resolve disagreements or improve itself. The epidemiological models being presented by places like Imperial or University of Washington are no more reliable now than they were 20 years ago for the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK. How can a field not get even slightly more accurate over a period of 20 years? Well, because there&#x27;s no incentive to. Like academic economists they&#x27;re rewarded for publishing papers, not being correct.<p>The &quot;men working in tech&quot; this comment so snottily dresses down differ from epidemiologists in some crucial ways. Many of them will work with data in a context where being wrong will ultimately inflict financial damage on themselves and their coworkers, or even crater their startup. Their ability to work with data correctly matters to them in ways it doesn&#x27;t really matter to academics, whose jobs are perfectly safe even in this time of mass unemployment and furloughs. Given the total failure of academics to correctly predict real epidemics, I hope we see way more such men bring outside views to what is otherwise a small and stagnant field."],"time":["2020-04-30 17:31:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rumanator"],"id":[23028024],"kids":[23028071],"parent":[23027487],"text":["Some of your complaints lack credibility.<p>For starters, I find it odd that you claim that the recruiter gave you feedback, and on the technical skills of all things.

Then g() pushed R11, because it was going to have its own variable to stash there, and then created space for its stack variables.  And one of those variables was smashing the stack by 4 bytes, over-writing the saved flag value from f().<p>Worse, the way the stack was getting smashed was on a call to mesgrecv().  This takes a pointer to a structure and a size, but the relationship between the two isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d expect.

I would run the tests, but some days they would crash in the middle of the night.   Then the California guys would be angry that they got no tests results.   I started debugging the code and got to a program called lswalk that would dole out jobs to the dozens of servers to be &#x27;run&#x27;.

I got the source code and started looking for problems and one thing I found was that if one of the servers resplonding with error the code would print out an error message.   One problem though... The error string printed had an uninitialized string, so that when the printf routine would search for an end of string that was never there, probably overwriting buffers and crashing code all over the place.

Ofcourse this tiny little addition could never cause any breakage, so this was released as a semver bugfix release.<p>The commit time shows it was 23:00 local time (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;goldenice&#x2F;ember-cli-babel&#x2F;commit&#x2F;c4c95d6f1637bfb8988f68dcacbaa436c6eb94bb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;goldenice&#x2F;ember-cli-babel&#x2F;commit&#x2F;c4c95d6f...<\/a>) when I figured the problem out and committed a fix. So I submit a PR to the library, figuring that if the author happens to be awake I won&#x27;t have to figure out a way to pin the dependency to an earlier version (which would have been easy in a regular dependency, but this was a global dependency, where it&#x27;s not as trivial as switching from npm 2.x or 3.x to yarn)<p>The author thankfully responds almost immediately, asking me to provide a fallback to console.warn instead of skipping the deprecation entirely. Makes sense, so I update my PR, submit it within a few minutes, and I see that the author immediately publishes a new version. Finally something works out for me. Or so I thought.<p>As it turns out the author made a tiny stylistic fix in my code. Except that tiny stylistic fix butchers my carefully crafted if statement, and now the code is broken again. It took me a while to figure out that the new version of the dependency WAS being used, but was also broken.<p>So I contact the author again, explain the situation. They changed the code immediately, pushing out another update. In the meantime I figured out how to do dependency pinning and all was well with the world again.<p>And that kids, is the story of how I came to appreciate transitive dependency pinning as a really useful feature.<p>(It&#x27;s still amazing to me by the way that I can contact somebody that wrote some random code that our code happens to rely on and get a response within half an hour.)"],"time":["2020-04-30 16:59:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nickcw"],"id":[23017388],"kids":[23017501,23017589,23017594,23018714,23021184,23021077,23020452,23020326,23021255,23020723,23017427,23019461,23021741,23017499],"parent":[23017160],"text":["I think that the problem here was that they were fighting against Conway&#x27;s Law: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conway%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conway%27s_law<\/a><p>&gt; Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#x27;s communication structure.<p>I think microservices work well in organizations that are big enough to have a team per microservice.

It&#x27;s not. You can find similar debates about how to chop up software ever since people moved beyond just having their code ship in punch card form.<p>The right discussion to have would be first deciding whether you want to break down by your logical architecture so that your deployment architecture reflects that or your organization diagram (aka. Conway&#x27;s law). Then the next step is deciding whether your primary goal is network isolation of unrelated chunks of code or enabling asynchronous development of these chunks of code (if so, there are other solutions). Usually it boils down to, again, Conway&#x27;s law: different teams just don&#x27;t want their stuff to depend on shit happening in another team because of internal bureaucracy and hassle.<p>Now say you have a valid business reason or technical reason for actually wanting to have different stuff be isolated (e.g. for scaling reasons or security reasons). The next step is deciding whether this means you also want to break up your code base. Monorepos and microservices are a thing. Look at e.g. lerna for node.js, or multi module gradle projects on the jvm. In Go this is well supported as well. If you&#x27;re really sure that you don&#x27;t want micro services because of Conway&#x27;s law there are lots of valid reasons for having a well structured mono repo with a bit of reuse of shared functionality, a simplified review process and more visibility in what is happening.<p>IMHO people do this for completely the wrong reasons; like wanting to try out some new language, organizational issues, etc. that ultimately result in fragmented code bases, lots of devops overhead and complexity (it&#x27;s never simple or cheap), lots of project management overhead, etc. You pay a price."],"time":["2020-04-29 18:30:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kkapelon"],"id":[23017615],"kids":[23017767,23017937,23018992,23017708,23017644,23025046,23018406,23017829],"parent":[23017160],"text":["&gt;Shared libraries were created to provide behavior that was similar for all workers.

Most software is not great. If you expect the exception to be the rule you&#x27;re setting yourself up for a career full of disappointment.<p>Microservices are a modern re-branding of service-oriented architecture, but &#x27;microservices&#x27; sounds cuter and less like it belongs in Java-land, and there&#x27;s some theoretical idea that splitting your app into even smaller pieces will somehow make the whole thing better.<p>SOA&#x2F;microservices solves a few problems and introduces a great many. The original SOA proponents were pretty explicit about this. Beware! There be dragons here! But one of the main pieces of prescriptive advice from domain driven design is helpful for splitting into distributed services: split along domain lines with minimum inter-service dependencies. Payments is an obvious one. Microservices seems to buck much of this advice in favor for a blissfully ignorant principle of &quot;small&quot; or &quot;isolated&quot;. Good luck isolating something that is not meant to be isolated.<p>Scaling software is hard. Scaling teams is harder. Trying to scale teams by scaling&#x2F;distributing software is an understandable goal but extremely hard to pull off because of additional complexities and costs you incur in doing so. Dev gets harder, deployment&#x2F;ops becomes harder, testing becomes harder. Cross-team communication, documentation, API publishing and adherence goes from being very low impact within an org to suddenly being critically important.<p>To do SOA&#x2F;microservices effectively you need complete organizational buy-in, and you have to commit completely to developing tooling and solving all the associated problems in moving to a services approach. Often, it&#x27;s easier to just put it all back together, organize the code in such a way to minimize merge conflicts and wait for the ungodly slow test suite to run in CI. There are good reasons you rarely hear SOA&#x2F;microservices success stories outside of enormous companies (Netflix, Facebook, Google, Amazing, etc).

By existence proof, that was clearly never the case at Segment. The common fallacy seems to be that microservices lead to better software via better architecture, regardless of human factors like team size. My sense is that it&#x27;s the opposite: microservices are a necessary evil to scale teams past a certain size due to the bottlenecks that emerge with monoliths as more people begin trying to make changes simultaneously, and should be viewed as neutral at best in terms of a software architecture pattern to increase reliability, performance, etc. In practice, it seems wise to keep your engineering team as small as possible for many reasons, one large one of which is that past a certain point you will be forced to move to microservices. All other things being equal, that&#x27;s a move you don&#x27;t want to ever have to make.<p>If you have hundreds of engineers then certainly microservice architecture starts to make sense, since even the idea of transactional deploys of the monolith break down due to queuing at that scale. But jeeze, don&#x27;t pull that trigger until you actually find yourself backing up on necessary complexity like deploy queues, PRs stuck due to inability to maintain the branch given the velocity of master, etc. Don&#x27;t let Conways law lead you prematurely to microservices. If I&#x27;m ever in a position where I am feeling real pain that leads to an urgency for microservices, I am probably going to first ask the question if I can just fire some people to make the problem go away. The risk of the transition to microservices is just that high.<p>It&#x27;s the same rule of thumb with other things like hiring, feature roadmaps, etc: YAGNI. If you are hiring someone before the pain is so high the work cannot be done otherwise, building features before you have people explicitly showing the need for them, or making deep, cross cutting architectural changes that impact everyone before they are strictly necessary due to concrete problems with shipping software, you&#x27;re probably choosing the wrong use of opportunity cost, capital, etc."],"time":["2020-04-29 18:08:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ChrisMarshallNY"],"id":[23017471],"kids":[23018508,23017904,23017514],"parent":[23017160],"text":["This sounds like the old arguments about OOP.<p>Turning everything into an object can make a small program into a big program, so it’s maybe not such a good idea for small-scale stuff.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solipsys.co.uk&#x2F;new&#x2F;TheParableOfTheToaster.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solipsys.co.uk&#x2F;new&#x2F;TheParableOfTheToaster.html<\/a><p>However, in my experience, OOP made it possible to do really big stuff.<p>It’s all about not having a “one-size-fits-all” approach.

Consult a doctor and don&#x27;t take too much, since it&#x27;s fat soluble and can build up to toxic levels in your system; also, since it is fat soluble, make sure your diet has enough good fats to help absorb it (guacamole and olive oil are two of my favorite supplementary foods with vitamin D)."],"time":["2020-04-30 04:49:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cogman10"],"id":[23023837],"kids":[23023871],"parent":[23023703],"text":["Does make me wonder how much of this is VDI and how much of this is the general population having VDI."],"time":["2020-04-29 22:28:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MattSteelblade"],"id":[23024339],"kids":[23024549],"parent":[23023703],"text":["I think it&#x27;s worth pointing out the conclusion in their abstract and what the authors are trying to accomplish: &quot;...we suggest that prospective, randomized controlled studies of VDI in COVID-19 patients are warranted.&quot;"],"time":["2020-04-29 23:10:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crazygringo"],"id":[23024553],"kids":{},"parent":[23023703],"text":["I don&#x27;t doubt this at all.<p>But at the same time, isn&#x27;t it suspected that vitamin D insufficiency is linked with a worse immune system generally?<p>(Anecdotally it made a big difference for me not getting winter colds ever since my doctor pointed out I had a significant wintertime deficiency and I started supplementing.)<p>In other words, there&#x27;s unlikely to be any unique link between vitamin D and COVID-19.

The IOM is to blame for this, and a heated debate amongst researchers.<p>I won&#x27;t go into full detail on that, but Vitamin D is a critical precursor and reactant in many vital metabolic reactions, my personal concentration was in inducing apoptosis in certain cancer cells with calcitriol, EB 1089, CB 1093, and p53. My proposals were rejected for Independent Studies and I never undertook it in the lab, unfortunately.<p>&gt; Unfortunately the daily recommended value was established erroneously and should be much higher.

As incentives and mechanisms for others to agree to host your content (aka pinning in ipfs) are not there, this is hard to fix.<p>- integration with existing centralized solutions is kind of meh&#x2F;barely supported. We actually looked at using s3 as store for ipfs just so we could onboard customers and give them some decent SLA (bandwidth would be another issue for that). There are some fringe projects on github implementing this but when we looked at it the smallish blocksizes in ipfs are kind of a non starter for using this at scale (think insane numbers of requests to s3). This stuff is not exactly mainstream. Obviously this wouldn&#x27;t be needed if we could incentivize others to &#x27;pin&#x27; content.

They&#x27;re okay for low-value simple stuff that doesn&#x27;t have much of an intrinsic bounty attached to it (like BitTorrent magnets), but trying to put a &quot;decentralized web&quot; on top of a DHT seems like a scenario where the instant it becomes popular it will get completely shredded for profit (spam, stealing Bitcoin, etc.).<p>My rule of thumb is that anything designed for serious or large scale use (in other words that might get popular) needs to be built to withstand either a &quot;nation state level attacker&quot; threat model or a &quot;Zerg rush of hundreds of thousands of profit motivated black hats&quot; threat model.

But in reality, the model often matters less than infrastructure&#x2F;latency&#x2F;system&#x2F;data issues.<p>In addition to that, people who are actually &quot;good&quot; at trading don&#x27;t publish papers, they silently make money. Papers are typically published by academics or students who have never built anything profitable but would like to put a paper on their resume. I have yet to see a single good academic paper about trading.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tradientblog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;lessons-learned-building-an-ml-trading-system-that-turned-5k-into-200k&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tradientblog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;lessons-learned-buildin...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-29 21:38:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lordnacho"],"id":[23023765],"kids":[23023988],"parent":[23022864],"text":["Former hedge fund and HFT quant trader here. There&#x27;s a lot of papers to be found claiming some sort of strategy. I don&#x27;t want to go to cynicism immediately. But we&#x27;ll get there:<p>- Trading isn&#x27;t just about deciding what to buy and sell, the sexy part that everyone thinks is great. I even had colleagues who thought they were special because they worked closer to the strategies, which meant that certain less glamourous parts were neglected.<p>- Less glamourous parts like coding the software to read in the market data and send out orders.<p>- Less glamourous parts like schmoozing with brokers to get them to lower your costs.<p>- And maintaining infrastructure, which somehow people think should come as part of coding.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying that RL won&#x27;t help you. It&#x27;s just that focusing on the &quot;intelligent&quot; part of the trading system tends to lead to disappointment, as you discover some unknown restrictions on your model that you hadn&#x27;t thought of. Things like when you find out short selling was prohibited during the period that your model backtest was shorting.<p>My main red flags when reading papers are:<p>- Choosing a dataset from a small market. Basically any market that isn&#x27;t the US or Western Europe large caps. You&#x27;ll discover both price impact and high fees quite late in the game.<p>- Choosing a very small subset of the market. Smaller n, more noise and overfitting.<p>- Short periods. N again.<p>- Long intervals between decision making. N again again.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there&#x27;s nothing useful to be read though.

But (to an extent) they are also necessary.<p>In the Western US fire used to be a regular occurrence. Natives would start fires, lighting would start fires, they would burn until they ran out of fuel and burn out. But this kept forests healthy. There used to be more bigger stronger pine trees and less undergrowth. Somewhere along the line it was decided fire was bad and we were going to set up fire towers and stop fires with maximum effort.<p>Which was all good, until it doesn&#x27;t work and we simply can&#x27;t because there is too much built up fuel and the fire rages out of control completely destroying the forest. The previous fires, while more regular, were smaller because the amount of fuel never accumulated to the levels it does with modern fire suppression methods.<p>In this analogy we&#x27;ve somehow decided that we are going to stop people from experiencing economic pain at all costs. This is humanistic. And we want things to keep growing and we don&#x27;t want to see destruction. But what happens is a lot of trash builds up. Malinvestment. Corruption. Paper profits over actual production. Unlimited credit spent on consumer items. No personal savings. No problem, firemen Uncle Sam and the Federal Reserve are here to save the day! And no one can argue with this happening because who wants to see anyone get burned through no fault of their own?<p>But (just to torture the analogy) what I suspect will eventually happen is enough malinvestment, corruption and lack of responsible behavior will build up they won&#x27;t be able to put the fire out. No one will. And it will burn the system flat to the ground instead of just clearing out a little brush and giving space to strong trees.<p>This isn&#x27;t to suggest the government shouldn&#x27;t help in this case.

Mostly driven by low interest rates, which have been kept low as a way to manage currency value as a way to manage inflation.  That along with any crash saw people with high interest rates as much larger and quicker to drive an economic crash with debts.  Though mostly, to drive consumer spending so GDP looks good and the perception helps that countries credit rating.  Making them able to borrow more for even less.  Consumers with no incentive to save, buy more, borrow more, everything looks nice.<p>But of course there is more to it than that, but the whole drive towards lower interest rates has over the decades bestowed a culture more included to think short-term and deal with the long-term later and enjoy the sun. This has permeated in many forms and creates what I would call a false economy.<p>So after the moore&#x27;s law of interest rates started to hit a limit as they could not shrink any lower, they invented QE, which worked and helped avoid reality of things catching up with the markets for many a time.  But then even that can only go so far, so the new tool - negative interest rates.<p>This of course, all tricks to help balance the books and keep the whole financial system rolling ahead without it taking a reality audit and adjusting down instead of being over valued due to perception of constant growth.<p>But with a big rainy day that is global, things in any market would take a hit, how much of that depends as many companies will die, but how many of them will be due to the way they operate and not the `market snap`(sorry Marvel, I&#x27;m using it) we are experiencing.<p>If anything, whilst many jobs will be lost, more attention to local sourcing will be given and that will create not only jobs, but more stable jobs.  At least to until the fashion of outsourcing comes back and we end up with Detroit mark2.<p>Also be new opportunities&#x2F;jobs - certainly be a boom for many internet companies.  Also see alas another nail in many a high street and with that, things will change, how much of that does transpire is unsure for certain.  But certainly see more things local produced instead of imported, with that production has been slowly clustering globally and in some area&#x27;s has become centered.

It is an inordinate amount of work that non-computer-interested most likely aren&#x27;t interested in. I do wonder what it takes (restoration of privacy rights enacted through judicial interpretation enforced upon companies like e.g. GDPR?) to have default UX that is E2E across most services, probably widely used companies like Apple doing it (which may compel Google, et al, to?). It surprises me to some degree that companies seem to _want_ the liability involved with associating people with their data? This seems odd, as the data is just as useful assigned to some random identifier that can be carted around the internet that can&#x27;t be tied to our person, and I wonder how the cost of liability remains worth it when technologically it&#x27;s unnecessary. The human aspect of social networking seems like the weak heel for removing names there, but still things like chat seem like things companies wouldn&#x27;t want to store (who knows how strongly gov is compelling them to do so to make it worthwhile, maybe, with $$$ or threats). Even things like imessage, most people use icloud to backup and in this case the messages are recoverable by Apple (for law enforcement as it is or their own purposes maybe, more cynically) - this is heavily marketed E2E but in practice isn&#x27;t, Apple says so on their security page even (this is nice of them): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT202303\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT202303<\/a> - I hope that as an industry we can work towards pushing ephemeral UX that users can adjust to but it will take adjusting, nobody needs a message from Nonna from 2014 and if it was the prized bread recipe, save it somewhere else! In any event, I hope this continues to get better for the lay user.<p>I haven&#x27;t changed most of my choices since making the switch. I do use mullvad with wireguard now and I consider moving off of 1.1.1.1 for similar reasons to leaving google (see recent news about large gov partner here). I don&#x27;t have many complaints. In the past year, I&#x27;ve also stopped reading twitter&#x2F;reddit and moved to reading the news once a week in some attempt to rewire my brain, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s mostly good, I spend more time thinking and reading more interesting things and it gives me some perspective, the trade offs are being more disconnected from society (not up to date on memes, miss seeing what friends are cooking!) which has pros&#x2F;cons. I&#x27;m rethinking this, it&#x27;s all about values really, I do think social media can be used in a privacy preserving way to still keep in touch with friends&#x2F;family (fingerprinting is slight issue) that doesn&#x27;t have to constantly fight for your dopamine receptors. Anyway, it&#x27;s interesting to discuss with like minded people, I know very few who aren&#x27;t constantly plugged in now and it can be hard to relate (ie talk about more interesting things imho)."],"time":["2020-04-29 16:16:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bsndev"],"id":[23033283],"kids":{},"parent":[23015354],"text":["I bought synology NAS and it helps me to de google myself. it comes with:\n- email server\n- gdrive replacement\n- office replacement\n- music library\n- photo library"],"time":["2020-04-30 19:13:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["littlecranky67"],"id":[23022250],"kids":[23022590,23022325,23022506,23022405,23022295,23023323],"parent":[23021295],"text":["I love Insomnia and use it almost daily and in the hope the developers&#x2F;owners are reading here on Hacker News: Please don&#x27;t make the same mistake as Postman.

Cheap self-help porn targeted at overachievers.<p>&gt; The term ‘ennui’ is often used interchangeably with ‘boredom’. However, various distinctions have been drawn between these two terms, and in general, the main difference between boredom and ennui is that ‘boredom’ refers to a mental state that is short-tern and driven primarily by situational and environmental factors, while ‘ennui’ refers to a mental state that is chronic and driven primarily by dispositional (personality-based) factors.<p>so... chronic boredom?<p>Shit, just talk to a professional, don&#x27;t read online articles about how to deal with your mental health challenges. Just reach out and ask for help. The stakes are too high. If you feel chronically bored, you&#x27;re most likely heading towards burnout or you&#x27;re depressed but not realizing it yet.

Any article on ennui this long that does not mention depression <i>at all<\/i> is clearly not thinking deeply or widely about the topic at hand.<p>I do think there is a good article about ennui that could have been written. And, in particular, how to distinguish it from depression. Both feature anhedonia (life is not pleasurable), monotony, dissatisfaction, and a vague sadness. To me, the key difference is drive.<p>With depression, it is as if your own motor is turned off. Everything you do brings you no pleasure, you can&#x27;t imagine them bringing you pleasure, and you don&#x27;t even have the energy to try. Both the world is empty <i>and you are too<\/i>.<p>With ennui, the inner component is different. The world feels boring and unsatisfying, but the internal drive to fix that problem is still present, just unguided. You know you aren&#x27;t happy and <i>want<\/i> to do something about it, you just don&#x27;t know <i>what<\/i>.<p>Ennui is restless where depression is inert.<p>This makes it a relatively easier problem to solve because it&#x27;s essentially external. The feeling is caused by your actions and not a fundamental chemical imbalance. Addressing it requires understanding your own values and motivations. What gives your life a sense of meaning? Look back on days that you felt were particularly gratifying—the ones you want to reflect on on your deathbed. What made them that way? What did they have in common?<p>Often, ennui comes from trying to replicate the same actions that brought us joy in the past without realizing that the context has changed. So there is a generalization step. It&#x27;s not that doing X was meaningful. It&#x27;s that doing X <i>because it meant Y<\/i> was.<p>For example, I used to be a game developer. After about six years, I was pretty burned out. It wasn&#x27;t as fun anymore. I kept doing it but felt more and more ennui. Why did the same activity that used to make me feel gratified no longer do so?<p>It&#x27;s because the underlying context—my own internal state—changed. A big part of the gratification came from:<p>* Learning a new domain and seeing my skill in it improve.<p>* Proving to myself that I could accomplish shipping a real AAA game.<p>After several years, my knowledge had plateaued, and I had already proven to myself several times over that I could do it. Those aspects were gone. What I took away from it is that internal growth—learning new skills—is important for me to feel that something is meaningful. Once I &quot;max out&quot; in a domain, it is no longer gratifying for me.<p>This may not be true for others where their satisfaction comes more from providing value to others, or demonstrating mastery.

If you don&#x27;t agree that this needs to be fixed, or you think we should do something different from my proposed action, please discuss it with me before merging -- we probably have a significant difference in understanding that is important to sort out.<p>• [fix?] means &quot;fix now if bug&quot;.  This looks like it might be a bug, but I&#x27;m not sure; please evaluate it, and if it&#x27;s indeed a bug, treat it as a [fix].<p>• [minifix] means &quot;fix now if small&quot;.  I&#x27;m asking for this to be fixed before merging because I think it will take &lt;30 seconds.  If it takes longer, forget it.<p>• [postfix] means &quot;postponable fix&quot;.

A [fix] could be big or small; the important information is that it&#x27;s mandatory.
