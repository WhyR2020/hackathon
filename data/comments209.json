If you power cycled the machine and the off time was less than 30 seconds, it always rebooted correctly.  If the off time was greater than 2 minutes, it ALSO always rebooted correctly, but if the off time was around 1 minute, it would reliably hang during the boot process.  This behavior was rapidly confirmed on a number of other units taken off the production line.<p>Needless to say this was very confusing.<p>The eventual root cause was that during boot, a file-system was created in DRAM, similar to what a modern system would use initramfs for.  The file system creation routine had originally been written for non-volatile memory, so it would by default check for a superblock to see if there was already a file system in place at the creation location and if there was, just use that (after unlinking all pre-existing files).  If no pre-existing FS was found it would create a new one.<p>But this was in DRAM, not non-volatile memory so:<p>- if the off time was less than 30 seconds, the filesystem was STILL IN THE DRAM and the ramfs_create() routine would happily re-use it.<p>- if the off time was over two minutes, there were enough bit errors in the DRAM that ramfs_create() would fail to recognize the superblock, overwrite it with a new one, and everything STILL worked fine.<p>- in the critical timing zone, the number of bit errors in the superblock in DRAM would be small enough that the FS creation would recognize that there was a pre-existing filesystem, but large enough to cause the ramfs_create() function to error out.  The boot would then hang when the DRAM filesystem was accessed.<p>Of course there was no error checking on the ramfs_create() return.<p>The solution was to change the flags to ramfs_create() to overwrite unconditionally.  After that, booting was reliable with any amount of off time.<p>Lesson is - cold boot attacks on DRAM contents are real, and we managed to do it to ourselves by accident."],"time":["2020-01-27 21:04:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geek_at"],"id":[22158118],"kids":[22158226,22158844,22158391,22161664,22158272,22162349],"parent":[22157430],"text":["I love bugs like this.

The heuristics there ended up bricking two expensive motherboards for me.<p>The older ISA bus, which was quite common until at least the end of the &#x27;90s, did not have any way standard way for software to identify cards, nor any way for software to specifically talk to the card in a specific slot.<p>PCI cards have a required Vendor ID assigned by the PCI-SIG, and a Device ID assigned by the vendor, and the PCI bus has a way to address by slot. A driver that supports a particular kind of card can scan the bus by slot, checking Vendor ID and Device ID to find cards it works with.<p>With ISA cards, all that driver would know is that the card it is looking for has, say, 4 registers that appear at consecutive I&#x2F;O addresses, and that there are jumpers on the card that can set the base I&#x2F;O address to 0x200, 0x240, 0x280, or 0x2CO.<p>The safe way to use a card was to install it in the PC, noting the jumper settings, and then install the driver and tell the driver what jumper settings you used. To know what jumper settings to use, you had to know what other cards were in the system and what I&#x2F;O addresses they used so you could pick settings that didn&#x27;t conflict with an existing card.<p>No one wanted to make someone installing a new operating system on a working system open up the thing, find all the settings on all the cards, and report that to the OS. They wanted to just automatically work with cards that had drivers built-in to the OS.<p>So what the OS installer would do is go through each built-in card it supported, and use heuristics to figure out if it is installed. For example, take that card I mentioned earlier that can be at 0x200, 0x240, 0x280, or 0x2C0. The OS might now that after reset that card should have 0x1F in register 0, 0x00 in register 1, and random values in registers 2 and 3. So if it doesn&#x27;t see 0x1F at 0x200, 0x240, 0x280, or 0x2C0, it knows that the card is not present.<p>But suppose there is 0x1F at 0x200 and 0x00 at 0x201. Then the card <i>might<\/i> be there. So now the driver would have to write to some of the registers, and see if the card responds the right way. Mostly it would do this be setting various modes, and then reading those mode settings, and see if they are right. If the card is not the right one, hopefully some of those commands don&#x27;t make any sense to it, and so its responses are different.<p>Think about this for a moment. Suppose the OS is looking for a network controller, and the card at that address is actually a disk controller that happens to have the same read values in its registers after a reset, so the probe for the network card has to go on to the writing part of the test.<p>It&#x27;s then writing network controller commands to a disk controller. If the command for &quot;set status&quot; on the network controller happens to be the same as the command for &quot;write to disk&quot; on the disk controller--you may have just trashed your disk. Oops.<p>And so the OS vendors had to very carefully construct their device probes. If writing commands for card X to different kind of card Y could trash things on Y, they needed to make sure that they had probed for Y first, and so if any Y were present skip them when probing for X.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily work if you have any cards that the OS does not know about. If you card is going to need a third party driver installed after the OS is installed, it was best to take that card out during OS installation if having random junk written to it could cause harm.<p>One day at work, we bought two very expensive top of the line motherboards. The box said that they required Windows 98 or later. I tried to install Windows 95 on one of them. The install went fine until it got to one of the places where it reboots, and the reboot failed utterly. It did not even show the BIOS messages. The system appeared to be thoroughly bricked.<p>Figuring one of the motherboards was defective, I tried the other one. Same damn thing. Bricked during Windows 95 install!<p>We eventually found out what happened. The Windows 95 searching for devices on the ISA bus ended up writing to some registers that on this machine controller the BIOS flashing. It had erased the BIOS. Windows 98 and later knew about the flash controller in the chipset used in this motherboard, and avoiding trashing your BIOS. (Not sure why the motherboards either didn&#x27;t have a jumper to disable BIOS flashing, or shipped with that jumper set to enabled)."],"time":["2020-01-27 21:25:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aritmo"],"id":[22157715],"kids":{},"parent":[22157430],"text":["Likely it was fixed in file"],"time":["2020-01-27 09:27:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22159119],"kids":{},"parent":[22157430],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-27 14:46:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["jp1016"],"id":[22163331],"kids":{},"parent":[22157430],"text":["i used to create virus on my school computer labs , a batch file with command to delete a critical windows file like ntldr.dll or somthing and restarts, then i rename it to fifa or GTA and put an icon of the game as well. someone from any other class when using the computer think they got a new game  and click on it and it won&#x27;t boot again. yeah , i was a bad kid"],"time":["2020-01-27 21:14:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["goutham467"],"id":[22162960],"kids":{},"parent":[22157430],"text":["In my new office, whenever any of my colleagues standup from their chair my external monitor would go blank, it was not happening consistently, especially when I called any of colleagues to see it.

By using a context manager, the Yeso Python binding avoids that error.  As the comments point out, you can reduce yv.py to the following six lines of code if you depend on CPython&#x27;s prompt finalization to flip buffers:<p><pre><code>    #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python\n    import yeso, sys\n    _, n = sys.argv\n    p = yeso.read_png(n)\n    w = yeso.Window(n, p.size)\n    w.frame().copy(p)\n    while True: w.wait()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYeso is still in its early stages, and I might change this interface a little bit, but I don&#x27;t see why things need to be any more complicated than this for simple GUI programs.  And my intuition is that making the interface less explicit makes it worse, <i>for experienced programmers<\/i>.<p>Proce55ing and Arduino offer at least some evidence that at least the setup()&#x2F;draw()&#x2F;mousemove() scaffolding is a significant help to beginners; they can get a moving object on the screen or a flashing LED before they have to know what a loop is, and the default behavior you have in Python or C of closing the window (for GUI programs) or restarting the firmware (for embedded programs) is not a good default."],"time":["2020-01-27 03:48:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sails"],"id":[22158264],"kids":{},"parent":[22150966],"text":["This looks really great!<p>A somewhat related video that your docs reminded me of, &quot;Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle&quot; [], which I think is a really interesting take on inventing and learning.

The reasons why:<p>1. Writing anything commercial would be a gamble. I&#x27;ve wrote at length on why this license isn&#x27;t meant for scripting languages, but even if it&#x27;s a compiled language, SDL moved away from LGPL here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MeMPCSqQ-34?t=430\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MeMPCSqQ-34?t=430<\/a>.<p>2. LGPL and scripting languages just don&#x27;t work from an open source perspective. It&#x27;s not copy-paste and vendorize friendly. Functions can&#x27;t be copied a la carte. I&#x27;d rather write something from scratch than link an LGPL library in one of my MIT licensed projects. I&#x27;m just not willing to open downstream users to the risk. What ends up happening is 5&#x2F;10 years on, someone ends up writing a new MIT&#x2F;BSD library to get around a viral one (e.g. GCC -&gt; Clang&#x2F;LLVM)."],"time":["2020-01-27 05:22:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["readyoursicp"],"id":[22164237],"kids":[22165169,22165840,22165086],"parent":[22164212],"text":["Hey everyone,<p>I’ve found that learning algorithms is more engaging when solving them with other people.

But then, what filesystem really is?  Filesystems are such a critical part of a running OS that we expect perfection for every use case; filesystem bugs or quirks[1] result in data loss which is usually <i>Really Bad<\/i>(tm).<p>That said, for the last two years, I&#x27;ve been running Linux on a Thinkpad with a Windows 10 VM in KVM&#x2F;qemu -- both are running all the time.  When I first configured my Windows 10 VM, performance was <i>brutal<\/i>; there were times when writes would stall the mouse cursor and the issue was directly related to `btrfs`.  I didn&#x27;t ditch the file-system, I switched to a raw volume for my VM and adjusted some settings that affected how `btrfs` interacted with it.  I discovered similar things happened when running a `balance` on the filesystem and after a bit of research, found that changing the IO scheduler to one more commonly used on spindle HDDs made everything more stable.<p>So why use something that requires so much grief to get it working?  Because those settings changes are a minor inconvenience compared against the things &quot;I don&#x27;t have to mess with&quot; to cover a bigger problem that I frequently encountered: OS recovery.  An out-of-the-box OpenSUSE Tumbleweed installation uses `btrfs` on root.  Every time software is added&#x2F;modified, or `yast` (the user-friendly administrative tool) is run, a snapshot is taken automatically.  When I or my OS screws something up, I have a boot menu that lets me &quot;go back&quot; to prior to the modification.  It Just Works(tm).  In the last two years, I&#x27;ve had around 4-5 cases where my OS was wrecked by keeping things up to date, or tweaking configuration.  In the past, I&#x27;d be re-installing.  Now, I reboot after applying updates and if things are messed up, I reboot again, restore from a read-only snapshot and I&#x27;m back.  I have no use for RAID or much else[2] which is one of the oft-repeated &quot;issues&quot; people identify with `btrfs`.<p>It fits for my use-case, along with many of the other use-cases I encounter frequently.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but neither is <i>any<\/i> filesystem.  I won&#x27;t even argue that other people with the <i>same use case<\/i> will come to the same conclusion.  But as far as I&#x27;m concerned, <i>damn<\/i> it works well.<p>[0] I want to say that an installation of openSUSE ended up causing me to switch to `btrfs`, but I can&#x27;t remember for sure -- that&#x27;s all I run, personally, and it is a default for a new installation&#x27;s root drive.<p>[1] Bug: a specific feature (i.e. RAID) just doesn&#x27;t work. Quirk: the filesystem has multiple concepts of &quot;free space&quot; that don&#x27;t necessarily line up with what running applications understand.<p>[2] My servers all have LSI or other hardware RAID controllers and present the array as a single disk to the OS; I&#x27;m not relying on my filesystem to manage that.

Some are understandable (the author presumably last looked at the state of ZFS 5 years ago), but some were not true even 5 years ago:<p>&gt; If you want to grow the pool, you basically have two recommended options: <i>add a new identical vdev<\/i>, or replace both devices in the existing vdev with higher capacity devices.<p>You can add vdevs to a pool which are different types or have different parities. It&#x27;s not really recommended because it means that you&#x27;re making it harder to know how many failures your pool can survive, but it&#x27;s definitely something you can do -- and it&#x27;s just as easy as adding any other vdev to your pool:<p><pre><code>  % zpool add &lt;pool&gt; &lt;vdev&gt; &lt;devices...&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis has always been possible with ZFS, as far as I&#x27;m aware.<p>&gt; So let’s say you had no writes for a month and continual reads. Those two new disks would go 100% unused. Only when you started writing data would they start to see utilization<p>This part is accurate...<p>&gt; and only for the newly written files.<p>... but this part is not. Modifying an existing file will almost certainly result in data being copied to the newer vdev -- because ZFS will send more writes to drives that are less utilised (and if most of the data is on the older vdevs, then most reads are to the older vdevs, and thus the newer vdevs get more writes).<p>&gt; It’s likely that for the life of that pool, you’d always have a heavier load on your oldest vdevs. Not the end of the world, but it definitely kills some performance advantages of striping data.<p>This is also half-true -- it&#x27;s definitely not ideal that ZFS doesn&#x27;t have a defrag feature, but the above-mentioned characteristic means that eventually your pool will not be so unbalanced.<p>&gt; Want to break a pool into smaller pools? Can’t do it. So let’s say you built your 2x8 + 2x8 pool. Then a few years from now 40 TB disks are available and you want to go back to a simple two disk mirror. There’s no way to shrink to just 2x40.<p>This is now possible. ZoL 0.8 and later support top-level mirror vdev removal.<p>&gt; Got a 4-disk raidz2 pool and want to add a disk? Can’t do it.<p>It is true that this is not possible at the moment, but in the interest of fairness I&#x27;d like to mention that it is currently being worked on[1].<p>&gt; For most fundamental changes, the answer is simple: start over. To be fair, that’s not always a terrible idea, but it does require some maintenance down time.<p>This is true, but I believe that the author makes it sound much harder than it actually is (it does have some maintenance downtime, but because you can snapshot the filesystem the downtime can be as little as a minute):<p><pre><code>    # Assuming you&#x27;ve already created the new pool $new_pool.\n    % zfs snapshot -r $old_pool&#x2F;ROOT@base_snapshot\n    % zfs send $old_pool&#x2F;ROOT@base_snapshot | zfs recv $new_pool&#x2F;ROOT\n\n    # The base copy is done -- no downtime.

For example, you might want to work with margins for time-slots that are non-linear but smooth.<p>So, even though I&#x27;ve worked with constrained linear programming in the past, I tend to prefer algorithms with meta-heuristics, such as simulated annealing or Tabu search. Although this might not provide the &#x27;best&#x27; solution, it provides a wider range of modelling tools.<p>To elaborate a bit on a use-case. Lets say we want to plan a high-school roster. Teachers might have a maximum of 8 hours per day of work, but if we make a hard cut-off at that time, we might miss an interesting 8:15 schedule that gives a teacher more time to have proper lunch. If, furthermore, we do not break the 40 hr.&#x2F;week rule, it might be a workable schedule. Also, it provides the search algorithm a usable gradient, so the search space becomes smooth and easier to navigate.

Special thanks to James Bookbinder and his team at University of Waterloo.<p>2) I&#x27;m an OR novice, and this is my first optimization project. I feel now that I can roughly model the flight assignment domain, but what the solvers do is a mystery to me, and when I read about Lagrangian relaxation and column generation, I&#x27;m lost. Fortunately I haven&#x27;t needed those techniques in this project.<p>3) The mathematical model, when written down, looks mystifying even to me, the author, and that&#x27;s unfortunate. My goal in writing this post was to reduce the mystery and explain the model in plain English (plus math notation), but in the end I&#x27;m afraid it still looks eye-glazingly complicated. Data science can be all too happy to cloak itself in mystery by writing down what are actually pretty basic equations. I don&#x27;t have a good solution to this.<p>Most of all, I got such joy out of building the model one constraint at a time and seeing the solver follow my directions and spit out optimal solutions.

But there is a large and interesting set of MIP problems where the continuous relaxation to ordinary linear optimization (&quot;linear programming&quot; in the jargon, although that&#x27;s as misleading a term as &quot;analog computer&quot; or &quot;military intelligence&quot;) gives you enough interesting information about the MIP problem to solve it enormously more efficiently than you can with a generic SAT solver.<p>One of the notes in Dercuano is an overview I put together of the field last year: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canonical.org&#x2F;~kragen&#x2F;dercuano-20191230.tar.gz\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canonical.org&#x2F;~kragen&#x2F;dercuano-20191230.tar.gz<\/a> file notes&#x2F;linear-optimization-landscape.html.  It seems that the best free-software solver is COIN-OR CBC, and the best free-software modeling language is GMPL, aka GNU MathProg, which is compatible with the popular proprietary linear-optimization modeling language AMPL, and includes its own somewhat weaker solver GLPK; it&#x27;s much easier to get GLPK solving a problem than CBC, but the relevant incantations are in the note.  But some of the proprietary solvers are much better; most of them are available on the NEOS Server.<p>I didn&#x27;t evaluate embedded DSLs like Pyomo in any depth, unfortunately.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed with the Flexport post, which I feel is badly formatted and uses needlessly obscure notation and then never gets around to actually writing down a model in MathProg or Pyomo or anything similar.  But I guess my own note is only a little better, and the Flexport article at least gives a MIP model of a nontrivial problem.  (There are many more such examples in the GNU MathProg distribution, and MIPLIB has a wealth of extremely nontrivial ones.)<p>Mathematical optimization in general (optimization in the sense of minimizing a possibly constrained function, not in the sense of making code run faster) amounts to programming at a higher level; I think it was Norvig that described it as &quot;the ultimate in agile software development&quot;, because you basically just write the tests.

Go back to 1940, and the US only had a 130 million population, which typically lived in large families in shared houses. In 1940, the European population (excluding Russia) was already 420 million. Thus, whereas the US population has more than doubled since then, the European population has only increased some 50 percent. This meant construction of far more dwellings in the US in the large 80 years.<p>- Eastern Europe: Eastern Europe has been much poorer than the US during the last 80 years with people largely living in apartments.<p>- Space: The US simply has more space per capita. We are 500 million in the European Union (for a few days more) in an area half the size of the US.<p>- Sprawl: The great US population expansion coincided with the automobile revolution allowing for people to live in suburbs far from city centers, which in turn allowed for larger houses.<p>- White flight: Europe never had an exodus from city centers comparable to the US.<p>- Materials: Europeans live in brick and mortar houses or concrete buildings.

This time of year is notoriously tough on mental health, and that&#x27;s probably part of it. I got a subclinical case of SAD during the holidays. No triggering reason, life is generally OK, but I really was not very active outside of some minimum activity. I am finally coming out of it now that the days are noticably longer.<p>2. There&#x27;s also been a seasonal cold going around that I just started getting over today. Its symptoms were mild but included some amount of disorganization and inability to focus. Really dramatic between yesterday and now in terms of how much I accomplished and how difficult it was.<p>3. All that notwithstanding, I have had a few traumatic experiences that resurface on occasion. The most effective thing I&#x27;ve done is to find a hobby that is really intensively engaging - not just idle escapism like most entertainment but the top-end, &quot;I have to stay 100% in it&quot; kind of stuff. For a while judo did this. It&#x27;s a large committment, though, and I can&#x27;t always find time for it. More recently pinball has filled that gap, and pinball is something I can get a quick fix of on my phone. Both of those games assault the senses and require my total attention to succeed, which really does a lot to reduce the ruminating aspects of traumatic stress.<p>4. When I want to ruminate and escaping won&#x27;t do the trick I will turn to a diary. In here I try to settle my thoughts with storytelling. The goal - and there is a goal here - is to not just report the facts and rationales like a detective but to make a fairy tale out of it, adding in the kind of symbolic resolution you feel is just or in character with your beliefs, even if it means adding fantastic  elements. When you do this, you change the story into one that allows you to heal and guides your identity back towards something stable. The &quot;healing story&quot; is an old folk technique, and a good, low-risk one to try.<p>5. It probably isn&#x27;t the job, and like others are saying, you want to keep that. A good rule to work from is &quot;fix ordinary things&quot;, and if the job doesn&#x27;t need fixing then it probably isn&#x27;t the focus.<p>Everything can be a struggle. Let yourself rest, but also don&#x27;t let things go when you have the energy and focus, even if it means silly stuff. I realized that my habits are such that I am really focused to do a little more coding right when I go to the gym...and so now I go and  immediately use their bathroom to get in an extra 20 minutes.

I also need to take at least a week on a relaxing vacation (not sightseeing &#x2F; running around doing stuff for a week!!) about every 6-8 months. I also try to work on _my_ schedule the best I can. I like to work from about 8am to 2pm and then some amount between 10pm-2am; for whatever reason those are my best working hours. Take as much time as you can to learn to listen to your body because I really think you can catch burnout before it reaches meltdown. I haven&#x27;t had a proper burnout since 2016.

Nobody is judging us harder than ourselves. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with finding a work environment that is pretty laid back, and cut yourself lots of slack. I did this when my first child was born, and knew having a kid would really push me, especially given my abuse background. I stuck with a pretty &#x27;maintenance mode&#x27; project, and wasn&#x27;t stressing too much about work. I was certainly lucky to be in that kind of situation.<p>Definitely seek out mental health help (maybe you are as you&#x27;re on a mental health break?). There are a lot of techniques for overcoming PTSD. EMDR, for example, is one very effective technique. There&#x27;s also somatic psychotherapy. You can do this. Seek out support. And if you don&#x27;t like your therapist, don&#x27;t hesitate to switch. A good therapist can be a very personal decision.<p>If you work at a good place, and you feel safe doing so, maybe consider talking to your supervisors about your situation? I think it&#x27;s tricky knowing whether to do this, and maybe you feel safe, but maybe you&#x27;re afraid of the consequences? Both would be understandable. If you have a lot of trust in your workplace, talking about it would at least give them context for what you&#x27;re going through, and you might be able to collaborate on a path forward that gets you help and gets you to a place in your career you can be laid back for a while.

Plenty of people would break down under half that.  (Seriously, suppose it was one sexual assault and the breakup.  That is enough to fuck a lot of people up.)<p>I can&#x27;t tell whether you already know this stuff.  If so you can skip this paragraph:<p>If I came into my therapist&#x27;s office and told her I had your symptoms, she would tell me that I had anxiety and depression from all the stress I was carrying around.  I know this because I&#x27;ve already done it.  I didn&#x27;t want to do it because I didn&#x27;t want to think of myself as crazy (mental illness has a lot of stigma attached to it), so I resisted for a year or two.  But eventually my problems got serious enough that I couldn&#x27;t deal with them any other way.  Waiting caused me a lot of trouble.  I&#x27;m still pissed that I can&#x27;t get those years back.<p>I&#x27;ve never had PTSD, so I don&#x27;t know what a therapist would say about your symptoms.  But I do know PTSD is treatable, as are anxiety and depression.  The treatments aren&#x27;t as easy as taking a pill (though the option is there).  They work slowly, and they&#x27;re process-oriented, so they discourage you from asking <i>when do I get better?<\/i>  But the time does come when you feel normal again.<p>A few pieces of random advice:<p>- Stop working until you get this sorted out.  Mental health issues tend to take away your ability to introspect.  You could get worse without realizing it, cause a lot of problems for your employer, maybe get fired and have a black mark on your record.<p>- You may not want to tell your employer why you&#x27;re leaving.  I don&#x27;t know what the culture is like in Toronto, but in the US people can get a little strange about mental illness.  Unless you get special mental health benefits or something (and maybe even then) it&#x27;s a good idea to just say &quot;personal issues&quot; when they ask you why you&#x27;re leaving.<p>- You say you have a medical person.  In the US medical people dispense drugs and see you once every month or two.  Therapists see you every week, and they help you solve the majority of your problems.  If it&#x27;s an option, find a therapist <i>that you like<\/i>.  You may have to sit through a couple of duds.  My therapist is the primary reason I&#x27;m healthy today.<p>- Understand that one possible endgame here is a breakdown where you suddenly can&#x27;t work or screw something up catastrophically (I&#x27;ve been there too :-).  Try to be graceful about it, but one way or another you should put everything down so you can focus on getting better.<p>- my email&#x27;s in my profile if you want to talk."],"time":["2020-01-28 02:48:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["say_it_as_it_is"],"id":[22165784],"kids":{},"parent":[22162647],"text":["Try vaping high cbd hemp flower daily after work for about two months.

I have had my own battles with mental health issues, but never so concentrated (just protracted). Like others, I really think you need to find a therapist first. As for the modality, what immediately comes to mind is integrative [1].   CBT or Jungian would not be good options though, for various reasons.<p>A reputable therapist ought to offer a free first session (or half) to see how you two get along and it gives them a sense of what you&#x27;re struggling with. It may take a few tries to find someone you click with (or a competent one), but stay at it. The exact modality does not matter so much as the quality of the relationship between client and therapist; Bowlby&#x27;s attachment theory explains this in more detail (e.g. secure attachment == good parenting).<p>I went through burnout a few years ago (quit the badly run by sociopaths startup), went thru a good period (i.e. taking time off), got desperate for work (bad idea, but couldn&#x27;t focus on what I&#x27;d planned to (aka get out of IT))), got a job, things were ok - and then went downhill again (the dead cat bounce) due to various environmental factors and also not really addressing some internal issues. So don&#x27;t do what I did.<p>As for the job, you can always get another one (you&#x27;re young enough). Again, don&#x27;t do what I did - I had a ton of responsibility in the startup job and so put up with a lot of crap because a) I thought I was indispensable, b) all the tech was my baby, etc. At the end of the day, I finally realized too late I owned zero equity and the founders were deliberately exploiting me. Your company sounds much better, but still, too much identification with &quot;the job&quot; is endemic in IT and tends to lead to burnout.<p>And the PTSD worries me for some reason... just my intuition. So don&#x27;t procrastinate (like I did...)  Good luck.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;therapy-types&#x2F;integrative-therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;therapy-types&#x2F;integrative...<\/a><p>[edit] I see you have a psychiatrist - good, but you should do talk based therapy also IMO - it may be my biases, but psychiatrists are only appropriate for biological based issues.

I know how hard it can be but I have come out the other side a much stronger person and a lot clearer on what is important in life. Always hang in there, it gets better.<p>Everyone is different I know and I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert but thought it might be worth listing some of the big things that helped me and seems to help a lot of others as well, just in case you find something:<p>- Exercise like you&#x27;ve never exercised before. If you ever had dreams of getting in shape or conquering a fitness challenge nothing motivated me more than knowing I might feel a little bit better mentally for it afterwards.<p>- Sleep. I got serious about making sure I got a good night sleep which was extremely hard at times. All the sleep hygiene tips are worth learning. Not getting too hot at night, blocking out all light, ear plugs, sleep meditations, stretching before bed, reading something calm and positive before bed, writing everything on your mind down so you can let it go etc etc<p>- Every day writing down 3 things I&#x27;m grateful for (even small things like a warm cup of tea), 1 happy thing that happened in the last 24 hours and 1 thing I&#x27;m looking forward to. There&#x27;s something to all the gratitude diary stuff.<p>- Meditation and mindfulness were often the best way to get a break from it. Learning these skills is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done.<p>- Controlled breathing gave me some control of my nervous system. To calm things down and slow my thoughts (especially in the middle of the night) I personally found the 4-7-8 breathing technique worked well for me if done properly but there&#x27;s lot of others taught in yoga etc as well.<p>- Socialise and talk to people a lot, even if you don&#x27;t feel like it.<p>- Help others. It is the right thing to do and it feels good and takes the focus off you.<p>- Learn new things, take on new challenges, things that you have no expectations about.<p>- Possibly the hardest but best lesson I learnt of all though was not to buy into the negative thoughts my brain was having. Realising that I&#x27;m only thinking that way because of the state my brain is in and that the state it is in today isn&#x27;t necessarily the state it will be in tomorrow, next week or next month. The world is a great and amazing place. If it doesn&#x27;t seem that way right now it&#x27;s just because of the state I&#x27;m in now but that state will change and when it does change the world does indeed seem great and amazing again.<p>I also tend to agree with the advice of staying in your job. For me there was an element of not being able to deal with too much but at the same time, running from all responsibility and work wasn&#x27;t the answer either so it was a balance to be found until I could get back to full capacity. Taking on as much responsibility as I could handle at each step helped to improve my self worth and helped a lot too. But that&#x27;s just me so I hope you find what is best for you.<p>Hang in there and best of luck to you!"],"time":["2020-01-28 02:43:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zackmorris"],"id":[22163489],"kids":[22167818],"parent":[22162647],"text":["First of all, good job on taking a mental health break. I was burned out at this time last year and should have asked for a sabbatical, but I thought I could tough it out. I ended up having a falling out with my work and we parted ways. A few thoughts off the top of my head:<p>* Do a health assessment, maybe a physical&#x2F;checkup, and address any digestive or sleep issues. I had undiagnosed sleep apnea for 10-20 years which lead to severe fatigue, then acquired IBS from (I think) a meat deficiency and lack of fiber while bodybuilding, similar to what vegetarians get after 3 years if they don&#x27;t meticulously watch their nutrition. I thought it was leaky gut from a sensitivity to legumes and nightshades (Dr. Gundry has info about this) but in my case, I think it was that I had substituted legumes for meat so had worn through my gut lining and also wasn’t making serotonin from tryptophan in the gut. Anyway, I went heavy on the meat and took some prenatal vitamins for a week and my digestion and mood improved within a matter of days. It was honestly a miracle.<p>* If your physical health is fine, start working on your mental health. I just found out a few days ago that I probably have ADHD, after reading this article on HN <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22129777\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22129777<\/a> about it. I also discovered that I have task anxiety felt as a pain between my chest and stomach when I need to do something I’m wary of (I thought I only had depression). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has helped, mainly that I acknowledge negative thoughts as they come in and then let them pass, similar to with meditation. And I use The Secret&#x2F;Manifestation to take negative thoughts like “I so don’t want to help them fix their website” with “thank creation that another opportunity fell in my lap, even though I can only save the lead right now until I’m feeling stronger”.<p>* My guess is that you have too much emotional baggage in your head that hasn’t been garbage collected. It will take you a period of time proportional to however long something was scribbling the hard drive in your head to recover from it. In my case, I normally do PHP and mobile development, but learned Java and Ruby for projects within 6 months that filled my head with anti-patterns that I had long ago stopped using. So I was mainly fixing mistakes in the code which I never would have made, which severely taxed my motivation. I was also on call at night 1 week out of every 3 so wasn’t dreaming. So I got so discombobulated that I was reverse engineering tasks all the way to their beginning and realizing that the entire project would have to be rewritten to make any changes. That annoyed the client and dropped my productivity to 10%. I’ve also been through PTSD due to the death of a friend 15 years ago that I felt responsible for, so slipped back into very dark and negative thought patterns of the whole world being against me. Which I realize now is what happens when someone has doubts about or loses their faith - what we might call a midlife crisis.<p>* If decluttering your mind through meditation and perhaps counseling feels too overwhelming right now, you can start with your immediate surroundings. I just spent the last few weeks cleaning my home office and shredding paperwork from 15 years ago. I had worked through burnout to depression 6 months ago due to my girlfriend having me do a bunch of home improvement projects around the house which got me over my starting friction. But cleaning my surroundings got me from depression to anxiety as my todo list shrank enough that I could see the forest for the trees. My task anxiety was so crippling that I was going days between getting even one thing done. But I discovered that by separating the thinking from the doing by building my todo list during one time period and working through it during another time period, I was able to act as my own boss. That let me visualize where I needed to be long term and then get into the zone while tasking, because it’s easier for me to do what other people tell me. While burned out, we often lose our ability to self-start.<p>* I don’t really have a fifth point, so a here’s a bunch grouped together: forgive yourself, be patient with yourself in your recovery, know that you are not alone (literally millions of people in the US alone struggle with burnout and depression), try to have as many emotional free expression tasks in your life as analytical so that you can do something constructive instead of procrastinate, talk to others who are struggling like yourself even if it’s just online forums and chat rooms.<p>I would say that I am pretty much back to normal, but unfortunately I haven’t really programmed in months. I am really, really struggling with the idea of going back to work. I need to, but feel uncomfortable taking on a full time job right now. I’ve been looking at freelancing, but unfortunately freelancer.com and upwork.com are completely saturated with 10-25 (as many as 85!) coder applications submitted for every contract I’m interested in. I’m trying the gig economy, but it’s kind of the off-season right now where I live so am only making $50-75 here and there. I’m looking into non-programming work that doesn’t emphasize problem solving as much - perhaps CAD or copywriting. I’m eager to work and full of energy and ideas, I just.. can’t write code.. right now. I’m hoping to get my blog back up and write some in-depth articles about the logistical side of programming and ADHD&#x2F;PTSD&#x2F;burnout&#x2F;depression&#x2F;anxiety, about solutions for when technical hurdles are not the problem. I’m up for anything, if anyone is in the same boat or needs help writing&#x2F;planning&#x2F;designing something."],"time":["2020-01-27 21:34:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["i386"],"id":[22164583],"kids":{},"parent":[22162647],"text":["Go on a very very long vacation!"],"time":["2020-01-27 23:38:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["24hrsonline"],"id":[22167987],"kids":{},"parent":[22162647],"text":["At ShipFromCA, you can Buy Oxycodone online.

In Unison, the ‘codebase’ is a somewhat abstract concept (unlike other languages where a codebase is a set of files) where you can inject definitions, somewhat similar to a Lisp image.<p>One can think of a program as a graph where every node is a definition and a definition’s content can refer to other definitions. Unison content-addresses each node and aliases the address to a human-readable name.<p>This means you can replace a name with another definition, and since Unison knows the node a human-readable name is aliased to, you can exactly find every name’s use and replace them to another node. In practice I think this means very easy refactoring unlike today’s programming languages where it’s hard to find every use of an identifier.<p>I’m not sure how this can benefit in practical ways, but the concept itself is pretty interesting to see. I would like to see a better way to share a Unison codebase though, as it currently is only shareable in a format that resembles a .git folder (as git also is another CAS).<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22010510\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22010510<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unisonweb.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tour\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unisonweb.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tour<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Content-addressable_storage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Content-addressable_storage<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-27 11:27:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["choeger"],"id":[22157168],"kids":[22157206],"parent":[22156370],"text":["Very interesting approach.
