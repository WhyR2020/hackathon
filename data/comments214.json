The consumer will often buy the cheapest appliance regardless of continued cost down in the future. If you can offset that loss in profit with something else that&#x27;s less prevalent on consumer&#x27;s minds, you can compete with other sellers.

I start a dozen software projects, finish it 80% then lose interest and do something else.<p>If I have no interest in something I can&#x27;t do it at all. It&#x27;s like getting a tooth pulled out.

That article sounds exactly like my experience. This morning I have been avoiding working on a project, and I caught myself staring at my computer with my hands ready but I just couldn&#x27;t start. I do feel that it is my ADHD, but I also feel that there are other emotions involved.

Using the Waking Up app by Sam Harris has really taught me so much more than I was expecting. For the first time last year I went 3 months without medicine. I wanted to gauge how strong my attention&#x2F;focus muscle was without medicine. At the end of 3 months I was able to start noticing when I was distracted or in my head and that was such a be improvement for me, because it allowed me to start paying attention again. I also noticed how I was communicating with myself. I went from being negative towards myself because I knew i should be paying attention. To understanding where my mind is at that day and knowing that today might be a harder day than yesterday, but that is okay. Just take it one step at a time.<p>TLDR: Exercise &amp; Meditation.

The first two years of working there I had great performance reviews, things went well. It was a high performing YC-backed success story, and I felt just as successful. I was promoted to Lead QA Engineer, and oversaw several projects going at once that I was interested in.<p>About two years in, it started going south when I lost my Adderall prescription. Eventually I got fired. It was devastating, and the best job I ever had.<p>I guess after some change at Kaiser Permanente, my primary care doctor was no longer able to write me Adderall. He sent me to psychiatry, which at Kaiser is less than stellar.<p>Psychiatrist said that unless I can provide proof from elementary school or doctors from my childhood, he’s going to have to reevaluate me; from the looks of what he said I might not get a diagnosis.  Offered me  Wellbutrin. The entire visit was a slap in the face. He thought I was there to get stimulants because I have a drug problem.<p>Indeed! I do have a drug problem in that no longer am being prescribed the drugs that make me function. I never abused drugs.<p>Even after talking to a manager, Kaiser refuses let me switch psychiatrists. This was about 2.5 years ago. It took me two months even get an appointment with that Dr; only to have him tell me get lost.<p>Meanwhile, I’ve been doing the best I can given the situation. ADHD Affects me greatly and I’ve lost so much since then.<p>For one, disorganization resulted in me missing out on exercising my stock options. I thought I had three months, it was 90 days. Missed it by a day!<p>This was problematic because the company was purchased by Autodesk about a year after I got fired. Would’ve been a nice liquidity event. ($600K)<p>I’m still falling incredibly short. I have a lot of trauma around getting fired and feeling like I am insufficient. I have not even applied for a job since leaving. Once unemployment ran out I started ridesharing; i’m doing that off and on for about two years. It barely pays rent but better than being broke and homeless in San Francisco.<p>Today, it’s a struggle to stay relevant. I have pretty much given up on finding a psychiatrist in San Francisco as they all appear booked for months. I have found success in self medication although it’s harder to find therapeutic pharmaceuticals then street drugs; not a viable alternative for me.<p>I’m sort of losing interest in tech. I find enjoyment in many things technical but cannot seem to get myself together. Thinking without finishing my college degree, no relevant work for the last 2 1&#x2F;2 years, and no treatment for my condition; nobody will want to hire me. Even if they did I am not sure I’d be able to be successful.<p>Where am I at now? Still ridesharing, trying to make ends meet. My resume is almost rewritten, I have looked at some jobs but not applied for any yet. My world has gotten a little bit smaller than I would like.<p>Absolutely I need some more structure than what I have."],"time":["2020-01-23 23:06:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mlang23"],"id":[22135939],"kids":{},"parent":[22129777],"text":["Life, a lifelong struggle."],"time":["2020-01-24 07:47:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["riversflow"],"id":[22133379],"kids":{},"parent":[22129777],"text":["I got diagnosed at 24 with ADHD-PI after being the “brilliant but lazy kid” who dropped out of Community College after being put on SSRIs for depression(mostly as a result of feeling like such a failure after being told since I was a child that school would get interesting in college, and it didn’t, the SSRIs made me lose all interest in everything), subsequently taking a full-time job, and having a co-worker suggest I might have ADD.<p>This article spoke to me, I bookmarked it and will probably recommend other people around me read it. I was especially moved by the parts about being traumatized by people treating you like you’re a bad person. Made me realize that  I’m trying to fight off a depressive episode currently that was probably made significantly worse by my former lover(the breakup&#x2F;cheating being what caused the episode) constantly acting this way, despite knowing I had ADD.<p>One part sticks out though as being overly optimistic,<p>&gt; “and even if you stop taking them or can&#x27;t get them later you&#x27;ll still have those accomplishments. Maybe the emotional impact of seeing yourself finally achieving things will be so encouraging that it&#x27;ll eradicate your feeling that you can&#x27;t accomplish anything - speaking from experience, it will.”<p>I have to put this in context: So a little over a  year ago I lost my job, I had been able to, thanks to adderall, move up to a pretty good position at a small business, that very unfortunately went belly up due to a new landlord who no longer wanted said business in their space and an inability to move due to the business being effectively grandfathered in.  About a year later, as part of my breakup I suddenly lost my place of living and as a result, my new semi-decent job. Even with my good job I had been mostly priced out of psychiatric medicine for a couple of years. I didn’t get employer based health insurance, and individual ACA insurance has been getting more expensive every year. This was fine at first, which made me not make the necessary sacrifices to keep myself medicated, but over time my symptoms regressed. I’m now making like 20% of what I was when I was medicated and the hill to get back to a satisfactory career position feels utterly monumental.<p>I now feel effectively trapped by my ADHD, which is completely resistant to being fixed by healthy routines. Since I broke up and moved back in with my parents I’ve been exercising daily— lifting weights and running—have a pretty amazing diet, meditate, have a group of old friends to socialize with, have good sleep hygiene, and after 4 months of all this I’m still struggling to improve my situation, I’m still depressed, my ADHD is as bad as ever and I’ve made basically no headway in terms of reestablishing a career. And the fact that when I was on adderall I was the me I’d always wanted to be, able to start (and finish!) things I wasn&#x27;t interested in, not waste (mountains of) time losing things and keep track of time effectively is now completely out of my reach, really brings me down, a lot.<p>I SO BADLY want to update my website and work on a software&#x2F;tech project. I’ve even gotten as far as figuring an original project out, doing research and wire framing the design. But I’m now stuck in analysis paralysis and my road to Getting There(tm) keeps shifting. I should obviously get on benefits, I paid into the system and deserve unemployment, but every time I’ve tried to get on it there’s problems. I‘m on Medi-Cal but apparently I need an office visit to get reregistered in my new county, I ironically got my benefits card after I got kicked out, after a 6 month process; ADHD makes signing up and getting benefits a nightmare, I’m constantly forgetting to do the next step or miss an appointment. Doubly bad when you’re depressed as I struggle with feeling persecuted.<p>I recognize I’m really an asset in the workplace but I need to make moves to find a job and prove my skills. I see people’s job hunt infographics where they apply to like 100’s of companies, and it’s honestly baffling to me, it takes me the better part of a day to tune my resume and write a cover letter I’m happy with."],"time":["2020-01-24 00:14:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sh53"],"id":[22135897],"kids":{},"parent":[22129777],"text":["r&#x2F;ADHD needs this"],"time":["2020-01-24 07:37:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Ghjklov"],"id":[22134275],"kids":{},"parent":[22129777],"text":["Not officially diagnosed, but I suffer a lot from ADHD-like behavior.

One pattern I think we all see over and over again is when products get bought by a large company, they often lose their &quot;soul&quot; (and the original team). Both those things happened with Mint.<p>Another important pattern I&#x27;ve seen is that products, in the long-term, morph to take the form of their revenue model. Many personal finance products are free, but make money by selling data or trying to upsell you on something else that you don&#x27;t need (like, say, a credit card you don&#x27;t need or a tax product that is overpriced [2]).

I&#x27;d definitely encourage anyone joining (or starting) a company to think about what the revenue model they are choosing means for the product and company long-term. Every company will say they are different, and that they actually care about their users and about building a good product... and maybe in the early days, the original team can stay true to that, but eventually time and money take their toll.<p>Companies that really want to build lovable, user-aligned products, set up a revenue model that encourages them to stick to that long term.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monarchmoney.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monarchmoney.com<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;inside-turbotax-20-year-f...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-23 16:25:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["creade"],"id":[22131244],"kids":[22133276,22135551,22131349,22131313,22134361],"parent":[22127845],"text":["One of my longest standing mint mysteries is how I alone was  A&#x2F;B tested into them trying to bum pizza off me: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;CSg_ZxLU8AAF96d?format=png&amp;name=medium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;CSg_ZxLU8AAF96d?format=png&amp;name=...<\/a><p>I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other confirmation that this was a thing outside the one time I saw it."],"time":["2020-01-23 21:01:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["awicz"],"id":[22128087],"kids":[22129845,22130239,22128198,22128121,22131642,22128293,22135014,22128348],"parent":[22127845],"text":["I switched to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ynab.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ynab.com<\/a> a while back.

I liked using Mint mostly just to track my net worth &#x2F; assets and did so for several years.<p>Fast forward a year or two, and Intuit had purchased Mint. A few months later I came to realize that Intuit was now creating TurboTax accounts for all existing Mint users without bothering to cross-reference existing account email addresses between the two databases. When I signed up for Mint originally, it was using your full email address as a user name. So now, I had a Mint account which was my email address, an old TurboTax account which had that same email address on file, but a different user name, and a new TurboTax account which WAS my email address, tied to the existing Mint account.<p>So what happened? I tried to log into Turbo Tax using the account I already had used for taxes in the past to import my Mint information, but I was told that email address is already in use by another TurboTax account - the one Intuit created for me instead of merging my existing accounts...<p>Several phone calls later, I was assured the only path forward was to start using the new account to do my taxes if I want Mint integration. I decline and asked why they couldn&#x27;t just get rid of the erroneous new account they created for me and let me combine the ones I already had. I was not about to lose years of tax returns on my old account to start a new account without that information. They said it was impossible.<p>Ultimately, I decided I&#x27;d delete the old Intuit&#x2F;TurboTax account and start fresh, to take advantage of the integration features. They told me they were required by law to keep my old TurboTax account data,  but that I could change the password to something random&#x2F;long and change the email address to something non-existent to prevent myself or anyone else from being able to log in anymore.<p>At this point, I was very annoyed, and chose a suitably-annoyed fake email address directing hatred toward Intuit, which I won&#x27;t repeat here, but rest assured it included a reference to Intuit and non-standard sex acts. I also changed the password to a 64-character random string, which I did not write down. Fast forward a couple weeks...<p>Lo and behold, I tried logging into Mint a few weeks after changing my Intuit password and wouldn&#x27;t you know, that account was inaccessible now, the exact opposite of what I was told they were going to do... Better yet, I couldn&#x27;t reset the password because I had changed the account email address on file to the aforementioned vulgarity. Now you see where this is going... I called customer service, and the rep assured me she could help if I could recall the email address I had used... So, I apologized in advance, and proceeded to tell her the address was &quot;Eff&quot;IntuitInThe&quot;A&quot;@&quot;eff&quot;you.com (something in this ballpark, and edited for language).<p>Needless to say, we had a good laugh. I haven&#x27;t really used Mint ever since, and have been considering deleting my account (if I can even do that without destroying my TurboTax account...)"],"time":["2020-01-24 00:57:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["McTossOut"],"id":[22136821],"kids":{},"parent":[22127845],"text":["It wouldn&#x27;t tie in to my Robinhood portfolio, and the synchronization would periodically fail, then they sold my personal data to advertisers and I started getting junk mail."],"time":["2020-01-24 11:07:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["Kalium"],"id":[22130542],"kids":[22133122,22132300,22138677,22132656],"parent":[22129436],"text":["Given how much of that $700B is likely to go towards developing such a system - likely somewhat less than all of it - and the general care towards usability in DoD-built systems?

That is, if you know the approximate location of the text that you want to undo, you just select a region that contains that location and call undo. It can be used as a quick git alternative. Say you modify the buffer all over the place. If you want to undo some text that you&#x27;ve modified an hour ago but you did other modifications to the buffer in countless other places, you can undo just that region and you don&#x27;t have to go back throught the whole undo tree.<p>Another one that I&#x27;ve currently discoverd and I&#x27;m very excited about is yasnippet (the modern variant of abbrev). You can define a string that stands for an abbreviation for an expansion. Everytime you type that string, it is replaced by that expansion. The nice thing about yasnippet compared to abbrev is that, among others, you can specify where to leave the cursor after the expansion.

Sure, it is probably an old trope at this point, but the entertainment modern society has given us has drastically lowered our attention spans. Those of us in our mid to late 20s are on the border. We didn&#x27;t grow up with social media, but we&#x27;re young enough to have started using it fairly early (but not early enough - usually - for it to effect us &#x2F;too&#x2F; badly, though those using it too much have suffered from it). Those a bit younger (high school age, freshman age) are absolutely suffering from it, and God knows how badly the primary and middle schoolers will suffer.<p>In this article, the OP talks about what they do instead of study most of the time: lay in bed and browse Twitter and Reddit. Sorry but - and not to sound trite - but that there is a huge problem. It is not a symptom, it is a problem (not <i>the<\/i> problem, but it contributes) in and of itself. Cut it out.<p>Unfortunately, I find myself sucked back into social media after giving it up for any length of time, whether by friends, family, a new venture that needs a Facebook page, whatever. But when I do give it up (and I mean all of it: Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, HN, the lot) I am the most productive I have ever been. I get things done. It&#x27;s not a magic cure, and it must be combined with other stuff (exercise, reading, meditation), but honestly, our lazy modern lives are the cause of most &quot;ADHD&quot; and nothing else."],"time":["2020-01-24 00:14:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["keyle"],"id":[22133961],"kids":{},"parent":[22127841],"text":["1999 - the GTD method<p>2019 - everyone thinks they have ADHD on some level<p>Constant: you&#x27;re human and you are a fine human.

Based on the details of the project werkzeug is designed to build WSGI apps easier and flask is just a convenient library on top of it providing easier way to manage request&#x2F;response. It is designed for developer productivity and performance is left to specific infrastructure software like gunicorn, uwsgi and others. Flask&#x2F;werkzeug or any WSGI&#x2F;ASGI related servers were designed for interfacing with a http server like nginx, apache, gunicorn, uwsgi and many. A python LWAN http server can beat go http server [1] [2].<p>Also take a look at comparison of various frameworks in Python including go http server [3].<p>People are most productive in the language&#x2F;framework they are most familiar and will defend it. Every language&#x2F;framework has their own strength and weakness and I believe over a period of time ideas flow from one language to another.<p>Indeed today many people in Python community will be moving towards Rust or Go because they think it can solve all their problems they face with dynamic typing and performance, which might not be entirely true. It&#x27;s upto an individual to decide if they want to go that path.<p>As an example werkzeug&#x2F;flask framework developer Armin moved to Rust in spite of it being a complex language with very large syntax surface area and a steep learning curve. In my opinion Rust&#x27;s complexity, difficulty to learn and understand, and probably a promise of type and memory safety (which is not 100% true given it needs to interface with C in unsafe mode and will only be as safe as the underlying C implementation), makes people adopt it to make them feel better programmers (Personally I would have chosen Haskell, if needed to do the same).<p>Now all the Python projects he worked on is mostly maintained by volunteers and David. But being a responsible open source developer and contributor before moving in that direction Armin did create pallets projecs [4]. So his decision to move is right for him given his preference and learning priorities.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexedi.com&#x2F;NXD-Blog.Multicore.Python.HTTP.Server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexedi.com&#x2F;NXD-Blog.Multicore.Python.HTTP.Server<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwan.ws&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwan.ws&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;million-requests-per-second-with-python-95c137af319&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;million-requests-per-secon...<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.palletsprojects.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.palletsprojects.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-24 04:09:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["raziel2p"],"id":[22132437],"kids":[22132610],"parent":[22131325],"text":["The gohttp library seems to do a lot less than what gunicorn&#x2F;werkzeug&#x2F;flask does.

Please excuse the wall of text.<p>Procedural generation can provide unlimited amounts of content seeded from finite effort. It&#x27;s still mostly hand-crafted, just at different abstraction level. Building blocks are constructed manually and algorithm that fits them together is also carefully designed and fine tuned. It is used often in indie games because of lower effort needed to give illusion of huge amount of content. Meanwhile AAA companies can afford armies of level designers to make a detailed words. I guess everyone agrees that human design beats procedural and current AI. It is more varied, imaginative and purposeful - the 3 ingredients necessary for immersion. The crowd-sourced approach has not yet been successfully applied, to best of my knowledge.<p>The work that GM is doing can be quite valuable, and yet it only reaches few players of that campaign and is remembered vaguely. What if we could capture and store GM responses to player prompts? What if other sessions could reuse these responses and build on them to create new responses? The basic use of recorded responses is to automate mundane actions and checks (fights, lockpicking...) so that GM can focus on creative stories and arcs.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this for quite some time and came up with partial solution. The automatic response system could consist of rules that are hand-crafted by GM while the session is played. Each rule is response to some action and changes the world state. So, each rule has to store the name of action, portion of world state that GM considers critical for that action, and how the world state is affected by action.<p>For example, let&#x27;s attack an orc with a sword. OK, the GM decides that player&#x27;s strength, sword sharpness, orc&#x27;s agility and a dice role are important in this interaction, so GM marks them as such. Because D20 dice came out as 12, GM decides that attack was fairly successful, and changes orc&#x27;s state to severely injured. This interaction is saved and the gaming session moves on. Later on, the same interaction &#x27;attack with sword&#x27; is repeated by with different world state. If important parts of world state are the same&#x2F;similar, then same result can be applied. If GM decides that existing rule is not applicable, then differentiating world state is marked and different results are entered and stored under a new rule. Now system is has two rules for &#x27;attack with sword&#x27; and can automatically choose between them, based on which rule matches the world state the most. With time the system becomes rich enough to simulate this action under various conditions, while still being able to accommodate new situations with help from GM.<p>Such rule-based system can be visualized as bunch of simple state-charts that are built on the fly, and they interact together by modifying global state. I can imagine this simple mechanism would be good enough for combat mechanics, crafting system, simple NPC simulation (moods, dialogs, quests), inventory interaction, terrain manipulation...  It should be enough to hand-craft a rich immersive world?<p>The hard part is coming with data structure that can capture rich world state in enough details without overwhelming the GM. The structure would have to model locations with objects, each with its attributes. All this would have to be relative to character who wants to preform the action. I&#x27;m considering graph databases, but don&#x27;t have enough experience with them to move onto implementation :("],"time":["2020-01-24 10:25:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["skue"],"id":[22128414],"kids":[22133090,22130221,22133972,22129486,22131151],"parent":[22128015],"text":["This is for a voluntary county board position without regulatory power that by statute needs to be elected by March when no one is paying attention.

My favorite quotes:<p>&gt; It is not just members of the community who wishes for “just two more features.” We have a committee with 300+ members. It seems that essentially every member has a feature or two that they’d like to get into the language, and many have several. I have not changed my opinion that adding too many features could “sink C++.” <i>Remember the Vasa!<\/i> [Vasa]. In fact, I think that the flood of new proposals has increased since I wrote [Vasa].

We should never present a design without a serious and honest discussion of possible problems and alternatives.

I think product-development analogies have been seriously overdone over the last few years<p>The idea that traditional product design mentalities are insufficient for programming language design is very interesting.  Indeed, a programming language’s design must answer to theoretical truths in addition to mere user feedback (this is a point brought up in the paper).

Over the past week or so, I first made my blog browsable with cURL[0], then plain TCP sockets[1]. I learned a lot through this process, and relearned some things as well:<p>1. HTTP&#x2F;1.1 is valuable. With the move to HTTP&#x2F;2, we lost the principle of &quot;simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible&quot; (Alan Kay). All things in HTTP&#x2F;2 are complex. I can make an HTTP&#x2F;1.1 client on the command line with netcat.<p>2. Serving documents is incredibly simple[2] and safe (once you handle path vulnerabilities :D ).<p>3. We should extract web browsers from the behemoth JavaScript VMs we&#x27;re all running now. I&#x27;m all for having portable VMs, and I like the direction WebAssembly is headed, but probably 80% of what I do on the web could be accomplished using an order of magnitude simpler software, accessing read-only documents.<p>4. Markdown and other human-readable formats are awesome. I used to think writing my blog in HTML had the least dependencies, but now I realize it makes you depend on a browser to render it, and that&#x27;s a <i>huge<\/i> dependency. Markdown can be read as-is and therefore is almost dependency-free.<p>So I agree with the author here, and this is how I think we get there. Someone should make a stripped down web browser with the following attributes, or something similar:<p>1. Only speaks HTTPS<p>2. Only GET requests<p>3. A few choice headers, like Range for streaming video.<p>4. No JavaScript, or any Turing complete language at all.<p>5. Minimal CSS, ie colors, font sizes, flexbox. No animations (you don&#x27;t have a language to trigger them with anyway).<p>6.
