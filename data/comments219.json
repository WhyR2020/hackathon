In short, when you have to look at a bunch of links for something (decide on AirBnB, people to hire, material for your next blog post, etc) Histre makes your life easier. But this is just the starting point for what Histre intends to do.<p>IMHO the biggest problem with apps like Evernote, Notion etc is that it becomes digital hoarding, and not a knowledge base. And the knowledge base focused apps out there involve a lot of manual upkeep, which almost never happens, especially at work. Things start out okay and quickly fall into disrepair. I&#x27;m differentiating from the other note taking apps by automatically putting together a knowledge base (grouped by topic etc).<p>One idea I&#x27;m excited about and I&#x27;m working on right now is: Histre automatically fetches updates from the websites you visit, ranks the websites with things like lack of ads &#x2F; referral links and ranks the new posts with your &#x27;revealed preferences&#x27; of what you tend to actually read from the list of updates previously shown etc. Personally I&#x27;m hoping for this to be a replacement for social news sites, which are too sensitive to people who bother to go upvote on &#x2F;new.<p>Automatic Upkeep: Histre detects links&#x2F;notes related to your existing notebooks and offers to update those notebooks with the new links and notes. This is similar to how Google Photos suggests new photos for your existing albums. This solves the upkeep problem. Currently people create knowledge bases with good intentions and it becomes stale and useless quite fast. This is a work in progress.<p>If there is anything else you want Histre to do, I&#x27;d love to hear it: hn@histre.com"],"time":["2020-01-21 16:51:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aasasd"],"id":[22106578],"kids":[22107976],"parent":[22105561],"text":["&gt; <i>but it takes me too much time to do that every time<\/i><p>Good.

Chrome Bookmarks\n    2. Workona\n    3. Notion\n    4. Native Bookmark Sources (e.g. HN, Stack Overflow, Twitter)<p>The large bookmark library you are talking about lives in layer 3, Notion. I too have issues with its Web Clipper. However, I came to realize that it is a very good habit anyway to manually curate recently added bookmarks. I do it about twice a month and usually, I can throw out a good portion of the new additions because they do not seem quite as relevant on second look. The big advantage of having your bookmarks library in Notion is that you can relate to other databases in Notion, e.g. projects, blog posts, ideas.<p>Another important lesson: Be careful not to do too much bookmarking. A large library can feel overwhelming and most things can be easily found again with a simple google search.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tkainrad.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;managing-my-personal-knowledge-base&#x2F;#bookmarking\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tkainrad.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;managing-my-personal-knowledge-ba...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-21 16:42:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shane156"],"id":[22106057],"kids":[22107457,22106096],"parent":[22105561],"text":["I have the same problem and have started using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raindrop.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raindrop.io<\/a><p>Hope it serves you well"],"time":["2020-01-21 12:44:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dredmorbius"],"id":[22124612],"kids":{},"parent":[22105561],"text":["Bookmarks themselves (save a few references), and many archival systems, aren&#x27;t particularly useful, mostly because they impose far too much overhead into either <i>classifying<\/i> or <i>using<\/i> the resulting archive.<p>Manually tagging everything ... is tedious.<p>The inability to search <i>content<\/i> of bookmarks, or even, often to find the original content online (praise His Noodliness for the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine), is a major impediment.<p>Reading (and using) research tools which <i>do<\/i> allow and facilitate use, not merely archival, of references, is a complete game-changer, and makes clear that much of the present organisational conceit of Web content is highly flawed, with assumptions based on 20- 30-year-old system limitations, when disk <i>was<\/i> scarce, storage expensive, and local search difficult at best.<p>The focus of most vendors -- both proprietary <i>and<\/i> nominally free software -- around user-surveillance, tracking, and cloud-based platforms facilitating both, means that usable, user-controlled, local (or at least proximate) solutions ... are poorly developed, supported, and advertised (irony noted).<p>There are some.

I doubt that we&#x27;ll see it used for low-power&#x2F;resource-constrained firmware, but lots and lots of embedded systems are now bulky Linux boxes with years of uptime, and I can see Rust making inroads there.

Lots of us in the embedded space aren&#x27;t so impressed by the extra memory safety because, if you allocate all your memory statically, there are fewer ways to screw things up with references, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to do bounds checking, so fewer bugs slip in.

I don&#x27;t like how Rust is trying to move away from C when considering syntax. I tend to prefer languages that can adopt the &quot;C flavor&quot;. Python, in my view, does this very well: its syntax is simple, because it borrows a lot from C in its &quot;flavor&quot;.<p>Rust is not doing that, and that&#x27;s a hurdle.<p>In my view, the &quot;C flavor&quot; is very important because it&#x27;s a standard of how people are able to read code. This has nothing to do with the C programming language, I&#x27;m just saying that simplicity is what made C popular and easy to use. I can understand that Rust brings very nice innovations, but in my view it should have done so while keeping the &quot;C flavor&quot; as most as it could have.<p>I admit it&#x27;s a conservative view, but I tend to believe that a language can be more easily adopted if at its most basic level, it&#x27;s simple to read for beginners.

I tried as much as possible to mix my formal coding studies and work, with those of UI design. This led me to the creation of several apps and websites, some of which are currently published and listed on my personal website (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;albemala.me&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;albemala.me&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>While designing user interfaces, one of the areas I struggle with is color. Creating beautiful color combinations is very hard - at least for me! So I decided to create an app to help make this task easier.<p>Back in 2017 I started working on this project, and after a couple of months of development, I published Iris - Color Schemes Editor. I iterated on it quickly, publishing a few updates based on users&#x27; feedback. A good number of people were using it and found it useful, so I decided to move a step forward.<p>Last year (2019) I re-designed and re-implemented the app from scratch, improving the overall experience and set of features. A few months of work later, IRIX 2.0 was ready (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@albemala&#x2F;irix-color-scheme-editor-color-tools-is-here-ef6a85f3ac7f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@albemala&#x2F;irix-color-scheme-editor-color-...<\/a>).<p>So, what is IRIX?<p>IRIX aims at being the definitive application for designers and artists to create beautiful color schemes. It is a full-featured color scheme editor and a collection of advanced color tools.<p>There are many tools around to work with colors. The web is teeming with applications to manage color schemes, test color contrast, extract colors from images, but they all have one or two features only. If you are a designer or an artist, you are probably familiar with that frustrating situation where you have three applications and five tabs open in your browser just to create a single palette!<p>With IRIX, the goal is to have a single space to work with colors and unify multiple tools into a single one (“A color app to rule them all”, someone could say…).<p>Some of the things you can do with IRIX include:<p>- Creating, editing, naming and organizing your color schemes. \n - Fine-tuning the colors in multiple color spaces and giving them names (or let the app suggest a name for you).\n - Generating color harmonies, shades, tints, and variations.\n - Mixing colors in different color spaces.\n - Extracting colors from images.\n - Testing colors for accessibility issues (contrast ratio, lightness, color blindness…).\n - Designing color schemes for infographics, maps, and presentations easily.\n - Importing colors from other applications and exporting them to many formats, like text, file, and images.\n - … And more!<p>IRIX is available on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<p>If you&#x27;re a designer, for work or hobby, I hope you would find this app useful.\nI would be glad to hear your feedback and thoughts on it."],"time":["2020-01-21 15:33:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["meristem"],"id":[22114037],"kids":{},"parent":[22107143],"text":["Site did not render well on Brave&#x2F;iOS.<p>I’m in the UX&#x2F;Human Factors Engineering field and hah, I too thought it was UNIX-related.

Then again though truck drivers aren&#x27;t paid while waiting to load and unload, and flight attendants aren&#x27;t paid until the plane is in the air.<p>Plus I feel like they are taking short cuts, I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d want to publish other peoples prices because they could change, items removed from the menu, etc. I guess they scrap the website or send someone in to take notes of the menu? I rather it be an agreement where businesses themselves opt-in and update their menu and prices. Wonder how these apps handle things when stuff is out of stock (ran out of wings, but has chicken tenders still) or the ice cream machine happens to be broken? Just seems not as deeply integrated as I&#x27;d hope. but even if businesses updated menus, with being on 3 apps and their own site I&#x27;m sure something would be missed due to human error unless some sort of API with a central UI to update everything. Plus some fast food places are understaffed too, because some people rather work in another field other than fast food or just don&#x27;t work at all. Reports that less teenagers are working in fast food too. Then I guess putting growth and stuff first is some business models for these apps, grow fast and figure out things later when you are a bigger company.<p>But even before internet ordering, businesses we&#x27;re doing shady things too. Like pizza delivery drivers are required to have commercial insurance, but many don&#x27;t so if found out and got in an accident, claim could be denied. Was reading that happen to some teenager using the family car for a part time job, and the state decided to take his license away because claim got denied and wasn&#x27;t able to pay out of his own pocket. Sounds like the employers mention it, but don&#x27;t really enforce what type of insurance you have. So many are using personal insurance, some forums discus this and some pizza drivers said they&#x27;d put their roof topper in the trunk before the police come if in an accident. So sounds like faceless huge corporations are shifting their liability to teenagers and other people just starting out and more vulnerable people. Then ride sharing, the companies say you are covered by their million dollar insurance policy but some people still have been dropped as result of ride sharing... Do they even give you a insurance policy number or card? Sounds like most people exchange their own insurance in that case or these apps are misleading. Then some even report insurance company dropping them just for asking about ride sharing insurance, even if they haven&#x27;t signed up."],"time":["2020-01-21 02:39:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wtmt"],"id":[22103669],"kids":{},"parent":[22102806],"text":["This can be used for amusement, but is in no way reliable to know what you (or anyone else) downloads.

Because by utilizing the cascade correctly, _you don’t need preprocessors._<p>For example, one of the more prominent use cases of preprocessors encourages you to employ variables to add the same font colour 50 times to 50 different HTML elements. This needlessly bloats the CSS, leading to heavier server loads, fewer site visitors served, and slower rendering on web browsers; especially mobile and low-power devices.\n By using the cascade _correctly_, that colour needs to be defined _once_. As in, even in the final published product, there is only one `color` property in the entire css file. One. Not 50. One. Maybe two at most, if the design intentionally interrupts the cascade of the font colour at some point or if an accent colour is used.<p>If you truly want to get good at CSS, avoid preprocessors completely. IMO they exist purely to help less-skilled developers work around their ignorance and lack of refined skills with CSS. Preprocessors are a shortcut, they are empty calories, they are a crutch that will hobble and limit you. Preprocessors are worse than training wheels - they are wheelchairs for perfectly healthy people, and are equally as limiting.<p>How do I know this? I have been making web sites since the early 90s, and have been using CSS on a near-daily frequency since it was first supported by a web browser in 1996. That’s just shy of a quarter century’s experience building style sheets for sites of all sizes, clear up to corporate and enterprise-class sites serving up hundreds of thousands of web pages.<p>This article is a great first step.

He&#x27;s got a huge heart and a whole lot of grit.  I see him enduring as a high-profile open source project author.  How many battles a day does one accept before reprioritizing life decisions?  One too many strained interactions takes a toll on anyone.  No matter how much grit someone has, everyone has a limit defining how much is worth enduring.<p>Andrew should not have to deflect burning arrows fired in his direction on a regular basis, and when they are fired he needs be able to cut them down before they make a mark.  Further, while he has developed the required skills, his counterparts haven&#x27;t.  I remember an interaction I had with Andrew where he mistook something I said as a flaming arrow and acted accordingly.  Realizing this, I immediately considered how what I said could be misinterpreted and did not take offense to his reaction.  His situation is far different from mine and he&#x27;s fighting battles I can only imagine.<p>For his sake, and that of others, there needs to be a concerted effort to address the difficulties that open source authors are dealing with.  In an organization, an employer facilitates various types of training to help employees navigate challenging situations. Ethics and professional conduct are learned, as well as conflict resolution.  I&#x27;ve taken such training a number of times and continue to learn from them.  There is a huge chasm between knowing and doing, though, so hands-on training is required to internalize these skills.<p>I propose a concerted effort to provide &quot;soft skill&quot; training for the technology community.

The second often results in them switching from the troll persona to actual sincerity, but it requires several back and forths of responding with goodwill to bile, and I think it&#x27;s even harder to accomplish in forums where people have tied their name to their opinions."],"time":["2020-01-20 21:47:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jcoffland"],"id":[22101423],"kids":[22101620,22101589,22102756],"parent":[22101244],"text":["HN is pretty good at moderating discussions.

Most people would agree these people are doing optimization &#x2F; machine learning &quot;proper&quot;.<p>3) There are the people working on improving hardware for machine learning &#x2F; optimization purpouses, by looking at the   most performant algorithms, breaking them down into primitive operations and requirements for hardware, there are also people working on the algorithms themselves and finding computational shortcuts (which can end up in software or hardware, can end up as proprietary knowledge or common knowledge, ...). The distinction between hard and software is somewhat blurry, since hardware designers can optimize or implement a section of software into hardware. A lot of this can still be considered ML &quot;proper&quot;.<p>4) Then there are the people who apply the ML frameworks and their exposed choices and settings to a specific problem domain. Many of them don&#x27;t need to understand the internals if they don&#x27;t need state of the art results. Many would nevertheless benefit from understanding the internals, and the requisite math. What I propose is to stop calling their activity as Machine Learning, and instead call it Machine Teaching. They are teachers, and just like elite schools they can choose which specific type of available student they will teach, and they can tweak (or filter from a large family of students) which student they select to teach the task at hand. There are bound to be many advantages of having actual human teachers get involved in machine teaching. These people will not be proficient in designing novel families of students unless they also know the requisite math, and identify those ML papers that are ML &quot;proper&quot; instead of ML &quot;teacher&quot;. When trying to find important foundational insights in ML &quot;proper&quot; one is typically overwhelmed by a large surplus of ML &quot;teacher&quot; type papers. These are important datapoints, and necessary to advance human insight into ML &quot;proper&quot;, but they are data, not knowledge. There are actual ML &quot;proper&quot; knowledge papers out there that explain why a certain phenomena is such and so, and they get very little attention because they necessarily lag the breakthrough ML datapoint paper, and most ML &quot;teachers&quot; don&#x27;t have the math background to understand them. So the probability that a given ML &quot;proper&quot; researcher <i>fundamentally<\/i> improves the state of the art is much higher than the probability that a given ML &quot;teacher&quot; will <i>fundamentally<\/i> improve the state of the art. At the same time the probability that a given <i>fundamental<\/i> breakthrough was achieved by an ML &quot;teacher&quot; is higher than the probability that a given <i>fundamental<\/i> breakthrough was achieved by an ML &quot;proper&quot; researcher:<p>P( Breakthrough | Proper ) &gt; P ( Breakthrough | teacher)<p>while<p>P ( Teacher | Breakthrough ) &gt; P ( Proper | Breakthrough )<p>Since most people don&#x27;t have the broad math &#x2F; physics &#x2F; ... knowledge to draw on, the number of ML &quot;teachers&quot; is much higher than ML &quot;proper&quot; researchers.<p>[1] well, really, some actors have vested interests in conflating those together...<p>EDIT: just to be clear, I am not complaining about ML Teachers, we need the ML Teachers, and their breakthrough datapoints. What I am complaining about, is conflating both activities of ML Proper and ML Teaching.

On Windows, the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen is a wall of &quot;Database File is Locked&quot; which was resolved with a rewrite of the DB access logic. After much experimentation, I have found that the happy path for SQLite is as follows:<p>1. Use a SQLite distribution that is compiled or otherwise configured for serialized threading mode (this is the default in most cases).<p>2. Use a single connection from a single process to access the SQLite database file. This connection can be safely shared between multiple threads with optional locking as required (due to the guarantees offered by #1 above).<p>3. Transactions are handled with locking in the application code (i.e. on the SQLiteConnection instance), not in the database. This is predominantly required for inserts with PK generation, but also applicable in cases where you don&#x27;t want 2 different threads to interleave updates during a certain multi-step operation (e.g. debiting one account and crediting another).<p>So far, we have found this to be the most performant and simple way to get business data in and out of a SQLite database file.

Disk drives will report that content is safely on persistent media as soon as it reaches the track buffer and before actually being written to oxide. This makes the disk drives seem to operate faster (which is vitally important to the manufacturer so that they can show good benchmark numbers in trade magazines). And in fairness, the lie normally causes no harm, as long as there is no power loss or hard reset prior to the track buffer actually being written to oxide. But if a power loss or hard reset does occur, and if that results in content that was written after a sync reaching oxide while content written before the sync is still in a track buffer, then database corruption can occur.<p>&gt;USB flash memory sticks seem to be especially pernicious liars regarding sync requests. One can easily see this by committing a large transaction to an SQLite database on a USB memory stick. The COMMIT command will return relatively quickly, indicating that the memory stick has told the operating system and the operating system has told SQLite that all content is safely in persistent storage, and yet the LED on the end of the memory stick will continue flashing for several more seconds. Pulling out the memory stick while the LED is still flashing will frequently result in database corruption.<p>-----<p>If you were a human rather than sqlite you would stop believing that a sync has occurred immediately, trust it a little bit after a few seconds, and if it&#x27;s been a minute since you yourself last touched the file, you would think &quot;surely it has been written by now&quot;.<p>So it seems by tracking wall time, the library could do better than have to rely on the drive, and could be more on guard against lying drives."],"time":["2020-01-20 17:38:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andreareina"],"id":[22099046],"kids":[22099060,22104289],"parent":[22098832],"text":["Is open() on something other than &#x2F;dev&#x2F;stderr returning 2 a thing?

My intro to +nix in the mid 90s started with FreeBSD as well. Back then, I used to tag along with my dad in the summer to work occasionally (two working parents, and dad ran&#x2F;runs a small telecom business). In the supply closet I saw a shelf with boxes lined up that all had a cool-ass little devil on them. Being interested in computers from my fathers influence, I asked him what the &#x27;Devil Software&#x27; was in the storage closet, and he explained that it was an operating system like Windows sort-of (which at the time I was already well in to understanding how to re-install =), but that it ran on Voicemail Servers - stuff with specific needs - because it was very &#x27;flexible in configuration&#x27;, as he put it. He then gave me a voicemail box and the manual, and said he would give me $20 if I could get the &#x27;Devil Software&#x27; installed on the machine from a blank HDD. This. was. huge. $20 to a 13 yr old was serious dough. Eventually I was successful (to his surprise? or dismay? haha since he was out 20 bucks). He was proud, and that made me proud, and that started the journey that is still ongoing to this day. Will note, father exploited me for cheap labor throughout my teens as my interest&#x2F;experience with BSD, and eventually GNU&#x2F;Linux increased =).

Much as I admire the FreeBSD ethos, I always end up coming back to Fedora for a very simple reason: the desktop experience on the BSD&#x27;s has always been painful for me. First, FreeBSD didn&#x27;t have the driver for my iGPU (Coffeelake), though Linux had support at least six months prior. FreeBSD devs to their credit were very helpful and welcoming when I tried troubleshooting my graphics situation, even writing a small patch for me. Then, when I installed the patched version of the driver and got video output, I had to be careful to maintain the patch. One time I accidentally upgraded all packages, overwriting the patched file and undoing the video support. Eventually I got fed up and just installed Fedora, which always works perfectly, runs like butter, and looks great. I get that the FreeBSD project is much smaller than GNU&#x2F;Linux, and hardware vendors like Intel and Nvidia are not nearly as supportive in terms of contributing code&#x2F;checking compatibility. I want to run FreeBSD, I really do. But at the end of the day I just don&#x27;t have enough hours in the week to be troubleshooting my desktop, I&#x27;d rather spend those hours being productive (or being unproductive in a manner of my choosing). It&#x27;s a great project - with a bit more love for newbies and the desktop experience I think FreeBSD could really shine. One option I think FreeBSD should consider is to offer separate server and workstation editions of each release, like Fedora does.

There&#x27;s two types:<p>Known and unknown.<p>If you are not knowingly accumulating technical debt, then 90% of the time you are accumulating it unknowingly. This is the most insidious form of debt.<p>I have searched my entire career in software engineering for the solution to unknown technical debt. The problem isn&#x27;t just solving it, it&#x27;s also clearly defining what is happening to your software over the years even when you spend the utmost care in not allowing technical debt to accumulate.<p>I think I sort of nailed down what&#x27;s going on in a fuzzy way. I also sort of have a fuzzy solution to the problem. Allow me to elucidate:<p>Eventually most projects will hit a point where you realize that your initial design was poor. You are given a new feature and your old design is simply not flexible enough to accommodate the change. In order to put the feature in, you either do a massive rewrite or you hack it in.<p>In this way the technical debt that was accumulated unknowingly may force the programmer to begin accumulating debt knowingly. In fact they often forget about the unknown technical debt. They think that the only proper solution is to contemplate between the cost of a hacky shortcut or a massive rewrite without thinking about what caused the need for the massive change in design. What exactly is the thing that is causing the &quot;need&quot; for the massive rewrite?<p>What&#x27;s happening is, whenever you design something you are predicting the future. You are assuming your design can handle certain current requirements and future ones. However, the future is actually unknown, there is very little chance you can ever predict the future in an accurate way. Thus by your lack of ability to predict the future, your design will usually in the majority of cases fail to predict the future and this problem will always occur.<p>That is all that is happening with unknown technical debt.<p>The best solution (not a full solution) to this is to design all your projects with the maximum flexibility possible. That means every corner of your code that can be factored into multiple modules or be easily factorable in the future. By coding this way, you maximize the reusability and reconfigurability of your code giving the best possible insurance for an unknown future.<p>If you heard of ravioli code, this is it. It has bad connotations but ravioli code is my best known solution to unknown technical debt. Most people feel ravioli code is hard to read or maintain... In a way it is, but the key here is deal with the program in layers of abstraction. Your complicated ravioli code of 100 primitives at the lowest layer must be able to &quot;compose&quot; into higher level layers where you only have to deal with a manageable 20 primitives.<p>So the key isn&#x27;t just ravioli code, but ravioli code with highly compose-able modules you can use to simplify your code into layers. Think of it like a slider between flexibility and simplicity. The higher the flexibility (more primitives) the more complex your program is; the lower the flexibility (less primitives) the more simple your program is... A good design is one where at any moment in the projects life time you can move from layer to layer and readjust the flexibility and simplicity of the program at will.<p>Unknown to most people there is a programming style that does the above almost mechanically:<p>Typed Functional programming.<p>You may have done some FP and seen it get messy (especially with JS), but to really see why this is the solution you should take a look at Typed FP using the point free style. The point free style will help you understand the true nature of a compose-able primitive."],"time":["2020-01-20 15:28:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["NiceWayToDoIT"],"id":[22098993],"kids":{},"parent":[22088031],"text":["Great analogy!"],"time":["2020-01-20 15:28:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22099951],"kids":{},"parent":[22088031],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-20 17:34:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["louwrentius"],"id":[22099487],"kids":[22100213,22099502],"parent":[22088031],"text":["Technical Debt is a bullshit term for people who want to get away with not finishing their work and still want to sound like they are reasonable."],"time":["2020-01-20 16:32:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["epicgiga"],"id":[22098385],"kids":[22098458,22098686,22101815],"parent":[22088031],"text":["Analogies and metaphors are pointless.
