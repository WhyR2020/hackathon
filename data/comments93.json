It&#x27;s called &quot;Kisangani Diary.&quot; It&#x27;s far more terrifying than any horror movie because it&#x27;s real.<p>It&#x27;s a documentary about a relief mission that goes out into the Congo using disused railway tracks in order to feed 10s of thousands of Hutu refugees wandering around in the forest fleeing reprisals for the earlier genocide in Rawanda.  They are starving to death and being chased by militia who are shooting at them from time to time from the forest.  Absolutely no one except for the people in this relief mission cares about what happens to them.<p>The movie begins with the narrator saying that almost everyone you see in this film will be dead by the end of the movie.  When I rewatched it lately, I wondered about those lines and what the future holds for us.  What kind of documentary are we in? What if ending shelter in place fails.  What if a deadlier strain shows up?  What if this is the early days of WW III?

This needs to somehow stop and I&#x27;m appalled that the WHO is part of the problem here in that they are emphasizing hand washing as the top priority rather than emphasizing &quot;Keep your hands clean to begin with by not touching every damn thing, especially not your face.&quot;<p>And I don&#x27;t know if the WHO is that stupid and honest to god doesn&#x27;t realize that not touching stuff is the more important thing or if they have studies and yadda and they believe that it is a lost cause to tell people &quot;No, really, <i>stop touching stuff!!!<\/i>&quot; and hand washing will get more compliance, so they emphasize that.<p>But they have their priorities backwards.

Taking the above example defining 2 u129 or larger and trying to multiply them results in an error while compiling about it not being supported yet. Packed struct items that cross word boundaries result in a broken struct that contains a size larger than the data (which breaks pretty much all code that tries to use it due to size&#x2F;type checking). Also due to  comptime being as big of an idea as it is not everything works quite yet like const example: f64 = std.math.sin(4) * std.math.sin(2) being a compile time error since sin isn&#x27;t defined for comptime floats yet.<p>Like I said it&#x27;s definitely fun to play with but it&#x27;s still quite a few releases away from &quot;is this a compiler bug or did the documentation skim over something I&#x27;m just supposed to know&quot; no longer being a problem so if that&#x27;s not your cup of tea best to just watch the release notes over the next year or two."],"time":["2020-04-13 23:55:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["magv"],"id":[22861111],"kids":[22861391,22862677],"parent":[22860008],"text":["I am continuously surprised by the amount of work zig committers manage to put out every release.

They don&#x27;t plan to fix it as it is &quot;not their problem.&quot; It can&#x27;t replicate cascade deletes. We seeded our replicated tables working through those issues and then the tables had different numbers of records. I could have written a custom data migration utility in the time wasted. I know because I have multiple times.<p>Chef: at one point, we had Chef Consultants come to help us with our monstrosity. They said that we had something more complex and full featured than anything they had ever seen and declined helping. I&#x27;ve lost weeks and weeks to fighting against what we eventually grew.<p>Sysdig: personally, I lost maybe a few hours. As an org, we lost hundreds on people trying to get it to work similar to Grafana. Sysdig, at the time, did not support math operations. How this got passed on down to engineering is a different story, but when you can&#x27;t compute derivatives on counters, you can&#x27;t make decisions based on rates of change, something we require.<p>Twisted Python: Factories with mixins where a variable you are trying to discover where it came from turns out to be a parent class&#x27;s parent class&#x27;s mixin&#x27;s parent class&#x27;s mixin&#x27;s parent class. True story. Dealing with cases where someone raised an exception somewhere in the code years ago, but now the section you are working in, you realize you cannot use Deferrals because Twisted uses exceptions as control flow, and now the exceptions at some other part of the code trigger ErrBack code somewhere else. As for the python part itself, not knowing the actual type for the variable incoming on a function is a pain. String? Int? Slice? Who knows! Add some print statements or read a bunch of code to find out. Honorable mention to time lost on SQL Alchemy. I can write SQL no problem. Every time I have to do something in SQL Alchemy, I start with SQL which is done in 30 seconds, then I spend the next hour going over documentation and experiments to get the query to build via SQL Alchemy.<p>AnyEvent Perl: 40 functions deep and not having a method signature. Yeah, time to read through hundreds of lines of code with branches that could send any number of parameters down to your function that you are looking at, or put print statements to know _what_ has been stuffed into your parameter list. Large systems benefit so much from strict typing. 40 functions deep and you know _exactly_ what is coming into your function and what it should return.<p>Go Modules. I&#x27;ve probably not hit the 100 hours yet, but I&#x27;d not be surprised to be in the 20 hour range. The module system was rolled out shoddily in my opinion. We went from things Just Work(tm) to multiple environment variables and language servers and editor issues. All I want is &quot;is a vendor dir there? Use it. Else, use GoPath.&quot; Can&#x27;t have that though. With private repos, proxies, vendor directories, environment variables, and varying levels of support from editors, it is just a mess. With Go 1.14, modules are getting better, but I&#x27;m still fighting the proxy servers in combination of vendor directory and private repos. I _love_ Go.

This means that I leave my phone in another place, out of reach, so I&#x27;m not tempted to pick it up and check Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etc. For me, this is somewhere away from other distractions, like my computer &#x2F; workspace, etc. \n- Set aside a small amount of time to read without distraction in a setting like this, and grow that amount. Maybe that&#x27;s 10-15 minutes? Start that out as a routine, and as you get more comfortable with it, add on a little more time. Block out that space and aggressively protect it. I&#x27;ve found that setting aside reading time in the morning, before I open up my computer and check social media, really helps.<p>Generally, I&#x27;ve found that the more I read, the better I get at it: practice, practice, practice. Treat it like an atrophied skill.<p>For longer articles, I have a bookmark set up for the newsletter I write (andrewliptak.substack.com), in which I have a short recommended articles section. I reserve this for longer-form pieces, and when I come across something that looks interesting, I bookmark it and come back to it when I&#x27;m in a good mindset to actually read the thing (see my above point.) I&#x27;ve set aside other parts of the day (usually at the end) to read these sorts of things.<p>Another thing that I&#x27;d recommend is Pocket.<p>Another good practice thing for reading is short stories.

Be really interested in the content — not sure if this works with a non add brain, but it really doesn’t matter where I am, if it’s interesting I’ll jump right down that rabbit hole. Not sure that helps you but maybe can create some parameters for experimentation (like is there a pattern with your interest level and if so how can you mitigate that)\n2. Meditation - specifically working with the breath. It takes 30s-3min for me to reboot my brain between tasks. Not much of an investment and in my experience it works.\n3. Printing stuff out — i find it much easier to read deep if I have it on paper \n4. Copying into an editor and editing — this is my goto for boring reads because it uses a different part of my brain that reading alone\n5.

We can’t.

Aside from the millions of deaths this could lead to, and completely crushing the health care system, there would also be many tens of millions of people sick and unable to work, plus many tens of millions of people stuck caring for them. A lot of people would choose to stay at home anyway, especially as the carnage reached its peak.

That seems fair.<p>&gt; ... In a crisis, it is easy to agree to spend money. But that fight is coming. We are engaged in the largest-ever surge in public debt in peacetime. Right now we are parking that debt on the balance sheet of central banks. Those central banks can also hold the interest rate low, which means that the debt service will not be exorbitant. But that defers the question of what to do with them. To the conventional mind debt must be eventually repaid through surpluses generated through tax increases or spending cuts.<p>The most likely outcome is that the debt from the many fiscal stimulus packages to come (infrastructure, direct payments to taxpayers, tax holidays) will just stay parked on the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet.<p>The US can afford to do this, but only if the Fed commits to pegging the yield curve through unlimited treasury purchases. The dollar will head much lower, making US goods more competitive abroad.

The author called it &quot;Dijkstra Maps&quot;. Basically it&#x27;s about generating a heatmap for all the squares on the level. You can start with 0 at player position, and from that point use a simple floodfill algorithm, putting down increasing numbers with each step. Then a monster simply examines all adjacent squares and selects the one with lowest number. This has at least two notable advantages:<p>1. You only need to do the path generation once, and it scales very well with the number of monsters.\n2. It&#x27;s really good at combining several concerns, because you can generate a couple of heat maps for different concerns and add them up. For example one heat map is about proximity to player. Another could be about proximity to health pickups, or proximity to cover, or proximity to open space if a monster likes to keep distance and shoot. If a gas trap is triggered, you can use a &quot;danger&quot; heat map. Then a monster can easily get closer to player and at the same time choose the path which has fewer harmful effects.<p>That&#x27;s why centaur archers in Brogue are so annoying, monsters avoid traps intelligently, monster groups avoid wasting their numerical advantage by chasing player through a corridor.<p>He described it in detail in this article:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roguebasin.com&#x2F;index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roguebasin.com&#x2F;index.php?title=The_Incredible_Pow...<\/a><p>And in case you&#x27;re wondering, Brogue source code is licensed on AGPLv3."],"time":["2020-04-12 17:37:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simias"],"id":[22849387],"kids":[22850398,22850176,22851052,22854588,22851727],"parent":[22848106],"text":["I&#x27;m always saddened that more works doesn&#x27;t go into making fun and original game AIs.

It is tough times in the industry. The large traditional reactors in the West (US, France, UK) are really struggling. Existing reactors have operations costs that were fine until fracked natural gas pulled the floor out on electricity prices. Now they&#x27;re struggling. New builds have been boondoggles because contracts went to lowest bidders, who had no idea how to build nuclear plants. The people are focused on intermittent clean sources like wind and solar, with due cause as solar PV prices fell by a factor of 10x since 2009 (as long as the sun is shining).<p>Meanwhile there has been a bunch of hype about &quot;new&quot; reactors (quoted because they were all initially conceived of and tested in the 1950s). Thorium. Molten Salt. Small Modular. Traveling Wave. Microreactors. These will have less waste and be safer! But will it matter? As I&#x27;ve grown in experience and expertise, I&#x27;ve started looking at the numbers more. Nuclear waste has great solutions in crystalline bedrock (Onkalo), massive salt (WIPP), and deep boreholes (Deep Isolation). If a reactor makes a little bit less, will that move the needle for the public? In terms of safety, current reactors are statistically extraordinarily safe because they don&#x27;t participate in causing the 4.2 million deaths&#x2F;year from air pollution (a Chernobyl of death every 2.5 days from the fossil industry). So if a new reactor is slightly safer, will all the anti-nuclear institutions roll over begging for one? I highly doubt it.<p>Besides, with tech development in nuclear, it&#x27;s fleet experience that matters. Many MSR designs make vast amounts of tritium and require remote maintenance. Will this be doable? Will releases be acceptable? Only fleet experience can tell. Never believe someone who&#x27;s never built a nuclear plant on what their design will cost.<p>These smaller reactors will absolutely struggle economically, especially at first.<p>More and more I think it&#x27;s really public communication&#x2F;PR&#x2F;education that matters most for nuclear.<p>Chinese and Russian reactors, on the other hand, are doing better, with Russia seemingly selling VVERs like hotcakes, and moving into markets like Nigeria soon.<p>I recently wrote up an elaborate page about early reactor development history [1] and about more modern nuclear economics [2] if anyone wants a deep dive.

The perfect complement is low capital cost, high marginal cost gas reciprocal engines. No surprise that this is a fast growing area of generation and that gas turbine manufacturers are hard at work adapting their designs to deal with greater intermittency.<p>&quot;Joe Biden puts the cost of his plan at $1.7 trillion over ten years. Some analysts estimate the total cost of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal at over $50 trillion.&quot;<p>Conveniently not looking at the cost per year explicitly in the Biden proposal or giving a timescale at all for (one interpretation of) the AOC plan. 1.7 trillion over 10 years is 170bn&#x2F;yr. That&#x27;s 8% of US GDP. Quite a lot of money, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to only look at the cost of something which is a set of long life capital investments that way. That&#x27;s because:<p>1) The lifetime of renewable generation and transmission infrastructure (and nuclear generation of course) is measured in decades and the operating costs  are &lt;&lt;&lt; capital costs.<p>2) We don&#x27;t treat capital investments the way we treat recurring expenditures. I &quot;spent&quot; several times my income buying a house. You need to look at the annualised cost over the lifetime of the investment not at the capital cost.<p>3) Looking at the total upfront cost is only relevant to the degree that in-year budgets or borrowing are constrained. Those constraints are effectively set by the capital markets and by monetary policy for countries borrowing in their own currencies. In government decision making, this distinction is expressed by calculating economic value for money separately from affordability.<p>4) Only stating the total capital cost doesn&#x27;t take into account the capital and operating costs in the alternative nor does the author make any attempt to quantify the cost of the nuclear option.<p>&quot;Moreover, these plans call for unprecedented regulation of the energy sector, something closer to a command economy than a free market.&quot;<p>Dumb as a rock. The energy sector is second only to healthcare in the amount of regulation that applies to it already. The most regulated part of the energy sector is... nuclear.<p>&quot;But what if there were sources of zero-carbon electricity that didn’t require heavy-handed regulation to make them viable in the marketplace?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m glad to hear that nuclear SMR&#x27;s will be able to buy private insurance rather than relying on the government to backstop them. Again, the size and complexity of the &quot;regulatory surface&quot; is much bigger for nuclear than for renewables.<p>Not only that, but basically all the expensive basic research and prototyping for GenIV nuclear has been done by governments. That&#x27;s true for renewable generation as well of course, but it does seem strange to see descriptions of private sector start-ups as being basically scrappy entrepreneurs when in most cases they are attempting to commercialise ideas that were tested at great expensive and sometime substantial scale using government money in the 1980s."],"time":["2020-04-13 14:41:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Alkhwarizmi"],"id":[22852323],"kids":{},"parent":[22851622],"text":["Screw nuclear power!!

But how does evolution lead to larger and larger pockets of negentropy that are capable of sustaining in increasingly hostile environments? How exactly does evolution lead to more and more “advanced” life forms?<p>Enter the magic of randomized algorithms. Randomized algorithms can often solve hard computational problems very efficiently, with the tradeoff that they have a small chance of failure. We can envision evolutionary leaps as computational problems, such as finding just the right folded protein to catalyze a particular cellular reaction. The magic of evolution is not just in building stable order, but also in harnessing randomness&#x2F;entropy to solve environmental problems and then bootstrapping those solutions to solve higher level problems. Think about how just enough randomness is allowed into the process of meiosis to create perfectly functioning new humans that are wonderfully unique.<p>DNA and RNA are the non-volatile memory of the biological computer. Central nervous systems eventually reached a level of complexity that allowed them to persist memories, which opened up an even higher order problem solving mechanism.

You’ll find that even doing a very quick straightening of debris on a table will make a space feel more orderly and produce some level of satisfaction.

They were a components supplier for a business I founded and ran many years ago.  They lobbied us to switch from LG to Samsung.  They made promises and helped us select sole-source components with, as they promised, long EOL (end of life) timelines.<p>We devoted a multidisciplinary ten month engineering effort to design an entire line of products around the components Samsung recommended.  I won&#x27;t even talk about the money we spent.  It wasn&#x27;t trivial, particularly for a small company.  The way I can put it is, we bet the farm on Samsung.<p>I will never forget the day I emailed our distributor to plan orders for production.  I got a three sentence reply:<p>&quot;These parts have been discontinued.  There are no planned replacements.  You will have to redesign your products.&quot;<p>I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t end up in the hospital with a massive heart attack.  I mean, this was a company-ending email.  I must have stared at that text for an hour before someone walked into my office and snapped me out of the mental loop I was in.<p>What&#x27;s worse is what they did after I raised hell.  They lied and filed a TRO (temporary restraining order) against us to prevent us from attending an industry trade show where they, and, more importantly, their competitors, were exhibiting.  The TRO had a radius of a few hundred feet from the Samsung booth at the show.  We couldn&#x27;t even park at the convention center.<p>Because of the TRO we couldn&#x27;t go to the convention and talk to alternative sources to try and find a solution.  With sole-source components there are no substitutes.  Every company makes a unique version and you are absolutely screwed if they EOL the part number you are buying.  It&#x27;s not like buying resistors, where there are million alternatives.  This is why a trade show was almost the only way we could deal with this situation.  It would take months and much travelling, potentially outside the US, to be able to meet with other manufacturers and evaluate options.  The financial damage Samsung created with their surprise EOL (after promising a seven year lifetime of the components they selected for us) was such that we couldn&#x27;t even buy a cheeseburger without risking going out of business.<p>After the conference we could not attend I found myself in court in San Jose, CA, for the TRO hearing.  I didn&#x27;t know anything about TRO&#x27;s until then.  If you don&#x27;t go to the hearing they can turn into a permanent restraining orders and they go on your record.  So, you have to take TRO&#x27;s seriously or suffer additional consequences.  Once again, we couldn&#x27;t hire an attorney due to the financial damage Samsung caused...so I went on my own.<p>The judge was very surprised by two things.  One, that I showed up on my own.  The CEO of a company doesn&#x27;t normally go to court without counsel.  Second, he could not believe this TRO was issued.  He understood why I was there on my own and advised me to let him run this and say very little unless he asked questions.  Samsung&#x27;s attorney was there with one of their Vice Presidents, the guy who lied in the TRO declaration in order to secure it.  The judge proceeded to read these people the riot act.  I wish I had it on video.  He tore them a new asshole, both of them.  He told the attorney that if I had the money to pursue it he could be disbarred but that they had caused so much damage that the best outcome would be to cancel the TRO and advise me to lick my wounds and move on.<p>He ripped them a new one more time and asked me how we were doing.  I told him &quot;not well&quot;.  He said, &quot;I am sorry this fraudulent TRO was issues in the first place.  Clearly this caused much damage.  I can&#x27;t address it at this level.  If you recover financially you might consider consulting with an attorney for further action&quot;.<p>That was the end of that story.  It was like Samsung detonated a nuclear bomb inside my company.  We were in life support after that.  We managed to stay alive.  We had designed a line of six new products that we could not manufacture.  We had no funds or financial path to redo them.  Our competitors were taking business away from us every day.  Our entire product line evaporated overnight.<p>We managed to redesign one of the products but it wasn&#x27;t ideal or very competitive.  And then the 2008 economic downturn hit us.  We somehow survived until 2010, when I finally shut down the business.  I ended-up in the hospital twice in two years due to the inordinate amount of stress this caused.<p>I wrote a very dark email to one of my friends at the end of 2009.  I told him I now understood, in no uncertain terms, why people took their own lives during financial catastrophes.  He was at my office in the blink of an eye concerned about what I might do.  I realized reading it later that the email sounded terrible.  What I meant to say was that the pain and suffering all of the above caused me led me to understand how someone --not me-- could make that choice and see it as perfectly logical or necessary.  That wasn&#x27;t my case at all.  Well, I&#x27;ll say that it was my kids and family who kept me together, without them I could absolutely see someone with the right (or, more appropriately, wrong) brain chemistry having a tragic ending under such circumstances.<p>Entrepreneurship is hard, even without some of the tragic shit that can happen for no reason at all.  This is partly why I sometimes react very harshly to people who, without any real experience building a non-trivial business, use words like &quot;greed&quot; and beyond.  Hence my favorite quote by Mark Twain: &quot;A man holding a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way&quot;.<p>I am not going to extend my experience to the entire Samsung organization, yet I am sure my words, over a decade after the incident, still communicate the tension I feel every time I think about what they did to us, the jobs they cost, the future they destroyed and the life-ending stress they were responsible for.  A shameful example of how financial asymmetry can stomp the little guy.  This also made me view the concept of Asian honor as a complete fable.  Maybe I was naive in believing such horseshit in the first place."],"time":["2020-04-13 02:14:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dba7dba"],"id":[22849612],"kids":{},"parent":[22832884],"text":["1.

The conspiracy theorists (my Facebook friends especially) seem to rank the likelihood of this list in reverse (i.e. clearly this was concocted by the chinese government). With how secretive and disingenuous the CCP is even on a good day, it&#x27;s easy to see why their argument has a few credence points (like any good conspiracy).<p>But I can&#x27;t reconcile that there&#x27;s not much for the CCP to gain on the world stage by releasing this thing. The US was already so politically tumultuous, and the 2016 Russian disinformation campaign was <i>so<\/i> much more effective at breaking our democracy apart, with the added benefit of not sending our economy into a global recession as a byproduct.
