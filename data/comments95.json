It&#x27;s slow, 2. One looses a lot of wood due to the chain kerf (thickness), 3. Regular chain sharpening is needed. On the other hand, it is pretty portable as this video shows.<p>I ended up going with the sawmill because it addressed these concerns. The downside being that one has to bring the logs to it. Cost wise it compared pretty equally to larger chainsaw mills I was looking at.<p>Having now used it for a coupe of years, my thoughts are:<p>0. It is amazing to see in action. I recommend watching the videos, but in person it is even better. It&#x27;s the first think you need in order to become a Bond villain.<p>1. You need a <i>lot<\/i> of boards to cover a floor or a wall. It is hard work with my mill, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it with a chainsaw.<p>2. It is surprisingly tiring (I find anything involving forestry is pretty hard on the body)<p>3. You will struggle to make a business out of it (I knew this going in, but just to reiterate)<p>4. Making straight lumber is a little tricky. Trying to do it is trees below 30cm in diameter is pointless. Making boards with a live (i.e. wiggly) edge is the sweet spot.<p>5. While I was super excited about this, it was actually the woodland mills wood chipper that was the better investment.<p>That all being said, it is amazing go fell a tree, then drag it over to the sawmill, cut it, then go and nail it up!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;woodlandmills.eu&#x2F;product&#x2F;hm126&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;woodlandmills.eu&#x2F;product&#x2F;hm126&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-11 13:22:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nkurz"],"id":[22820193],"kids":[22839972,22840339,22820579],"parent":[22819647],"text":["Interesting approach --- I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed that results would turn out as even as they seem to.

Somewhere deep in the comments, he says: &quot;First, you start a shallow straight cut along the guide wire with your chain saw’s tip.

Students should not be using the command line for programming. I believe that forcing students to learn to use command line tools is  the reason why so much software has such horrible user experience. They learn that users don&#x27;t matter unless they&#x27;ve steeped themselves in the arcana of each particular program and have practically become programmers themselves.<p>&gt; Second, it catches some basic mistakes and allows the student to defer learning about the finnicky language requirements that aren’t deemed core to the curriculum, like imports and file naming requirements.<p>I had the exact opposite experience. At university, they sat us down at a Unix shell with almost no instruction on the shell or the compiler. We spent so much time learning the finicky shell requirements (and which we had no clear understanding were part of the shell and not the compiler itself or something else), that we were sidelined from understanding what the compiler was telling us or how it worked. You&#x27;d run your program and if it gave you an error 11, well, you just read and re-read it until you noticed something off.<p>Nowadays with an IDE and a static analyzer, it can show my code and show the exact path of execution that will lead to an invalid memory access before I&#x27;ve even run it. Students can learn to find problems themselves because it&#x27;s laid out right in front of their eyes in relatively-understandable java or C or whatever language they&#x27;re programming in. They don&#x27;t need to worry about, &quot;Oh when I compile on this machine, I have to specify the -I argument to the compiler for includes, but on machines I actually use in real life, I don&#x27;t have to specify anything because it finds all the files I&#x27;m actually using because I put them into the IDE myself and can see their relationships.&quot;<p>&gt; it’s crucial to introduce these inconvenient details eventually.<p>Why? If I&#x27;m going to be downloading my IDE from the Internet or an App Store why the heck should I ever learn fiddly Unix commands? I&#x27;m writing GUI-based applications. I don&#x27;t <i>need<\/i> to understand any of that crap if I don&#x27;t want to. It&#x27;s like saying you can&#x27;t be a taxi driver if you don&#x27;t understand how the carburetor works. Really? My job is to drive the car around, not to fix it. I know a good mechanic who can do that if the need arises. If they want to learn it, then all the better, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a requirement.<p>&gt; What they can’t do, unless they’ve figured it out on their own, is operate a computer outside of the confines of the IDE they’ve been taught.<p>On the contrary, I had no problem operating the GUI-based computers of my day. It was the bizarre, often contradictory commands in the Unix shell that baffled me. Their names were often stupid puns, their &quot;help&quot; pages did no such thing, and I wasted years learning a bunch of stuff that ended up not being very helpful in the real world.<p>&gt; When students have only ever programmed in Java using some bespoke learning library provided by their professor, it will take them much longer than necessary to figure out other languages, other libraries, and other approaches.<p>That has nothing to do with IDEs. That has to do with a deficient teaching environment, and is the exact same problem I described above, which sounds like what the author is advocating.<p>&gt; Teaching someone to use git is very difficult if they’ve never been taught that a file is an logical unit composed of bytes and metadata.<p>No, teaching someone to use git is very difficult because it was designed to be difficult because the self-absorbed creator thinks that people should have to suffer to become good programmers. It&#x27;s just sadistic.<p>&gt; Students need to know how to use computers before they can program them in a serious way.<p>I agree, and what the author is proposing sounds like the opposite of that to me.<p>&gt; After the first foray into programming, take time to teach students about the UNIX command line.<p>Ugh. I disagree strongly with this sentiment. CS students need to get away from the mentality that Unix is the be-all-end-all of operating systems and programming environments and the quicker that happens the better in my opinion."],"time":["2020-04-12 03:54:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["erdos4d"],"id":[22844983],"kids":[22845036,22845435],"parent":[22844788],"text":["Wait, I shouldn&#x27;t make students learn the tool they will be forced to use when they get a job?

My solution was actually quite similar to the author&#x27;s #1 with the major exception being that I used ODG for LibreOffice Draw which mostly solves the author&#x27;s two main complaints here. Background images can be high quality and placing your text is as easy as clicking where you want to place your text box.<p>The only other major difference is that I didn&#x27;t interact with UNO. Since Open Document Format files are zipped XML files I extracted the content.xml and did regular expressions for my variables then replaced them.<p>We did have to do signatures as well but that turns out to be not THAT much of a pain. If you insert an image on top of your form manually then look at the resulting file you can pretty much copy the part of the XML that refers to the inserted image, insert the signature image into the ODG zip and make sure the names line up and it will work.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the practice of editing complex XML with regular expressions is not always advisable. In my experience it works fairly reliably with ODG because the format remains simple. But, with ODT it can result in corrupted files quite easily because additional XML can lie inbetween the text letters of your variables. Then you&#x27;ll be on a mission to find and ignore all the text markup like XML bold markers and span tags and paragraph markers and style tags.... before you know it your simple unzip regex rezip becomes a whole library."],"time":["2020-04-11 05:59:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevenjohns"],"id":[22839787],"kids":{},"parent":[22838417],"text":["There is more than one way to deal with this, unfortunately it&#x27;s all quite messy.

Bob is friends with Mary, and with Pete. But they are also very loose and do not convey any information around belonging&#x2F;precedence&#x2F;ordering, which is a major downside. Associations don&#x27;t have sufficient representational power for capturing structures.<p>Hierarchical relationships are very useful for expressing structure. For modeling real knowledge, you also need the ability to represent <i>multiple hierarchies<\/i>. For example, Bob is Dan and Chloe&#x27;s father (parent-child in one context), and Bob is also Beth and Joe&#x27;s boss (parent-child in another context).

It also allows you to defer the deeper modelling until a use case presents itself and build your hierarchies from the underlying structure of the domain (with data) rather than trying to impose an almost surely incorrectly hypothesis about the structure of the domain from the top down (without data).<p>That said, there are a number of cases where hierarchical taxonomies are vital in building information systems. Some examples.<p>A use case where you need a way to guarantee that a space is completely covered without duplicates (important for accounting, or creating menus). Having a single non-overlapping reference space (like a map) is critical for clear communication.<p>A use case where you need to capture some semi hierarchical knowledge from domain experts, e.g. an org chart, or the parts of a car, or the parts of the brain.<p>Org charts are the perfect example of the tradeoff. Consider the US Department of Defense (don&#x27;t actually do this you will loose your mind). The chain of command is famously a single parent hierarchy, and if it is not, it is a sign that something can go wrong due to conflicting orders. However, let&#x27;s say I wanted to know which branch of the military funded a certain research project based on the office that wrote the RFP. This question is pretty much impossible to answer for an arbitrary RFP, and the time and effort needed to maintain the full associative ontology and keep it up to date is stupefying huge, AND it is not even clear that such an ontology would actually be pointing to anything that was actually meaningful in the real world (beyond ill defined social and economic relationships between arbitrary groups of primates).<p>Hierarchies are an effective way to collect knowledge from domain experts in a systematic way that does not require them to know that they are writing down a bunch of axioms, but instead can just draw a diagram -- multiple hierarchies are very important here, because hierarchies from different experts usually agree at a high level, and then differ in the details, often due to the use case for the knowledge or from the experimental perspective, not because there is some fundamental ontological difference. In this sense having multiple hierarchies is a way around the problem of ambiguity in the meaning of &quot;is a&quot;."],"time":["2020-04-12 00:38:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stillbourne"],"id":[22844522],"kids":{},"parent":[22841171],"text":["Which is just a fancy way of saying favor composition over inheritance."],"time":["2020-04-11 23:50:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dvt"],"id":[22843913],"kids":[22844330],"parent":[22836685],"text":["G.E.

Just like with GUID keys, this can be pre-computed on each client (whereas autoincrement cannot). This approach is very clever IMO because it can be used directly on top of any universal byte[]&#x2F;byte[] key-value store.

From the Wikipedia page for Asian giant hornet [1]:<p>&gt; As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles in much the same way as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of 46 °C (115 °F). In addition, the exertions of the honeybees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ball. At that concentration of CO2, they can tolerate up to 50 °C (122 °F), but the hornet cannot survive the combination of high temperature and high carbon dioxide level. Some bees do die along with the intruder, much as happens when they attack other intruders with their stings, but by killing the hornet scout, they prevent it from summoning reinforcements that would wipe out the entire colony.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Asian_giant_hornet\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Asian_giant_hornet<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-11 15:24:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zkirill"],"id":[22840543],"kids":[22842301,22842291],"parent":[22826773],"text":["They should enlist dragonflies.

In Europe there is now a process where individuals can effectively censor the internet&#x2F;press from publishing factual information about their past transgressions. Ostensibly this is to allow the individual to move on with their life. For example, someone convicted of murder has successfully removed articles related to his murder from the internet (in Europe). This is incredibly dangerous. Why should the government get to decide what fact based censorship is irrelevant or not?

This coupled with lack of comment support hurts code readability. Maybe it could collapse &gt;1 empty lines to just 1 empty line inside.<p>- Defining floats: if you have a program that deals with both floats and has int-based for loops, you can&#x27;t use &quot;floatvars&quot; if I understand correctly. Now, having to add &quot;#&quot; as a suffix for each float variable greatly hurts readability since you now have lines like &quot;z# = x# * x# + y# * y#&quot;<p>- Editor - tries to be too smart at times which hurts basic editing functionality like undo; if I add a line and type something, the cmd-z doesn&#x27;t remove that line, it only removes text in the line. Also, if I type something syntactically wrong, the editor first tries to format&#x2F;transform the code and only then shows an error but doesn&#x27;t then return the code to what it looked like; this makes it hard to fix errors.<p>- Re: editor, why just not use a mature engine like CodeMirror? (and add your own syntax highlighting &#x2F; hints, etc)<p>- Why all those &quot;.&quot; instead of &quot;end&quot; in loops&#x2F;ifs inside functions? This is not explained anywhere and looks a bit obscure in tutorials<p>- Color system with 000-999: a lot of boilerplate to deal with it, troublesome to create palettes and it&#x27;s only 10 bits of color.

I&#x27;m sorry in advance for how rambly this post is.<p>`const fn` is a nice example, because it&#x27;s a large number, but the cognitive impact could be neatly summarized for the general rust userbase by &quot;neat, but I don&#x27;t really care&quot;.  The cognitive impact is directly proportional to how easily we can abstract the changes into a coherent story.  Does it matter that there were exactly 138 &quot;this fn is now const&quot; changes in 1.33?  No, because you already forgot that there were actually only 125.  What&#x27;s the actual difference between 13 extra `const fn` changes and a list of 13 other completely independent changes?  13 arbitrary library changes sound like a lot when they&#x27;re not neatly bounded by a pre-existing frame of reference.  In this case, &quot;this fn is now const&quot; * X where X is &#x27;a big number&#x27; doesn&#x27;t change in cognitive impact when X is replaced with X * 1.1.<p>I think that Kubernetes release notes are another interesting example.  There&#x27;s typically a huge number of changes due to the distributed nature of the project&#x27;s development.  The vast vast majority of the changes would have little to no effect on <i>your<\/i> k8s deployment, but there may be <i>some<\/i> nugget in there that does have a big impact on you.  The problem is that that nugget is different for everyone.<p>So it seems like the key to communicating change may be to present the change <i>in conjunction with<\/i> a carefully selected frame of reference that enables the audience to easily conceptualize the bounds of the effects of the change in relation to their own experience, before being inundated with the details of the change that would only be useful to people occupying a different frame of reference.  The problem is that everyone&#x27;s experience is different and the impact a change will have will greatly depend on who&#x27;s reading.<p>Maybe release posts need old school newspaper-like front pages where changes are scoped and summarized, and details are hidden unless the user wants more.  Or maybe there should be multiple posts from the perspective of different user personas.  But these ideas aren&#x27;t cheap to implement, and the problem seems to approach something like &quot;the fundamental difficulty of communication&quot; which is way beyond my scope of understanding."],"time":["2020-04-11 21:33:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["uluyol"],"id":[22844606],"kids":[22844644],"parent":[22842442],"text":["&gt; ... but soundness fixes happened so little it wasn’t worth talking about.

It threw me for a loop the first time that I saw the spread operator in an assignment in a project I was filing a PR for, and I thought I was on top of all the features.<p>Some changes that stand out to me: the try macro being deprecated was huge, and though the ? Operator is a thousand times nicer, that was a rather radical shift to the ecosystem where you could smell code from yesterday a mile way; I seem to remember try blocks were stabilized then removed but I seem to be mistaken on that count; async of course is a huge change and it absolutely does force you to use it since it’s a contagious language feature in pretty much all languages (I’m very disappointed with tokio on this count and have a feature I’ll probably file a PR for to help reduce this); the change allowing reusing the same variable name inside a match binding as the variable being assigned to was hugely beneficial but quickly broke backwards compatibility because of how nice it was to give up. I think the changes to std::error are also worth mentioning, they might be backwards compatible but they completely obviated an entire generation of crates and coding styles (I for one do not lament the death of quick error and co).<p>I feel a better metric for this might be to study the min rustc version to compile libraries, i.e. community adoption of new or breaking changes. If you take the releases from the top 250 crates in the past few years and see how many rustc versions back from whatever was stable at the time of release could compiled the release, that might give you a more data-oriented result.<p>Also, I think some of the real frustration might be from “core” crate breakage, such as the transition from tokio 0.1 to 0.3 and the ensuing mess or examples like gfx-rs that hundreds of other popular crates built on to get OpenGL support before they completely deprecated it and pivoted altogether such that not all are those crates left based on a dead-ended project but OpenGL users are all SOL (“just a little while  longer!”) as the community-adopted alternative is wgpu which requires Vulcan&#x2F;Metal&#x2F;DirectX until the promised OpenGL support lands there.<p>I’m not complaining; NIH people generally get off easy with community deprecation of popular crates ;) and OSS developers are absolutely not beholden to anyone. But I imagine for developers plugged into the ecosystem, changes to extremely popular crates and changes to the language or standard library might result in a general annoyance that doesn’t distinguish between the two (and that’s also fair since the reason rust has a small standard library is so people use crates which can be more easily replaced or deprecated)."],"time":["2020-04-11 20:33:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["znpy"],"id":[22843113],"kids":[22843144],"parent":[22842442],"text":["Meh.

I have done this since I was a consultant and even now I do it within the company I am at now.<p>1. Heartbeat, which checks the service is responding. Used for HTTP monitoring services to make sure the route is up mainly.<p>2. Heartbeat which checks the service is up and validates all database connections are up and I can get data from the database (usually a trivial query on a small table).  Used as the primary detection for internal failures.<p>3. For any 3rd party services I depend on I setup a heartbeat endpoint for them that will check the service is up (but not necessarily giving me good data).  Usually I group them, sometimes I group and separate them under like &#x2F;heartbeat&#x2F;services, &#x2F;heartbeat&#x2F;service1, &#x2F;heartbeat&#x2F;service2.  Sometimes you can validate the service is returning good data but not all the time is it easy to do that, so I do what I can.<p>4. I setup a 3rd party service to monitor the heartbeats and the return code to validate they are up and properly returning what I expect, notify me if not.  I don&#x27;t have to do sophisticated response processing at the 3rd party service because I can just use http return codes 99% of the time. The detailed response checking is done at the heartbeat level, then a response code generated.  And of course, any failure to respond shows too.<p>This is still not perfect, but it has proven to make sure we know before anyone else when something fails.  I still have one product that we haven&#x27;t converted to this process right now but we are migrating to a new version that has these checks so it will help me sleep better the faster that happens.<p>One key thing is don&#x27;t make the check interval too crazy, the general http is used a lot for the load balancers, but the others are spread out a lot more to reduce creating artificial load.  When we build an independent  service (microservice etc) I make sure they have these same checks, although it might not be http based.

Different android phones handle background bluetooth scanning &#x2F; advertising differently and some tend to require additional config changes - such as disabling battery saving features - to even make it work.\nAnd iOS bluetooth advertising in background is just bad. Since u can&#x27;t add custom UUIDs to the advertisement package, just advertising data is often not enough, so u have to connect too, which creates a range of other problems.\nI suspect they will release OS upgrades to solve some of these issues, but not all devices will be fixable (eg, older Android devices).

We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don&#x27;t. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians.<\/i><p><i>The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here&#x27;s how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I&#x27;ll dig deeper. I&#x27;ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won&#x27;t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I&#x27;ll offer some questions and we&#x27;ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you&#x27;ll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that&#x27;s fine too. It&#x27;s all free. And it&#x27;s all here to help make you a better thinker!<\/i>"],"time":["2020-04-10 04:56:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["the_snooze"],"id":[22827727],"kids":[22830127],"parent":[22826722],"text":["Securing Digital Democracy <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;digital-democracy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;digital-democracy<\/a><p>I went through this not long after it was first offered following the 2012 elections, and it introduced me to the amazing world of security and human factors.

Are there statistics that show that hiring has problems? All of the reasons given in the article are claims without evidence, nor objective comparison to hiring for other industries. When looking for jobs, I’ve never been evaluated on IQ or code alone, it has always come with communication and personality and culture fit evaluations, among many other things. When hiring, my own team does everything this article claims isn’t being done. So I might be completely unaware of the major trends out there... how can I see those trends from where I sit? Are people not getting jobs who should, has there been high unemployment? Are companies not able to hire people? If hiring is broken, what are the problems it’s causing?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a disguised IQ test<p>It is amusing to me that many blog posts and comments around here argue for exactly that under the same banner ‘hiring is broken’.

They take as much time in days as they need, and let us know when you&#x27;re done. The candidate then comes back and hosts a code review in front of our team. I give strict instructions before hand: The purpose of the review is to learn how they thought through the problem and how they solved it, not do criticize their style and approach.<p>3. If we decide we like them to this point, the third interview is with managers from other functions. How well does the candidate communicate, come across to non-developers, express interest in the company and role, etc. It&#x27;s a check point to look for concerning weaknesses, as well as get buy in from the broader organization.<p>This approach so far has yielded excellent results. We ask developers how much time they took in the programming task and why they chose the one they solved. The programming task is telling, not in the quality of their code and how long they took, but how much did they get into it? We have had the range from candidates who did not complete it at all and opted out, to candidates who stumped 40 year veterans with elegant code. In every case, we learn how well they can express their thoughts, and importantly, their level of love for the discipline.

Lots of developers also have responsibilities that use empathy and character and leadership and those people you should always hire along that rubric as well, but if what you need is strong technical skill and ability to solve hard problems with code. You have to find someone who can program well; after that you can have a lot of flexibility in how you work with them and what other responsibilities you give them.

If you don&#x27;t have hard technical problems then you have the luxury of not needing people who are very good technically, so you can have the luxury of rounding out your interview, but if you have programs for which code quality is very important, you should trust someone who can build good software."],"time":["2020-04-11 02:08:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kcorey"],"id":[22840367],"kids":[22846302],"parent":[22828932],"text":["In my experience the UK is slightly less focused on credentials than the backwards boneheads in the US.<p>That&#x27;s the good news.<p>The bad news is that tech interviews in the UK tend toward the same faux-IQ test mentality.<p>When are recruiters going to realise that just because you can reduce a person to a HackerRank score, that doesn&#x27;t inform a good hiring decision?<p>I&#x27;ve often said the <i>only<\/i> way to see how someone is going to work out in an office is to hire them and let them work for a month on probation.

I don&#x27;t enjoy my current job and in order to get the jobs I want with the people I want to work with this is the price. That being said, it&#x27;s absurd we have to do this EVERY DAMN TIME. Even moving between FAANG requires you to do this. That in and of itself is a clear indication of how bad of a signal this interview process is. Reviewing reddit and team blind and HN (as this is the best data that I have), it seems many folks working at a big tech company still need to leetcode to move to another big tech company despite already passing the bar at one! If that isn&#x27;t a clear indication of the type of information these interviews provide I don&#x27;t know what other evidence we need.<p>And here is the real crux of the whole thing. Considering how standard it is, we might as well just make it a part of a software developer certification&#x2F;license that you have to do once to break into the industry. The funny thing is, despite our best efforts to not become a real standard profession we are behaving a lot like one, except we don&#x27;t realize it and keep making candidates jump through the same hoops repeatedly.<p>Now many of you will balk at the prospect of standardizing but hear me out. Are we really that different from any other profession? At the end of the day most CS curriculums are very much the same. Why can&#x27;t we do standardized tests to &quot;pass the bar&quot; so to speak? And additional certifications can be taken for specialties (e.g. ML, Cyber Security, Finance etc.) like in many other engineering professions or like specializing in medicine.<p>Yes, knowing algorithms and data structures IS imporant to being a good software developer, even if you are building CRUD or mobile apps. But, how many times to do I need to prove I know them? Yes, showing leadership skills IS important to being a good software developer. But isn&#x27;t being a leader mostly about conflict management, moral obligation and being ethical?<p>Maybe we can stop fearing becoming a real profession that is beholden to standards and public scrutiny and embrace it. It will end up being better for everyone.<p>For juniors (not in age, but in experience), it offers a consistent predictable way to learn and grow, and a set of criteria they can focus on learning to land junior positions. From there we can treat them like apprentices, and to get certification you need to spend x number of years being supervised. This allows companies to also retain their junior talent for longer and their investment in their training can pay off in the long run because even if they lose a junior who&#x27;s now certified, they can hire a recently certified intermediate from another company!<p>For seniors, it means we can focus on demonstrating why we are seniors (i.e. I&#x27;ve built these systems, led these projects, etc.), and offers a real honest predictable path to becoming a staff or principal (i.e. a master).<p>For companies, it means they can focus on hiring PEOPLE, not leetcoding machines. They shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about assessing the technical skills of individuals. The only reason they do so is because they feel they have to. If they had confidence that the people they are interviewing are likely qualified as it is, then they can actually focus their time and effort on more important things to assess such as if a person is a good fit for the mission. People assume companies do this because they want to haze candidates. The reality is, companies just don&#x27;t have any better way of de-risking their hires at this time.<p>We can revisit the criteria regularly to make sure the tests we need to pass represent what it means to be do our jobs and do them well. We can have industry input, academic input and so on. We can even have the professional body accredit programs so as not to have candidates waste their time and to ensure academic programs keep up with the advances industry makes. Further, we can make this a global thing.<p>Rather than shunning becoming a true profession, let&#x27;s learn from the mistakes of other professions and build a process that helps everyone."],"time":["2020-04-10 17:21:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kafrofrite"],"id":[22831620],"kids":{},"parent":[22828932],"text":["Just adding on the post. I used to work for big tech companies, I interviewed for some and also I had the pleasure of interviewing candidates. I mostly interviewed for security related roles but at some stage, I had constantly positive feedback from the candidate so I was thrown in to interview candidates for other roles as well.<p>I agree with the article, and had my fair share of bad apples so my thoughts here. \nUnless the role was something that required dealing with incidents, there was no point on doing a technical interview onsite and seeing how the candidate reacts under stress. Generally, noone cares how well a candidate performs under stress. Instead, I&#x27;d let them deal with technical problems on their own time, if they wanted and tell them to spend no more than 2 days (I&#x27;d actually kill the instance to ensure that). For security positions, I ended up building a CTF platform and told them to solve as many challenges as they wish and send back a report.<p>For the onsite interviews, we did mostly cultural interviews. \nThere was a bit of technical questions involved, mostly open-ended questions to see how they approached a problem. This usually was to design some system or, given a tiny codebase, how they&#x27;d go implementing a feature.\nAlso, I did what we ended up naming &quot;spirals&quot;. Successive questions, increasing in difficulty to see how much in depth they went during their research. E.g. Traceroute -&gt; Ping -&gt; ICMP -&gt; Differences in Linux vs Windows. This had two benefits. It was clear how much in depth they would go and two, it was almost guaranteed that at some point they wouldn&#x27;t know the answer, which is fine, but forces them to explain how they would go to find the answer.\nAlmost always, I&#x27;d tell them whether they were on the right path and if they were stuck kinda help them. \nI&#x27;d give about 5-10 minutes for the candidate to ask me anything. Literally, anything. For me, this was important because I would get a sense for how candidates evaluated the company and what they were interested in.<p>Beyond that, at some stage, we added some questions called internally the &quot;I read it on the internet&quot;. The questions were pretty straightforward, e.g. given a terminal, tell me how would you ssh in this box as XYZ user or how would you rm a directory. Fun fact. I initially made fun of the operations guys asking those questions until I interviewed a series of people where noone knew how to do simple stuff with their terminals.\nBtw, I didn&#x27;t focus at all on technologies. Given the size of the company, asking &quot;How much you know about $LANGUAGE&quot; would be futile. I wanted to hire people who could pick up new technologies and, given the size of the company most of the tools were custom-built or heavily modified. It was pointless asking &quot;$LANGUAGE&quot; and then telling them &quot;Well, great, just keep in mind we don&#x27;t actually use exactly $LANGUAGE but rather our own version of it&quot;. \nLast, and probably the most important. I asked myself how I wanted to be treated during an interview. I kept in mind that I generally wanted to be treated with dignity and respect, I kept in mind that the resume is basically a snapshot of someone&#x27;s life and the candidate is a human being and acted accordingly. Also, I valued for candidates who asked for feedback and actually I&#x27;d give them some and tell them stuff to read reg. things I felt they could do better. Btw, I also assumed that each candidate would get an offer and I didn&#x27;t want them coming in and thinking &quot;That&#x27;s the idiot that was acting cocky during the interview&quot;."],"time":["2020-04-10 12:28:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["redis_mlc"],"id":[22829154],"kids":[22829240,22829429,22829170],"parent":[22828932],"text":["The interview question that best exemplifies what Neil wrote is, &quot;Did you write it yourself, or as part of a team?&quot;<p>Both answers are wrong, depending on the interviewer.<p>If you say &quot;yourself&quot;, you&#x27;re admitting you&#x27;re a lone wolf.
