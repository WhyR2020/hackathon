From time to time, a repository might go down, or it might be moved to another address, or a library might be migrated to another repository. Whenever this happens, your build might break. The solution is to proxy all requests at the organizational level through your own server which keeps a mirror of any package that has been referenced once. That way, if it become unavailable externally, then you can still use it internally.

Specifically:<p>1. The sandboxing via --allow-net, --allow-fs, etc is very odd to me. I don&#x27;t recall hearing about a lot of security issues that could have been prevented by this. I mean, I suppose this won&#x27;t hurt anyone, but it&#x27;s certainly never something that I&#x27;ve wanted. I expect most people will simply white-list most access by default in all new projects.<p>2. deno bundle: Initially, when I heard about this, I was excited. The need to bundle code via webpack and similar systems is one of the worst things about front end browser development. It introduces tons of complexity and makes debugging much harder. So I thought, wow, maybe deno is going to just give us a first-class solution to this problem that will just work. Nope. They are only concerned with bundling code such that it can be run elsewhere by deno. A friend put it thus: &quot;we don&#x27;t want bundlers anymore, so we&#x27;re making deno bundle, the one true bundler!&quot; &quot;does it do any of the stuff that webpack does?&quot; &quot;mostly no, because it&#x27;s not meant for that&quot; Read the comments on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;denoland&#x2F;deno&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2475\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;denoland&#x2F;deno&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2475<\/a> to get a sense of what I&#x27;m complaining about.<p>3. URL Imports. Packages in node.js are stupendously easy to use. Making me import from a URL instead of typing `yarn add foo` and `import * as foo from &#x27;foo&#x27;` does not make my life any easier. It certainly makes the implementation easier, and I&#x27;m glad to see the last of node_modules and path-climbing module resolution. But the URL-based system offers no equivalent that I can see to lock files and automatic upgrades (e.g. `yarn upgrade`), which are two crucial features. This is something that node developers need and want, and if Deno doesn&#x27;t provide it, 3rd parties will. My worry is that we&#x27;ll end up with competing third-party solutions and a fractured ecosystem, due to Deno&#x27;s failure of leadership here.<p>4. Stack traces: The single worst thing about using node is the frequency with which you get utterly useless stack traces that tell you nothing about the true source of the error. It was easier to debug C++ programs 20 years ago that it is to debug node.js apps today. But as far as I can tell, deno isn&#x27;t making any efforts to improve this. That&#x27;s ok, they don&#x27;t have to fix every problem. But it does make me worry that they don&#x27;t know what node.js developers actually care about, if this wasn&#x27;t on their &quot;must fix&quot; list.<p>5. Typescript by default. I really like typescript. I mostly want to use it instead of javascript these days. But tsc is slow. Slooooooow. Really really slow. I am worried that most deno programs are going to be very slow to start up in practice. (Before you say &quot;caching&quot;, 99% of the time that you want to start a program, it&#x27;s because you just changed the source code. caching can only do so much in this case). And I am extremely skeptical of the plan to build a new typescript compiler in rust.<p>I&#x27;ll conclude with praising a few things that I am very glad to see: No more node_modules, Web APIs, and a promise-based stdlib."],"time":["2020-05-14 04:55:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jariel"],"id":[23174805],"kids":{},"parent":[23172483],"text":["&quot;It&#x27;s important to understand that Deno is not a fork of Node - it&#x27;s a completely new implementation. &quot;<p>New implementation of WHAT?

Deno uses my private key to inform the DNS that it exists and is serving traffic.  (Much like any Dynamic DNS server.)<p>4) My friend does the same - makes a public &#x2F; private key pair, finds a DNS he likes, uploads his public key, makes a Deno server and registers it with the DNS.<p>5) My friend and I trade DNS+public keys.  It&#x27;s a URL to the DNS that has the public key in it.<p>6) I go to some administrator page on my Deno, it looks a lot like this [1].  I create a new Connection, and plug in the DNS+public key of my friend.  He does the same on his server.<p>7) On my admin page, I pick an app that I want to use to communicate with my friend.  I can see a list of my Connections, and I just check off a box that the app has permission to communicate with that friend.<p>8) This app that I&#x27;ve picked, it only sees the world through an incredibly narrow API.  It&#x27;s like WireGuard.  Deno handles all of the communication and permissions, much like Sandstorm.io.  The first thing I want is just queued-up JSON messaging.  The app can send and receive JSON messages.  I envision that I want it to be in messaging mode (rather than &quot;streaming online&quot;), so it has something like ZeroMQ under the hood to pub&#x2F;sub, client&#x2F;server, all that.  But roughly it has a bi-directional pipe for sending and receiving JSON and can queue up messages when the other server is offline.<p>9) I now have a sandboxed app that can&#x27;t talk to the rest of the world, has its own private VPN-like connection to another process.  All traffic is encrypted like WireGuard.  The DNS aspect lets my friend move his server if the IP changes.<p>I feel like if some project kind of like Sandstorm, kind of like Dynamic DNS, kind of like WireGuard, and kind of like Deno all got together, they would make a beautiful thing.<p>When I think about how I wish Diaspora worked, as a way to replace Facebook, this is it.  I wish it was built on top of something like this.  This is the atomic unit of distributed, yet safe, that I wish internet apps were made out of.  I imagine that I would be setting up hosting of the Deno server nodes for my friends and family, since I&#x27;m their tech support guy.  But they&#x27;d be in charge of their own connections and apps in their nodes.<p>So, HN, time for you to tell me that it&#x27;s 1) a terrible idea, 2) already exists, 3) why don&#x27;t I just make it myself.

This was about 2004. Their demo blew away executives in particular. They showed multicolored lights casting multicolored shadows on a single high detail character. One of the lights was behind a stained glass window, projecting beautiful patterns. Soon after a deal was signed to use the engine throughout the entire studio. In retrospect that was a good decision and I have a lot of respect for Unreal Engine and Epic in general.<p>Edit: found the video of the demo levels that shipped with very early UE3 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1m7T5ay_8DI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1m7T5ay_8DI<\/a><p>However UE3-generation games that finally shipped had none of the visual effects from the early demos. The multicolored shadows could only be rendered with multiple passes, at least one per light, which proved to be too expensive for larger dynamic game scenes. It took years of work from the demo to shipped games, and an army of unnamed engineers to wrestle the technology into a product.<p>UE4 had a great early demo of dynamic global illumination using something like voxel cone tracing if I remember correctly.

My pet theory on this is that US CS PhD students are exposed to globalization in a big way. If you look at figure D2 in the 2018 Taulbee Survey by the Computing Research Association [0], you can see that nonresident aliens as a fraction of enrollments in US and Canadian CS PhD programs rose from around 40% in the mid ninties to 64% in 2015, 2016, and 2017.<p>On the one hand I think it&#x27;s great that the US and Canada continue to attract research talent from around the world. But on the other hand I suspect that the increased competitiveness has changed the nature of the PhD program in computer science. I think that professors these days have so many options for grad students that they can choose students with specialized experience in their research field, which means that any &quot;exploratory&quot; phase of the PhD process has shrunk significantly. In the article, the author says that CMU expects students to choose an advisor within a month or two of starting the program, and I guess that in reality most students have applied to work with a specific advisor before stepping foot on campus. I wonder has it always been the case? Can anyone - maybe someone who did a PhD at CMU or elsewhere more than a decade ago - shed any light here?<p>Of course the increased competitiveness of US CS PhD programs is just conjecture on my part. It could be that the increase in nonresident alien enrollment just means that many US and Canadian citizens are not interested in a CS PhD these days, and that the PhD programs haven&#x27;t really changed, which also sounds plausible. From my experience during my short PhD attempt, the amount of time spent studying (classes, reading papers, etc) versus simply working for an advisor was smaller than I expected, and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because of a real change in the PhD process or simply my own naïveté.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cra.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;2018_Taulbee_Survey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cra.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;2018_Taulbee_Surv...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-14 10:05:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pnathan"],"id":[23171928],"kids":[23180669,23171950],"parent":[23164618],"text":["Very interested in working through the PhD as a mid-career SW engineer with a MS.

The current knowledge is that the flower opens as type A and then closes and reopens later as type B. The one type pollinates the other type. Some varieties will have type B during the day, allowing immediate cross polination between that tree and the other variety with the type A open at that time.<p>Now, the part where I say research is lacking: As general advice in farming circles, people currently tend to use a B type cross pollinator (a second cultivar in about 1&#x2F;20 trees) for a A type tree. However, there are cases of monocultivar orchards with very high yields that don&#x27;t have the cross pollinators. So, if the tree opens at night as type B, it means there is something that is active at night that pollinates the trees (I&#x27;ll give you a hint, bees sleep at night)...<p>I&#x27;ve tried to summarise something that is a bit more complicated, so I hope it makes sense. Another thing you&#x27;ll point out is that the insect that&#x27;s active at night would also need to be active during the day if it&#x27;s pollinating with pollen from earlier the same day. Otherwise you&#x27;ll still need some access to a type A flower at night. In any case, my main point is that studying the night phase of the flowers is something that I don&#x27;t know a lot of farmers are doing.

Schools years ago no longer may keep physical journals around because they use this system.<p>Peak was usually when semester end was coming. Currently, daily, we must sustain 2x of that peak, but peaked at 3x of that on the first day &quot;remote schools opened&quot;. The everyday traffic is currently like almost 3x it would have been, measuring by requests per second received on frontends.<p>We were struggling usually at end of semester. Luckily we stated to do some upgrades and optimizations to handle that, just before the lockdown started. In the end, we can now sustain many more times traffic we have. The hardest part wasn&#x27;t adding more resources (that was a MUST for sure) but it was much more effort to handle stuff that scales vertically (SQL) and some file share issues.<p>So there were some intermittent issues that were frustrating the users, sometimes bringing whole site down for minutes. (Sometimes is the trickiest part to handle). That includes hunting down expensive queries (not so hard), calling less or more optimal queries, taming SQL plan cache and dealing with some NTFS stuff for file share.<p>Some of the issues couldn&#x27;t be solved solely throwing more hardware in.<p>I&#x27;m still puzzled for the file share issue on Windows. Yeah, not so clever to store millions of files in a single folder within NTFS filesystem. We have append-only share, no deletes ever happening. Stuff like timestamps and short paths were disabled, defragmented $mft and the likes, but... every ~24 hours the drive would become sooo painfully slow and inacessible. Some access denied errors get thrown, etc. And it continues for some minutes. Maybe 15. Sometimes more. But between that ~15min period it works, so it&#x27;s like a wave with some period. But the thing is, outside of this window, the file share works very good (with all those millions of files within a folder). They were never deleted and we didn&#x27;t need to enumerate - just fetch file by file.<p>No, Antivirus wasn&#x27;t at fault, no backup system wasn&#x27;t messing around. Is there stuff NTFS may do under the hood on SSD drives? I&#x27;m aware there is a TRIM process, but as I understand it has to deal when the stuff is being deleted from the SSD?<p>We moved to rotating disks (!) and split those files across few folders and got rid of those issues.
