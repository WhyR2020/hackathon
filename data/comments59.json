Better materials for toothed belts have helped. Those have more space to absorb a shock load. Researchers like harmonic drives, because they can put a big reduction in a small package, but harmonic drives are especially vulnerable to broken gear teeth on overload.<p>Direct drive, without gears or belts, would be nice. The advantage of direct drive is, as someone said a century ago in the context of electric locomotives, &quot;You cannot strip the teeth of a magnetic field.&quot; Washing machine motors are often direct drive today.

If your page fault handler gets called, you know that the password comparison got past the first &quot;a&quot; and tried to check the second &quot;a&quot;. If you get a &quot;wrong password&quot; error, you know that the first &quot;a&quot; was wrong.<p>In the latter case, bump the first character and try again. You can discover the first character this way in at most N tries, where N is the number of characters in the character set used for passwords.<p>One you have the first character, repeat, this time with the page boundary between the second and third characters. Similar for the rest of the characters.<p>TOP-10 had lots of interesting security oversights. For example, the login system call, which was used by the login program to actually log you in once it verified your credentials, did not actually require any privileges. Its only restriction was that it only worked when executed by a process that was not logged in.<p>It turned out the login program was not the only program that could be run without logging in. You could also run the program to show the print queue. That program had a command to run other programs. Thus, you could walk up to any terminal that no one was logged in on, run the queue program telling it to run the debugger, and then from the debugger execute a login system call to login to any account you wanted. Oops.<p>TOP-10 also had some security things it did way better than Windows or Unix do today, such as access control lists. It used a totally different model than the &quot;ACL as part of the file metadata for the file the ACL controls&quot; model.<p>Instead, the way ACLs worked is that first the system checked the normal file permissions. If they allowed the access, it was allowed. If they denied the access, it then checked a flag that said the caller wanted to check ACLs. If that flag was not set, the access failed. If the flag was set, the kernel sent a message to a user-mode daemon, FILDAE, describing the desired access. FILDAE then got to decide if the access should be allowed or not.<p>The way FILDAE worked is that a user could have a file, ACCESS.USR, which FILDAE consulted. I don&#x27;t remember if it looked for ACCESS.USR in the same directory as the file someone was trying to access, or the home directory of the file owner, or something else.<p>ACCESS.USR contained access rules, one per line. An access rule could specify a file or files (wildcards were allowed), a user (wildcards allowed), a group (wildcards allowed), an accessing program (wildcards allowed), type of access, and whether it was allowed or not.<p>So for example, if you wrote a game and wanted to maintain a high score file, you could put rules in ACCESS.USR that specified that anyone could write to that specific file if and only if they were running your game.<p>You could develop simple naming conventions that fit your security model, such as files whose name started with &quot;pub&quot; in a directory were publicly readable, and files whose names started with &quot;prv&quot; were not, and you could easily make exceptions for particular files or people or programs.<p>I think this fits in a lot better with the way most people naturally thing about access rules, making it a lot easier to avoid ACL mistakes.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a FILDAE for current systems. (Although to be fair, it does add some complexity that ACLs in metadata do not have. Because it was a separate daemon, there was the issue of communication between it and the kernel. People found some bugs that let them get FILDAE and the kernel confused about which FILDAE replies went with which requests)."],"time":["2020-08-28 18:14:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["luizfelberti"],"id":[24305944],"kids":[24306374,24306101,24308294,24306350,24306462,24306004],"parent":[24305247],"text":["Step 1) Use Scrypt instead<p>Step 2) There is no step 2"],"time":["2020-08-28 17:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SQueeeeeL"],"id":[24308626],"kids":[24308756,24309022],"parent":[24308061],"text":["Seems like another one of those, pay 2,000 for <i>access<\/i> groups that entirely expects to rent seek on what is essentially a really good irc group (which are FREE to start and join).

But it’d be really nice if it was possible. As it stands, Photos on my phone is consuming a lot of storage space from photos that were removed months ago. The only path forward in order to reclaim my storage is to do a factory reset – I just haven’t gotten around to it yet because I have some device-only data that I need to save elsewhere first.<p>And furthermore, in this way, if I could replace some of the built-in apps along with their integrations, with custom alternate apps of my own.

The hardware, operating system, and applications were designed with everything a security professional loves in mind. Even so, modern systems are too large and too complex to be bullet-proof.&quot;<p>That statement, and many others like it in the article, leads you to believe that the systems are good, but provides no actionable information other than a hedge saying that the system is imperfect. How imperfect is it? What is a viable threat? What quantitative effect do the mitigations have? Without this type of information it is just parroting content-free marketing speak.<p>Here is actionable information. Bug bounties correlate strongly to the cost of discovery for a class of attack. Therefore, Apple thinks it takes less than $1M to create a remote no-install zero-click kernel arbitrary code execution [1]. If you need one click, then $250K. If you need an install, then $150K. Given the nature of software, after such an attack is discovered it can be deployed in bulk with minimal extra effort, so you really need to divide the cost over the number of targets that can feasibly be attacked to evaluate the &quot;marginal cost per attack&quot;. How widely you think a remote no-install zero-click attack can be distributed will tell you what that number is.<p>To provide an example of such an attack here is a post-mortem done by Google Project Zero of 5 exploit chains being exploited for 2.5 years before discovery [2]. They mention that the sites received thousands of visitors per week, so a conservative estimate would be 130k visitors&#x2F;5 exploits for an average of 26k targets per exploit. Assuming this falls under the first category of attack, that means the marginal cost to fully compromise an iPhone is ~$40.<p>So, the total effect of every mitigation they do is raising the cost of exploiting to $40&#x2F;iPhone which is not secure by any objective metric.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;security-bounty&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;security-bounty&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;a-very-deep-d...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-28 23:55:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lapcatsoftware"],"id":[24310756],"kids":[24312075],"parent":[24309390],"text":["&quot;In the battle over the security and privacy of my phone, I am happy to pay a premium knowing that my information is safe and sound, and that it is not going to be sold to the highest bidder.&quot;<p>Meanwhile, &quot;Secret Service Bought Phone Location Data from Apps, Contract Confirms&quot;. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgxk3g&#x2F;secret-service-phone-location-data-babel-street\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgxk3g&#x2F;secret-service-pho...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 00:12:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["emsy"],"id":[24310190],"kids":[24310346,24312009],"parent":[24309390],"text":["This article does not answer the question how Apple‘s privacy and security model would be impacted by 3rd party stores.

It allows repeater owners to link two or more repeaters together over the Internet so that a transmission into one repeater results in a transmission _out_ of multiple repeaters, effectively giving your transmission wider coverage, or coverage in multiple geographical locations.<p>2. The Echolink clients allow licensed amateur radio operators to receive and transmit on VHF&#x2F;UHF repeaters around the world from their desktop or mobile devices.<p>3. The Echolink server allows amateur radio operators to turn their own radios into internet-connected nodes so that they can access them away from home, or allow others to use their radios over the Echolink network.<p>4. The Echolink network has topic-specific conference rooms that hams can join with their client. Or, repeater owners can temporarily have their repeater join a conference room. For example, there is almost certainly one or more dedicated to the hurricane events happening in the southern US right now.<p>The &quot;official&quot; Echolink client and server software is closed-source, this is an open source implementation.<p>You need to have an amateur radio license to sign up for an account on the Echolink network, because anything you transmit into the network might go out over the airwaves somewhere and you need a license and call sign to do that."],"time":["2020-08-28 17:24:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["whitehouse3"],"id":[24303559],"kids":[24303616],"parent":[24302735],"text":["I wonder how common is EchoLink among other newer protocols like C4FM?

Similarly if someone has urges towards their gender but would prefer for whatever reason (to be more normal, to follow their religion, to have kids, ...) they would like to have urges towards the opposite gender, I see no problem with voluntery conversion therapy.<p>One big pet peeves of mine with a lot of left leaning people is that they are pro gay because &quot;it is their choice and doesn&#x27;t effect me&quot; yet they are against voluntery conversion even though the same logic holds.

I highly recommend this method as it results in far better channel performance.<p>NCPACKET.ORG has 35 stations in a well thought out network, and they can run IRC-LIKE 20-way chat sessions which are lively and non-directed, with impunity, and low latency (60 seconds or less from end to end of an 8-hop-wide network)."],"time":["2020-08-28 20:02:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vidanay"],"id":[24307725],"kids":[24309147],"parent":[24307496],"text":["Looks like someone read my other comment :-)"],"time":["2020-08-28 19:41:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arcticbull"],"id":[24301975],"kids":[24302128,24302069,24302093,24302227,24302142,24313091,24302233,24302039,24302103],"parent":[24301427],"text":["Block reward rate: 6.25BTC. 144 blocks are mined per day.

Because I&#x27;m not seeing that in this article.<p>The problem with Bitcoin as a value store is the value it has. I&#x27;d argue that the current Bitcoin value is based on speculation and not on anything concrete. Oil and gold obviously have very concrete practical uses, since we can use them to make our cars move, our houses warm and our computers do something.<p>US Dollar obviously is less concrete since its value is based on people agreeing that it has a value - but it has a very large backing. Obviously there&#x27;s a country where 300+ million people have agreed that the US Dollar has value and you can find someone to trade in your dollars all around the world.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not completely impressed with the comparison between gold and Bitcoin. First of all, fixed scarcity? Is this actually a good thing? And is Bitcoin actually scarce? How does hard forking affect the scarcity? And is there a reason why any singular fork of Bitcoin is the one and true cryptocurrency? Because if there&#x27;s something with no scarcity, it&#x27;s cryptocurrency in general.<p>&quot;Software durability&quot; also is pretty funny. I don&#x27;t consider software all that durable. How much cryptocurrency has been stolen through software exploits, be it within a cryptocurrency itself or via some adjecent software, thus far?<p>Portability and storage for Bitcoin also sound pretty good at first. However, if you&#x27;re thinking about a value storage, is portability actually that good? If I want to store $500k as an asset, I don&#x27;t actually want it to be that portable since I don&#x27;t want anyone else be taking it. $500k in gold is like 8 kg, so at least it&#x27;s not something that someone can sneak out or take from across the world.

There won&#x27;t be a single new 4th gen Supra produced. I would argue vintage cars are the most similar asset to bitcoin. Since like cars, some bitcoin is continually lost and destroyed every day. Like bitcoin, cars are simply worth whatever someone is willing to pay. The market for  cars is not logical, it is purely emotional. Yes, toyota supra prices will likely not collapse anytime soon, since they look cool and there are less and less examples every day.

Certainly, you&#x27;re not aiming to remove features or break workflows, but there exists a world in which some percentage N of users who are affected negatively by a change are not worth the effort of maintaining something. I think this viewpoint ignores that often as software gets more use and grows, our understanding of the problem-space and relevant abstraction grows as well. Black &amp; white statements about what is or isn&#x27;t allowed by developers in their products regarding updates completely ignores this aspect of development. Granted, if you can choose when to upgrade and to what version to upgrade this is less of an issue. Modern app stores do not function for the user in this respect.<p>As for the interface being updated: it happens. Sometimes it is worse, but then many times people only complain about things being &quot;worse&quot; because of assimilation bias. There&#x27;s some fantastic reading about not necessarily catering to power users: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;c011&#x2F;4ca106ff22cf53aaed57d95adcb7ef306378.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;c011&#x2F;4ca106ff22cf53aaed57d9...<\/a>. I don&#x27;t think I would 100% agree with that full article, but a lot of the central premises hold up.<p>As for killing compatibility with plug-ins or third party add-ons, I am upset by this as anyone but sometimes it needs to happen. Sometimes a breaking bug is abused by a third party for bad reasons as much as they can be for good reasons (e.g. banning add-ons that use exploits to mine bitcoin or data from users, even if the add-on was offering up a useful feature as well).<p>Now, relating to Firefox&#x27;s recent Android update that breaks a lot of things, and even their behaviour for deprecating XUL in the past (I&#x27;m not referring to how long they gave people to upgrade, which was fair, but rather that some XUL features were never duplicated in webextensions thereby rendering some extensions impossible to reproduce), I would argue that yeah, maybe there is some sense of truth or some imperative that we need heed in the article. However, I think most of this would be mitigated by being able to pin versions, ask for a specific version from a specific date, or rollback.

Does Apple still allow for models like that?<p>The model currently used by a number of apps - webapps, Electron apps, browsers, operating systems - is that of the &quot;evergreen&quot; model, where they continuously update. But this is where Firefox is dropping a bollock; they do BIG updates, rebrand it with things like Quantum, and push MAJOR UI updates.<p>Contrast this with Chrome which, from a user (i.e. my) perspective has only done incremental updates. UI changes have been small and subtle. This page [1] has a number of screenshots from the old version of Chrome. I have a dark theme going on now but it&#x27;s not changed that much at all. Chrome has never been a brand, hardly a product, as opposed to Firefox which is still stuck in the 90&#x27;s &#x2F; 2000&#x27;s where they only get interest if they do a new version.<p>That was the old model for Windows, Office, Adobe products, etc for a long time as well - they HAD to make a new &quot;big&quot; version to keep sales going. But customers did not HAVE to update, so they would often stick with older versions - things that worked - and e.g. Adobe HAD to come up with new features to convince people to upgrade.<p>But it&#x27;s all gone to subscription services now, which come with &quot;evergreen&quot; updates.<p>One more anecdote I&#x27;d like to do: I&#x27;ve been using 1password for years now, because for me it worked best as a crossplatform password manager (Windows, Mac &amp; iOS, synchronization via Dropbox). They switched to a subscription model a while ago, but the versions I have were all paid for in single purchases. On Windows I&#x27;m still on 1password 4 while on Mac it&#x27;s 1password 7, and thankfully the two are still fully compatible when it comes to their data. I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t last, but as long as I don&#x27;t HAVE to update (and as long as their encryption is solid), it&#x27;ll be fine to just keep the version I have now - That is one company &#x2F; product that cannot afford to be flippant about their customer data, data format.

The Celera 500L’s rear-mounted propeller is a good choice for a more fuel-efficient plane, Alonso said. But the egg-like fuselage probably is less fuel-efficient than the narrower fuselages on planes such as the PC-12, he pointed out.<p>&gt;Mark Drela, an MIT aeronautical engineer, is equally skeptical. “The 500L looks fairly well-designed,” Drela told The Daily Beast, “but I cannot say whether it’s close to optimum, or whether the diesel engine makes sense.”<p>&gt; To say for sure, Drela said he’d need to know how much the Celera 500L weighs and how efficient its engine is. Since Otto isn’t talking, Drela can only guess.

We shy away from hard work because inherent in hard work is risk. Hard work is hard because you might fail. You can’t fail at long work, you merely show up. You fail at hard work when you don’t make an emotional connection, or when you don’t solve the problem or when you hesitate.<p>I disagree with this, at least what the author classifies as risk. I&#x27;m more than happy to take on challenging work, work I am emotionally connected to and want to see succeed--then fail. I can deal with failure and progress on just fine because I have pretty iron clad motivation. I&#x27;ve worked in R&amp;D environments most my life and I can assure you, research has a lot of failure if you&#x27;re doing it correctly.<p>The risk that makes certain work &quot;hard&quot; vs others is that failure results in livelihood setbacks: not having food, not having a place to live, financial failure, health risks, not having any bit of job security, etc. Those to me are the real risks people shy away from when we talk about &quot;hard&quot; work.<p>Give me a difficult&#x2F;creative problem or task and I can try for hours, days, weeks, months, years... to find a solution, but only if I know at the end of the day I&#x27;ll have a reasonably comfortable life.<p>The way a lot of work is structured, I find &quot;hard&quot; work is that which has inherent livelihood risk to the person doing the work in some way, shape, or form. It could be health risk work (say a police officer), failed research resulting in lack of a job, or a poor new art collection that ruins the future career of an artist.<p>Our society needs to learn to be more accepting to to a few more degrees of failure than the hypercompetiveness currently allows. Less and less failure is being acceptable and it&#x27;s completely unrealistic to hold all humans to these standards. Yes, we should reward high risk success but should we punish every form of failure as we often do?
