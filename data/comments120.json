What behaviors of your own would you acknowledge may or may not contribute to the overall ‘health’ of HN?<p>Active, knowledgeable, and able to refute obviously bad points (though it still has its circlejerks at times) -- I would characterize this as healthy.  HN also has a specific focus -- highly technical -- and is free of ads and other unwelcome overt marketing (though I&#x27;m 100% sure there is covert marketing happening).  It is an organ of YCombinator, so some degree of start-up shilling is expected and tolerated (even welcome, sometimes), but again it is expected and thus easy to avoid or ignore.<p>HN also is able to get rid of or generally marginalize the few, obviously toxic posters.  They show up, no doubt, but are fairly hard to find compared to some of the clearly bad-faith subreddits like fatpeoplehate or the like.<p>&gt;How did you get into HN? Who introduced you? What makes you stay?<p>Regular reddit and slashdot user, lots of overlap with those sites.  I stay mostly because it is a fairly healthy tech forum; see the reasons above.  HN also represents (generally) an older (as in, not 19-year-old wanna be hacker, but like 29-45 year old who has been around) professional crowd, with a very heavy focus on tech.  That said, HN also has enough people who aren&#x27;t in IT to keep it interesting.  The level of education and overall work experience is <i>considerably<\/i> higher than a lot of other forums, as is the &quot;grown-up-in-the-room&quot;, peer-to-peer feel of the place.  By comparison, some subreddits like r&#x2F;relationships or r&#x2F;legaladvice is full of people talking entirely out of their ass, or with no sense of reality or self-awareness (or just straight up trolling)."],"time":["2020-03-27 20:47:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gintery"],"id":[22708190],"kids":[22708560],"parent":[22704051],"text":["This site suffers from extreme group-think.

Is there a way I can subscribe to get the results of your study?<p>1. Criteria for health in online communities: users are sincere and extend goodwill towards each other when they discuss topics. Many users (more than a tiny minority) contribute original ideas, personal stories and evidence of things they make. There is some effort required to contribute but members are incentivized to try by the anticipated responses and reactions of other members. Moderation is predictable and is emotionally intelligent. A critical mass of users are mature enough that norms don’t quickly change, and there is no mechanism a small minority can use to be over-represented when administration considers the wishes of the community (i.e. the Metafilter problem.) The community does not believe that its comments are the main attraction to the site. This isn’t a complete list.<p>2. How the criteria differs from offline community health: online communities are mostly discussion whereas offline communities work together, share meals, and so on, so it’s vital for the discussion to be high quality online in order for the community to be healthy. Offline communities have greeting and parting rituals that shape them.<p>3. How HN exemplifies healthy or unhealthy behaviors: HN mostly exemplifies healthy behaviors. There is a minority of users who are too immature and inexperienced to make valuable contributions, and a smaller minority who are antisocial. This percentage doesn’t seem to be increasing quickly, though. A substantial number of HN users believe comments are the main draw to the site, which is an unhealthy mindset to the degree those users are willing to let the quality of the links and text posts degrade.<p>4. Behaviors of my own that contribute: I try to extend goodwill towards users and encourage discussion of particulars, rather than fighting over general statements. On the other hand, I have a tendency to participate in inconsequential&#x2F;creativity-free conversations that need to stay below a threshold to continue to attract users who have more to offer. I also downvote a lot of comments that attack other users or write unhinged, insubstantial polemics.<p>5. How I got into HN: I came here from a Paul Graham essay in 2008-2009 (different username.) He had a link to HN on his personal site. At the time, I was developing heavily in Rails and learned a lot from the Ruby-oriented and JS framework articles.<p>6. Who introduced me: See above.

Overall, I guess I&#x27;d have to say that it&#x27;s <i>healthy<\/i> since the quality of the content and discussion far exceeds Reddit, Twitter, etc.<p>But it&#x27;s not without serious flaws.  As others may have mentioned, there&#x27;s a lot of groupthink here that&#x27;s shrouded under very academic&#x2F;intellectual pretense.  Because everyone wants to look like they&#x27;re on the cutting edge, the community creates this illusion that &quot;only <i>real<\/i> developers use &lt;insert language&#x2F;framework of the day&gt;&quot;.  I&#x27;m almost certain that a lot of content gets no attention or isn&#x27;t discussed because it&#x27;s not considered cool.<p>However, this is nothing new.  I haven&#x27;t really seen this community degrade in that sense.<p>What has degraded is the community&#x27;s attitude towards voting&#x2F;downvoting.  In my opinion, as I have expressed many times, the comment voting system is broken.  Obviously, there needs to be some kind of community moderation, so I&#x27;m not necessarily saying that the system should be abolished(not yet), but it&#x27;s not functioning that well in its current state.  Users have to be extremely careful about what they post because, if misinterpreted in the slightest way, your opinion, even if civilized and valid, will be demoted.  If your comment is even the slightest shade of grey, few will take it seriously, and it will be pushed down on the heap.  All it takes is a few people to not like what you have to say and press the down arrow in the belief that their dislike should mean something.<p>Over the past maybe 4 years, I&#x27;ve noticed more people taking advantage of downvoting rather harmless comments without creating a discussion about why they feel that way.  This is harmful because, due to the mechanics of downvoting, people are de-legitimizing others when they should really only reserve the down arrow button for &quot;This comment is blatantly rule-breaking&#x2F;offensive&#x2F;wrong, and others shouldn&#x27;t see it&quot;.  The latter really should be a rarity.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the politics of our time that have encouraged everyone to hold strong opinions on everything, but the increase in downvoting behavior makes me believe that downvoting should be removed and replaced with flagging.  Maybe HN runs on bare bones, but if something isn&#x27;t breaking the rules, then it shouldn&#x27;t be suppressed, but if something breaks the rules, moderation should know about it rather than letting randos on the internet determine what&#x27;s legitimate and what isn&#x27;t.<p>TL;DR The community is healthy in that it has above-average caliber in discussion, but there&#x27;s a higher level of intellectual suppression and back-patting than I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere."],"time":["2020-03-27 19:09:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RMPR"],"id":[22710098],"kids":{},"parent":[22704051],"text":["&gt; How did you get into HN?

I think HN has its good and its bad sides.<p>What I like about HN is the (usually) high quality of discussion. You&#x27;re likely not gonna get hit with insults or low blows or trolling on this site. I think this is in part due to the great moderation (I always wonder how they&#x27;re able to pull that off so well with so little staff) but it&#x27;s also manifested in the culture here. Commenting on HN just feels different than on Twitter, for example.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that I act differently on HN compared to other circles that I&#x27;m in. Like, VERY different. On HN, people (me including) share way less details about themselves and their emotions (from what I&#x27;ve seen - I&#x27;m not a credible source for data), to the point where it sometimes feels like you&#x27;re talking to a bunch of robots. Compare that to Twitter: I&#x27;m mostly just on Twitter to follow people I relate to for their portrayal of character online (be it real or staged). I&#x27;m also more open to show my own emotions on Twitter (though that has its limits as well). However, I wouldn&#x27;t engage in a serious discussion on Twitter or use it as a source of information.<p>Generally I don&#x27;t think HN really has a concept of &quot;community&quot;. It&#x27;s just a place where a lot of information is flung around and people (mostly serious and professional) come to talk about it but you don&#x27;t really form &quot;bonds&quot; or &quot;networks&quot; on HN. I mean, sometimes you don&#x27;t even read the name of the person you&#x27;re replying to. That&#x27;s why I like to think of it as &quot;the least social network&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t take it too seriously either. Like okay, maybe HN has moved the needle in the real world sometimes but I think most of the discussion here doesn&#x27;t have a real impact other than that we&#x27;re entertained for the moment. (Though it would be interesting to see an analysis of what HN has or might have done in the real world.) Therefore I also sometimes see it as a bit of a &quot;roleplay&quot; where you act in a fancy way just for fun. Like, I&#x27;m not trying to mock anyone, I say exactly what I would say IRL, just in a more formal and correct manner and I think it&#x27;s nice to do that occasionally but I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;d like to know what others on this site think about that.<p>All in all, I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s a lot more to the question if a site is &quot;healthy&quot; I think and in the end it greatly depends on the receiver. HN also has a couple of mannerisms that could make it a bad experience for some, like strongly favoring some concepts and technologies while being extremely pessimistic on the rest. I&#x27;m glad there is something like HN but I think it could be a bit more open (to new ideas, different views, etc.) and, for the lack of a better word, human.<p>Addendum: While writing this I had the idea that Hacker News is filled with an equal amount of humans and (actual) robots and the humans are trained to be more robotic while the robots are trained to be more human, to prepare the singularity.

It&#x27;s healthy in that it encourages discussion due to skeptics of all kinds. However, it can get very pedantic at times, where some people nitpick not over the post itself but some non-pertinent detail about the post, such as the title, website loading speed, trackers, and so on; the content metadata, as it were, rather than the content itself. This is quite annoying to read through. If I were to make a new forum, I&#x27;d want something like the following stipulations for posters:<p>- Steel-man all arguments: consider the best possible interpretation of the argument, and if you need to, consider playing the devil&#x27;s advocate not only for the post you are replying to, but also your own post. I&#x27;ve written a lot of philosophy papers and they strongly advocate this point, that you must consider each and every single counter objection. I know that HN rules include consideration of the best possible interpretation, but it may not be enforced strictly enough.<p>- Do not comment if you cannot do the above. This includes short one sentence comments that should be permitted if they truly and exemplarily contribute to the conversation, such as a necessary piece of information. Too often I see pithy quotes or humor, which, while interesting, are not very suitable to argumentation in the formal sense.<p>- Focus on the main content, not metadata. As above, many posters comment on something that is not part of the content but its metadata. This goes hand in hand with the &quot;best possible interpretation&quot; clause. If you so feel the need to nitpick over the title, do so only after addressing the content at hand.<p>How does one achieve this? People run on incentives, so the design of the forum must incentivize people to act in this way. On one end you have Twitter, which incentivizes short, flame-baiting &quot;hot takes&quot; over long-form discussion. This is inherently and entirely due to the _design_ of the site alone, where the 140 (now 280) character limit creates these incentives. On the other hand, you have academic paper communities, which incentivize understanding long-form content lest a reader misunderstands a paper, creates an opposing paper, publishes it, and is socially ridiculed for not having noticed the misunderstanding sooner. In other words, the design of the forum incentivizes the reader to digest content fully. The hypothetical forum would stand somewhere in the middle.<p>Now, to achieve this in practice, versus theory, there are certain designs you can have to do so:<p>- Strict moderation. This is similar to the moderation levels of &#x2F;r&#x2F;AskScience or &#x2F;r&#x2F;AskHistorians on Reddit where low-effort comments and even branches are removed. This is the easiest to implement technologically but also the hardest sociologically, due to needing manpower and choosing acceptable moderators.<p>- No downvoting, and no showing numbers of votes. HN does this well to some extent, but you still see branches downvoted for differing opinions. Perhaps one can only downvote or report posts with a rational reason, basically held to the same standards as if they were to reply to it.<p>- Randomizing content to a certain degree. HN and Reddit have algorithms to do this so that the top-most content is not always shown.<p>- Sorting and filtering any and all posts based on content and votes. This is more of a convenience feature but I wish more sites could let you sort and filter by certain tags or number of votes, and by date, like reddit and HN with the Algolia search.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve thought of for now, I know it doesn&#x27;t exactly answer your question but these were a few things that annoy me about most fora."],"time":["2020-03-28 00:55:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kick"],"id":[22705560],"kids":[22706177],"parent":[22704051],"text":["<i>What criteria do you use to determine &#x27;health&#x27; in online communities?<\/i><p>This is a question that I think is too broad to be worthwhile, because signs of health in one community aren&#x27;t necessarily signs of health for another.<p>As an example of two communities that are effectively polar opposites (at least in theory, anyway; in reality they&#x27;re pretty close): HN &amp; &#x2F;r&#x2F;NFL.<p>&#x27;Health&#x27; in &#x2F;r&#x2F;NFL&#x27;s case is closer to emulating a gathering on someone&#x27;s couch to watch American football.

Plenty of things end up worse than originally intended to be. Let&#x27;s reframe a little bit.<p>Are <i>some<\/i> of the stories on the front page intellectually-gratifying? As an uncontroversial example, &#x27;afandian&#x27;s blog post (which at the time of writing this is at #22) is certainly intellectually-gratifying. On the other hand, there are more than a few that are uncontroversially <i>not<\/i> so.<p>Are <i>most<\/i> of the comments civil and high-quality? I leave answering this as an exercise to the reader.<p>With that framing, it&#x27;s kind of healthy.<p>Let&#x27;s hit it from a different angle: is it better than the average public-facing Internet community aiming to do the same things <i>presently<\/i>? For the most part, I would say so, especially at the scale it&#x27;s at.<p>Conclusion: Healthy enough.<p><i>How do these differ from those criteria you use to determine ‘health’ in offline communities you are in?<\/i><p>I disagree with the premise of this question as-worded.<p><i>How does HN exemplify or not exemplify &#x27;healthy&#x27; behaviors?<\/i><p>I think HN embodies the healthiest example of large-scale heavily- and strictly-moderated conversation on the Internet. On the other side of that, I think the community reacts poorly to it as a result: it&#x27;s done well enough to where it doesn&#x27;t <i>feel<\/i> like it&#x27;s as moderated as it is, so when people notice that it isn&#x27;t they&#x27;re surprised and alarmed.<p><i>What behaviors of your own would you acknowledge may or may not contribute to the overall ‘health’ of HN?<\/i><p>My submissions are pretty great overall. My comments aren&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d like them to be, and I occasionally find myself commenting on things I don&#x27;t care about, so I&#x27;ve been reconsidering commenting at all lately.<p><i>What makes you stay?<\/i><p>kuro5hin is dead, and I&#x27;ve been reading this site for ages. Since the best is dead, most communities have little if any redeeming qualities, a good mail client doesn&#x27;t exist (great discussion still happens on some mailing lists), and HN is by and large still decent, it&#x27;s the closest alternative that isn&#x27;t a microblogging community.<p>I also recommend that you examine the corpses of dead online hangouts for this. Many places were fantastic for years but died due to events that weren&#x27;t necessarily tied to the core functions or community of the hangout (kuro5hin being an example of this alongside many newsgroups).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;hackernews.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;hackernews.html<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Apg%20hn%20quality&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=comment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-27 19:43:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["carapace"],"id":[22705074],"kids":[22706747],"parent":[22704051],"text":["When I have to explain HN to normal people I say, &quot;Culturally it&#x27;s a wasteland, but the technical information you can glean there is top notch.&quot;<p>What I mean by &quot;cultural wasteland&quot; is that you have a lot of social retards and moral cretins on here who, for whatever reasons, will gladly lumber threads with crazy sociopathic BS.

This is a very valid reason to give unstructured interviews, and if you ask smart people who give them, this is what they&#x27;re looking for.<p>I totally agree with the utility of work-sample tests.  There is nothing better to see someone&#x27;s performance than simply giving them a small but relevant chunk of work to do.  It is very important to keep them short and flexible though.<p>If you make them too lengthy, you&#x27;ll skew the results against people who have better things to do with their time.  What kind of person works for free anyway?  Certainly not the caliber of people I want to work with.<p>And if you make the test too specific to certain technologies, you skew the test against smart engineers who are less familiar with that tech.

In a competitive world, these organizations are unnecessarily creating a competitive disadvantage for themselves. By adopting more valid hiring procedures, they could turn this competitive disadvantage into a competitive advantage.”<\/i><p>The problem is that this misunderstands the purpose of the hiring process.

This shutdown needs to end immediately.  This is absolutely crushing the middle class and the economy. I&#x27;d bet that many of the small shops and restaurants I used to go to will never reopen. These low-margin businesses cannot cope with a week long closure, let alone four. We are already looking at waves of rent&#x2F;debt defaults followed by massive layoffs and then a deep recession if not a depression. And if the government&#x27;s response is unlimited money creation (for the banks or for individuals, it does not matter) then we are looking at a potential monetary or dollar crisis.<p>This decision to shutdown the economy has been made on the misguided assumption that you can save the healthcare system in isolation from the rest of the system of production in which it resides.  It is also assuming that saving lives supersedes any other consideration, especially money or economics.  We are hearing this now from the media who already pre-attacking Trump for hinting he wants to end the shutdown -- that he is valuing billionaires or dollars over lives.  This is shear non-sense and ignores the fact that people are not ghosts, we need to work in order to stay alive and live. I am reading on many forums about people who are about to lose their business that they spent 20 years building or their homes if they cannot get back to work soon. This is not just narrowly about lives lost to the virus but living for everyone. Of course we will do everything reasonable to help the afflicted but shutting down the economy should not be one of them.<p>If you want to still hold to the assumption that only lives matter in this decision then think about this.  Think of how many alcoholics will be created or relapse from spending days on end with nothing to do, bored in their home. How many of those will eventually die of alcoholism or kill people with their car? What about anorexics who recover but under quarantine and the anxiety of virus scaremongering relapse and ultimately starve to death?  If the economy goes into a recession or depression (a fait accompli in my view) then how many people are going commit suicide which always goes up in bad times?  How many people will die in just these three examples 100K, 200K, 1M people?<p>These are not fantasy deaths, it will really happen but they will never be blamed on the shutdown. It is a real hidden cost, as real as those who die from CV19.

Realistically both are probably 9+ months out: vaccines are slow to develop, and almost every governor has proven they&#x27;d rather shut down everything than see hospitals be overloaded.<p>In other words, for the next 6-12 months we have two choices:<p>(a) Public life sees a boom-bust pattern of sickness, where we open things back up, then a new outbreak of infection happens, and everything shuts down again for 2-6 weeks.<p>(b) We aggressively fight off our initial outbreak, then build infrastructure to quickly identify and contain all infections. We gently reopen life back to a kind-of-normal states of permanent semi-quarantine until a vaccine arrives.<p>In my opinion, (b) is clearly the optimal approach. And yet we haven&#x27;t even begun working on the infrastructural and cultural changes needed to support pre-herd-immunity public life.<p>We need mass production of face masks and a culture where it is unacceptable to not wear a face mask in public, particularly crowded locations and public transit.<p>We need every building, every bus and train, every tourist attraction, testing every visitor with a contactless thermometer. If you have a fever you get a covid-19 test.<p>To support allowing non-remote-capable work to resume, any jobs that are remote capable should remain remote until we have herd immunity.

E.g. reading Halliday, Resnick &amp; Walker completely might take you years! Not all topics are equally important.

It is really difficult to skip any step along the way. E.g. to understand special relativity, you must first understand classical physics and electrodynamics.<p>(5) Be prepared that the timescales in physics are long. Often, what turns people off is that they do not get things quickly (e.g. in 15-30 minutes). If you find yourself thinking hours about seemingly simple problems, do not despair! That is normal in physics.<p>(6) You have to &#x27;soak in&#x27; physics. It takes time. Initially, you might feel like you do not make a lot of progress, but the more you know, the quicker it will get.

Reasonably complicated systems described in the language of some theory are generally intractable to analyze exactly, or to draw general conclusions from, so you need to throw something away to make progress.

The exercises for Experimental Physics are usually not long but can be surprising. ;) Also it might be surprising that depending on your interest a strong foundation in Mathematics is not critical, although you&#x27;ll still need to wrap your head around the common math problems.<p>One motivating thing is that while you go through the topics (Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Wave theory, QM, ...) the frameworks and approaches are somewhat repetitive and just get more sophisticated over time.<p>TL;DR: pick a curriculum and combine it with your favorite material"],"time":["2020-03-26 18:14:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thecleaner"],"id":[22691606],"kids":{},"parent":[22682837],"text":["Anyone knows of a good reference for numerical methods for quantum mechanics ?"],"time":["2020-03-26 09:43:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["utxaa"],"id":[22696801],"kids":{},"parent":[22682837],"text":["start with <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brilliant.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brilliant.org<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-26 20:10:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mdo123"],"id":[22696781],"kids":{},"parent":[22682837],"text":["Ummm, open a physics text book?"],"time":["2020-03-26 20:08:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["antognini"],"id":[22696413],"kids":[22696896],"parent":[22682837],"text":["My personal recommendations for an undergraduate course in physics (based in large part off of my own undergrad curriculum):<p>Foundations:<p>1. Newtonian Mechanics by A.P. French (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;NewtonianMechanics&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;NewtonianMechanics&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up<\/a>).  This will give you a good foundation for what is to come.<p>2. Spacetime Physics by Taylor &amp; Wheeler --- first edition if you can find it!  It is much, much better than the second!  Special relativity is conceptually strange, but mathematically pretty easy, so you can jump right into it after learning Newtonian mechanics.  Have a little fun!<p>3. Electricity &amp; Magnetism by Purcell.  This book is a little unusual in that it <i>derives<\/i> magnetism from the laws of special relativity.  This is the more natural approach than just asserting the laws of magnetism since magnetism is fundamentally a relativistic phenomenon.<p>4. Waves by Crawford.  (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;Waves_371&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;Waves_371&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up<\/a>)  A bit hard to find in print, but a really excellent textbook.  Waves are a fascinating topic because they come up in every area of physics, so a course focused around them has a huge number of applications.<p>5. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths.  <i>The<\/i> best introduction to the topic you will find!<p>6. Thermal Physics by Kittel &amp; Kroemer.  I haven&#x27;t actually found an introductory book on statistical physics that I&#x27;m crazy about, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad.<p>That should last you some time.  But once you&#x27;re through with those and are looking for more, then here are some advanced topics:<p>7. Analytical Mechanics by Hand &amp; Finch.  This will teach you advanced Newtonian mechanics --- in particular Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics.  There is a chapter on chaotic dynamics towards the end, too.  Another option here is Classical Mechanics by Goldstein.<p>8. Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths.  More advanced E&amp;M than Purcell.  If you want to go further, then there&#x27;s always Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson.<p>9. Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar.  This spends more time on the mathematical foundations of QM than Griffiths does and goes into the path integral formalism and touches on relativistic QM towards the end of the book.<p>10. A First Course in General Relativity by Schutz.  There are arbitrarily advanced texts on GR, but I&#x27;d recommend starting off with something friendly like Schutz.<p>11. An Introduction to Elementary Particles by Griffiths.  Not super advanced mathematically, but it&#x27;s a good thing to read over to prepare you for more advanced QFT texts.  The first chapter is especially good as a history of the development of particle physics.<p>12. Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell by Zee.<p>13. Modern Classical Physics by Thorne &amp; Blandford.  This is a tour de force.  It&#x27;s an enormous book but it really touches on everything that is left out by the above books.  It covers optics, fluid dynamics, statistical physics, plasma physics, and more.  (I&#x27;m currently reading through it and have only gotten through 6 chapters, but it&#x27;s really an incredible textbook.)<p>14. Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity by Sethna.  This is a really fun book, but almost all the material is in the problems.<p>Finally, and most importantly --- remember that physics is not a spectator sport!  You <i>must<\/i> do problems.

from &quot;elaborative material&quot;, with the help of your subject&#x2F;exam syllabi.&quot;<p>- Core material&quot; = key concepts; principles; laws; definitions; terminologies; nomenclatures; diagrams and drawings, etc.;&quot;<p>- Elaborative material&quot; = examples, illustrations, anecdotes, etc.;<p>That&#x27;s to say, your focus is on &quot;core material&quot;, and using Pareto&#x27;s Law, generally about 80% of exam questions are more likely to come from &quot;core material&quot;.<p>This is not to say &quot;elaborative material&quot; is not important.<p>Tactically speaking, once you have the full grasp of &quot;core material&quot;, &quot;elaborative material&quot; is more likely to fall in automatically.<p>You may even want to explore the use of the following study tools:<p>i) SQ5R reading&#x2F;studying strategy:<p>It&#x27;s a structured system [SQ5R is an acronym for SURVEY, QUESTIONS, READ, RECORD, RECITE, REVIEW, REFLECT], but it equips you with efficient and effective ways to navigate academic materials, especially the intellectually-intense ones, with ease and expediency.<p>I append herewith a nice document for you to read:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saddleback.edu&#x2F;upload..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saddleback.edu&#x2F;upload..<\/a>.<p>ii) Cornell Notes:<p>It&#x27;s a far more superior system that the conventional outline method, known to most students in schools, college and universities.<p>It&#x27;s latent power comes from its simple and yet elegant three-column spatial configuration for taking notes and making notes.<p>The &quot;cue&quot; column is the most powerful system I have ever known, as it facilitates - and expedites - your memory retention&#x2F;recall via self-testing.<p>You may want to read this nice write-up on Cornell Notes method of note-taking and note-making, in conjunction with SQ5R reading strategy:<p>Guide to Effective Note Taking - SQ3R and Cornell - The Student Power<p>If you think you have an artistic streak in you, you may even want to explore the multitudinous graphical methods of note-taking and note-making, like idea mapping, cluster diagramming, and other graphic organisers and visual tools.<p>As a supplementary routine to SQ5R and Cornell Notes, you may even want to explore the use of the proven Index Card Strategy to deal with your &quot;core material&quot;, particularly the definitions, terminologies and nomenclatures, for quick and convenient &quot;learning-on-the-go&quot;: commuting and waiting in queue.<p>For your final test&#x2F;exam preparation, you can even expand the foregoing &quot;Divide and Conquer Strategy&quot; as follows:<p>Grab a large sheet of blank paper, butcher roll or news print roll, say 8 ft by 4 ft or so, and paste it on the wall, and a box of colour markers, both fat-tip and fine-tip.<p>Some assorted colour sticky notes, too!<p>Now, pick up your subject textbook.<p>With the fat-tip marker, write the subject title on the centre of the paper on the wall.<p>You may want to draw a simple image of your choice to represent this title.<p>Using your knowledge of &quot;core&quot; ideas and &quot;elaborative&quot; details you have developed earlier, write them all down, using your fine-tip markers, on the wall paper, all along the periphery.<p>You can transcribe &quot;elaborative&quot; details on to your sticky notes, and place them alongside the &quot;core&quot; ideas.<p>Upon completion, stand back, do a gallery walk and quickly review just to make sure that you have not missed out any important data from your notes and&#x2F;or subject textbook.<p>This single sheet of completed wall paper for the chosen subject will be your consolidated and summarised study sheet for your subject test&#x2F;exam.<p>The beauty of this elaborate process is that you have at your complete disposal all the &quot;core&quot; ideas and &quot;elaborative&quot; details all nicely laid out on one single sheet of paper, at a visual glance.<p>You can then use each large consolidated&#x2F;summarised sheet for self-testing or reciprocal questioning with a study buddy.<p>For the fun of it, you may even want to paste the completed wall paper on to the bedroom ceiling hovering over your bed, so that you can do what I often like to call the 3 R&#x27;s (recap&#x2F;review&#x2F;reinforce) prior to hitting the sack.<p>I just realize, I could just paste you the lik.

If the expected wakeup event does not materialize, <i>the process will wait forever and there is usually nothing that anybody can do about it short of rebooting the system.<\/i><p>This is the source of the dreaded, unkillable process which is shown to be in the &quot;D&quot; state by ps.<p>Given the highly obnoxious nature of unkillable processes, one would think that interruptible sleeps should be used whenever possible.
