The most obvious thing you can do is just taking the time you need to make an informed choice. Read the docs, source code, check out known issues, examples, etc. Do you plan to integrate tech X with tech Y? Check if everything you need is supported. Keep notes if it&#x27;s really overwhelming. You can speed up the process by eliminating choices early if you know your project&#x27;s hard requirements. If all this doesn&#x27;t apply to you, e.g. because there are multiple choices that fit your requirements, just pick one and see how it works out for you.<p>At the end of the day however, you just need to pick something and roll with it.

Cook recently posted an idea (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;25&#x2F;worst-tool-for-the-job&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;25&#x2F;worst-tool-for-the...<\/a>) that I also thought useful: Try to choose the <i>worst<\/i> tool for the job.<p>Naturally he&#x27;s not talking about choosing deliberately bad technology, so much as he&#x27;s saying to lean toward choosing crude tools for most tasks, and only opting for sophisticated tools when experience shows you need them.<p>What I particularly like about this idea is that it short-circuits the idea of even wanting to have nice things, so that you can get straight to solving the problem in the most direct way possible. If your dinky solution doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s probably also fairly easy to replace when the time comes.<p>For example, it&#x27;s easy to slurp CSV files into almost any database, and code that relies on CSVs for storage probably has a simple enough interaction model that it&#x27;s easy to migrate it as well. So picking CSV might make it easier to get to work, and save tomorrow&#x27;s problems for tomorrow. But migrating from PostgreSQL to Cassandra, or vice versa, is a terribly daunting change. So you <i>really<\/i> want to be sure you&#x27;re making the right decision on the first try.

Contrary to many of the comments here, I would never just go for a &quot;boring framework&quot; because it is tried and true, or just use what I already know.  That sounds like a great way to grind yourself into burnout.<p>Instead I would start jamming on a whiteboard or in a notebook.  Think about the problem you are tackling: what are the inputs, what are the outputs, what are the key functions, and what data structures and algorithms might be important?  How about the team?  Is it just you, or are you working with other people? What are your experiences, interests and passions? What&#x27;s the timeline?  Spend some time exploring libraries, reading paper and blog posts to inform yourself of the space.  Maybe read some open source libraries.  Don&#x27;t go nuts, but scan around to soak up some good ideas and build a mental model of the space.  This all helps put some parameters around the situation and give you some confidence that you are making informed decisions.  Now you can think about the MVP, key interfaces, etc, and you might find that you can do some quick and dirty components for 80% of the project while really focusing on the heart of the challenge in that last 20%.<p>Often times if you define good interfaces you can swap early hacks and experiments out for something fancier (faster, more scalable, etc) later on, so then you don&#x27;t need to worry as much about making optimal decisions.  For example, you might use some distributed key value store or message bus in the end system, but to get the ball rolling you can just spin up a Redis instance during development, or even just write a couple functions that fake it in-memory or using JSON on disk for starters.<p>Now you can think about what you want to learn in this project.  What&#x27;s going to be fun and interesting about it?  Do you want to dig into some new algorithms, a different language, a machine learning model?  I like to use my curiosity as a major motivation to differentiate from other solutions and push through what could otherwise be boring aspects of the project.  Say you need a service that just manages logins and sends back some tokens.  That can be done in a million ways, and it is likely to get swapped out down the line anyways as you scale or whatever.  So make it interesting, pick a new library or language and go nuts.  This of course needs to be balanced with making sure you can accomplish the task in a reasonable amount of time, but this kind of learning is empowering and it will make you a more capable engineer.  Now 20 years into my career I can program in 10+ languages on embedded micro-controllers or virtual cloud clusters, and picking up a new language or framework isn&#x27;t daunting at all.<p>Have fun doing it, and you&#x27;ll get better faster than everyone who is picking the boring framework in their same old language to solve it the way that the blogs are telling them to and then frantically searching stackoverflow because half way into the project they discover that their square problem doesn&#x27;t perfectly fit into the framework&#x27;s glorious round, ahem, hole.  That&#x27;s not engineering or craftsmanship.  That&#x27;s nervous fanboy frenzy that is the opposite of empowering.<p>Everyone has to find their own explore vs exploit trade-off, and we need people whose experience is narrow and deep as well as others who have learned far and wide.

First you don&#x27;t need to be on the latest tech stack. Tech stacks come and go, but some stick around with force for a very long time. In fact the most successful will always stick around. For instance, while I wouldn&#x27;t start a new Java based stack today, I would have no problem starting a Kotlin one, which will end up using the same technology under the hood. The reason is that I&#x27;m not particularly found of Java, but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are a huge amount of people that would start a brand new Java project with no hesitation. And they would be right to do so. Consider the following:\n- what is your team familiar with?\n--if your team is comfortable with a strong, battle tested technology, that&#x27;s a strong incentive to use it.\n- is the technology of choice not too obsolete?\n--if you start a brand new Cobalt project, then you are dealing with some serious problems in your environment. In fact, in some extreme cases, choice is non-existent, but in those cases you would not have the so called &quot;decision fatigue&quot; to begin with, since there would be no choices to speak of.\n- does stack X solve a problem you are having with stack Y?\n-- if the proposed stack doesn&#x27;t address real world issues with you current stack, than there is no need to change.\n- is stack X an evolution of stack Y?\n-- in same cases the new stack is very familiar, an evolution of kinds of your current stack. For instance .Net Core is and evolution to regular .Net. In those cases, migrating your team to the new stack should be pretty easy and provide some benefits. Just be careful not to jump the ship too early. Make sure the features you rely on are available, and that the new platform is stable.<p>If you read the above, you might get the impression that I&#x27;m saying people rarely change stacks. And that&#x27;s actually true. At the end of the day, people tend to stick with what they know, because it works, and has worked for years. Rewriting software is risky and expensive. But even for new projects, if the teams sticks to their current tech stack, they can reuse years of work, as well as rely on the expertise they acquired through the problems they faced. Now I know that this kind of question often comes from people that are either new to the field or not very experienced. So I will give some advice if you get a fresh start, as in a start up with no legacy code or existing team, or if you are building or own project, or maybe you get a team that is somehow isolated from the rest of the company.<p>Basically if you have no real world bias (as opposed to personal bias) towards any tech stack, then the only solution is to do a lot of research. Building prototypes often help test out the options. But first learn about them. Learn their motivation. Why was this stack built to begin with, what problems were they trying to solve. Are their problems similar to what you expect in you project?<p>Sometime people build new stacks to address real world problems. Some times they build them because they can. I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t use a technology just because the other had no good reason to built it, just had to opportunity. Sometimes people build really good products even if they are not trying to solve world hunger. And if you find such stack go ahead. But in general, try to find stable, battle tested tech, that solves your particular problem. Ignore the trends, focus on reliability and familiarity."],"time":["2020-08-18 02:33:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crdrost"],"id":[24189499],"kids":{},"parent":[24176774],"text":["Haha, everybody is going to have their opinion on this. Heck, I read through the comments and I didn’t see this answer but probably in the time it takes to type it up, someone else will post it.<p>So Adam Savage had a video[1] a few months back on weathering prop money to look like a properly “gangsta” stack of bills rather than a set of nice printed paper. And when it was broadcast it was live and he took questions from the audience while some espresso was drying on the bills in his oven, and one of those questions was about someone needing a prop that looked properly covered in dirt and blood, and what is the best way to do that?<p>He said that the dirt part was easy (I assume he meant, just bury the stuff for a day or two and come back and it will be covered in dirt) but the blood part was harder because blood doesn&#x27;t stay red for very long. But at the end he had some really great commentary, looking back at the question he said<p>&gt; So, your question though, “what is the <i>best<\/i> way”... The answer is, <i>there is no<\/i>, there is no best way! There is the way you figure out how to do it. Yeah! That’s really the thing. It may be that you’ve gotta, like, <i>take a brush<\/i> and kinda work at a whole bunch of different bills, and then take the stack and then effect the stack, right?, I think that’s like a multi-stage process, and then you should do some tests with different paints and see, like, under the lighting conditions these will be seen—I don’t know if it’s for a theater or a film—does it communicate? Does it <i>tell you<\/i> that it’s bloody, dirty money? That’s the question to be asking, you gotta hold it up, look at it, <i>[mimes looking at it and pausing and thinking] “does that sell to me?”—and ask other people, “does this sell?”... and like most of the time they’re gonna go, “no,” and you’re gonna keep on going. But it’s trial and error.<p>I present this advice to you in part as a way of combating decision fatigue. It’s gonna be trial and error, there’s not gonna be a ‘best way,’ so spending too much time up-front trying to figure out <\/i>what is that best way* is gonna be a waste of your precious limited resources of attention and drive.<p>Because the actual definition of “best” is coming from these extrinsic factors. Sure you don’t have lighting. But maybe you have a constraint that you would like to build a JavaScript game around the same rules engine as you’re using to analyze the game and figure out cheap play and winning&#x2F;losing, and it would be really tremendously inconvenient if you discovered that the two rules engines are subtly different and your analysis misses a loophole that breaks your JavaScript game. So you write the analysis engine in Node.js or so, so that you can reuse identical code in both places—or maybe JS is an inconvenient language because it does not have a great library that some other language does, like maybe you need to do a Fast Fourier Transform as part of this game so now you have to switch to a client-server model with the server having access to your FFT library. I don’t know. But the decision is made not by which technology is intrinsically better, just like the decision of which red goes into your blood paint is not about which paint is intrinsically better.<p>Two minor tips,<p>(1) I commented recently in another post that you should not concern yourself at all about scaling problems. I want to repeat that here. On initial selection of technology, do <i>not<\/i> worry about whether it scales. On initial selection of algorithms, it is even acceptable to brute force through some <i>n<\/i>! number of ways of permuting some elements until you find some better heuristic. Always start with doing it whatever is the easiest way for you personally, because <i>you do not know until you see it in its eventual lighting<\/i> what parts will and won’t work. It may be that this <i>n<\/i>! is indeed too long, mostly <i>n<\/i> is small but every once in a while it goes to 12, 13, 14, or even 15. But it may also turn out that the final decision can be effortlessly cached and then it becomes O(1) after that, so it is a one-time cost that doesn’t need to be recalculated. Or maybe it does. Spend all of your time optimizing that, and you may find out that <i>n<\/i> is never more than 8 in practice and the thing completes in some fraction of a second. You don’t know how to choose tech or algorithms to scale until you know what your scaling problems are, and when you know that you’ll be able to measure them. Never start with Kubernetes, never start with anything intricate, just do the easiest thing which might work and then see why it doesn’t. And this solves a lot of decision fatigue.<p>(2) In addition to ease, you might consider joy. Start writing the thing in Haskell, if that will bring you joy. You may find that with a Data.Map.Strict and a System.Random.StdGen that you can very easily load a dictionary of names and frequencies into Haskell and then randomly generate a name according to that frequency table, and maybe that is fun to you, that this fits in just a couple lines of code. If you are playing then you aren’t nearly as subject to decision fatigue. Nobody sits there with a box of lego trying to make a castle going “but is the 2x4x3 brick a <i>better<\/i> material to build this castle rather than say the thinner, longer walls of a 1x6x3 brick? What about a 2x4x1 brick, a larger number of thinner layers in case I need curvy designs built into the walls?” Like those decisions do have to be made but you kind of just <i>make<\/i> them and if it’s wrong you unmake them later, and you don’t care because you’re <i>playing around<\/i> and so it doesn’t feel like a big decision to you.<p>Those are my three pieces of advice. There is no best way there is just the way that you figure out which does the thing; do whatever comes easiest to you and worry about making it better later; and feel free to play around with other things you’re curious about.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=igEqC3snaYY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=igEqC3snaYY<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 19:32:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lr4444lr"],"id":[24189072],"kids":[24197487],"parent":[24176774],"text":["Use frameworks."],"time":["2020-08-17 18:56:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DominoTree"],"id":[24192542],"kids":[24193240],"parent":[24176050],"text":["It&#x27;s not pretty or nearly as useful, but towards the &quot;end&quot; of its life, the ST had native Ethernet and TCP&#x2F;IP<p>Here&#x27;s a picture of a native session running (on sdf.org)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;DG0_h-eU0AEFy_7?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;DG0_h-eU0AEFy_7?format=jpg&amp;name=...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 23:44:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter_d_sherman"],"id":[24200780],"kids":{},"parent":[24176050],"text":["&gt;&quot;In the following tutorial, I’ll describe how I connected my Atari ST to the Internet via using a cheap ESP8266 microcontroller as a WiFi-to-serial router – running at 19.2 kbit&#x2F;s.&quot;<p>This is a great idea!<p>I don&#x27;t own an Atari ST, but in theory this should work for any computer with an RS-232 interface, of course, non Atari ST computers would need their own SLIP-compatible software stack on the software side, but this article covers all that&#x27;s needed on the hardware side for any computer with an RS-232 interface...<p>Anyway, brilliant and tremendously useful idea!"],"time":["2020-08-18 18:34:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j45"],"id":[24194460],"kids":[24194712,24195213,24194529],"parent":[24176050],"text":["The 1040ST was truly one of the more flexible and malleable computers in it&#x27;s day.<p>Connectivity between computers using MIDI Cables, for example was a regular way to play networked games.<p>I feel extremely lucky to be exposed to an entire lab of them in Canada and it did the right thing at the time - feed the imagination in ways 5-10 years ahead of it&#x27;s time in North America that other machines couldn&#x27;t quite do it.<p>If these kinds of machines had caught on in North America like they had in Europe maybe the world would look different."],"time":["2020-08-18 03:43:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["leothekim"],"id":[24198482],"kids":{},"parent":[24190385],"text":["Possibly one of the most moving interviews I’ve seen was Dave Brubeck talking about returning to America after WWII and witnessing racism towards black veterans.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;stadqAHRroA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;stadqAHRroA<\/a><p>The story he tells at the very end brings me to tears.

So the kids do most of their schoolwork in their rooms or at the dining table. They work in blocks of about 2 hours, and I schedule breaks to coincide with theirs. During the breaks we try to go for a short walk or something to get the wiggles out, and then it&#x27;s back to work. Tuesdays (and sometimes Thursdays) I go to my spouse&#x27;s office where I can isolate and get some real work done until late. We trade that time for Fridays, when I stop work a couple hours early so the au pair can leave if he wants to. If I need to be able to really focus I leave the house and go to a park where I can tether and crank out some real work. This is difficult though, as I need 2 laptops and a phone to get work done.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a traditional au pair experience, so we plan on some really nice thank you gifts for our au pair at the end of his contract, and hopefully we&#x27;ll be back in school next fall and can go back to something a little more normal."],"time":["2020-08-17 19:50:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jph00"],"id":[24189328],"kids":[24190600,24189619],"parent":[24189147],"text":["I&#x27;ve been surprised at how well our 4 y.o daughter has adjusted to the online world, on the whole. Whilst not all of our friends&#x27; children have the same experience, I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s fairly common for children we know (at least of this age) to quickly adapt to making friends and socializing and learning through Zoom&#x2F;Skype&#x2F;etc.<p>Mornings are spent on &quot;Kid&#x27;s Club&quot; via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modulo.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modulo.app<\/a> , which is a fairly new startup that provides online spaces for kids to learn together, hang out together, etc. My daughter has made a number of new friends through that and she&#x27;s able to do a lot of the same stuff she was doing before (art, learning apps, etc), but in a more social way. Sometimes she gets to help other kids when they get stuck with their learning apps, and visa versa, which is fun. We&#x27;re likely to expand this to some of the afternoon too, since they&#x27;re adding a Spanish program.<p>Overall, I&#x27;ve noticed that her development has thrived since she&#x27;s moved to a more self-paced environment. There&#x27;s been no sign that using screens a lot is causing any problems. We&#x27;ve set up an iPad on an adjustable goose-neck stand so she can (and does) run around a lot and her friends can still see her. We also make sure there&#x27;s time outside for exercise.<p>We&#x27;ve found a lot of good online resources, generally free or very cheap, such as Cosmic Kids Yoga, Draw Every Day with JJK, Mo Willems Doodles, and Khan Academy Kids. We&#x27;ve also discovered kids coding apps, like CodeSpark and SpriteBox, that have been a big hit. The teacher at Modulo.app does a good job of helping us find resources for stuff our daughter takes an interest in, and we share stuff we find with them too.<p>We&#x27;re both full-time parents, and certainly we&#x27;re not as productive as we were before, but for me it&#x27;s a totally acceptable compromise.

If you find yourself in a similar situation, here are some tips we have found helpful, especially for our 2nd grader:<p>1) Print out the daily&#x2F;weekly schedule for the student, and put it up on the wall somewhere. This is one less tab they have to keep open and refer to constantly. Also, a second copy helps parents keep on top of the kids schedule. A color printer here is a huge benefit. We have an HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw, and it’s amazing.<p>2) Get a headset with a microphone; aim for comfort more than style. Something over-ear with a cushioned headband. They’re going to be wearing it all day, and earbuds can fall out of small ears. My 7yo daughter looks like an airline pilot with hers on. They’re huge, but she loves them.<p>3) Encourage your child not to panic when something goes wrong. Adults are much better equipped to handle meeting malfunction than kids. They won’t get an unexcused absence or other demerit because of a computer malfunction. The kids extend grace to the teacher when they see it, and they’ll be treated in kind."],"time":["2020-08-17 20:10:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["emidln"],"id":[24190180],"kids":{},"parent":[24189147],"text":["My wife is a stay at home parent and taught my daughter for the last 3 months of the school year last year. My daughter (then in the 4th grade) was attending a private school in the Chicago suburbs. The transition was decent, with her school already having a 1:1 laptop program and Google Classroom integration into her curriculum. The only change was that 4th graders didn&#x27;t take their chromebooks home, but when school was abruptly closed, the laptops came with. All of her subjects had asynchronous work pages or chapter questions, asynchronous reading, asynchronous projects, and then synchronous instruction, synchronous classmate discussion&#x2F;talk&#x2F;project time, and synchronous project presentations. My daughter&#x27;s grades improved slightly, likely from the additional focus given the lack of classroom distractions at home. My wife was available to answer immediate questions while I was working from home in most subjects, although I helped out when additional perspectives were needed to learn the material (my wife and I had very different education experiences, so our methods tend to be divergent).<p>This year we had the option of a similar remote program for the first semester or in-person, with the commitment lasting until the grading period is over. We&#x27;re very fortunate to have one parent who can easily dedicate time during the day and a program conducive to remote learning. I can only imagine the sleepless schedules that would be involved in a less structured online program or with both parents working.<p>The major reason for not moving to home schooling this year is to guarantee our place at the private school for 6th&#x2F;7th&#x2F;8th grade without a significant donation to get back in.

On Thursdays, our cleaner would come, and we all had to cram into half the house while she cleaned the other half, or we had to leave the house. Sometimes we ended up working in bed or on the balcony.<p>My oldest son was quite capable of doing his own schoolwork, though he&#x27;s always finished way too quickly and spent the rest of the day gaming, so this made his gaming addiction a lot worse in retrospect, but at the time, he didn&#x27;t need much attention. Or youngest did, though. It&#x27;s hard to work when a 5-year-old wants your attention. But our regular babysitter had all her other babysitting jobs and restaurant jobs cancelled, so eventually we hired her 3 days a week to entertain and teach our youngest, and that worked very well.

There are probably plenty who are currently our of a job, and as long as they don&#x27;t do much else than babysit at your place and go back to their own home, they&#x27;re not a big risk.

As adults, we&#x27;re hardly willing to be on 8 hours of video call a day and asking for this from children is absurd. (I&#x27;m not too worried about the details of whether it&#x27;s exactly 8 hours, the point is, they&#x27;re clearly trying to function as a school <i>day<\/i> replacement rather than a <i>school<\/i> replacement; the two are not the same.)<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed my oldest is falling behind in math, because they&#x27;re going just a <i>touch<\/i> faster than he can quite keep up with [1], and I&#x27;ve kind of wanted to fix that anyhow.

Now that you have identified potential microservices, very carefully think through the API for each microservice.  APIs are very difficult to change after they are widely used, so its important to get it as close to right as possible the first time.

Amazon employees would need to fly back to Seattle and then fly back to San Diego if they came down for a friday meeting and wanted to spend the weekend on personal time! \nAmazon has gamed the rules, they compete directly with their clients (sellers) using the sales data to decide what product to source.  They ran their warehouses as 3rd party entities to avoid nexus and begrudging accepted 3rd party (non-Amazon owned) sellers when the courts ruled that wholly owned entities would create sales-tax nexus.

Lack of native distributed search led to Google’s monopoly.<p>“The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for.”<p>This doesn’t make any sense.   Google’s entire early innovation was to use hyperlinks as an indicator of popularity and thus a proxy metric for veracity, and PageRank was born.<p>Original attempts at distributed search based on other metrics like text analysis were tried (Webcrawler, AltaVista which was used by Yahoo, Inktomi which was used by Lycos, HotBot, etc) but didn’t produce better results, and Google eventually grew to #1 by 2004 (6 years after intro).<p>Google could not have existed without the hyperlink.  The reason it has a monopoly today is largely due to investment cycles and intellectual property law:  after the dot com bust, there wasn’t exactly an appetite to build new search engines given PageRank was patented and would need to be licensed (it expired in 2019).<p>This monopoly doesn’t matter as much:  generic search engine use has been declining for years in favour of other approaches to finding content (social media, syndication, domain specific aggregators, etc).<p>Decentralized Index&#x2F;search (not just distributed but truly decentralized) remains an open research problem.   it may be possible to improve and deploy with the right incentives and investment, but it’s ludicrous to think this was possible in 1992-1998.<p>2.  Lack of native payments led to advertising to take off.<p>This has no factual basis:  CGI-bin scripts to purchase things with HTTP POST calls existed as early as 1993.  Amazon and eBay launched in 1995.  PayPal started when Google did, in 1998.<p>More importantly, most viewed the web as another visual media like Television, which was ad-driven. People generally didn’t like paying for things that felt free, like information, or music, or movies.<p>But again, the Ad Words monopoly remains tenuous.  Facebook has been steamrolling it in growth and will eventually eclipse it.  We are also seeing a lot more willingness for people to pay for content to avoid ads.<p>3. “poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all)”<p>It was called hypermedia widely by around 1995 when images and audio (Real Networks in particular) took off, there just wasn’t the processing power, bandwidth, or compression algorithms available to make this real until 1998 when MP4 came out.<p>Google’s early attempt at video, Google Videos, was a market failure.   They had to buy YouTube which (most importantly) made it easy to publish videos compared to others, but it took many years for it to reach #1.<p>And that position too is threatened between Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc.<p>In summary, Google is #1 in a number of markets due to a combination of smart business moves, smart technology, being an early player, and the business&#x2F;investment climate at key inflection points of the industry.  There are a large number of competitive pressures against Google that make this lead tenuous.   Google is as vulnerable as AOL or Microsoft were in the late 90s, when they were thought to be unassailable.<p>As for the health of the web, let’s remember that regardless of all the claims of the death of the web, whether native mobile, or WebSockets, or walled gardens, GraphQL, or single page apps or accelerators like Amp (which had to change offer direct hyperlink access due to complaints), the web remains entrenched, omnipresent, and has no clear replacement.<p>This matters because the core architecture of the web:  URLs, HTTP, MIME, and (to a somewhat shrinking extent) HTML remains the foundational glue that holds all this mess of media and technology together, and is fundamentally about enabling decentralization.  URLs still are the main way that native mobile apps integrate with the network.  HTML is still the default fallback UI.  HTTP is still the primary application protocol by far.<p>All of this was the design intent of the architecture of the Web:  to last decades, regardless of how the origin servers or user agents evolved.   It’s an architecture ripe for innovation to make decentralized alternatives to today’s incumbents.<p>To paraphrase John Lennon, centralization is over, if you want it.<p>But this requires the experience to be actually better for users, and not just in an “eat your vegetables &#x2F; don’t give your privacy away” manner. Starting a new venture to take this on requires a combination of investment, insight, and commitment that’s not easy to assemble.  But it can and probably will happen, relative to legislation or very possible social catastrophes that entrench the current players longer than needed."],"time":["2020-08-16 19:00:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saos"],"id":[24177728],"kids":{},"parent":[24176898],"text":["&gt; AMP, a technology no one asked for<p>!!!"],"time":["2020-08-16 15:47:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cmrdporcupine"],"id":[24177715],"kids":[24178256,24178604,24178539,24177742,24178643,24178914,24177730,24179871,24177923,24179664,24177746,24180036,24180198,24177906,24179261,24178889,24179093,24178440],"parent":[24176898],"text":["A lot of talk in this article about Google capturing the whole web, all valid points, but I find the Facebook walled garden even more terrifying.

If you incorporate anti bug (literal bugs in factorio) into your designs with automated repair then you almost never have to worry about bugs.  Don&#x27;t have lots of dependencies, build isolated services to focus on certain things.  Have a high speed bus for different services to communicate over.

Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.<p>This woolly relation between language and reality is well-known. It has been studied in various ways in linguistics and the philosophy of language, for instance by Frege and not least Foucault and everything after. I also think many modern linguistic schools take a very different view of &quot;uncertainty and vagueness&quot; than I sense in the author here, but they are obviously writing for non-specialist audience and trying not to dwell on this subject here.<p>My point is, when making and evaluating these NLP methods and the tools they are used to construct, it is extremely important to understand that language models social realities rather than any single physical one. It seems to me all too easy, coming from formal grammar or pure stats or computer science, to rush into these things with naive assumptions about what words are or how they mean things to people.

The conversation is held in the context of a &quot;blocks world&quot; where a robot with a single hand and eye (&quot;Computer&quot; in the excerpt above) moves blocks of various shapes and colours around, as directed by a human user in free-form natural language. When the Computer says &quot;OK&quot; after it&#x27;s directed to &quot;put the littlest pyramid on top of it&quot; it&#x27;s because it really has grabbed the smallest pyramid in the blocks world and placed it on top of the small block in an earlier sentence, as the Person asked. The program has a memory module to keep track of what ellipses like &quot;it&quot;, &quot;one&quot; etc refer to throughout the conversation.<p>SHRDLU was a traditional program hand-crafted by a single PhD student- no machine learning, no statistical techniques. It included, among other things, a context-free grammar (!) of natural English and a planner (to control the robot&#x27;s hand) all written in Lisp and PLANNER.

The difference is bit 1, the direction bit, supported by many instructions.<p>Internally, the 8086 has 5-bit registers that specify the source and destination, typically a register. [1] The source and destination register get their value either from the register specification in the instruction (bits 5-3 or bits 0-2), or values in the microcode.<p>The clever part is the outputs of the source and destination registers go through multiplexers that can swap them. If the instruction has a direction bit, and the direction bit is set, then accesses to the source and destination registers are swapped.<p>The point of this is that the microcode doesn&#x27;t know anything about direction swapping, so it is implemented &quot;for free&quot; as far as microcode size (but with the addition of the swapping circuit).<p>The 8086 has a &quot;Group PLA&quot; that categorizes instructions into groups; one of these groups is &quot;instructions that have a direction bit&quot;. This prevents direction swapping from happening for instructions where it is not supported.<p>I hope this explanation makes sense; it should probably be a blog post :-)<p>[1] You might wonder why source and destination are specified with 5 bits when the instructions use 3 bits to specify the register. The first reason is that many registers can be accessed as half-registers, so you need another bit. (This bit comes from the byte&#x2F;word specification bit in instructions.) Second, this mechanism is used to access the other 8086 registers, not just the general-purpose registers. Third, there are also invisible temporary registers that also need accessing. Thus, the internal register specifications are 5 bits."],"time":["2020-08-16 20:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BeeOnRope"],"id":[24181436],"kids":[24181491,24181650],"parent":[24178188],"text":["It might be worth noting that <i>strictly speaking<\/i> this isn&#x27;t safe to apply to an arbitrary binary.

Last year Estonia had to decommission their shale plants (yes, they used to burn shale) due to CO2. In order to get power from somewhere, a series of interconnectors were built, with Sweden and Finland (which is funny, 40% of Sweden&#x27;s power comes from nuclear) and those interconnectors had 16 outages within a very short period of time, which happens when you build new grids, you need to work all kinks out.

Ruby&#x27;s tooling made Heroku possible: ie, reproducible builds across; dev, testing, staging and production environments. Heroku&#x27;s success was based on the primitives of the Twelve-Factor App[1].
