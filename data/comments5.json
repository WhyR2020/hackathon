The implication is that a GPT model with &gt;1 trillion parameters would begin to see a reduction in data efficiency. I have read all the GPT related papers and I’m frankly not sure what nostalgebraist thinks this would mean, practically speaking. All complex problem domains begin to see a dropoff in data efficiency once the “easy” structure is successfully learned. The lesson here might simply be that GPT type models are close (within an order of magnitude, so “close” is subjective) to being able to learn all the “obvious” regularities in massive language datasets, leaving the increasingly subtle regularities that might require very specific, very difficult-to-reach-through-local-minima-ravines, or very “big” learned abstractions to discover.

I found this one: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepai.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;a-proposal-for-intelligent-agents-with-episodic-memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepai.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;a-proposal-for-intelligent-ag...<\/a><p>GPT-2 was a solution to a certain kind of problem: is it possible to throw out the idea of representing language while still having good performance on a variety of language tasks? But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything like that for &quot;memory,&quot; which seems separate and distinct from &quot;tasks.&quot;<p>In concrete terms, I&#x27;m interested in models that have memory in the sense of &quot;When you inference from the model, you leave a lasting impact on the model.&quot; Inferencing from the model should cause a change in the model parameters. Yet most models currently seem to assume that model parameters can be frozen without losing something essential to the end goal.<p>We&#x27;re very task-oriented. But none of these chat bots can remember my name, or anything about me, and it&#x27;s always bugged me. GPT-2 (and now GPT-3) punts the problem to a sufficiently clever programmer: just figure out how to encode all the &quot;memory&quot; into the context window, and then out pops the results you want. But that feels rather like arguing &quot;Just come up with a technique that works, and it will work.&quot; Perhaps it&#x27;s true, but not too helpful.<p>If you hear the same name a few times, you&#x27;ll remember it a long time, and start associating it with someone&#x27;s face. It seems like language models could do something similar. I don&#x27;t know precisely what; maybe someone here does.<p>You could designate part of the model as long-term memory, short-term, etc. Inferencing from the model could cause larger effects in the short-term area than the long-term area (equivalent to a higher learning rate)."],"time":["2020-06-04 10:00:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ladberg"],"id":[23400321],"kids":[23413714,23418353,23413811,23413505,23413492],"parent":[23400042],"text":["The author mentions that the shape of the curve from 117M parameters to 175B is interesting, but doesn&#x27;t show it.

If the input string begins with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; (a zero, followed by lowercase or uppercase X), radix is assumed to be 16 and the rest of the string is parsed as a hexidecimal number.<\/i><p><i>2. If the input string begins with &quot;0&quot; (a zero), radix is assumed to be 8 (octal) or 10 (decimal). Exactly which radix is chosen is implementation-dependent.

For example, the city regularly releases criminals instead of sentencing them, which resulted in infuriating situations, like a man with 74 prior convictions including 15 assaults being released, only to then throw hot coffee at a toddler (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;project-seattle&#x2F;no-felony-charges-for-repeat-offender-who-threw-coffee-at-toddler-in-seattle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;project-seattle&#x2F;no-felony-charges-...<\/a>). Reducing policing simply further removes disincentives for crime, beyond what we&#x27;ve done already, and will remove all the good we get from policing as well.<p>The calls for &quot;community programs&quot; also seem incredibly vague and wasteful, and are unlikely to provide any substitute for the societal safety that comes from enforcing laws. Instead, I suggest we focus on more nuanced and precise actions - like banning or altering training around carotid artery holds, like banning no-knock raids, like having always-on body cams, like revisiting qualified immunity (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;to-curtail-police-impunity-rep-justin-amash-announces-legislation-to-end-qualified-immunity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;to-curtail-police-impunity-rep-just...<\/a>), etc."],"time":["2020-06-04 21:01:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["achow"],"id":[23418193],"kids":{},"parent":[23416322],"text":["The AI part are:<p>- Business name generator<p>- Slogan generator<p>- Logo maker<p>- AI heat map generator (given a mockup of website, analyzes where users potentially would look at)<p>- Content generator <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zyro.com&#x2F;ai&#x2F;content-generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zyro.com&#x2F;ai&#x2F;content-generator<\/a><p>I can see logo maker and content generator proving to be very useful for &#x27;mom and pop&#x27; websites; quite practical use of &#x27;AI&#x27;."],"time":["2020-06-04 17:49:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["michaelbuckbee"],"id":[23418127],"kids":[23419007,23418731,23419210,23418293],"parent":[23416322],"text":["Something I&#x27;ve noticed in both website builders and theme buying is that it is very hard to separate the incredible stock photography from the overall style of the site.<p>The common experience seems to be picking what you think is the &quot;perfect&quot; theme only to find that it&#x27;s really dependent upon having thousands of dollars of high-end photos taken.<p>It seems like an unsolved problem."],"time":["2020-06-04 17:44:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Gys"],"id":[23416876],"kids":[23418118,23417290],"parent":[23416322],"text":["Squarespace was leaning heavily on &#x27;AI generated websites&#x27; only a few years ago.

Two of the questions on the first graphic are about income mobility for people born in the bottom quantile. The graphic is correct, as far as it goes, but overlooks huge differences by race. While the average American born in the bottom 20% has a 7.8% chance of reaching the top 20%, that number is actually 25% for Asians.<p>Or, take the fact that the US lags Denmark in inter generational income mobility. Which is true, but it’s also true that the difference is due mainly to taxes and transfers flattening the whole distribution instead of fundamental structural differences that enable more movement: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;social-mobility-memos&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;denmerica-why-denmark-plus-america-could-be-the-mobility-utopia&#x2F;amp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;social-mobility-memos&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09...<\/a>. Put differently, it’s not that the welfare system allows the son of a gardener to become an engineer, but that massive income redistribution reduces the disparity between gardeners and engineers. (For many Americans, that distinction could be dispositive in whether you support an expanded welfare system.)<p>So take these facts the next step. The authors studied these things in the context of support for reducing income inequality. Isn’t there a very plausible argument here that the experience of poor Asians shows that there isn’t a systemic structural problem keeping people in the bottom 20%? Or, isn’t it plausible that the generous welfare state doesn’t really fundamentally change people’s’ trajectories, but just reduces the divergence between those trajectories? And if you teach people the first set of statistics but not the second, are you educating them to make up their own minds, or feeding them facts to support a preconceived notion?<p>Stepping back: experts should certainly understand these facts. But what do we expect ordinary people to take away from them? Consider the work done by Piketty and Saez on income inequality: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;10&#x2F;16850050&#x2F;inequality-tax-return-data-saez-piketty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;10&#x2F;16850050&#x2F;i...<\/a>. Defining &quot;income equality&quot; actually is quite a quagmire. For example, in their 2003 work, P&amp;S excluded the effect of tax transfers (such as the earned income tax credit) which significantly overstated the degree of inequality. Or, they mention that marginal tax rates were higher in the 1960s, but exclude the fact that the tax bases were narrower, such that the actual average tax rate on the top 1% hasn&#x27;t changed dramatically over the decades: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high<\/a>. And there are so many other confounding variables to account for. The immigrant population today is almost triple what it was in 1960. Because immigrants often start at the bottom of the ladder, an increasing immigrant share could make incomes seem stagnant even though they’re growing within each different demographic. You also need to account for household sizes, major differences in marriage rates, etc. There are an enormous number of variables.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to take a side on this issue, I&#x27;m just using it as an example. These are issues of vast complexity. The facts are things experts can fight over. But do we really expect people to make political choices based on this information? Invocation of &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;experts&quot; have an intuitive appeal, but the &quot;fact&quot; is that for almost any disputed political issue, the facts are far from clear. So people use heuristics: ideologies, knee-jerk reactions, general principles, values.

I totally agree with the concept of just taking notes in sequence.  Notes are a record of moments in your life.  The act of taking notes quickly, without distraction, and moving on, is so important.<p>Organizing notes in any other way besides just a sequence (especially heirarchical folders, which is how most apps organize) gets cumbersome.<p>It becomes a combination of analysis paralyasis (which category best fits this note I&#x27;m about to take? What if it fits into multiple categories? Too bad, it can only live in one folder) and a quagmire of trying to keep the data organized and findable in the future.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier to just keep a log of every note and then add just enough tagging that you can find it later when you need it.<p>I was fed up with all the other note apps out there, and created one that accomplishes all the goals I have personally always wanted.

Portability trumps all else.  I agree that append-only is the way to go; I put a table of contents at the end of each notebook and a header line with the date at the top of each page.  (I use the dates rather than page numbers in the table of contents.)  I&#x27;ve been doing this since about 2005.  Everything goes into the same notebook: notes on &quot;virtual virtual memory&quot; (2020-01-28), notes on foreign exchange rates here in Argentina (2020-01-28), notes on prices of laptops in the store (2020-01-28), a list of things to fix (toilet, clothing, remote control) (2020-01-30), designs for flexural dial indicators (2020-02-01), an explanation of Cantor&#x27;s diagonalization proof (2020-02-06), thoughts on multitouch UX design (202-02-06), etc.  I don&#x27;t write anything private in the notebook, so I can show it to people.  (For the same reason, I write it in Spanish instead of English.)<p>In order to have space for later commentary, I initially write the notes only on the right-hand pages — the left-hand pages stay blank, then get more stuff added to them later, which may be references to other notes I added later, extensions of the idea, or sometimes just random notes that don&#x27;t seem to deserve their own note.<p>I initially wrote in rollerball, but I have the notebook with me all day every day; after a few unfortunate incidents with rain and spilled drinks, I switched to only waterproof markings.  I&#x27;m using an 0.3mm mechanical pencil, which is my favorite, but I use plain ballpoint pens when that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s available.  Their ink is oil-based, so it resists water, though not dry alcohol or grease.  I can write much smaller with the pencil, so the notebook lasts longer.<p>I did try using a local brand here in Argentina that apes the Moleskine, called BRÜGGE.  I greatly regret it.  The cover came unstuck from the notebook after less than a year — apparently the shitheads used a pressure-sensitive adhesive like the one in Scotch Tape rather than traditional bookbinding adhesives like wheat paste or hide glue.  A few years later, my girlfriend admired the BRÜGGE notebooks in a store; I warned her, but she wanted one.  The same thing happened to her, so it wasn&#x27;t just a temporary quality mixup — the company is really targeting that abysmal level of quality!  Unfortunately BRÜGGE is displacing Moleskine from more and more stationery shops here.  (I got mine from Librería Artística Catalinas for US$16; I think they have relocated now to Córdoba 746, Capital Federal.  That&#x27;s also where I got the mechanical pencil, although they didn&#x27;t have any leads harder than HB.)<p>Lately I haven&#x27;t been keeping my address book in the notebook, but when I did, I used a hash table with separate chaining; I numbered the lines in the address-book section, and had a &quot;successor&quot; column.  At the beginning of the address book was the hash table itself, a matrix whose rows are groups of first letters (of the person&#x27;s name) and whose columns are groups of third letters; so &quot;María&quot; whoever would end up in row LM, column QR.  If she was the first person in that cell, I&#x27;d just write the line number there, but if not, I would add her as a successor at the end of the chain.  Difficult to explain (especially to non-programmers) but easy to update and search.  Insertion is not worst-case constant time because you can&#x27;t insert at the beginning of the chain — the paper is WORM rather than strictly read&#x2F;write.<p>Here&#x27;s a sample page, in Spanish, photographed at 5 megapixels: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd&#x2F;nbshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd&#x2F;nbshot<\/a><p>Notes on my computerized notetaking practices are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23388381\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23388381<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-04 04:00:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nicbou"],"id":[23422419],"kids":{},"parent":[23401019],"text":["I still take most of my notes in Google Keep.

How are we to account for this paradox? Think of the situation known to most of us from our youth: the unfortunate child who, on Sunday afternoon, has to visit his grandmother instead of being allowed to play with friends. The old-fashioned authoritarian father’s message to the reluctant boy would have been: “I don’t care how you feel. Just do your duty, go to grandmother and behave there properly!” In this case, the child’s predicament is not bad at all: although forced to do something he clearly doesn’t want to, he will retain his inner freedom and the ability to (later) rebel against the paternal authority. Much more tricky would have been the message of a “postmodern” non-authoritarian father: “You know how much your grandmother loves you! But, nonetheless, I do not want to force you to visit her – go there only if you really want to!” Every child who is not stupid (and as a rule they are definitely not stupid) will immediately recognize the trap of this permissive attitude: beneath the appearance of a free choice there is an even more oppressive demand than the one formulated by the traditional authoritarian father, namely an implicit injunction not only to visit the grandmother, but to do it voluntarily, out of the child’s own free will. Such a false free choice is the obscene superego injunction: it deprives the child even of his inner freedom, ordering him not only what to do, but what to want to do."],"time":["2020-06-04 11:53:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["twic"],"id":[23415094],"kids":[23415481,23415389,23415995],"parent":[23414160],"text":["I have come to see postmodernism and critical theory and all that stuff not as inquiry, but as a game.<p>Usually, academia is inquiry: physicists are inquiring into how matter and energy work, historians are inquiring into what happened and why, etc. From a distance, postmodern philosophy looks like it is inquiring into how society works, what hidden assumptions we have, etc.<p>But it isn&#x27;t, really.

One should always distinguish valid applications such as Postmodernist Architecture, which is a very distinctive movement that does push forward certain concepts that existed in the Modernist architecture (you can look up the Bateson building and the philosophy behind it). \nPostmodernism in contemporary art is a much weaker application, in a sense that to kind of put every post-war artist(or post 70&#x27;s) under this moniker doesn&#x27;t really achieve much.<p>The article discusses something which came to prominence not so long ago, the inclusion of the radical ideas in the mainstream left-wing discourse in States. I don&#x27;t want to touch the identity&#x2F;gender politics part here, but the death of meta-narrative the author attributes to Lyotard is an interesting part.<p>What her main problem is if I understood that correctly - there are a number of ideas and symbols, which are close to the heart of &quot;liberal democrat&quot;, and there is a certain metanarrative that she holds as true. And that is being attacked by relativists and deconstructionists.\nWhat are those symbols - Equality, Freedom, Science, Reason.

They are flat phased array antennas, and don&#x27;t need to be precisely pointed like satellite dishes do. They are about the size of an extra-large pizza, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a Starlink phone.<p>The user antennas are likely to be quite expensive at first (several thousand dollars). Cost reduction of the user antennas is the biggest hurdle Starlink currently faces. Nobody knows yet how much SpaceX will charge for the antenna or service.<p>Starlink can&#x27;t support a high density of users, so it will not be an alternative to ISPs in cities. Rural and mobile use are the important applications. The US military is doing trials with it. Cell tower backhaul may also be a possibility.<p>Starlink V1 doesn&#x27;t have cross-satellite links, so the satellites can only provide service while over a ground station. There will be hundreds of ground stations in North America; no information about other regions yet. Starlink V2 is planned to have laser links between satellites, which will enable 100% global coverage 24&#x2F;7, though local regulations are likely to prevent SpaceX from providing service in many places.<p>Because the speed of light in a vacuum is 30% faster than in optical fiber, the latency of Starlink over long distances has the potential to be lower than any other option once laser links are available.<p>Each launch of 60 Starlink satellites has nearly as much solar panel area as the International Space Station. Once SpaceX&#x27;s Starship is operational they should be able to launch several hundred satellites at once instead of just 60.<p>Starlink&#x27;s only current competitor, OneWeb, just filed for bankruptcy after only launching a handful of satellites, and is fishing for acquisition offers. Amazon is also planning something called Project Kuiper but not much is known about it.<p>Starlink V2 will have 30,000 satellites, requiring hundreds of launches. Even once the initial fleet is launched, SpaceX will still need to maintain the constellation with many launches per year indefinitely.<p>SpaceX&#x27;s FCC application has many interesting details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licensing.fcc.gov&#x2F;myibfs&#x2F;download.do?attachment_key=2378669\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licensing.fcc.gov&#x2F;myibfs&#x2F;download.do?attachment_key=...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-04 02:22:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jessriedel"],"id":[23411026],"kids":[23411089,23411079,23411550],"parent":[23409063],"text":["Could someone explain the technical notability beyond what can be inferred from the Wikipedia page?<p>&gt; An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the internet.<p>&gt; Originally the definition required control by a single entity, typically an Internet service provider (ISP) or a very large organization with independent connections to multiple networks....

When Skia&#x27;s asked to write a JPEG from a pixel buffer tagged with a color profile (SkColorSpace), we auto-generate an ICC profile programatically from the parameters that describe the color gamut and transfer functions we use to represent those color profiles.  That&#x27;s what the code in this file is up to: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.chromium.org&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master:third_party&#x2F;skia&#x2F;src&#x2F;core&#x2F;SkICC.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.chromium.org&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master:t...<\/a><p>So this profile is one of infinite possible profiles that&#x27;ll have &quot;Google&#x2F;Skia&#x2F;..big long MD5..&quot; somewhere in them.<p>This profile in particular looks like it&#x27;s probably describing the ProPhoto color space, which is very, very large and uses imaginary colors outside visible light to increase its gamut.  While the JPEG itself is always storing values in range in the ProPhoto gamut, when you convert that to another gamut (say, to match the display, or to sRGB) it&#x27;s very easy to end up with logical color channel values less than zero or greater than one, which do make a kind of sense, but not to code that expects colors are always sRGB bytes.<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me what gamut the colors being read in that Java code are in,\nand that&#x27;d very much affect what the appropriate values for that LUMINOSITY_MATRIX should be.  Those are the correct values to get the luminosity for sRGB colors (though I think what&#x27;s being calculated here is subtly-different gamma-encoded &quot;luma&quot; instead), but they&#x27;re not likely a sound way to get luminosity if the image is in any different gamut.  A typical strategy is to convert any image you load to the display gamut early, since you&#x27;ll need to do that eventually to display it.  And it&#x27;s more and more common that phone display gamuts are not sRGB, usually something wider now like Display P3."],"time":["2020-06-03 18:55:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Someone"],"id":[23404880],"kids":[23405073,23406704,23405432,23408791],"parent":[23404432],"text":["<i>“Restarting the device in safe mode (by holding down the volume button during boot-up) did not fix the issue.”<\/i><p>So, lesson learned: in safe mode, do not use a background image that the user set."],"time":["2020-06-03 17:58:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AdmiralAsshat"],"id":[23404745],"kids":[23404886,23410165,23404846,23407714],"parent":[23404432],"text":["Granted we understand &quot;brick&quot; to mean the device cannot boot, but this comes pretty damn close on some phones, it seems.<p>&gt; &quot;After setting the image in question as a wallpaper, the phone immediately crashed.

This last does not mean that simple concentration of the means of production and of the command over labour, which is identical with accumulation. It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. This process differs from the former in this, that it only presupposes a change in the distribution of capital already on hand, and functioning; its field of action is therefore not limited by the absolute growth of social wealth, by the absolute limits of accumulation. Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. This is the centralization proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration.<p>The laws of this centralization of capitals, or of the attraction of capital by capital, cannot be developed here. A brief hint at a few facts must suffice. The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities depends, coeteris pribus, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages in direct proportion to the number, and the inverse proportion to the magnitudes, of the antagonistic capitals. It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hand of their conquerors, partly vanish. Apart from this, with capitalist production an altogether new force comes into play - the credit system.<p>In its beginnings, the credit system sneaks in as a modest helper of accumulation and draws by invisible threads the money resources scattered all over the surface of society into the hands of individual or associated capitalists. But soon it becomes a new and formidable weapon in the competitive struggle, and finally it transforms itself into an immense social mechanism for centralization of capitals."],"time":["2020-06-03 18:44:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Proven"],"id":[23406196],"kids":{},"parent":[23403455],"text":["That alleged trend doesn&#x27;t concern me at all.<p>What concerns me is my declining power vs. State power."],"time":["2020-06-03 19:37:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["tryptophan"],"id":[23404274],"kids":[23404429,23405224,23404484],"parent":[23403455],"text":["This seems like a political piece.<p>There is no mention of how the decline in worker share is due to a rise in real-eastate income share, not due to monopolies or corporations or capitalism or billionaires. &quot;Due to&quot; is maybe a strong way of putting it, but that&#x27;s where the share from the decrease went.<p>For some reason everyone seems to accept the idea that just being there first and buying land first somehow entitles you to eternally increasing prices and rents for that land, even when you do literally nothing to improve it&#x27;s value(hello, &#x27;historic&#x27; parking lots in SF).

I love it. Gnome continues to improve a lot with each release, and overall the operating system feels very stable. I can&#x27;t think of the last time I saw any error.<p>- This machine doesn&#x27;t have great battery life regardless of what OS you are running, but after properly configuring the GPU, battery life on linux is on par with Windows if not a bit better. I&#x27;ve also undervolted the cpu, which is easy to do and provides even better batter life.<p>- I was able to install all the software I needed using a combination of the Fedora rpm repositories, rpmfusion, and flathub. I actually have come to prefer flatpaks over other installation methods for software like bitwarden, spotify, riot, slack, etc. I don&#x27;t notice the same performance issues I have seen with snaps on Ubuntu. I install Steam from rpmfusion, and am surprised at how nice the linux gaming experience is these days.<p>There are a few things that are less than stellar, though.<p>- It takes a little work to get decent battery life because of the nvidia gpu, and the setup isn&#x27;t perfect. External displays must be run of the discrete gpu, so you can&#x27;t get them to work if you are just running off the integrated intel chip, which provides the best battery life. In fact, external displays don&#x27;t work when using &quot;prime offloading&quot; either. You need to set the nvidia gpu as the primary gpu to get external displays to work. What this all adds up to is that I need to change a config value and log out&#x2F;back in depending on whether I am plugged in to an external display or not. I have a script that does this so it isn&#x27;t that bad.<p>Interestingly, with the latest kernel release the nouveau driver is working for my nvidia card and, at least according to powertop, is able to dynamically switch from power-saving to primary mode when an external display is connected. I am also hopeful nvidia will resolve this in the next release.<p>- Docker is still a pain to set up on 32. There&#x27;s no docker-ce repo, but you can install from the Fedora 31 repos, and to get it to work some system and firewall configuration is required. This is all pretty well documented in a github issue now, but it took a lot of troubleshooting at first.<p>That&#x27;s my experience, and it has improved a lot since the machine first came out and I was running Fedora 30. There were initially several serious firmware bugs which took a long time to get resolved, and the OS&#x2F;driver support was not nearly as good as it is now. Overall, I would recommend this combo if you need a powerful machine."],"time":["2020-06-03 17:11:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wilsonfiifi"],"id":[23407847],"kids":[23407960],"parent":[23401258],"text":["What’s dual (or multiple) monitor Support like with Linux these days?
