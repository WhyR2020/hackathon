You mention that your confidence suffers. This is more likely to discourage you from facing future challenges. Each challenge feels a little more out of reach, and each consequence increases the pressure.<p>One thing that a lot of undiagnosed adults don&#x27;t know is that ADHD can present like as anxiety and depression. It can also look like fear and apathy.

I&#x27;ve been adjusting treatment over that time, and it&#x27;s still not perfect, but in that time I went from an anxious falling apart mess grateful to have a job at all, to taking on leadership of a team. (Obviously, a great deal of other things have improved along with that, but I&#x27;m trying to stay relevant to the question.) Side effects of my particular med (currently vyvanse) are non-existent, I&#x27;m just gradually working up to a dose that works for me.

I was told I can ‘achieve anything’ during my childhood which, somehow is a signal to my brain to pick the things I definitely can do and leave the harder things because it might actually show I cannot ‘achieve anything’ (duh, ofcourse I can’t, but it is not a rational or even conscious thing anyway).<p>Luckily I found a mechanism to cope with that very early on; I build a ‘story’ around the task&#x2F;project&#x2F;thing that I want to do but also ‘prove to my brain’ I am ‘all that’ (so I don’t simply don’t do it as is the first instinct); basically to narrate that this is only the first step and it will probably be crap, but it will become that shiny perfection that was promised later on through iteration.<p>I do this with everything; cooking, software dev (where it is actually the normal way things work), hardware, management, sports, etc. Some things go ‘perfect’ the first time, most obviously do not, but they either become irrelevant or get better (and even perfect for some definition).<p>That way, I am mentally shielded from not doing them in the first place because of my mental block.

To that end there are certain habits you can pick up that greatly help with modifying your behavior, and provide a sense of success before the overall problem is solved.<p>The first thing I recommend is to make your own lists of short tasks that need to be completed. This in itself can be satisfying because writing the list is effectively your first finished task.<p>Next, after completing a few tasks you need to reward yourself with something you enjoy. It shouldn&#x27;t take much time to do, but it should be something you won&#x27;t get easily board of. Continue rewarding yourself after a set number of tasks. Generally, you should be getting a reward about once an hour to start out, not more. After a few days, maybe a week, increase the number of tasks you must complete for a reward. Continue increasing the number of tasks per reward every few days. If you find yourself losing motivation, then decrease the number of tasks required.<p>Just a few tips, the reward should be something that you can do quickly and that you can resist doing while you&#x27;re still working. The reward should be mildly habit forming, but not addictive. Also, if it&#x27;s food related you might want to make it small enough that it won&#x27;t make you fat. A favorite candy can be a good choice so long as you can make the rewards small but still satisfying. It also shouldn&#x27;t be something complicated or distracting to other people. If it&#x27;s too complicated that can kill your own productivity. It also helps if you take a short break like 5 minutes per reward or at least take short breaks a few times a day even without a reward."],"time":["2020-04-21 22:29:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["quezzle"],"id":[22920690],"kids":[22920781],"parent":[22919697],"text":["This may sound flippant but it’s deadly serious:<p><i><\/i><i>Just Do It.<\/i><i><\/i><p>Put your head down and do the work and stop not doing it.<p>I spoke to my counselor once about going to the gym and I was expecting to hear him talk about emotional issues that might be preventing me going etc and he said: “there are some things in life that you simply have to take action on.

It’s best if you create your own, based on your particular strengths and tendencies, by researching about behavior and keeping a journal to accelerate your learning like a field scientist.<p>But here’s a quick general model to get started:<p>1. Consider 4 drivers of behavior: Need Levels (serotonin&#x2F;oxytocin), Activation Level (norepinephrine&#x2F;stress vs relaxation rest), Energy Level (glucose&#x2F;glycogen vs insulin spikes and energy conservation), Drive&#x2F;Learned Behavior (dopamine&#x2F;learned reward behavior vs helplessness).<p>2. If you have big needs, ie you are needy because of say chronically low serotonin levels, you will be more desperate to seek pleasure, even if that runs counter to your stated goals (stay up late binging, even though it will lower your ability to perform at work).<p>3. You need energy to mentally process, so to be a high performer at work, you need to pattern your life to have max energy at work. So exercise and eat well to be energetic between 9-5. This might mean addressing general neediness, otherwise you will keep doing destructive behavior outside work, that will harm your performance. You won’t go to the gym, won’t eat the healthy food because you are too busy addressing desperate pleasure.<p>4. If you don’t improve your general energy level, you will tend to overuse stress elevators, like caffeine and harsh self-talk, but over the long run that will impair your health, make you physically weaker, while also impairing accurate self-awareness (because it becomes too necessary for you to believe good things about yourself even if false).<p>5. Your learned approaches to solving problems, aka getting rewards, have to be trained by you. Dopaminergenic systems that deliver ‘drive’ when you are confident the outcome will result in success. You need to learn how to approach challenges at work to get immediate rewards of serotonin and oxytocin. For example, how to approach your work to get approval from colleagues, or how to approach your work to receive intrinsic reward like problem simplification (which rewards by lowering the mental burden of the problem), or aesthetic beauty creation etc...<p>You might see in your life several problem behaviors through this model, but one that stands out to me is related to #5, you don’t have effective strategies to get more immediate reward out of hard problems. That’s typical, especially in people with high standards. When training people to be more effective, I teach them to break up hard problems into steps, but also to appreciate the process of working on problems from different angles. Because then they start to see short term rewards that they can achieve in the process of working toward their goals... What is your process for analyzing the problem? What is your process for collaborating on the problem with others? What tools do you use? This way you will find that a hard problem, that initially looks like a barren forest with a single reward after a 100 miles of journey, is transformed into many pockets of orchards where you can look for trees with low hanging fruits of short term pleasure... Each day you get up and look for fruit, you can sustain yourself on a single hard problem for years like this, speaking from personal experience."],"time":["2020-04-20 03:46:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kingkawn"],"id":[22920196],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["Experiment with the tone of The inner voice you use to overcome it"],"time":["2020-04-20 03:00:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dfsegoat"],"id":[22920055],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["Do the things you need to do.<p>Don’t let your brain try to trick you out of it."],"time":["2020-04-20 02:34:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["BasDirks"],"id":[22921492],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["Make it a game to find goals that excite you."],"time":["2020-04-20 07:53:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tribeofone"],"id":[22919982],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["Lookup Wes Watson on youtube."],"time":["2020-04-20 02:19:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unstrafed"],"id":[22920978],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["I&#x27;ve lived with ADHD for about half of my life. You may or may not have ADHD, but what you&#x27;re describing sounds pretty similar. Here&#x27;re a few things I do.<p>0. Rexamine physical health. In the past two years, I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea and low testosterone (I&#x27;m a guy). Having those two treated has been almost miraculous. The ADHD is still very real, but I find I can fight the inattentiveness if I&#x27;ve had a good night&#x27;s sleep. (And, I guess not coincidentally, a good night&#x27;s sleep for me is between 6 and 7 hours on a CPAP. I can rarely make it to 8 hours. Again, the ADHD is real.) I&#x27;ve also been examining my diet, my weight, my activity level and other physical changes I can make.<p>1. Be constructively self-critical and responsible for your actions, but not self-destructive. I shouldn&#x27;t accept failure from myself due to lack of attentiveness&#x2F;motivation, but that&#x27;s not a license to tell myself that I&#x27;m an intrinsically, irredeemably bad person. This may be a cliche in SV, but with ADHD or the feelings you&#x27;re describing, every failure really is a learning opportunity. Your feelings of lack of motivation are not anyone else&#x27;s fault, but they&#x27;re not yours either. However, only you can take the initiative to make the situation better.<p>2. Think through the activities you do where you actually do have quite a bit of clarity and focus. I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s something you do that just makes time seem to melt away. See if there&#x27;s a way to harness what interests you in that activity, and see if you can apply it in a constructive way. I have two: playing RTS games and driving or doing some other fairly monotonous activity that nonetheless requires attention and focus. Playing RTS games has actually helped me develop strategies to remember to do things, and driving long distances suggested to me that if I constrain my environment in certain ways, I can actually be quite productive and attentive.<p>3. Use some strategies&#x2F;invent your own.<p>- I find that writing down checklists is a huge help. It makes the big problems crumble into small manageable bricks. (For checklists, I&#x27;ve started literally putting notes in VS Code in a markdown file, and then using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension, which shows an interactive, two-way bound rendering on the right pane of my screen.)<p>- Bootstrap the right mindset every day. I put a few post-it notes around my monitor, bathroom mirror or other places that I&#x27;ll see to remind me how to deal with life. I put enough up that they&#x27;ll help me without making me feel overwhelmed. This strategy is also useful for any self-control issues you may have, which usually goes hand-in-hand with a lack of motivation&#x2F;feeling overwhelmed by big problems. When I make a good decision based on a reminder from the past, it&#x27;s a fun feeling. These good feelings can form a sort of virtuous cycle where you find yourself being a bit more disciplined than you have been.<p>- Quit social media. I&#x27;ve entirely cut out Twitter and I only use Facebook Messenger. I don&#x27;t miss any of it. I visit HN more now, and use the &quot;attentiveness&quot; features in my profile. This may seem drastic, but it&#x27;s helpful.<p>- If you can&#x27;t quit something (YouTube, for instance), use some sort of blocker that will keep you locked out for a time. I edit my &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts file, although there are more automated tools that can do this kind of thing.<p>- Read up on tactics people use for things like speed reading or note-taking or other organizational and personal management skills. Then put them into practice. I&#x27;ve started using a RocketBook for note-taking, and it&#x27;s wonderful. I use a specific note-taking method called the Cornell Method [1], and I find my focus and comprehension when learning big new topics is much higher. Find what works for you, and implement it.<p>- Trap yourself into pro-productivity habits, not anti-productivity ones. Eliminate any distractions or interactions when you&#x27;re doing productive work; maximize the number of distractions when you&#x27;re doing unproductive things (like getting so far into YouTube&#x27;s recommendation algorithm that you watch a Japanese guy make hard objects out of bread or fingernails - this may or may not have happened to me). I set timers for that stuff and otherwise try to harass myself as much as possible. When I&#x27;m working, I set Do Not Disturb mode on anything supporting it, I turn off other notifications (within reason - I&#x27;d recommend you still respond to your boss&#x2F;client, for instance). Look into things like the pomodoro method, where you work for 25 mins and take a 5 minute break, and see if you can increase the productive time.<p>4. Find something you think you can&#x27;t do, and then try to do it and don&#x27;t give up. Steve Jobs once said, &quot;Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.&quot; [2] My experience has shown this is quite true. We make our own luck. I&#x27;ve learned that with enough effort, that feeling feeling in the pit of my stomach that coincides with the thought &quot;I don&#x27;t know how I can tackle this problem&quot; has almost always given way to the feeling of victory when I actually do solve the problem. I haven&#x27;t had 100% success, of course, but I always frame the lack of success as TODOs to revisit later. I have my current job because I did this, and it&#x27;s the best job I&#x27;ve ever had with the best team I have ever worked with. Once you do a single thing you thought you couldn&#x27;t do, your perspective on life does change somewhat.<p>5. Make change gradually. I didn&#x27;t take a magic pill and have all problems in my life solved. In fact, I can&#x27;t do this - I&#x27;ll be dooming myself to failure. If I try a new exercise regimen or trying to form habits or something like that, I do them one at a time. I find it hard to cope otherwise. My wife is the opposite - she gets motivation from shocking herself into a new routine, but I just can&#x27;t handle that approach. I set major goals on the order of years, milestones on the order of months, and then individual strategies and tactics on weeks or days.<p>6. Find the positives of your situation. Unlike most people who have a basic intuition about how to accomplish complex tasks, I have devote my own brainpower to it. However, this has resulted in me developing an almost scientific process for improvement, which most normally motivated&#x2F;attentive people don&#x27;t have. There were people I graduated college with who had no issues with ADHD and were far ahead of me in terms of organizational skills and the ability to self-manage. However, through continual work over the years I&#x27;ve surpassed many of them in accomplishments. Career accomplishments are not a measure of a fulfilled life, of course, but making genuine contributions to fellow humans (even if those are fairly small but real) is a good feeling that is hard to overstate.<p>7. Try to control your emotions without suppressing them or letting them run wild. I find that a lot of the source of my &quot;mental laziness&quot; actually doesn&#x27;t involve the mind at all, but my emotions. I have to engage the mind to counteract the emotions I experience, and when I do, the strong emotions holding me back (e.g. fear, anger, boredom, despair) are actually not that severe. Putting emotional experiences into words is a simple strategy that can be helpful. Our brains have a sophisticated neocortex which can handle complex reasoning, including linguistic reasoning. Our emotions are thought to be processed and generated by our limbic systems, which are present in most vertebrates and is pre-linguistic (though is very much involved in vocalization of emotional tone, even in non-humans). I&#x27;ve found that the higher functions of our brains can actually put the lower functions in their place when warranted.<p>8. Use therapy and other resources to help you. Therapists can absolutely help. You will find there are probably treatments that you can do that will help, and many of them do not involve medication. A therapist can be especially helpful at determining the causes of why you feel the way you feel, and may be helpful in developing strategies to overcome these issues. A therapist can also be a shortcut to some of the experimentation I mentioned above. They are often aware of explicit strategies that work for many people, and those might directly help you or might be a good seed that grows into something unique for you. And it&#x27;s sometimes helpful to be forced to put your thoughts and attitude into words for another human being, who can synthesize it and review it with you.<p>This list has ballooned from a few planned points, but I hope it helps. You can vanquish this problem. I think you would be surprised at how much you can accomplish by putting forth just a little bit of intentional effort in the right ways.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsc.cornell.edu&#x2F;study-skills&#x2F;cornell-note-taking-system&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsc.cornell.edu&#x2F;study-skills&#x2F;cornell-note-taking-syst...<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw&amp;t=38s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw&amp;t=38s<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-20 05:57:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fargle"],"id":[22921387],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["Don&#x27;t give up."],"time":["2020-04-20 07:31:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marciojmo"],"id":[22921172],"kids":{},"parent":[22919697],"text":["tl;dr: Role play a robot.<p>Try to block &quot;thinking&quot;.

I&#x27;ll offer an actionable strategy which I have been using to progress from a depressed late 20something dependent on family charity, to graduating a competitive coding bootcamp and building prototypes for a startup.<p>The key is to exercise those proper faculties of mind -- a few simple exercises are cold showers, long-distance running, and meditation.<p>Cold showers have taught me how to overcome the initial difficulties; to continuously put oneself into a position of discomfort, then use powers of consciousness to develop acceptance is a powerful practice. There are various methods to implement this habit -- at the end of my shower, I set a timer for 5 minutes and progressively drop the temperature whenever I acclimate to the current state. The game I play is to spend the longest amount of time in the coldest water by dropping progressively quicker during those 5 mins. Challenging yourself is a reward within itself.<p>Where cold showers build mental strength in the domain of environmental changes, long-distance running builds endurance. As a side-effect, there is a strong correlation between mental health and cardio exercise, aerobic exercise generates BDNF which acts as a precursor for neurogenesis. Depressed people often have smaller hippocampi, and BDNF literally grows neurons in the hippocampus, where we store memory. There are many other evidence-based positive side effects. For implementation, I would suggest the Maffetone method, which teaches users to never push to hard, as it leads to burnout; but instead to progressively build up endurance by exercising at a comfortable rate. The only tool necessary is a heart-rate monitor, and any type of cardio activity can be substituted. His method is used successfully by ironmen and triathlete winners. It&#x27;s a method to learn patience.<p>Samadhi is a state characterized as intense one-pointed concentration established through meditation. It is impossible to practice meditation without practicing those steps which lead towards a meditative mind. The yoga sutras of patangili provide a programmatic method towards this state. What is practiced by most popular western yoga is the practice of asana, or preparing the body for meditation. Following asana is pranayama, which is the regulation of breath through various practices. It is thought that breath control is the vector which enables us to manage the rest of our autonomic system, which enables our own internal state to control how we react to events -- the fundamental basis for freedom. It is difficult to discover teachers for these practices. Practically, I would suggest searching for Wim Hof&#x27;s breathing method as a good introduction or entertaining exercise.

Another big part was being able to spend time in prayer, fasting, and service to God and others.

From my point of view few if any of us commenting here are knowledgeable enough to connect all the disparate data points we keep snatching at and synthesize them into conclusions that are likely to be correct. The people who can do that are working on it, and generally too busy at the moment to post on forums or give interviews. The misinformation and unfounded conclusions that are flying around, and especially the atmosphere of political strife and mistrust are very frustrating to them (and all of us I&#x27;m sure). Most of us here have chafed at similar situations when people who don&#x27;t really understand what we do express strong opinions about how we should do it. They understand how people are being impacted, but they can&#x27;t give us certainty at the moment however badly we want it.<p>The mortality rate in this place or that; the experience on a cruise ship, or in Sweden, or in North Dakota vs. that in New York or Italy; the percentage of people who are positive and asymptomatic vs. presymptomatic vs. symptomatic; whether this or that drug seems to have a good effect on outcomes; they absolutely don&#x27;t know how all of this fits together yet. All of them, doctors, nurses, researchers, are going in every day, treating patients, participating in daily conference calls to share information on outcomes, trying different therapies. They&#x27;re figuring this out and all they have asked us for is some time. All these studies and hypotheses and numbers from various places don&#x27;t always reflect what&#x27;s actually happening on the ground.<p>Someone mentioned quarantining the &quot;vulnerable&quot; people and letting everyone else get back to work and develop our &quot;herd immunity.&quot; Are researchers certain we gain long term immunity? Can they precisely define &quot;vulnerable?&quot; My wife is clinical care coordinator on a covid unit in northern New Jersey (that&#x27;s the personal part). Her first patient was 51. I bet that&#x27;s younger than most of you are thinking when you think &quot;vulnerable.&quot; It looks like he&#x27;s going to make it and drop into that large &quot;didn&#x27;t die&quot; bucket I see referred to here over and over, but to get there he spent _five weeks_ in an ICU bed on a ventilator. My wife has treated lots of elderly people. She&#x27;s also treated people in their 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s. People in those age groups have died. Children have died, too. How many of each type of person will be affected by this or that containment policy? We don&#x27;t know.<p>When this thing started my wife&#x27;s hospital was running about 2:1 patients to nurses. They&#x27;re now flirting with 4-6:1. They don&#x27;t have proper PPE. At another hospital near us a nurse was suspended for bringing her own to work. The general opinion is that the system can&#x27;t handle much additional strain, and I don&#x27;t think any of us are in a position to argue the point with them. It&#x27;s been a month. We can absolutely make it through a few months if we have to, while they do their work.

It&#x27;s been well over a decade since it was made clear that this was going to end. So, IMHO the impact to remaining 2.7 users is minimal. They were in any case extremely conservative updating and are probably also running lots of other outdated stuff like Red Hat &#x2F; Ubuntu versions that long dropped out of LTS, etc. That&#x27;s fine and valid but at this point you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that you are on your own.

Lots of python is more about other types of jobs where the impact of security vulnerabilities is much less.<p>And, I&#x27;m sure that if there&#x27;s demand, somebody might actually step up to do the occasional patch release if it is really needed.

So it&#x27;s very clear companies have never chosen one office solution to another because it is the preference of the worker.<p>As for the argument of changes to &quot;productivity&quot;. For starters very few of us work in roles where productivity is a directly measurable thing. Sure you can argue about commits, lines of code, ship times, but those are all nowhere near as measurable as &quot;widgets-per-hour&quot;. On top of this we all know that a huge portion of roles out there are arguably not productive at all (and if they are it&#x27;s very hard to measure).

Firstly, “epiphany addiction” — I encountered it on the blog of Aaron Swartz (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;anders\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;anders<\/a>):<p>&gt; <i>The irony, of course, is that the books are totally useless unless you take their advice. If you just keep reading them, thinking “that’s so insightful! that changes everything,” but never actually doing anything different, then pretty quickly the feeling will wear off and you’ll start searching for another book to fill the void. Chris Macleod calls this “epiphany addiction”: “Each time they feel like they’ve stumbled on some life changing discovery, feel energized for a bit without going on to achieve any real world changes, and then return to their default […]. They always end up back at the drawing board of trying to think their way out of their problem, and it’s not long before they come up with the latest pseudo earth shattering insight.”<\/i><p>2. Beware of searching for one true method by which you will finally “defeat” procrastination. I remember this excitement when some trick used to work, and the urge to write a post like this (BTW, congrats on writing and finishing this post — I never got around to writing something so “finished”), having found “the answer”. But eventually some trick that used to make you productive may stop helping so much. (Because there are other unaddressed root issues, which seem to find a “workaround”: this is the &quot;procrastination as wily adversary&quot; metaphor, as in <i>War of Art<\/i> etc.) Ultimately, it seems we need a complementary set of approaches, both external (like Steps 1 to 3 in this blog post: changing your habits), and internal (being more aware of your feelings and drives, etc). Procrastination (for many) seems to be discomfort-avoidance, where the discomfort can be some combination of fear, anxiety, distaste, dread, uncertainty, ambiguity, conflict with (some of) one&#x27;s values, etc. It helps to become more aware about the nature of your discomfort, and get to the root of it. But ultimately you can&#x27;t think your way out of the procrastination problem. Things like mindfulness, talking to a therapist, good exercise,… all help; just don&#x27;t pin your hopes too strongly on one of them, to the exclusion of other approaches. (I had given up blocking websites as it had stopped working for me, but after reading this post I just added a major time-waster to my &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts file, thank you.)<p>The goal is to get to a state where you don&#x27;t feel out of control of your own mind, where you can decide to do something and just do it — but it can be a process to get there. Good luck to you, me, and all of us. “You can&#x27;t think your way into right action, but you can act your way into right thinking.”"],"time":["2020-04-20 13:54:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["k__"],"id":[22922673],"kids":[22922762],"parent":[22922372],"text":["Procrastination is a very delicate problem.<p>I mostly embraced it.

You could try and do server-side WebRTC using a project like Pions[2], or use headless Chrome and be a peer, but both of those come with their own headaches. This just uses the MediaRecorder API to send chunks of video as it’s available via a WebSocket, then the server pipes those messages into FFmpeg via stdin. It’s lightweight enough that it even runs incredibly well on Glitch[3].<p>Also, if you’re curious, the videos that come out of the MediaRecorder are all over the place between browsers, but they’re all varying degrees of “barely qualifying as playable video”.

The government had enough masks &#x2F; PPE on paper, but never actually checked it was usable. No one intended this to happen, it just sort of fell through the cracks, and all the paperwork said everything was OK.<p>Now that huge amounts of physical masks are actually needed, they can&#x27;t get by anymore on paperwork that doesn&#x27;t reflect reality.<p>The stockpile probably has a (not officially acknowledged) main purpose of protecting the essential parts of government if there&#x27;s an outbreak: soldiers, intelligence, Congress, etc.<p>Since people actually started physically checking the masks in government stockpiles, behind the scenes bureaucrats have been panicking because they suddenly found out there won&#x27;t be enough PPE to protect the government, and the market&#x27;s so tight and the supply chain is so stretched that they just can&#x27;t simply buy it, there&#x27;s way too much demand.<p>So they&#x27;ve decided they need to rebuild the stockpile.  The government&#x27;s reasoning is probably that what really matters is that the &quot;people who matter&quot; in government have what they need.  If civilian doctors get sick, and some of them die, that&#x27;s (seen by government bureaucrats as) an acceptable price to pay to be sure the government itself is protected.<p>This sounds pretty horrible, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re completely wrong.

Maybe it&#x27;s to hide the original screwup of not checking the stockpile properly.

But it&#x27;s not a slam dunk obvious &quot;best practice&quot; or whatever. The end goal is to deliver the best quality software (or alternatively the most sell-able software), shipping early isn&#x27;t some arbitrary metric you use to assess your engineers, it&#x27;s a strategy to get your product from point A to B as quick as possible, where B is something really useful that the market wants, and A is presumably something crap that you can&#x27;t sell. Because if you already have a piece of great software then your focus should be on selling it, not throwing more darts at the wall and hoping you don&#x27;t knock the dart board off.<p>Looking at the dot points, I have no doubt that all of OP&#x27;s teams are successful. They&#x27;re all great advice, except for the one the title and conclusion of the article are based on.<p>Their first point is &quot;keep the team small, all doers, no talkers&quot;. IME that already puts you way ahead of the pack. By far the easiest way to cork a startup is to hire one of everything and wait for Parkinson&#x27;s law to bone you. A small team of programmers isn&#x27;t the ideal setup for everything, but I bet it does well above average compared to the field (which is good, because the average startup goes down like the Hindenburg if YC&#x27;s data is accurate).<p>Outsourcing stuff that isn&#x27;t core is also good advice. Half the reason big teams don&#x27;t work is exponential growth of communication. If you can modularise your business so that one app&#x2F;feature&#x2F;whatever is tied strictly to one communication channel, then you avoid all that. Obviously it can backfire. I&#x27;m sure everyone has seen a few projects eat dust by outsourcing to the wrong people, it&#x27;s not exactly an original story. I think it&#x27;s good advice in general though.<p>Aligning people&#x27;s development goals with the business&#x27;s goals is obvious. The further suggestion to prioritise employee&#x27;s wants over the business&#x27;s is interesting though. I think it&#x27;s on the right track but the actual good advice is buried a layer deeper here. You should prioritise work your team wants to do, but there&#x27;s a prerequisite that you probably also need a team that wants to do work that is good for the business. I think the real advice is hire people who are (or can become) mentally invested in what your business is trying to accomplish. And the easiest shortcut to that is probably to make them financially invested in it by offering equity. Align everyone&#x27;s goals then trust your team completely. I think if you&#x27;re already in a position where your employees don&#x27;t care and have tangential goals (like a bit of resume driven development), then you probably don&#x27;t have a great move to make, and blindly following OP&#x27;s advice isn&#x27;t likely to improve the situation much.<p>One person per project is fantastic advice for some definition of &#x27;project&#x27;. Big businesses and big teams hate this approach, it&#x27;s all about bus factors and treating everyone like cogs that can be moved around to wherever they&#x27;re needed. Most of the teams I&#x27;ve been on would rather everyone have a shitty basic knowledge of an entire huge codebase than have anyone be responsible for any subset of it. And IME it always devolves into one hero that tries to control everything and everyone else feels like they have no control. I&#x27;ve been on both sides of it countless times, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best way to build software. Not by a long shot.<p>I think the reason it happens is because good developers have an innate want for more control, to take on more power and the responsibility that comes with it. Supressing that might work for average teams that can do their job with average developers (including good ones that are brought down to the mean), but if you want to stand out from the crowd you need to build an environment where everyone can have responsibility and be a core part of the team.<p>&#x27;Peer management&#x27; works great. But OP&#x27;s approach isn&#x27;t the way to go about it. I know a handful of great developers, people who I would entrust with my business or back with my own money. One of the things they all have in common is that timed status reports designed to hold them accountable wouldn&#x27;t work on them. They might put on a smile and suck it up but I can guarantee you they wouldn&#x27;t actually give a fuck what anybody thought about their delivery speed unless they actually respected them as a peer. So this is another dot point with a huge pre-requisite. It&#x27;s great advice as long as you already have a team that all respect each other&#x27;s abilities and are all close friends who don&#x27;t want to disappoint each other. And if that&#x27;s the case then you don&#x27;t actually have to take action as a founder or CEO. You don&#x27;t need to set up weekly reminders for your staff to make promises, the accountability will have grown naturally and already be there. Good engineers are self managing. OP says that themself in the opening paragraph. So this specific advice seems a bit out of place.<p>That leaves &#x27;no tasks longer than one week&#x27;. I think in the context of OP&#x27;s teams, this advice is crap. If you&#x27;re already nailing everything above, then you have a team that will deliver results and build great software. In every project I&#x27;ve worked on, there has been stuff in the pipeline that would take longer than a week and be a net positive for the business. Especially if you&#x27;re running a small team and have a modular workload with shared responsibility as above. There&#x27;s always going to be something that, if you broke it down, would represent a big hairy mess of interrelated tasks that have a high level of complexity, affect the same parts of the code base, and require the same high level of domain knowledge. Breaking those kinds of tasks down is usually a mistake, and it&#x27;s totally fine to have a team member you trust go off on a little odyssey for a fortnight or a month to deliver them. That doesn&#x27;t mean they work in a silo, or you don&#x27;t get kept in the loop, just that they&#x27;re given space to work.<p>In large teams these tasks are usually brute forced by breaking them down, creating jira monstrosities with every dependency thoroughly tracked, then splitting them up amongst a team of 10 people. They always, without fail, slip a couple of sprints and end up taking a month anyway, with the added bonus of tying the whole team up for that time. Nobody notices of course because we all know the correct language to use to make it sound like everything that was done was efficient and necessary and nobody really wants to suggest that whatever project management best practices are in these days might not have a 100% strike rate over the extremely varied work that goes into a complex software product.<p>So, tldr; OP has a bunch of great advice that you should definitely follow, but I think they&#x27;re off base on a couple of things."],"time":["2020-04-20 10:15:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cjslep"],"id":[22921843],"kids":[22922349,22923396,22924889],"parent":[22920143],"text":["When we first moved to a Gemeinde just outside of Zürich, my wife and I were amazed to see these cat ladders coming down from balconies.

OS&#x2F;2 was 5 years ahead of Microsoft Windows, and offered full 32-bit processing long before Windows did. However, OS&#x2F;2&#x27;s strength was also its weakness.<p>OS&#x2F;2 was developed from scratch, and was not encumbered by a legacy of DOS compatibility, 16-bit applications, and drivers like Windows was. This enabled IBM to innovate radically and more quickly. The application I wrote for my client was a multi-threaded program, written paradoxically with Microsoft&#x27;s Programmer Workbench, the character-based precursor to Visual Studio.<p>However, this freedom from legacy code also meant there were few applications available for OS&#x2F;2, and the only drivers were for IBM printers. OS&#x2F;2 eventually disappeared in spite of its technological superiority at the time.<p>IBM&#x27;s development environment was called C-Set, and, despite being a 32-bit compiler, was inferior to Programmer&#x27;s Workbench. For instance, after a compilation, if you double-clicked on an error message, it would open up the source code in a separate editor window, in a proportional typeface. You could not trigger a compilation from this window. You had to make your change, save &amp; close, then go back to the compiler window. Awkward.<p>There was no Resource Workshop for designing dialog boxes visually. You had to write all the statements in a text editor, and wouldn&#x27;t see the appearance until compiling and running the program. This slowed down development.<p>While debugging, I recall trying to step into the GUI part of the application code. This locked up the computer so bad we had to re-install OS&#x2F;2, a tedious process requiring 22 diskettes.<p>The IBM documentation was so inscrutable that even for ver. 2 of OS&#x2F;2, we had to refer to Microsoft&#x27;s ver. 1 manuals. IBM&#x27;s support gave an interesting insight into OS&#x2F;2&#x27;s downfall. My client had an expensive OS&#x2F;2 support contract with IBM. The client contacts were two guys in the PC support section. When I required technical support to answer some obscure and specialized questions about OS&#x2F;2, it didn&#x27;t make sense to get these guys involved, even though they were supposed to be the only official go-between with IBM. So I called IBM with the client&#x27;s authorization, and impersonated one of the support techs. After a few calls I slipped and used my name. The IBM guy was livid and tore a strip of me, saying that as an independent contractor, I had no business blah blah.

I built this a few years ago, and the main motivation at the time was that I&#x27;d heard people say that adding the new features in Python3 required breaking backwards compatibility, which I didn&#x27;t believe. IMO the only feature that really required breaking backwards compatibility was the str&#x2F;unicode consolidation and refactoring. This project was my way of proving that we could have gotten the other features that people tend to be most excited about (async&#x2F;await, function annotations, new super(), etc) without breaking existing Python2 code. I think it was successful at that as a proof of concept.<p>It was a fun project; I learned a lot about how the CPython implementation works and have a lot of respect for the people that built it.

A good example is the  CPIP: Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness guide:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;public-health&#x2F;services&#x2F;flu-influenza&#x2F;canadian-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-planning-guidance-health-sector&#x2F;table-of-contents.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;public-health&#x2F;services&#x2F;flu-influenz...<\/a><p>This strategy is almost perfect with a few tweaks but Canada dropped the ball on three fronts: 1. Data Sharing, 2. Process Scaling, and 3. Communication. The failures started with an inability to integrate Border Services data into the plan and the system failed to anticipate the scale of isolating the peak number of Snow Birds and March Break travellers returning back to Canada.<p>Strategy is a starting point but it is not the full story with respect to COVID-19 preparedness."],"time":["2020-04-20 11:48:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22922303],"kids":{},"parent":[22920983],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-20 11:09:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["pmiller2"],"id":[22922346],"kids":{},"parent":[22920983],"text":["This was a pretty good takedown of a pretty garbage essay, but I was disappointed the author didn&#x27;t spend more time talking about how capitalism has failed us here. For instance, corporations are fundamentally good at one thing: maximizing the amount of profit they can make by selling whatever it is they sell.<p>This is precisely why we were scrambling for ventilators a few weeks ago: it wouldn&#x27;t have been profitable to build them a year ago, because hospitals wouldn&#x27;t buy them, because they didn&#x27;t have the ability to use, store, or maintain them.<p>Another example is the current situation with toilet paper.  What&#x27;s happening here is not that people are pooping more than they were a few months ago.  It&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re doing it more at home, rather than at work.  TP for home use and TP for commercial use are different products (anyone who&#x27;s pooped at work or in a public bathroom knows this), made by different companies and using different supply chains.<p>While we have enough capacity to make and ship all the TP we need right now, what&#x27;s happening is that commercial TP makers are (rightly!) not switching to making TP for home use, because that would be really expensive for them to do.  They don&#x27;t have the proper supply chain (contracts, logistics, <i>etc.<\/i>) to support it, either.  End result: no TP in the stores. [0]<p>I saw a shower thought on Reddit that said something to the effect of &quot;the economy is in a bad state right now because people are only buying what they need.&quot;  While this vastly oversimplifies the issue, there is a good amount of merit to it.  Right now, most of my spending on stuff that is not rent is literally food for myself and my dog, and the occasional item to make this lockdown a bit more bearable.  There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m spending money on anything that isn&#x27;t immediately useful or will become necessary in the near to medium term future.  And, I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones who still has their job, because I can WFH.<p>OTOH, there are a number of things I hope we can learn from this lockdown.  I&#x27;ve already written about how I hope people can realize Keynes was right, and we don&#x27;t really have to work so damn much. [1]  More importantly, though, I hope people can realize that most of our elected representatives simply do not have our interests in mind (<i>e.g.<\/i> Trump wanting to &quot;reopen the economy&quot; by Easter, in spite of all the deaths that would have caused), and start voting in people who actually do represent them.<p>It&#x27;s an absolute crying shame that the US doesn&#x27;t have even the most basic levels of worker protections that every country in Europe offers.  So many people are suffering right now through no fault of their own, simply because we can&#x27;t afford to let people who have lost their jobs have more than a pittance of unemployment benefits, and a pathetic $1200 check they had to wait to get because someone wanted their signature on them.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marker.medium.com&#x2F;what-everyones-getting-wrong-about-the-toilet-paper-shortage-c812e1358fe0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marker.medium.com&#x2F;what-everyones-getting-wrong-about...<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22901430\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22901430<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-20 11:20:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["draw_down"],"id":[22923011],"kids":{},"parent":[22920983],"text":["Wow, what a nice response!"],"time":["2020-04-20 13:48:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["DeathArrow"],"id":[22922342],"kids":{},"parent":[22920983],"text":["TLDR:<p>White males are to blame for all evils in the Universe."],"time":["2020-04-20 11:19:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["chrisco255"],"id":[22921710],"kids":[22921881,22922224],"parent":[22920983],"text":["Bail out money is a death march to insolvency.

When the liquids are pumped into the battery cell stack situated between the tanks, a redox reaction occurs, and generates electricity at the battery’s electrodes.<p>&gt; By comparison, the new invention has only one electrolyte, comprised of an iron salt (rather than the more commonly used vanadium) dissolved in acid. When hydrogen ions react with the iron salt (Fe2+), hydrogen gas is produced at the platinum-coated carbon cathode in the battery stack.<p>&gt; “We introduce iron as a middleman, so we can separate electrolysis into two reactions,” says Wang. Doing so allows one to control where and when to reverse the reaction to produce electrical energy to supply to the grid. “The system gives you flexibility... you could do the regeneration during evening time when electricity prices are at a peak,” he says.<p>&gt; Regenerating Fe2+ in the reverse reaction also allows for the continuous production of hydrogen gas, he says. “And because the hydrogen-iron cell uses about half the voltage of a traditional electrolyzer, you can generate hydrogen at a much cheaper cost if you do everything right.”<p>It sounds to me like there are two things going on here.<p>Firstly, they have a redox cell which has one electrolyte, in which iron ions move between the II and III redox states.<p>Secondly, they have a way to shuffle electrons between iron and hydrogen, so they can take energy from the iron in the redox cell and use it to make hydrogen.<p>So, over short timescales, the system just works like a redox battery. No hydrogen is produced or consumed. But if the battery gets full, or they want hydrogen for other purposes, they can produce hydrogen, and in doing so, regenerate the iron.<p>Is that right? If so, what are the reactions here? What is the composition of the electrolyte, and what stops the iron ions decaying to the lower-energy state?

I work in China, and while China&#x27;s progress has been insane, Korea&#x27;s at a place where China is not yet.  So the debate is live in Korea, Canada, or somewhere else (or could just continue working in China, but difficult to call China home, given our backgrounds).<p>The #1 reason why I wouldn&#x27;t prefer Korea is because Samsung and other chaebols have too much of a grip on the country.  They don&#x27;t play fair.  They don&#x27;t give other companies even a chance to disrupt them.  It&#x27;s worse than what Microsoft was like in the 90s because at least Microsoft didn&#x27;t blatantly bribe and corrupt the highest levels of government.  They manipulate the stock market extremely maliciously to take out competitors before they can become disruptive.  I attended a lecture from a professor at Seoul National University who was an advisor to the government on how to get them to make the stock market more fair and allow companies to grow and achieve success.  It was startling to what extent the stock market got manipulated.<p>Never mind the idea of starting a company and being able to have a great exit.  Even if I was just a normal worker, how would my retirement funds be able to grow in that kind of a stock market, even if my employer matched contributions?

Also scary, zero risk diversification.<p>I think Korea&#x27;s long-term growth prospects will be severely limited as long as the chaebols have a stranglehold on the economy.  I am hopeful by the fact that they let Hanjin go bankrupt.  Apparently, everyone in Hanjin was just completely complacent and waiting for the government to bail them out.  When they didn&#x27;t get bailed out, it was a sign that the new government was willing to make some of the hard decisions necessary to allow for a properly entrepreneurial society to thrive."],"time":["2020-04-20 09:45:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[22919610],"kids":{},"parent":[22919213],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;ZkJiy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;ZkJiy<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-20 01:17:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AnonC"],"id":[22925586],"kids":[22926031,22926504],"parent":[22922475],"text":["I didn’t find any information about this service’s infrastructure and presence.

The reason that this is a hard problem has nothing to do with React, or Gatsby. It has to do with the strategy of precompiling HTML and not having a runtime server, an approach with many many benefits (described here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshwcomeau.com&#x2F;gatsby&#x2F;a-static-future&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshwcomeau.com&#x2F;gatsby&#x2F;a-static-future&#x2F;<\/a>).

I am not saying that this is the right approach for every website, but it was 100% the right choice for this one.<p>4.

Of course, you can also use N birth certificates to pass through any KYC system N times, to create N entities in said system, against the system’s wishes.<p>The problem with birth certificates is that they’re a single assertion about a single instantaneous event: they just say “this person was born.” It’s very easy to forge a new one, or to steal+repurpose someone else’s (especially if they’re dead and this fact has never been recorded), because a birth certificate only needs to be “verified” once, at point of issuance.<p>An alternative scheme would be to have some device that’s constantly doing life-logging of your biometrics (like what’s discussed here), where each segment of <i>unique<\/i> biometric data the device records translates to one “token” that can be put into any given proof-of-life <i>account<\/i>.<p>Such devices wouldn’t have to be constantly uploading data to the cloud; they’d just be recording it and storing it. It’d be up to you to present these devices for data-collection and collation, just like it’s up to you to present your birth certificate.<p>The key difference with such a system, would be that if you just put on two devices, you’re not mining proof-of-life at double the rate, because the data segment collected by the two devices wouldn’t be <i>unique<\/i> between them—you’d only be able to earn one token per real human being per period, no matter how much machine-power you devoted to doing so. When the data from the two devices was collated, it’d be clear that there’s duplicate biometric period data, and so you wouldn’t earn a token for said duplicate data.<p>It wouldn’t matter how you split up and rearranged the tokens generated by the devices. You could hold all your tokens in one “identity”, or split them up across multiple “identities.” But, if you split the tokens up, then each split identity would only have 1&#x2F;N of the proof strength of the identity of someone who puts all their tokens in one basket.<p>With such a system, you could literally just have each token a person can present translate to a vote, such that everyone who’s been alive for N periods gets N votes, as long as they can proof-of-life all N periods. (This would, of course, bias toward older people; but you can instead normalize the voting power of each token by dividing by the person’s age. How to prove age? Record the “genesis” token of each device through a trusted timestamping system—i.e. activate each device online. Then the person’s legal age would be the timestamp on the oldest genesis token they can prove ownership of, by proving ownership of the private key that was used to sign the genesis-certificate-request.)<p>I enjoy the fact that, other than the “trusted timestamping of genesis tokens” part, this system has roughly nothing to do with a shared ledger or “blockchain”; each device can just keep its own independent private log, and the only time those logs leave the device is when the person themselves commands the devices to export them. It’d also be up to you to wear or not wear a life-logging device. But, of course, in avoiding having your life logged, you’d be losing out on tokens for the periods you didn’t log, and so depriving yourself of the things tokens translate into (voting power; federal tax-credit hours; state-public-healthcare-benefit time-spent-as-a-state-resident-proof hours; immigration time-spent-living-in-the-country-proof hours; etc.)<p>...and of course this is a weird and dystopian invasion of privacy. Attaching ankle bracelets to babies to ensure they get appropriately credited for their own infancy sounds like something out of Black Mirror. I never said it wasn’t.
