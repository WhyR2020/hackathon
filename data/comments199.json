This is rare among us designers and has proven to be extremely powerful for the result since there is less wasted effort.<p>- Analysis — Your users, know everything that&#x27;s wrong with your product but have difficulty communicating it. Often it comes out in anger and frustration. That&#x27;s where my usability analysis comes in. I&#x27;ll review your app from an outsider and expert point of view, and give you actionable feedback.<p>- Free advice — You might not be sure if I am the right fit, and I very well might not be. I can help you figure out the best direction to go for free.<p>I take my work very seriously and put a lot of work into excellent communication, proper planning, and, last but not least, properly understanding your product so that we can produce great results.<p>Portfolio at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gilli.is\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gilli.is<\/a><p>Contact me at gilli@hn.gilli.is"],"time":["2020-09-01 22:51:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["x110dc"],"id":[24365880],"kids":[24376590,24376586],"parent":[24342497],"text":["SEEKING FREELANCER - News Revenue Hub | Data Analyst (contract) | Remote | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundjournalism.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;job-opening-data-analyst-contract&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundjournalism.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;job-opening-da...<\/a><p>News Revenue Hub a 501c3 nonprofit.

I had some sympathy with Elon, having also had experience of animal experiments that don’t work perfectly the day we have visitors in the room!

The demonstrations were actually quite underwhelming in this regard, and didn’t show anything that hasn’t been done before (e.g. decoding limb position during walking).  There is a big difference between recording brain cells and ‘reading thoughts’, especially when it comes to higher-level cognitive functions that we don’t understand as well.  The idea of ‘writing to the brain’ is even more questionable – there are fundamental limitations to targeting specific networks of neurons in a meaningful way using electrical stimulation.<p>&gt; “So in summary I would say this is solid engineering but mediocre neuroscience.  Finally, I think it is unfortunate that they are presenting their work in this way, rather than publishing peer-reviewed papers that would allow their claims to be scrutinised, but I guess this is something that we will have to get used to as neural interfaces move from the academic to the commercial sector.”<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemediacentre.org&#x2F;expert-reaction-to-elon-musks-neuralink-demonstration-involving-pigs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemediacentre.org&#x2F;expert-reaction-to-elon-m...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-01 13:32:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moontear"],"id":[24340340],"kids":[24340449,24341003,24340920,24340358],"parent":[24340052],"text":["I am not an expert, but what I thought was remarkable is the 12000 channels Musk talked about.

The first-class citizen remains JS, for now, and people writing C&#x2F;C++, Rust, Scala, ML, and others to webassembly are making their code available with JS bindings that just work. That&#x27;s pretty amazing.<p>The closest thing to this is Python, and it&#x27;s so nontrivial to contribute native or FFI code that works reliably to pip that it&#x27;s not done outside of a handful of extremely performance sensitive data science projects.

Those who promote this meme either offer no explanation for how this can be done, or offer a hand-wavy and anemic explanation of what is really a titanic effort on an untried scale.

No. A number of college athletes are currently grounded with pericarditis, a risky diagnosis with an indefinite time course.

If we&#x27;re concerned about the drag on our economy, let&#x27;s consider what kind of drag a chronically ill labor force will generate. This is the scenario in third-world countries, where infectious diseases like malaria and AIDS eat into labor productivity and sap the average life expectancy.<p>In other words, this is a dangerous complex of memes that show up in tandem and aren&#x27;t particularly affected by gathering evidence.

Fundamentally, if any review took place at all, it&#x27;s going to be automated only. I don&#x27;t see any competitor being able to withstand the cost of having humans review Apps going into their stores, nor do I see any players who could afford it have an incentive to do so if they can just push users to an App Store they don&#x27;t have deal with in this way.<p>For instance, I couldn&#x27;t find any indication that the Amazon AppStore has any human intervention for the reviewing of applications submitted [0][1], and not without issues[2]. Notoriously, Google is automating everything they can about the app review process, across both Google Play and The Chrome WebStore[3][4] and its a dumpster fire[5].<p>Comparing this to the iOS App Store, its at least a league cut above the rest here, and there are many justified criticisms and problems with it as well.<p>I think what we need is firm transparency of app store policies, and frankly I think App Review should include more about what code is exactly the issue (or at least, what APIs aren&#x27;t being used correctly, or what have you), and give specific, detailed examples, rather than often undetailed responses that help nobody through the submission process. The hostility here is the problem, as with other issues that are re-occurent recently, I think Apple wins by providing more transparency and less opaque in the process. I don&#x27;t know if the consumer really wants an alternative app store (I know developers do, but thats really not the question at the end of the day, if Apple suitably changes course on managing the existing store)<p>I don&#x27;t think its competition thats the problem, as we&#x27;ve seen on Android, it doesn&#x27;t show merit that this actually makes things better, or that consumers are really interested in having this competition in the space.<p>[0]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.amazon.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;app-submission&#x2F;understanding-submission.html#overview-of-the-app-submission-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.amazon.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;app-submission&#x2F;understandi...<\/a><p>[1]Granted, I read through their docs, and I never saw any reference to a &quot;reviewer&quot;.

Or in other words, all land housing the people you may see every day). Let me know if you think I&#x27;ve got the two sides nailed down correctly.<p>The urban mindset to developing a metropolitan region:<p>* Cars are a luxury (and often a nuisance) and should not be required for essential, everyday travel.<p>* The region expands both outwards (by adding high speed transit to surrounding neighborhoods), and upwards (replacing existing development with higher density development)<p>* Key transportation infrastructure: public transit (bus, tram, train, subway), in addition to feet and bikes<p>* (some amount of) Density is a key pattern: Having enough people per square mile to bring workers and customers, sustaining local businesses, as well as maintainable a taxable base large enough to pay for transit and other infrastructure<p>* Multi use zoning is king: local storefronts and restaurants are considered beneficial for quality of life. Sufficiently dense streets thrive off the mixture of people and business.<p>* &quot;porous&quot; neighborhoods (e.g. grid street layout) are a pattern: porous neighborhoods are more efficient on a mile-per-mile basis, helping to enable low-speed travel (read: foot &amp; bike). This increases the amount of business-capable space within a neighborhood, which is beneficial to the local economy and quality of life of residents<p>* Suburban mindset seen as harmful: suburban mindset seeks to expand outwards. This adds people who consume local infrastructure (e.g. driving on local roads, creating noise and pollution) but who might not live in city jurisdiction (i.e. can&#x27;t be taxes in a straightforward manner), and aren&#x27;t interested in contributing to the well-being of the city. Suburban mindset seeks to limit legal expansion of density, mandate parking minimums, cut urban spending for necessary infrastructure like transit, reduce quality of life by widening roads, building highways, and increasing speed limits, and continue an outward suburban expansion that will just accentuate existing problems with traffic and with car noises<p>The suburban mindset to developing a metropolitan region:<p>* Cars are <i>the<\/i> key mode of travel for the vast majority of destinations, and as such are a necessity<p>* The region expands outwards by purchasing and developing surrounding farmland, and connecting this land to the city with high speed roads. This keeps land absurdly cheap.<p>* Key transportation infrastructure: roads (with sufficiently high speeds and capacity), parking lots<p>* Density is a key antipattern: More people per square mile brings congestion and noise, consume available parking, but offer little communal benefits as residents generally don&#x27;t need to work or shop locally (no need to sustain local businesses)<p>* Single use zoning is king: businesses want to locate on large roads with lots of traffic, people want to locate on small subdivisions with little traffic. Zoning enforces this to maintain everybody&#x27;s quality of life.<p>* &quot;porous&quot; neighborhoods are an antipattern: stores are not on local streets, so any porous neighborhoods mostly bring in through-traffic (which gives noise and pollution but no economic benefit). Thus a tiered freeway&#x2F;highway&#x2F;boulevard -&gt; neighborhood -&gt; subdivision pattern to residential space, in place of a city grid<p>* Mandatory parking minimums useful, as parking is a valuable public good<p>* Urban mindset seen as harmful: urban mindset seeks to build higher density housing in centralized places that already have bad traffic during rush hour, which will just make it worse. Urban mindset seeks to make more use of urban space with less parking, which offers a worse quality of life to suburbanites who wish to drive into the city. Urban mindset seeks to limit legal restrictions on density, which threatens to see multifamilies or apartment buildings in quiet neighborhoods that currently have low traffic and low noise (but won&#x27;t when population density goes up). Urban mindset looks to spend on public transit, which is not useful at all to all the many people who live in the suburbs (but suburbanites may face state taxes or consumption taxes to fund transit, as well as increases in traffic due to construction)"],"time":["2020-08-31 21:36:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["postingawayonhn"],"id":[24331804],"kids":[24331848],"parent":[24331698],"text":["Now compare Manhattan."],"time":["2020-08-31 16:31:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mc32"],"id":[24331800],"kids":[24331867,24331936],"parent":[24331698],"text":["Ok?

In Newtonian physics lots of common quantities are represented by vectors: position, momentum, force, the magnetic potential, etc.  Other important quantities are represented by scalars: time, energy, power, the electric potential, etc.<p>One of the deep insights of special relativity is that these scalar and vector quantities are actually <i>unified<\/i> into a single, new entity called a &quot;four-vector&quot;.  Each four-vector has three spatial components and one temporal component.  So in the two lists I wrote above, each scalar quantity gets paired with the corresponding vector quantity: time &amp; position; energy &amp; momentum; power &amp; force; the electric &amp; magnetic potentials.  In Newtonian physics a rotation in three-dimensional space will transform one component of your position vector into another (say, some of your x-component becomes a bit of y-component).  In special relativity observers moving at different velocities are related by a similar kind of transformation of their four-vectors --- a bit of the time component mixes with the spatial component and vice versa.<p>But what happens if you do this with velocity?  Velocity is a vector.  It&#x27;s corresponding temporal quantity is a bit weird: change in time per change in time.  But it&#x27;s a little more subtle than that, because it&#x27;s actually the change in <i>coordinate<\/i> time per change in <i>proper<\/i> time.  Basically this is the ratio between how fast you observe a clock tick in an observer&#x27;s reference frame relative to how fast they see it tick within that reference frame.<p>But the really weird thing about this particular four-vector is that it <i>always<\/i> has a magnitude of exactly the speed of light.  No matter how fast you go, the magnitude of your four-velocity does not actually get larger.  All you do by going faster is just mix some of the time component of your four-velocity into the spatial components.  (This is why the clocks of moving observers tick more slowly.)  And when you slow down, you just mix some of the spatial components into the temporal component.  And when you&#x27;re at rest the spatial components are all at zero, so the only component of your four-velocity is in the temporal direction.  So at rest your four-velocity points directly in the future with a magnitude equal to the speed of light.

When you’re driving a car you usually follow traffic rules and stop lights to get to your destination safely. In an airplane there’s constant communication and things change frequently based on weather, traffic, emergencies, etc. I can’t count the number of times ATC has repeated back an incorrect call sign. As a human we know it was probably meant for us and call back to confirm. Would a computer do that? Even if we used datalink communications then ATC would now have a much higher burden. Also human pilots would lose the situational awareness of hearing instructions for other aircraft on frequency.<p>Then there’s the question of— in an emergency situation is the computer going to be able to make the right judgement calls?

The fact that those imports are black boxes and can do literally anything used to make my noob mind overload. And I&#x27;d develop a blind spot for them. Before I could read code that exploited numpy&#x27;s power, I had to work with numpy for a while to gain an intuition for it. New people don&#x27;t have that. This isn&#x27;t just towards numpy, but for all libraries in tutorials. If it&#x27;s at all possible (I know it&#x27;s not always possible in a reasonable way), make a super simple example of what you&#x27;re going to use the library to do before you replace it with the library.<p>As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Sentdex is actually really good at teaching new developers. I think this is because he often starts without numpy. For example in NNFS videos, he starts with just lists.

Fortunately, 99.9% of the time the error was caught by the physician or the nurse assigned to the patient. The one instance where it wasn&#x27;t caught was actually due to human error - nurse gave patient anti-hypertensive med instead of the ordered calcium channel blocker (Cardene vs Cardizem?).<p>On the worst occasion, one doctor I worked with struggled on a daily basis to input orders into the system. I think it would take 5-6 minutes just to input some basic orders. Someone ended up teaching him how to input the orders in free form text and the nurse(s) would just write up new orders based on that (eg, doctor would write a single order as &quot;cbc,cmp,ua r&#x2F;o uti, drug screen, CXR 1v r&#x2F;o pneumonia&quot; and the assigned nurse would recreate the orders in the system in a line-item fashion). Kind of sucks for the nurse, but I think it ended up working out better for both parties.<p>I ended up dropping out of the doctor career path due to this unique and eye-opening experience as a scribe (not because of the EHR software itself but figured the &quot;doctor life&quot; was not meant for me)."],"time":["2020-09-01 03:58:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jld"],"id":[24336407],"kids":[24337214,24341886],"parent":[24336039],"text":["It&#x27;s like asking &quot;Why do pilots hate airplane food?&quot;<p>It has nothing to do with why pilots are&#x2F;aren&#x27;t epicures, and a more to do with their bosses deciding to serve them crappy food."],"time":["2020-09-01 00:10:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cknight"],"id":[24337837],"kids":{},"parent":[24336039],"text":["That medical software is simply bad is also my experience, having been an IT Manager for a clinic management company for a few years now.<p>In Australia at least, 85%+ of medical practices run one of two practice management systems.

This conversion ratio was set by the central bank and acted as a final brake on inflation. When the gold standard was abolished and the dollar and pound became free floating fiat currency, it only became worth something because the government says it is. The “I promise to pay the bearer x pounds&#x2F; dollars” is just a hangover from the gold standard days when you could redeem money for gold directly from the central bank rather than through a private gold dealer. Now you can only redeem an equivalent amount of fiat currency at the central bank if day your dollar &#x2F; pound note becomes damaged.<p>Banks can create deposits &#x2F; reserves at the central bank out of nothing, they just have to promise to pay the central bank back at a later date, plus an equivalent amount of interest equal to the central bank set interest rate. This is how the central bank regulates the interest rate in the economy. If a bank charges another bank a higher level of interest for lending than the central bank, that bank can just go to the central bank instead and get charged the lower central bank interest rate. This acts as a brake on maximum inter-bank interest rates and ultimately what interest rates are charged by end consumers. The same is true for cash deposits, the central bank acts a floor &#x2F; minimum interest rate for deposits as the central bank will pay interest at the central bank interest rate for deposits held at the central bank."],"time":["2020-08-31 13:31:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["athrun"],"id":[24329502],"kids":[24331538],"parent":[24326224],"text":["I found this paper from the Bank of England very enlightening when it comes to the actual mechanisms of money creation and their limits.<p>The paper is short and concise enough and the diagrams are very helpful to the uninitiated.<p>Money Creation in the Modern Economy: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankofengland.co.uk&#x2F;-&#x2F;media&#x2F;boe&#x2F;files&#x2F;quarterly-bulletin&#x2F;2014&#x2F;money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankofengland.co.uk&#x2F;-&#x2F;media&#x2F;boe&#x2F;files&#x2F;quarterly-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-31 10:34:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["riffraff"],"id":[24328855],"kids":[24329096,24332337,24329488,24332168,24329140],"parent":[24326224],"text":["&gt; Welcome to fractional reserve banking!<p>I don&#x27;t think that is fractional reserve banking.<p>FRB is the system where a bank is required to have a reserve of X% before it can issue money, while in the current system the banks first emits money and then (in the US) it attempts to get a reserve[0] for that (and in the EU, it doesn&#x27;t either, tho there are liquidity requirements).<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reserve_requirement\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reserve_requirement<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-31 07:54:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["H8crilA"],"id":[24329642],"kids":[24331405],"parent":[24326224],"text":["&gt; <i>For example, when you make a bank transfer to another bank, the bank can not simply send over money created by itself.<\/i><p>Uhh, yes it can.

A layer of emergence separates the two.<p>It&#x27;s true that what banks do is not <i>fundamentally<\/i> different to what full tilt poker did. Even the &quot;bank run&quot; parallels the many bank runs in history, and associated monetary collapse.<p>You can find other parallels too. My favourite is employees. Say you have no money. You hire 10 people clean pools, with salaries due at the end of the month. They work. You get paid. If you get paid enough, you can pay salaries on time and make profit.<p>This is the same principle as monetary stimulus, where a government makes loans to stimulate economic activity. We do call that money creation, but it&#x27;s not <i>fundamentally<\/i> different to what every employee does.<p>IRL, a poker site or pool cleaning business will (almost) always hit a point of reversal. Expansion becomes deflationary rather than inflationary. Further growth requires capital, rather than generating it. The business models that don&#x27;t do reach levels where their money creation starts to have macro-scale effects. These tend to join the financial sector (eg, the stock market), where they are regulated in some fashion to curb monetary inflations and deflations.<p>What makes banks qualitatively different is stability. They can do this long term, continuously increasing scale, without bank runs. Quantity is a quality of its own. If banks expand mortgage lending, real estate will inflate... either with higher prices or with more building. This isn&#x27;t money that was redirected from one sector to another. It&#x27;s new money.<p>This is why monetary policy isn&#x27;t just central banking. It&#x27;s regulators.

And, about the same % as speak English natively, speak Hindi (+ dialects) natively, and again about the same amount speak Arabic, and again about the same amount (all above 300 million) speak French, tho a greater % of those have le français as an nth language.<p>HN, and programming, shouldn&#x27;t get carried away with the myopic, &quot;fish in the fishbowel&quot; view of English primacy.
