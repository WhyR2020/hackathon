What Google does see is a hash-prefix of your username, to narrow down the encrypted data set of compromised credentials being returned to your Chrome instance.<p>Here’s what happens. Your instance of Chrome hashes your username and password and encrypts that value with an ephemeral key which doesn’t leave Chrome, <i>Kc<\/i><p>Google gets the encrypted cred-hash and applies a second round of encryption with a key only known to Google, <i>Kg<\/i>. They return the doubly-encrypted cred-hash, and also return 256 candidates encrypted with just <i>Kg<\/i> for you to compare against, those 256 candidates are selected based on a clear-text 3 byte prefix that Chrome also sends them.<p>When Chrome gets the results back, it decrypts the cred-hash using <i>Kc<\/i> which results in the cred-hash now being encrypted only with <i>Kg<\/i>; coincidentally this is the same exact key used to encrypt the candidates, allowing Chrome to do a simple byte-compare to see if there’s a match between your cred-hash and the encrypted breach candidates.<p>The cool part is the encryption operation is basically communicative. You can add your layer of encryption first, send the value to Google, they add their encryption and you get the double-encrypted blob back, and then you remove your encryption to end up with a plaintext encrypted just with Google’s key, even though Google never saw the plaintext, and you never saw their key.<p>This trick allows your browser, and only your browser, to compare your cred-hash against the breached cred-hashes while all the data you are comparing is actually encrypted with a secret key held by Google that never leaves Google’s server.<p>The only information leak is the 3-byte hash prefix to identify the slice of the comparison set.

The tool is supposed to be a Visual basic style drag and drop GUI builder for enterprise apps. the interesting part of the backstory is that this is my 7th attempt to build this!<p>So the back story is: I first thought about building a web based development tool since I was at University where I built a Hypercard style development tool called OpenPage (using C++ on Solaris) as my Computer Science project which scored as one of the highest projects of the year at Machester University, UK (1994). My beginners confidence didn&#x27;t carry on into anything concrete though, until 2000, when I wrote the second version in Java, but this didn&#x27;t go anywhere. For a third version I tried to develop this in Javascript, Ruby and Sintra in 2007, but I didn&#x27;t realise how difficult a problem this was. Also, in 2008 a fourth attempt was made where I tried again in Erlang, but it didn&#x27;t go anywhere. So I hung up my boots and then in 2013 after building a startup NemCV with Franco Soldera I tried a fifth time and built a Clojure&#x2F;Clojurescript based tool called Clojure on Coils, which was pretty cool, but most people thought it was a joke. Eventually after a couple of years I realised that I didn&#x27;t understand the problem well enough, so for attempt six decided to outsource the problem by investing in a project by Chris Granger and Rob Attori, called LightTable&#x2F;Eve. They tried to solve the problem of building a usable development system, but by 2018, they too realised that this was a huge task, and very hard to monetise.<p>So, I took a step back and realised that I now had a lot of knowledge about the subject, but needed to find a way to build something that can be commercially viable as an entry point, as this is a problem that 10,000s of companies have tackled and failed at (since the 1980s - just pick up a 1980s edition of Personal Computer to see many companies attempting the same thing). So I am now taking baby steps with a seventh attempt, by building a tool for enterprise users to build small webapps which can integrate with other systems, based on the look and feel of one of my favorite products of all time, Visual Basic 6. The product is called Pilot, and has a simple VB style editor, and allows you to build GUI apps, and microservices. It uses a simple component model based on 1 Javascript function per component, for both server side and front end components. It uses NodeJS, SQLite, and VueJS. It used to run as an Electron dekstop app but the I decided to dump Electron once I made Pilot container native so that it can run on Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Ubuntu Snap, as Electron would make the container runtimes too large. So the big focus now is to make alot of integrations so that people who work in large enterprises and just want to build a GUI really fast can build an app on top 3Scale, Mulesoft, Kong, Rest APIs, Postgres or other enterprise stuff.<p>There have been many people involved in this project and I give my thanks to them, since they have written alot of the code. Unfortunately I am the only person who is happy to put my name to the commits as I have a very forward thinking employer, Red Hat, although there have been major contributors from Google and Microsoft as well. Also, I must stress that this project and the views of myself and other team members in no way represents the views of our employers at Red Hat, Google, or Microsoft.<p>The project is still very rough around the edges, but please feel free to reach out to me for any questions that you may have."],"time":["2019-12-09 08:48:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dspillett"],"id":[21751279],"kids":{},"parent":[21734845],"text":["Imitating VB6 might be the wrong direction for a lot of people here.

Initially this fails: MIDI Off messages trigger notes in the same way as MIDI On messages. This is easily fixed by routing the MIDI through a DAW. (Why? No idea.) I play a standard Boogie riff, except slowed down to 100 BPM (because I can&#x27;t really play keys; I just have this controller for inputting notes). DrumBot analyses this (100% correctly) as a Chicago Blues turnaround and, apparently knowing that six and two is eight, immediately channels Casey Jones[3].<p>Dear fellow scholars: what a time to be alive! [4]<p>Btw. @notwaldorf: I just had a go at routing DrumBot&#x27;s output back into my DAW and obtained good results by dragging parts of my custom drum kit onto the MIDI notes that seemed most relevant. Then I changed the input and now DrumBot is hitting notes I haven&#x27;t mapped yet. I guess it&#x27;s using the standard GM drum map? Implementing that in its entirety would involve setting up over 40 separate instruments :&#x2F; But I&#x27;m not supposed to go quite that far, right?

The cause of the problem is due to the existing spec and implementation, where we will try to compare the two URLs by resolving the host IP addresses, instead of just doing a string comparison. Because hashCode has to maintain certain relationships with equals, namely if two objects are equal, they should have the same hashCode, the implementation of hashCode also tries to resolve the host in the URL into an IP address. As a result, we are facing problems with http virtual hosting, as described in the Description part, and performance hit due to DNS name resolutions.<p>&gt; Unfortunately, changing the behavior now would break  backward compatibility in a serious way, plus Java Security mechanism depends on it in some parts of the implementation. We can&#x27;t change it now.<p>&gt; However, to address URI parsing in general, we introduced a new class called URI in Merlin (jdk1.4). People are encouraged to use URI for parsing and URI comparison, and leave URL class for accessing the URI itself, getting at the protocol handler, interacting with the protocol etc. So, at present, we don&#x27;t plan on changing the URL.equals&#x2F;hashCode behavior and we will leave the bug open until Tiger, when we re-investigate our options."],"time":["2019-12-11 20:56:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["strictnein"],"id":[21766052],"kids":[21768099,21766461,21766148,21766150,21766901,21766132,21766135,21766129,21766394,21767936,21766127,21766404,21766140],"parent":[21765788],"text":[" &gt; &quot;Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be resolved into the same IP addresses&quot;<p>Uhmm... yikes.

Each section of code could then specify new &#x27;code hooks&#x27;, for future code to insert itself at during compilation.<p>My original inspiration was that English language is spoken sequentially, but ends up in a graph database (i.e. the brain&#x27;s neural network). So you&#x27;d write code like a thesis, and the hooks you specify would allow the splicer to form the code graph.<p>In theory it seemed like it would be useful, so I built Pacman with it and, well, it didn&#x27;t really work in practice! Things ended up being more abstract in the end, and I&#x27;d be mentally juggling where hooks were created and what the final code would look like. Even showing the code output to the right wasn&#x27;t that helpful, as the way the code was spliced together put things in not the most readable order.<p>Additionally how to split up the code wasn&#x27;t the most obvious, i.e. when should a hook be added? It often felt I&#x27;d only know after writing the code in full. At which point it just felt like extra work.

I defined a series of core extension points such as the request router and authentication and authorization providers. Modules provided extensions that connected to the core extension points, as well as define their own extension points that other modules could connect to. Dependency injection was used throughout so that implementations could be easily swapped (mostly used for the tests). It took quite a bit of time to develop this framework, but, as a result, everything was modularized, contained, and composed.<p>It was a complete nightmare to reason about and work with, even for me, and especially for newcomers. A natural way of trying to understand a system is to look at its entry point. With a system like this, it looks like a skeleton:<p><pre><code>    let di := DependencyContainer.make()\n    let moduleSystem := ModuleSystem.with_container(di)\n\n    di.register_singleton[IModuleSystem](moduleSystem)\n\n    moduleSystem.find_and_register_modules()\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhere do we go from here? The next logical step is into `find_and_register_modules` or into the documentation for the module system (just kidding: I was a &quot;senior engineer,&quot; I didn&#x27;t write docs).<p>We are left with a lot of questions. How does anything happen? It&#x27;s somewhere inside the modules, but which one? Does the order that modules are loaded matter? The answer is maybe. Clearly, there are places where order of operations matter. For example, the main navigation should be ordered. How do we accomplish that? (The answer for my system was to have the interface for navigation extensions specify there was a `readonly weight: Float64` attribute. But then to actually understand why things are in the order they&#x27;re in, and to get things ordered correctly, you need to look up the values for other navigation items. It&#x27;s secret coupling.)<p>More recently, I saw a team at my previous company build a system like this. There were dozens of interfaces and implementation classes and code for composing all of this, and the end result was you couldn&#x27;t just go somewhere and see what was happening. What we really want to see is:<p><pre><code>    match maybe_user\n        Some(&amp;user) =&gt; nav.add(UserProfileNavItem.for_user(user))\n        None =&gt; nav.add(&quot;Login&quot;, &quot;&#x2F;login&quot;)\n\n    nav.add(&quot;Browse&quot;, &quot;&#x2F;browse&quot;)\n    nav.add(&quot;Search&quot;, &quot;&#x2F;search&quot;)\n    nav.add(&quot;Help&quot;, &quot;&#x2F;help&quot;)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nDo you have to make a change here whenever something gets added? Yes. You do. But the idea that your program needs infinite flexibility in all areas is simply wrong. And, in fact, everything ends up secretly coupled and inscrutable.<p>For this reason, my advice has long been to limit extensibility to specific, narrow use cases (for example, filters in an image editing program). Do not build entire systems around extensibility. You are not building an abstract system, so don&#x27;t waste your time with unnecessary and obscuring abstractions."],"time":["2019-12-11 23:57:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crazypython"],"id":[21767245],"kids":[21767575,21767343],"parent":[21766557],"text":["This is just AOP."],"time":["2019-12-11 23:02:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bruth"],"id":[21767133],"kids":{},"parent":[21766557],"text":["Posted in 2013"],"time":["2019-12-11 22:49:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rahuldottech"],"id":[21760123],"kids":[21760540,21760630,21760308,21760338,21761915,21762022,21763460,21764269,21763576],"parent":[21760021],"text":["That&#x27;s a no from me.

The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth did have &quot;nomadic invasions&quot; even in the 17th century, but its main institutions were built on republican ideology, and more authoritarian&#x2F;centralist arguments at the time were based mainly on internal affairs, not external threats. On the other hand, which Early Modern countries had institutions aimed primarily at &quot;economic development&quot;? It&#x27;s probably debatable in the cases of the Netherlands and England.<p>Also they neglect to mention that many of these countries were not even independent for a long time. Modern populist Poland and Hungary, incidentally, both have had continuously own elites and statehood traditions since around 900-1000 AD (in contrast to some other Eastern European countries). But in Hungary in 16th-middle 19th century, Poland in the 19th century their own elites had to take the back seat or struggle with the foreign empires. So they weren&#x27;t the ones creating dominant institutions.<p>And these, I would say, were the real formative years. If we are to play &quot;find historical roots&quot;, the current Polish government (and probably the Hungarian one) is the direct descendant of romantic nationalist tendencies of the 19th century.

Thus Russia imposed strict restrictions on the mobility of peasants from the late 16th century onward, precisely because the availability of rich new farmland on the expanding frontier would otherwise have increased their bargaining power against landlords. (The frontier expansion itself was probably the result of the growing effectiveness of firearms, which turned the military balance against the steppe nomads; so gunpowder, which contributed to the rise of the bourgeoisie in the West, created serfdom in the East).

Poland was under relative peace in the 16th century when it gained wealth ( according to some statistics, Polish Kingdom was the biggest importer of luxurious cloths at that time, and as we know today if basic needs are satisfied people turn into consumption). Then in the 17th century Poland was attacked by Swedes, Germans, Russians which started the dawn of the country which ended in the end of the 18th century by splitting Poland between Russia, Germany and Austro-Hungary. Then when Poland re-gained independency in the 20th century it stared building an army, economy was raising, then WWII happened during which Poland was completely destroyed and until today it did not receive any compensation from Germany, obviously after WWII Communist Russia ruled in Poland which didn&#x27;t help the economy.

They include the following:<p>1. Angle of Attack (AoA) comparison – an addition to MCAS that will now compare readings from both angle of attack sensors on the aircraft. If there is a difference of more than 5.5 degrees the speed trim system will be disabled. Also included in this change is something known as a “midvalue select” which uses data from both sensors together to create a third input that will help to filter out any AOA signal oscillatory failures or spurious sensor failures. This modification will prevent MCAS from commanding nose down trim when a single AoA sensor reports a false AoA as it happened in the two accident flights.<p>2. MCAS resynchronization – this change will account for manual electric trim inputs made by the pilot while MCAS is activating. It will track whatever input the pilot makes and return the pitch trim to that setting when MCAS retrims back to normal.<p>3. Stab trim command limit – is an addition that will limit the maximum nose down trim that the\nautomatic flight control system can command to prevent the pitch trim from reaching an\nuncontrollable situation.<p>4. FCC monitors – software monitors have been added to the flight control computers that will\ncross check pitch trim commands against each other. If a difference is detected by these\nmonitors the automatic trim functions are disabled. This protection helps prevent erroneous\ntrim commands from a myriad of causes that could occur in the automatic flight control system.<p>These design changes in the software that controls the automatic pitch trim features including MCAS\nshould prevent angle of attack sensor failures from causing the pitch trim to operate when it should not.\nFurther, they should prevent the trim from activating erroneously for other reasons as well.<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transportation.house.gov&#x2F;download&#x2F;kiefer-testimony\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transportation.house.gov&#x2F;download&#x2F;kiefer-testimony<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-11 20:44:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jdsully"],"id":[21764855],"kids":[21766094],"parent":[21762007],"text":["Its pretty clear reading the article that the public now has a much higher safety standard than the FAA did internally.<p>Flying has become so safe that the public no longer considers it risky, but the FAA never updated its targets.

I call this my gradient theory.<p>Consider human learning as an optimization in the mathematical sense. Note that humans are good at learning things along a gradient. Now note that this is not just about how the learning works but also how far we go. For example, if a human thinks it is too cold, they turn the knob not where they want the temperature to be but much farther up, and then when the desired temperature is reached, they turn it back. Or consider how you find a page in a book. You overshoot and then go back. Or how you choose the speed when driving. You go as fast as you feel comfortable, and you find that by overshooting and correcting.<p>I think this is inherent in humans. Evolution made us this way.<p>The downside is that humans are bad in environments where there is no clear limit or where you can&#x27;t correct after overshooting, for example driving too fast and then having an accident, or substance abuse.<p>Now take this thought and apply it to programming.<p>If you find me a way to work with complexity, for example modularization, abstracting it away, etc., it will not lead to us writing a good version of the software we had before. It will lead us to writing larger software that will then again be at the limit of what we can do with the technology available.<p>So far it is just a theory, but I can see in my software selection that all the programs that I consider good and simple in the sense that this manifesto describes, all of those are old programs that were written when the functionality they offer was the limit of what was achievable with technology back then. The reason they did not metastasize into something unwieldly is that a) they did but it was still comparatively small or b) they already contain all the features anyone could think of.<p>Try comparing two programs of your choice that do essentially the same. You will find that if there is an old and a new one, the newer one will be bigger and slower and usually work in less environments and have less features.<p>It also turns out that no two people have the same idea of what &quot;simple&quot; means.

To get the best privacy you often have to sacrifice some security, and vice versa. An example would be allowing Windows Defender to automatically submit data and files to Microsoft. This increases security but decreases privacy. Another example is how Google requires you to submit a non-VoIP phone number during Google account creation. Obviously, this decreases privacy, but it also prevents spammers from flooding the comments section of YouTube videos with links to sites hosting malware (this used to be a huge problem). Of course there are many controls that increase both privacy and security together. But the relationship is complex, and I think the only way to write a clear book for specialists with actionable guidelines is to place either security or privacy as the priority, not both.<p>Also, at first glance I am not sure if the book is meant to help administrators and businesspeople design services that are secure and protect end-user privacy, or if it is meant to help end-users themselves protect their privacy&#x2F;security, or both [Edit: 1]. In the Introduction: &quot;This reference architecture is created to improve security and privacy designs in general.&quot; Chapter on security principles seems aimed at the admins too. But there is a whole chapter on OSS Privacy Applications that seems target end-users and show them how they can protect their privacy. I am left wondering: &quot;Is this book for me? Maybe. Idk.&quot; Maybe I skimmed too quickly, but it really seems like it&#x27;s trying to address too many audiences at once.<p>Maybe the authors can comment on why they made these design decisions.<p>[1] Edit: add to that developers, with the chapter on secure coding guidelines."],"time":["2019-12-11 19:59:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["a_band"],"id":[21765215],"kids":{},"parent":[21764713],"text":["This looks like an amazing resource.

First, it appeals to the idea that we should give Puerto Rico a pass because it’s poor. But <i>Puerto Rico is not poor.<\/i> Its GDP per capita is above Italy, and right below Spain and New Zealand.[1] It’s not a third world country where you can say there is a humanitarian basis why they shouldn’t have to pay back money they borrowed.<p>The other point in the article is simply that these funds are not the original debt holders. But what difference does that make? If your neighbor owes you $100,000, and refuses to pay, I might buy the debt at $50,000 in return for the hassle of collecting it. Is there something wrong with that? Should the debt be forgiven merely because of that?<p>The article overlooks that legal rules alter primary behavior. People alter their decisions about lending based on what might happen, legally, if the investment goes sideways. The original lenders, who put up money that allows Puerto Rico to pay for various things, did so within a legal regime where it knew Puerto Rico couldn’t declare bankruptcy. They might not have lent the money at all otherwise. Moreover, in general lenders make lending decisions knowing that they can sell bad debt to collection firms or third parties. Eliminating the legal rights of those third parties alters the lending decisions of the primary actors going forward.<p>[1] I’d go so far as to say that it’s doubtful the author would appeal to Puerto Rico’s poverty if this was a debt owed by Italy, because the reader wouldn’t be as sympathetic.

Didn&#x27;t they tell us that the Earth rang like a bell after the big Indonesian and Japanese earthquakes (where &quot;they&quot; are scientists being interpreted by journalists). All that dissipated energy can impact other faults. This seemed like a popularization of the recent science behind it.<p>Edited to add: there is also the speculation that the massive volcanism of the Deccan Traps in India were triggered by the Chicxulub impact event, because they were antipodal and roughly the same time.

It starts off sounding like popularizing established science, but then makes some claims without giving sources, even informal. For example, the graphic with the &quot;+ pattern&quot; says it is based on analysis, but doesn&#x27;t say whose. Is it from a scientific article, some other article or the author&#x27;s own speculation, any would be fine if it were explained. There is a &quot;Methods&quot; section at the end, but it isn&#x27;t clear from that either: &quot; The Sumatra data was limited to M5.5+ earthquakes, and was collected worldwide.&quot; There&#x27;s a reason your English teacher told you not to use the passive voice!<p>In general I found the graphics and animations to be clear and informative, and the multi-media aspect well done. But there were some annoying distractions: first, the vertically scrolling text sometimes covered the key part of the graphic, like I scrolled past the right location without knowing where it was. There needs to be &quot;sticky&quot; places where the scrolling stops to present the next piece of information.<p>More critically, when the dots representing the CA quakes are moved from the map to the timeline, they loose their size. Since the whole point is to count significant quakes over time, this is a net loss of understanding and source of confusion. The fact that the one key 5.5 quake later has to be highlighted (and I almost missed it in the scrolling), shows how important it would be to keep the size. And here the argument is weak because the 5.5 quake was nearby and the next day, so not really different from an aftershock--it&#x27;s like the change of graphic is used to hide the weakness of the argument."],"time":["2019-12-11 22:12:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fit2rule"],"id":[21764246],"kids":[21764721],"parent":[21756679],"text":["I was in Oakland, I was in LA.

A young physics student starts a revolutionary new marketplace immune to State coercion; he ends up ordering hits on people because they might threaten his great experiment, and is jailed for life without parole. Fully automated contractual systems are proposed to make business and the law work better; the contracts people actually write are unregulated penny stock offerings whose fine print literally states that you are buying nothing of any value. The biggest crowdfunding in history attracts $150 million on the promise that it will embody the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code; upon release it is immediately hacked, and $50 million is stolen.

David Gerard covers the origins and history of Bitcoin to the present day, the other cryptocurrencies it spawned including Ethereum, the ICO craze and the 2017 crypto bubble, and the attempts to apply blockchains and smart contracts to business.

Rather than focus on details of cryptography and code that describe how a cryptocurrency or a blockchain works, the book discusses the phenomena that have emerged as part of the rise of Bitcoin and blockchain.

It’s unintentionally funny most of the time and explains things in a dry humor that I really enjoyed.<p>&gt;However, it sometimes reads too negative and is too bitcoin and smart contract coins specific, therefore ignoring other aspects of cryptocurrencies which often have a real use case. For example, it doesn’t talk at all about privacy coins (Monero &#x2F; ZCash), Storage Coins (STORJ &#x2F; Siacoin &#x2F; Filecoin), social communities with rewards (STEEM), RIPPLE, etc. That being said, I agree with the sentiment that for most of the projects nowadays the blockchain isn’t even needed, and would arguably work better in a centralized way.

Because of its\nlarge number of processors, high computational\nthroughput (100 million instructions&#x2F;sec), large\ncumulative high speed memory (16 megabytes), high\ninterprocessor communications bandwidth, and\nexternal communications and sensing channels, ZMOB\nopens some new areas of exploration in object-oriented modeling,\nknowledge-based and domain\nexpert systems, intelligent sensing and robotics,\nand distributed perceptual and cognitive modeling.\nThe paper attempts to blend a description of\nZMOB&#x27;s hardware with ideas about where and how it\nfits into various types of AI research.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retrocomputing.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;5080&#x2F;fastest-cp-m-z80-based-computer-ever-built\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retrocomputing.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;5080&#x2F;fast...<\/a><p>&gt;The fastest Z80 computer ever designed and built was almost certainly ZMOB, a 256 node Z80A cluster designed and built at University of Maryland as part of NASA NSG-7253.

It can also be useful when you want to look things up by a prefix of an individual column: filter to a given day or month using a timestamp index, or filter to errors reported from client version 3.2.x. As a “covering index” it can somewhat help with queries that limit to foo=x and do something with bar (filter on it, return it, sum it, etc.). Finally, it helps with multiple scenarios for aggregation, not only searching: a timestamp index can let you get a count of orders by day, hour, or second without needing to make another temporary table&#x2F;index.<p>Often the crucial thing for keeping a DB humming is not getting the last couple percent out of already-fast operations but making sure you don’t have any disastrous queries, so an index being versatile for many kinds of search is especially valuable.<p>Related to that last point, databases are trying to prepare for queries that haven’t even been written yet, while when you’re coding some algorithm that involves a hashtable, you already know exactly what lookup you’re going to do a few lines later.

It sucks because through my co-founder, we had serious reach through social platforms such as Instagram, but we also knew the initial business model couldn&#x27;t scale so we had to pivot.<p>* Deep inside I knew our code would be a hard sell and I see the bigger picture now. Thank you all for zapping me out of it. I do think that cross-platform WebRTC integration has some value, but as some of you point out, my knowledge is probably more valuable than the code it self. I will reach out to all of you who have pinged me. I might be up to join as a contractor for some time, to help out with knowledge transfer &#x2F; maintain the code.<p>* Since my co-founder will still work within the same market, I can&#x27;t open-source the code without causing friction I&#x27;d say. So might not do that.<p>* I consider my co-founder a really close friend so it is of high importance for me to keep our friendship intact.

The company buying it had overpromised to their customers and were contractually bound to deliver, so purchasing my whacky half-finished source code was cheaper for them than paying the penalty for not delivering on time. As part of the deal, we were also hired for a month to integrate their CI into the app and ship it. After they dodged legal responsibility this way, I believe they never used the source code again, but instead hired a team to rewrite everything from scratch. So they paid us purely for the time savings.<p>2. The software being sold had been featured on national TV together with a major Hollywood movie studio praising it.
