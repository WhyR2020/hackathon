Other than Eagleworks and a group in China, they were early leaders on verifying the concept.<p>The law of conservation of momentum was created before quantum mechanics was discovered. Let&#x27;s assume there&#x27;s a base medium in which all energy (that is, mass) is embedded.  Furthermore, let&#x27;s assume there&#x27;s a way to interface with this medium. The EmDrive works if one allows mass (that is, energy) to be transferred into this base medium. Momentum is conserved because the mass&#x2F;energy is transferred to the all-encompassing medium. This medium is the same medium which enables quantum entanglement.<p>In theory, the quantum vacuum and surrounding phenomena provides that medium. Frankly, I feel the classical interpretation of CoM is insufficient to explain the workings of the EmDrive. The article uses the phrase &quot;a physics violation,&quot; but a more accurate statement is &quot;a high-school level physics violation.&quot;<p>How big of a deal is the EmDrive? It&#x27;s an EM-wave-to-thrust device. Take a moment and consider the significance of such a device. Satellites could remain in space effectively forever, because solar panels continuously source the &quot;propellant&quot;. Build one strong enough to counter Earth&#x27;s gravity, and you get the hovercraft. As long as you have access to electricity, you can generate thrust.<p>The article also mentions Salvatore Pais and his patents.

You can read the full comment at the link below, but here&#x27;s the most important points:<p>&quot;Whether or not the named inventor was a crank, and whether or not the invention was equally frivolous, this was a patent prosecuted by a Navy attorney, vouched for by the Navy CTO, and pushed through under atypical circumstances, in a public forum.<p>What&#x27;s even more intriguing is that, if the Navy wanted, it could obtain the patent under a secrecy order that would keep it from the public&#x27;s eyes until it was declassified.<p>Knowing all this, now ask yourself why this impossible sounding patent issued in a public forum with high-level brass support under tax payer dollars.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19763445\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19763445<\/a><p>My gut tells me the EmDrive works.

In reality, a former tech reporter for the Atlanta Business Chronicle more accurately called Atlanta the Bangalore of the South since many larger tech groups will open offices here to try to reduce costs.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong with Atlanta, it is a great place to live from a standpoint of having a lower cost of living compared with what you can get for a salary, especially if you are able to work for a west coast company that pays well. There are also other cities with a similar dynamic.<p>My point is that there are many ways to find it, but be careful because you may be trading one set of problems for another."],"time":["2020-09-14 01:45:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["skmurphy"],"id":[24466416],"kids":{},"parent":[24459155],"text":["We have helped a number of teams form at the Bootstrapper Breakfast over the last fourteen years.

The biggest SaaS products aren&#x27;t that great, they just have a great way to get sales&#x2F;leads. The best consumer products, aren&#x27;t that great (or weren&#x27;t that great) - they just found an hack. 99.9% of startups thinks they need to make a great product and then raise VC and throw millions on FB and G ads -being highly unprofitable- (since PPC is a game for established deep-pocket companies with ridiculous CACs)<p>Literally just hacks:\nAirbnb, spamming Craiglist. Dropbox, referral incentive-based storage + a viral funny video for hackers. Stripe, they happened to be in an early YC batch. Facebook started with the most exclusive place in the world: Harvard. Hotmail: adding &quot;sent with hotmail&quot; at the end of the email. etc.<p>If you find a way to for ex. post on Facebook Groups at scale, then you should work a product backward from there since not all channels are suited for all products.

Making the product is h hard part and distribution is easy: if you inventhe the transistor, the customers will be there.<p>so yeah a sales cofounder will add nothing as he wont happen to know which temporary weird thing on the internet allows in a very specific way to get a ton of customers at a very cheap price (ideally free).

I have built and exited multiple startups together with a bunch of wonderful people over the years.<p>The problem you are describing is not unique in any way, shape or form. I coach dozens of startups every year and your problem is more common than you might think. When I first started, I was just like you. I had no one to turn to and I felt like I could get nowhere. Meetups and networking events were and still are a waste of time for the most part as you don?t really want to get into business with people you?ve only met for 2 hours and know very little about on a personal level. So where does that leave you?<p>1) <i><\/i>You don?t need a non-technical person<i><\/i>: Find a technical co-founder who has transitioned into management or have some sense of how to run a business and have said person be in charge of the duties that you don?t excel at. The reason I usually make this recommendation to people in your position is that most non-technical people tend to have a problem communicating with their technical counter-part because they don?t understand the technical challenges ahead the same way you do. It leads to resentment and hostility when communication breaks down. This is one of the most common reasons startups fail. Communication is key in team building.<p>2) <i><\/i>Keep working on your product and ignore all the fluff<i><\/i>: Put your head down and grind an MVP out before worrying about any of the other stuff. We can all pump out ideas by the hundreds, but execution is really what matters at the end of the day. Building an MVP most often does not require a co-founder. It just requires you to spend some of your free time building things. Do what you can for now (if you are serious about this) and stop worrying about ?expansion plans?, ?go to market strategies? and ?networks?.<p>2) <i><\/i>Get a couple of advisors that you can trust<i><\/i>: Ask those who have gone through this whole thing before and let them mentor you. A lot of times people connect via their advisors? networks and that usually ends up being a lot more successful of a partnership. This is because any person your advisor is going to suggest you partner up with in some capacity will have been screened&#x2F;filtered by said advisor. I connect people at least a dozen times a year that I think would be great fit for each other, and that ends up working a lot better than finding people via networking events. The key here is to find advisors that are honest and want what is in your best interest.<p>3) <i><\/i>Utilize capital properly<i><\/i>: If you have an MVP for an idea that is worth its salt, finding capital these days is extremely easy. In fact, it is so easy that people raise absurd amounts because capital is competing for deals. There is a lot more money out there than there are good companies to invest in. All you need is for your product to be in the hands of a couple hundred people. This validates <i><\/i>you<i><\/i> and shows that you are actually doing real work. Investors invest in people first; products and ideas are secondary for the most part. Take that money and hire for the things you are not good at. You don?t always need a co-founder. Sometimes a good employee can become your co-founder after the fact as they prove to you over time that they are trust-worthy, hardworking and capable.<p>4) <i><\/i>Create a communication channels<i><\/i>: Once you have an MVP ready, make sure that communication channels with your users are well established for continuous feedback. As an example, you can create a Discord group where your users can give you feedback and feature requests&#x2F;ideas. That becomes the mechanism for other like-minded people, that are already using your product, to reach out to you. It would be impossible for me to count the number of times people have reached out to me via one of those communication channels about one of my startups. When people are excited about what you are doing, they will seek you out rather than the other way around.<p>5) <i><\/i>COVID is actually a blessing not a curse<i><\/i>: There are now tens of thousands of people like you that are sitting at home waiting for their moment to shine. They are all motivated and willing to get to work. <i><\/i>You just need to have something to present to the world so that people can be excited<i><\/i>. Remember, you are asking for someone to go on a journey together with you. Excite people and have them chase you.<p>Finally, if you (or anyone else for that matter) wants to have a chat about their startup&#x2F;product, feel free to reach out to me.

Bloom&#x27;s studies were in US high schools in the early 1980s. Most ITS papers are on university students or interventions that are also supported with extra staff time and training. They&#x27;re often on different subjects, with different levels of support in the base class, differently motivated students, different home environments, different teaching styles, etc, but we expect the results between studies to be comparable. I doubt even modern US high schools are like US high schools of the 1970s and 1980s. The control group for Bloom&#x27;s studies no longer exists.<p>To give an extreme example of this problem - that control groups in education are not at all similar - when I was doing my PhD on AI in education, I was doing it at a university that gives &quot;supervisions&quot; (small group tutoring) to all its students. So if I were to have tried an &quot;effect size&quot; study on anything I built, my <i>control group<\/i> would have been equivalent to Bloom&#x27;s <i>intervention group<\/i> (in that they <i>did<\/i> receive small group tutoring) not his control group.<p>When I was doing my PhD, I had a little informal tea-time quip which was that the flip side of effect size analysis is everything control groups &quot;don&#x27;t do&quot; if they&#x27;re to be comparable. Bloom finds classroom morale has a 0.6 sigma effect, so should we take it that the base is that our studies should take place in classes with bad morale?

For example, an educational intervention that produced a reliable gain of .33 each year could, if applied to lower class schools, wipe out the typical achievement gap between lower and middle-class children in 3 years?no small accomplishment.

To take Aristotle?s view: We might have evolved to have natures directed toward cruelty. In such a counterfactual scenario, we would have moral grounds for cruelty, which runs counter to our deepest moral convictions. Any view which tries to ground moral truth in things that might have been different is going to face a similar problem. There will be some counterfactual scenario in which the putative ground of morality is absent or points us toward evil rather than the good.&quot;<p>What is cruelty? He&#x27;s just juxtaposing abstract &quot;cruelty&quot; with some unspecified hypothetical and assumes it is meaningful. Cruelty presumes opposition to nature, so it makes no sense to say that some act A, understood in the abstract, is cruel.<p>&quot;Different statues are made of different clay; on the container view in contrast, everything that does, or could, exist is a manifestation of the same Reality.&quot;<p>Prima facie, sounds like a vulgarization of God-as-Being, i.e., all things exist as potentially existing in relation to actually existing things, and actually existing things are like potential things in relation to the act of existence that causes them to be, which is God.<p>&quot;If we follow Aristotle in grounding moral truth in the goal-directed nature of human beings, then we fail to account for the necessity of moral truths.&quot;<p>The aim was never necessity but nature. The natural law is called thus for a reason. I don&#x27;t know what &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; is apart from the nature of a thing.<p>&quot;My proposal is that the inherently directed nature of Reality entails that it?s objectively good for Reality when it manifests as pleasure and objectively bad for Reality when it manifests as pain.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s elevating the world of plural substances to the level of a single substance and referring to it as Reality. But this does nothing to convert the natural moral law into the necessary moral law because you&#x27;ve just reduced the universe to one thing whose nature is such that such-and-such is good for it and such-and-such is not. To accomplish that kind of necessity, he would have to identity nature with necessity and that would require identifying what he called &quot;Reality&quot; with God. If Reality is God, then this is pantheism. But why this need to posit necessity?<p>&quot;Foundational theories of morality have been locked in a perennial tug of war between the supernaturalism of Plato and the naturalism of his opponents.&quot;<p>Has he explored Thomism? Forms exist only in things and the mind, but also in God. Thus, you have both access to moral truths by knowing the natures of things, but even with the destruction of those things, they continue to exist in God (even if we may not be able to know them). Also, it is bad for human beings to harm others at least because it harms the common good and thus their own good.

If you are serious about SE as a career, then within in 10 years, do one of the following:<p>1 - Start your own sofware development company. Do the startup thing.<p>2 - Start your own software consultancy business.<p>3 - Make an informed choice of a niche and become an expert.<p>Outside of the above, at most you can look forward to (in general) is either transitioning to management, or a continuation of what your are describing: a glorified blue-collar career. (White collar professionals with experience seeking employment do -not- suffer the same indignities that is the common experience of skilled workers in this field.)<p>Management is fine if that turns you on, but you will definitely not scratch your geek itches as a manager, so the question is: is wasting your intellectual abilities as a young person worth a &quot;payoff&quot; of ending up in a management role? I mean, if you&#x27;re going to end up in middle management, wouldn&#x27;t it be smarter to just cut the chase, get that MBA, and start your management career properly.

I can&#x27;t see your actual interviews, but I&#x27;m just guessing a little based on your example.<p>On the 3 second tweet time question, I think you&#x27;re just getting anxious at the thought that they might expect you to replicate thousands of engineer-months of work in a 20-min interview session. Nobody sane expects you to do that. If I was asking that question, I know nobody&#x27;s gonna build Twitter in 20 minutes - what I want to know is how you think about and attack the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked with anything Twitter-scale, but I might attack it like: How many followers are we talking about here? Okay, let&#x27;s just start with a simple, dumb system and build it up. Simplest thing I can think of is a basic CRUD application backed by a Relational DB. SQL joins to get the tweets from your followers. You&#x27;d have to make a new request and new query manually to load new tweets. You could auto-poll, but that&#x27;ll get real hard on the DB with even a modest number of users trying to refresh semi-rapidly. Maybe we can have a system where a single DB is still the source of truth, but there&#x27;s a parallel system to load new tweets faster for those watching. Could maybe use websockets or long-polling for web clients. Let&#x27;s build some separate servers for that websockets traffic. I&#x27;m pretty sure that as long as there isn&#x27;t that much overall traffic to any one watcher, we can handle a good number of connections on one server, so we don&#x27;t need a ton of them. Maybe creating a new tweet still adds it to the DB normally, but also triggers a background job, so the tweeter still sees fast response time. So we&#x27;ve got a background job going, and a bunch of realtime connection servers that are maintaining connections for specific users. We&#x27;ve gotta connect them somehow, send a message from the background worker to the realtime servers to send the tweet to connected clients that are following that user. Now let&#x27;s think about how that would work...<p>Basically, show that you can examine the problem and come up with a few possible solutions and think about the trade-offs of them. I want to hire the engineer who can do that for any problem set in front of them. It&#x27;s much harder to justify hiring the one who just has a blank stare for anything they don&#x27;t have experience with already.<p>And for the record, that question isn&#x27;t inherently bad IMO. But it would be a bad interviewer to just ask it and stare at the poor nervous candidate who has no idea what you want. A better interviewer would make it more clear what they&#x27;re looking for, and help them down the first few steps of what I just went through above until they get the idea. Ex: So let&#x27;s say Twitter 1.0 is a basic CRUD DB app. What might the DB schema look like? What&#x27;s going to happen in terms of DB queries when we try to render a timeline for a user? What&#x27;s going to happen if they all start hitting refresh every 10 seconds? If we want users to be able to see tweets faster than that, what might we do?"],"time":["2020-09-13 20:27:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["troughway"],"id":[24460572],"kids":{},"parent":[24460286],"text":["There is a lot to be said for the entirety of your question, but i&#x27;ll try to focus on this since it stood out to me (plus the interest of time):<p>&gt;System design rounds require me to solve problems that the top engineers in the world spend months on. One question I was asked was &quot;How do you make sure that a celebrity&#x27;s tweet reaches all of her followers in less than 3 seconds?&quot;. I had no idea, I have never handled that kinda scale. In fact most of my work experience is kinda vanilla and boring, so I generally have nothing much to draw on or much to talk about.<p>System Design rounds are going to be difficult. The idea isn&#x27;t to give a correct, complete answer. It&#x27;s to see how well you can reason about a hazy problem based on your current knowledge. Bram Cohen who wrote BitTorrent has this to say:<p>&quot;My suggestion for learning software architecture is to practice. Obviously you can&#x27;t practice it by doing hundreds of projects, because each one of them takes too long, but you can easily design a hundred architectures for problems which only exist on paper, and where you strive to just get the solution to work on paper. Start by modifying the requirements of a problem you&#x27;re working on. What if the amount of bandwidth or CPU was a hundredth what it currently is? What if it were a thousand times? A million? What if you had a thousand times as much data? A million? A billion? What if the users were untrusted and you had to either prevent them from damaging the system or have a means of fixing things when they did? It doesn&#x27;t matter if these scenarios are totally unrealistic, what matters is that they&#x27;re different and that when you try to find architectures for handling them you take the inputs just as seriously as if you were about to start writing a system with those requirements for work. Try to find as many different approaches as you can, and come up with scenarios in which the stranger ones would be better.&quot; [1]<p>Secondly, &quot;vanilla and boring&quot; is a moving target. That question up there would for the most part be vanilla to senior backend developers, a little more than trivia and a waste of time.<p>You cannot say &quot;I never handled that kinda scale&quot;. This is the wrong mindset to apply to any sort of problem solving. Start with what you know and get to the point where you have a list of knowns and unknowns. And for heavens sake, you have a massively powerful search engine. &quot;Writing scalable systems&quot; should be a query in your head right after you think &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to scale&quot;.<p>Talk about your vanilla and boring work. If you think it would make you feel better, focus on how it impacted the customers or whoever. It&#x27;s perfectly fine to work on non-world changing things.<p>Lastly:<p>&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this by saying this field has never been my passion, just a profession I like.<p>Probably a healthy mindset, considering the amount of people in this field who chose it as a means of escapism from the hardships of every day life and convinced themselves in the process of coping with trauma that it&#x27;s a passion. Passion isn&#x27;t a requirement for good work, but some time spent learning the tech and being analytical in thinking about problems goes a long way.<p>And to answer your Q, ideally you should only quit if you don&#x27;t like the day to day work and related reasons.

Would you want a person who is impressed by an applicant spitting a few buzzwords and frameworks? That applicant then lands the job, gets assigned to your team, and becomes the reason you apprehend going to work? They may have been burned by past &quot;bad&quot; hires and have decided to tighten it up. People holding a team back, undermining decisions, commiserating while never explicitly voicing their concerns. This is a problem that must be prevented from happening, or dealt with swiftly if it happens.<p>Yes, they&#x27;re not FAANGs but it&#x27;s precisely that!

There are a lot of different home situations, many different types of commutes, and then there is the specific software and hardware you use for communication and how you configure it.<p>For example, take something like presence.  The boss wants to know if you are working.   With software, there are ways to track that if it&#x27;s really necessary.  For a manager that doesn&#x27;t trust the employees, activity tracking software gives about the even more information than being there, because you can actually see screenshots.<p>That is what UpWork does.  It&#x27;s quite invasive, and most people would not tolerate it if they felt they had the choice, but I bring it up as an example of how the software configuration makes as much difference as the physical location. And in fact tens (hundreds?) of thousands of people on UpWork have tolerated it.  So it&#x27;s a real thing, even though it&#x27;s abhorrent.<p>The more sane way is having some way to see your reports&#x27; work output on a regular basis. And there is no reason that needs to be minute-to-minute or even day-to-day if there is a level of trust.<p>But presence is not just useful in a physical setting for monitoring employees.  It also allows for things like spontaneous communication or types of communication not possible or difficult on a computer screen.  Here I think again, the actual software available and the configuration can make a huge difference.<p>For example, if you truly feel that water-cooler meetings are critical, you can build that into your at-home software setup and just make it mandatory.  There are a lot of ways you could do that.  It could literally be chat rooms named &quot;water-cooler1&quot; and &quot;water-cooler2&quot; and then you put some piece of required information like an expense code in there so people have to enter.<p>Or there are various types of software with virtual spaces, such as top-down maps where you see the location of your co-workers and can even hear their conversations if your avatar is close by.  There are also 3d world&#x27;s, both with a screen interface and a virtual reality interface.<p>I think especially as VR and AR headsets get more comfortable and usable over the next few years, that is really going to be able to compete with physical presence. For example, they are starting to track eye movements.  That&#x27;s going to make it possible to actually communicate using your eyes in VR.<p>Point being that there is a big spectrum in types or level of presence that is about the type of software and hardware configuration (and culture&#x2F;rules) as much as it is about actual physical location."],"time":["2020-09-13 00:38:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rogerkirkness"],"id":[24452297],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["Weird proxy for &quot;normal&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-12 15:34:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pcbro141"],"id":[24452635],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["Question: What month do you think you&#x27;ll be back in the office, if you had to guess?"],"time":["2020-09-12 16:18:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scruffyherder"],"id":[24467437],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["You cant play cubicle chess if you don?t have any pawns."],"time":["2020-09-14 08:37:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dan_m2k"],"id":[24460699],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["Property portfolios = people paying your pension one day."],"time":["2020-09-13 15:27:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mhh__"],"id":[24455570],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["It&#x27;s the economy, stupid!<p>(Is the quiet part some are not saying out loud)"],"time":["2020-09-12 22:54:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Spooky23"],"id":[24456102],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["Easy.

I did this on purpose so I wouldn?t have to commute. Now I am spending high rent for a small space. My company keeps stating that we will have to return to the office in some unknown ?near future?, otherwise I would plan on going full WFH and relocating to a larger home somewhere cheaper and more rural. But I?m stuck.<p>I also miss my dedicated workspace, and I miss being able to separate work and home life easily by going no contact after 5PM without management thinking that means I am a bad employee.<p>But most of all, I miss being able to let my bosses &quot;micromanage&quot; me in a way that didn&#x27;t disrupt me. ?Office Politics? has changed at my company in a way that is taking up a lot more of my productive time than it used to, and I hate it.<p>Before the Great WFH of 2020, my boss would walk by my cubicle or speak to me in person regularly. Short conversations, didn&#x27;t ever bother me, and allowed me to focus on work. Made him feel busy and made him feel I was busy. Ultimately I was able to spend less time &quot;appearing busy&quot; and more on actually getting work done.<p>Since management at my company doesn&#x27;t know how to actually track real work output, they have always used proxies like &quot;how long does this person stay at the office?&quot;, &quot;Are they still in their cubicle when I am leaving?&quot;, &quot;When I walk by their cubicle do they have their IDE open doing &#x27;coding stuff&#x27;&quot; etc. etc.<p>I?ve always been decently performant at code production. So all I had to do was stay on my coding tasks for a few hours each day, have an IDE always open on at least one of my monitors and wait til exactly 5:01 PM every day before I left as that was when my boss went home. I ended up getting stuff done quick, got to avoid most meetings, and could screw around the rest of the day if I wanted. Personal projects, internet surfing, etc.<p>Great reviews from management. I would prefer an actual meritocratic standard based on actual work done, but that really has never been the case at any of the companies I have ever worked at so far in my career as a software engineer, so I?m used to it at this point.<p>But now that we are all WFH, they really don&#x27;t seem to know what to do. They don&#x27;t know how much work anyone is, or isn&#x27;t doing, instead daily standups have changed from 10 minute short succinct updates to ?how aggressively and for how long can you technobabble bullshit about your coding tasks you did yesterday? turning these stand ups into at least an hour or more, and now I have to also technobabble bullshit or management will think I?m slacking.<p>Even more so than before, they now seem to think pointless emails and multi-hour zoom meetings are the true marker of productivity. I hate this. I don&#x27;t want to have to spend hours per day making up bullshit technobabble emails and sitting in on multi-hour long zoom meetings talking about unrelated boring bullshit. I just want to be able to focus on getting my coding tasks done for the day. Some of the lowest performers on my team love it though, because they are great at meetings, scheduling meetings, and making themselves feel important with pointless technical presentations during these meetings. Not to mention we are expected to have our webcams on at all times during these meetings, so I can?t even ?pretend? to be present while I go make myself tea or something.<p>The barrier to entry for meetings has lowered. Before, scheduling a meeting in the office room down the hall and giving a presentation on why we all should add ?bureaucratic coding standard addition xyz? was both too scary and too much work. Now, its ?why not, management will think I am showing leadership skills!?.<p>Thanks guys, I love more poorly managed bureaucracy. Test driven development might be good if someone actually managed it and maintained standard during code reviews, but now everyone just creates shitty unit tests to meet the \n70% code coverage requirement we are told to meet because the literal lowest performer on my team scheduled multi hour meetings with management on why we should all follow tde and convinced them it was a good idea."],"time":["2020-09-13 00:37:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yourapostasy"],"id":[24453017],"kids":{},"parent":[24452280],"text":["1. Real estate interests are extremely wealthy and powerful in nearly all nations, and in every OECD nation. Commercial real estate especially so. Take a look at the wealthiest individuals in a nation, and a big chunk of them are connected to real estate. It is realistic instead of cynical to expect these interests to hammer for a return to <i>status quo ante<\/i>, regardless of the actual benefits to those who must follow such diktats.<p>2. In the US at least in my experience and from observing my clients&#x27; organizations, after two decades of relentless offshoring, for high-wage roles we&#x27;re nearly scraping the bottom third percentile of the talent barrel globally for available replacements for on-shore talent, without accreting significant technical, organizational, support, maintenance, goodwill, and other types of intangible debt that CxO&#x27;s increasingly recognize as burdensome friction to rapid innovation. Gains to be had offshoring are measured in inches and not yards now, with lots of attention-to-detail work to achieve it; the gains exist, but are just as hard to accomplish anywhere in the world, domestic or offshore. Just recently here on HN we were discussing management&#x2F;promotion engineering&#x2F;demotion, with a significant sidebar conversation on hybrid tech lead roles; there aren&#x27;t that many people wired for that kind of balanced hybrid, and throw that on top of the complexities we normally deal with, and it is no wonder it is hard to recruit no matter where you look in the world.<p>3. Lots of &quot;I need that separation&quot; reports are very familiar to those who have been doing remote work for a decade or more. It takes anywhere from a year to multiple years to work out accommodations and find your groove when remote working. Finding that separation is part of it. Some people never adjust to it, and that&#x27;s okay.<p>4. We have plausibly reached beyond the observer effect-type improvements in productivity [1] from the remote work change in habits, so this mass social experiment shows there is something substantive to remote work compared to traditional office work.<p>5. We have not yet reached critical mass on the time everyone has been working from home to internalize the effects of their new normal. Remote workers who have successfully made the switch have reported this takes between 6-18 months typically. This takes different forms in people. For some an intense loneliness sets in, others depression, others are happier, others find more energy. This is the Remote Work Great Filter.<p>6. We flipped the switch and paused a system that has taken literally <i>centuries<\/i> of refinement upon office work, and started a remote equivalent under emergency conditions from scratch in many instances with (from initial indications) no productivity hit, and some even claiming a small productivity increase. What kinds of productivity increases lie behind further remote work refinement?<p>7. A &quot;grey system&quot; of hybridized remote and on-prem office presence can unlock interesting benefits. As expensive as offices are, the pandemic response shows that they aren&#x27;t so unbearably expensive that companies would wholesale leap at the slightest opportunity to unload them. This might change with the depression barreling down upon us, but for now, there is the opportunity (and perhaps even requirement) to use long-term commercial lease agreements (or even more long-term capex real estate purchases) to double or triple the amount of space in company offices. A soft turn away from the open office plan.<p>8. As flawed as the response was in the US, a lesson I drew from it is the qualitative change in information infrastructure since only a couple decades ago enabled private entities everywhere (not just the US) to rapidly route around many kinds of damage in many, adaptive, different ways. Very rapid, Net-based, decentralized, decoupled decision-making like depicted in some futurist visions is already here in a proto-form.<p>A lot of the response depends upon organizational culture and individual psychosocial makeup.

Everyone[1] sitting at the tables in a public library is being productive. And almost all modern libraries have bookable meeting rooms as a <i>free<\/i> service!<p>[1] If your library is full of noisy people, find a different one. This mostly only happens to the one library per city nearest to the projects. I suggest a public library near a college; or, for that matter, a University library, if it?s public-access.<p>Yes, there?s also coffee shops, but those only solve work-life separation. Most coffee shops don?t offer bookable spaces for private meetings. I guess you could combine coffee shops with booths at restaurants, but that gets expensive quickly. Libraries are free! And, unlike the coffee shop where sitting there all day with your laptop will <i>annoy<\/i> the employees, being productive all day in a library is <i>the point<\/i>, and you have every right to ask the library employees to shush anyone <i>interfering<\/i> with your productivity, because productivity is what they want the library environment to foster.<p>??????<p>Who doesn&#x27;t think libraries are a valid substitute for offices?<p>? Sales people and call-center workers, obviously. Anyone who needs to make phone calls all day. But these people were never really suited to ordinary office space, either. They need sound-proofed rooms&#x2F;booths, really. You can build those anywhere ? podcasters and journalists are currently building these at home. You really do need a <i>separate<\/i> space for this, though, and that might not be tenable in a small bachelor apartment.

This role is dying, and most of the visible backlash is likely coming from here. It&#x27;s like the death throes of aristocracy when centralized government rises to replace it. Good riddance, I say.

Basically, you feed in a list of &quot;&lt;user id&gt;, &lt;book id&gt;, &lt;rating&gt;&quot; and the algorithm generates a feature vector for each book and each user. So the reason some book gets recommended is because... the dot product of that book&#x27;s vector with your vector was high. You can do this easily with off-the-shelf libraries, like Surprise[1] (I&#x27;m using that lib in my startup[2]).<p>At least this is what happens in matrix factorization methods. Recommendations from k-nearest neighbor methods can be explained more easily, but knn doesn&#x27;t scale as well.<p>This is a minor drawback of matrix factorization--people have been shown to trust recommendations more if they understand how the recommendations were generated. Twitter recently published a super interesting paper[3] about how they generate recommendations at scale, and as a bonus their method is explainable. They create a model that describes the communities in Twitter--groups of people who follow the same set of influencers. Users and items are represented by vectors, where each element of a vector describes to what degree a user&#x2F;item fits in a certain community. When generating recommendations, you can get the user&#x27;s top communities and then fetch items for those communities. If you generated a text description for each community, you could include that with each recommendation.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NicolasHug&#x2F;Surprise\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NicolasHug&#x2F;Surprise<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findka.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findka.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kdd.org&#x2F;kdd2020&#x2F;accepted-papers&#x2F;view&#x2F;simclusters-community-based-representations-for-heterogeneous-recommendatio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kdd.org&#x2F;kdd2020&#x2F;accepted-papers&#x2F;view&#x2F;simclusters...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-12 22:35:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["buovjaga"],"id":[24455495],"kids":{},"parent":[24454221],"text":["There is at least <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;Alamantus&#x2F;Readlebee\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;Alamantus&#x2F;Readlebee<\/a> &quot;An attempt at a viable alternative to Goodreads&quot;, in active development.<p>Blog post from yesterday: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robbie.antenesse.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;one-year-of-readlebee.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robbie.antenesse.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;one-year-of-readlebe...<\/a><p>Edit: oh, there is also Bookwyrm, as mentioned in this megalist: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.feneas.org&#x2F;feneas&#x2F;fediverse&#x2F;-&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;watchlist-for-activitypub-apps#reviewing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.feneas.org&#x2F;feneas&#x2F;fediverse&#x2F;-&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;watchlist-fo...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-12 22:44:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["giberson"],"id":[24455023],"kids":[24455169],"parent":[24454221],"text":["&gt; My idea for an 11-star experience 1 in finding new books is that Goodreads knows me even better than I know myself and constantly recommends the perfect book.<p>&gt; goodreads shows me five books that I don?t want to read.<p>I wonder if these two ideas are at odds with each other. Imagine for a moment that recommendation engines were solved problems, and definitely worked given the above statement. They know you better than you know yourself.  Would it?s recommendations likely only include books that you obviously wanted to read? Or would they include books you didn?t know you wanted or needed to read? I mean this in  terms of judging the books by their cover rather knowing about their existence. Isn?t it likely or even probable that the majority of books recommended would be based on the value they contribute to something deeper than the pure enjoyment purposes?<p>As an aside, I remember in a college literature class I took the instructor told us that it?s up to the reader to derive value or meaning from stories. This was a class that studied short stories of early American authors. Most of which were slice of life narratives that didn?t have any apparent meaning, or commentary from the authors themselves. The exercise was to study the characters, scenery and tone and try derive what might either lie beneath the words or story themselves. Whether the ideas we deduced from the stories were accurate (and in most cases probably were not) the value Of the process was of critical thinking about the stories that made us consider and express ideas and beliefs we normally don?t.<p>Back on topic, would a working recommendation engine likely suggest things that on the surface seemed either boring or blatantly unappealing that would provide tremendous value if we put work in to reading and studying?<p>That being said, is it possible that current recommendation engines are already working? Most are at least driven by reading behaviors of the masses, so it seems like it might be feasible that that Steven king book that is unappealing to you is something you should actually read.<p>(This is not including recommendations for books you have already read in different languages which seems like an obvious bug, but then again reading books you?ve already read in different languages might be an excellent way to become more fluent in a new language or gain a deeper understanding of translation of ideas between languages....)<p>So, maybe the tech isn?t something that needs to be fixed.
