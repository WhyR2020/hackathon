In my head I call this &quot;causal disconnection&quot; or similar phrases, but it&#x27;s not a good name.<p>The underlying idea here is that, when you are told &quot;X&quot;, it&#x27;s useful to think about the causal chain that resulted in you being told &quot;X&quot;. Is the truth of X a powerful force in that chain? Is it one of many competing forces? Or is it, perhaps, totally irrelevant? In some sense this is a Bayesian viewpoint on the question &quot;suppose somebody makes a claim -- how much should you update your probability that that claim is true?&quot;<p>Politics obviously abounds with this, but a good non-political example is pop-sci rumors. For instance, I often hear the claim that cicadas sleep for prime-numbered years because that minimizes the probability of overlapping&#x2F;conflicting&#x2F;getting-caught-by other species (explanations vary). Now, <i>without making much effort to evaluate the truth of this statement<\/i>, think about what causes people to make this claim. Well, clearly, it sounds very good, so it&#x27;ll spread quickly (as a meme). Now, what if the claim was false -- how much would that fact impede its spread? Probably not so much.<p>(Somewhat remarkably, this suggests a concrete reason to be wary of oft-repeated claims. The fact that a claim is often repeated suggests that it spreads quickly.

I’ve never met someone with his ability to take pain.”<p>This is a paraphrased quote from Musk’s biography, from a Tesla engineer who knew Musk personally when the company was on the verge of collapse. The ability to make hyper-rational decisions during hardship is one of the most important traits of a leader.<p>This advice got me through that period. I understood that everything had a cause and effect, so I decided to change. Reading made me more prepared for anything.

There was Feynman&#x27;s critique of rote memorization in Brazil[1], but ok, Brasil isn&#x27;t CaTech.  And Mexico high-school graduates having TIMSS scores similar to US high-school dropouts, but oh well, that&#x27;s Mexico.  And news media have a trope, like &quot;Harvard MBA students don&#x27;t know what causes Earth seasons&quot;, but that&#x27;s merely misunderstanding the nature of expertise -- if someone last studied a topic in middle school, then a middle-school-like understanding shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise.  Similarly for grad and undergrad, professors and grad school.  MIT and Harvard graduates being unable to light a bulb with a battery and wire[2], that seemed more bizarre.  But by the time I saw Eric Mazur&#x27;s (Harvard, intro physics) &quot;it became clear that in spite of high evaluations, and in spite of good performance, my students were not really learning very much&quot;[3], it didn&#x27;t come as a surprise.  Though it could still felt odd, for a time.  Talking with first-tier medical school graduate students, with no clue how big blood cells are, beyond &quot;really really small&quot;. Asking first-tier astronomy graduate students, &quot;a five-year old asks you &#x27;I&#x27;m told the Sun is a big hot ball [...] what color is the ball?&#x27;&quot;... and of the very few who didn&#x27;t get it wrong, half-ish learned it as &quot;common misconceptions in astronomy education&quot;, rather from their own, atypically extensive and successful education.  A follow-up of &quot;what color is sunlight?&quot; repeatedly produces these cute, not &quot;aha!&quot;, but &quot;uh oh&quot; moments... the &quot;that doesn&#x27;t make sense, does it...&quot; of two conflicting bits of unintegrated knowledge colliding for the first time.  I no longer find it even slightly odd when a physical sciences gradate student tells me the Sun doesn&#x27;t have a color, or is rainbow color.  A person&#x27;s understanding very rapidly becomes ramshackle as they move beyond their active research focus.  And education content is pervasively authored beyond that.  Far far beyond.  Chemistry education research describes chemistry education content using adjectives like &quot;incoherent&quot;.  To be fair, rote education in Brasil and elsewhere achieves... something, some societal value.  And ours does too, and more of it.  But now when I occasionally encounter someone who thinks of science education as working... it&#x27;s become an exercise of empathy and imagination to picture how that might be a plausible description of the world.<p>[1] From &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking[...]&quot; &quot;In regard to education in Brazil, I had a very interesting experience.&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v.cx&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;feynman-brazil-education\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v.cx&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;feynman-brazil-education<\/a>\n[2] &quot;Minds of Our Own&quot; clip <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ng5qzH39nyg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ng5qzH39nyg<\/a> full 1997 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learner.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;minds-of-our-own&#x2F;1-can-we-believe-our-eyes&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learner.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;minds-of-our-own&#x2F;1-can-we-bel...<\/a>\n[3] Eric Mazur&#x27;s &quot;Confessions[...]&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI&amp;t=920\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI&amp;t=920<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-07 01:51:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["badsavage"],"id":[23101266],"kids":{},"parent":[23092657],"text":["open-source software"],"time":["2020-05-07 11:43:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["olalonde"],"id":[23096803],"kids":[23096973],"parent":[23092657],"text":["That free market capitalism is a good system that works.

Sure you can reduce RDS spend, but you&#x27;ll have to spend a week to do it - so bust out the calculator or just sign the checks. No one will stop you from creating a single point of failure - but they&#x27;d happily charge for consulting fees to fix it. There is a conflict on interest - they profit from poor design.<p>In my opinion, the internet is missing a platform that encourages developers to build things in a reproducible way. Develop and host at home until you get your first customers, then move to a hosting provider down the line.

Getting a general purpouse internet connection that handles that kind of bandwidth to your heavily customized office is often just not really possible.  If you&#x27;re lucky your office is at least in the same metro area as a relevant datacenter.  If you&#x27;re really lucky you can maybe build a custom fiber or microwave link without prohibative cost.  But with those kinds of geographical limitations, you&#x27;re not so much relying on the general internet, so much as you&#x27;re expanding your LAN to include a specific datacenter &#x2F; zone of &quot;the cloud&quot; at that point.<p>2) Security.  These servers are often completely disconnected from the internet, on a completely separate network, to help isolate them and reducing data exfiltration when some idiot installs malware-laden warez, despite clear corporate policy threatening to fire you if you so much as even <i>think<\/i> about installing bootleg software.  Exceptions - where the servers <i>do<\/i> have internet access - are often recent, regrettable, and being reconsidered - because of, or perhaps despite, draconian whitelisting policies and other attempts at implementing defense in depth.<p>3) Customizability.  Gamedev means devkits with strict NDAs and physical security requirements, and a motley assortment of phone hardware, that you want accessible to your build servers for automatic unit&#x2F;integration testing.  Oddball OS&#x2F;driver&#x2F;hardware may also be useful for such testing.  Sure, if you can track down the right parties, you might be able to have your lawyers convince their lawyers to let you move said hardware into a datacenter, expand the IP whitelists, etc... but at that point all you&#x27;ve really done is made it harder to borrow a specific popular-but-discontinued phone model from the build farm for local debugging when it&#x27;s the only one reproducing a specific crash when you want to debug and lack proper remote debug tooling.<p>...there are some inroads on the phone farms (AWS Device Farm, Xamarin Test Cloud) but I&#x27;m unaware of farms varied desktop hardware or devkits.

Their whole pricing model is based on being able to over-provision compute and move workloads around within a datacenter. As much as people talk about failing hard drives and other components at scale, failure rates are still low enough that you could operate dozens of systems at full capacity for 3+ years with maybe a handful of legit hardware failures. To rent that same compute from any cloud provider would cost significantly more.

The one that comes back to me now is that the file sizes are HUGE, because resolution is very high, so bandwidth is a major concern. Editors and colorists need rapid feedback on their work, which demands beefy workstations connected directly with high bandwidth connections to the source files. Doing something like this over a long distance network (even if the storage was free) would be prohibitively expensive, and sometimes literally impossible.<p>So the write loads are basically the antithesis of what cloud optimized for: “random sequential reads of typical short length, big append only writes”. The big production houses (lucasarts famously) are also incredibly secretive about their source material, and like to use physical access as a proxy for digital access.<p>It leads to some seemingly strange (to me as a cloud SWE guy) decisions.

For people who think lock-in isn&#x27;t much of a problem remember your whole hiring strategy will be aligned to whatever cloud vendor you&#x27;re using (look at job description that already filter out based on AWS or GCP experience). Lock-in is so bad that for a business it is close to the rule of real-estate (location, location, location), only that it&#x27;s to the advantage of the cloud vendor not you as the customer.<p>[1] optimyze.cloud<p>[2] <i>&quot;I have just tried to pull the official EC2 price list via JSON API, and the JSON file is 1.3gb&quot;<\/i> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;halvarflake&#x2F;status&#x2F;1258161778770542594\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;halvarflake&#x2F;status&#x2F;1258161778770542594<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-07 11:36:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blackflame7000"],"id":[23098725],"kids":{},"parent":[23089999],"text":["If you have a lot of data but not a lot of users, it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive to pay monthly hosting and network egress fees when you can buy cheap hard drives, use ZFS, and whatever server protocol you desire."],"time":["2020-05-07 03:42:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mcv"],"id":[23101014],"kids":{},"parent":[23089999],"text":["I notice all the banks I&#x27;m working for are moving to the cloud.

(For this analogy, a gallon of water is a unit of work.) And the gallon of water weighs 8.34 lbs irregardless if it is sitting on my desk in a physical building, or on your desk, in the cloud. Same weight, same unit of work. same effort. For a brand new, greenfield application, the cloud is a no brainer. I agree 100%. But for legacy applications, and there are so, soooo many, the cloud is just some one else&#x27;s computer. Yes, the cloud is more scaleable, yes, the cloud is more manageable, and yes, you can control the cpu&#x2F;storage&#x2F;memory&#x2F;network in much finer amounts. But legacy applications are very complicated. They have long tails, interconnections to other applications that cannot immediately be migrated to the cloud. I have migrated clients off of the cloud, back to on premise or to (co-lo) local hosting, because without rewriting the legacy application, the cloud costs are simply too great.<p>The essence of IT is to apply technology to solve a business problem. Otherwise, why would the business spend the money? The IT solution might be crazy&#x2F;stupid&#x2F;complex but if it works, many business simply adopt it and move on. Now, move that crazy&#x2F;stupid&#x2F;complex process to the cloud and surprise, it is very, very expensive. So, yes, the cloud is better, but only for some things. And until legacy applications are rewritten on-premise will exist.<p>One final insight. The cloud costs more. It has been engineered to be so, both from a profitability standpoint(Amazon <i>is<\/i> a for profit company) but also because the cloud has decomposed the infrastructure of IT into functional subcomponents, each of which cost money. When I was younger, the challenge for IT was explaining to management, the ROI of new servers, expanded networking, additional technology. We never quite got it right and often had it completely wrong. That was because we lacked the ability to account for&#x2F;track and manage the actual costs of an on-premise operation. Accounting had one view, operations had another view and management had no idea really, why they were spending millions a year and could not get their business goals accomplished. The cloud changed all of that. You can do almost anything in the cloud, for a price. And I will humbly submit, that the cost of the cloud - minus the aforementioned profitability, is what on-premise organizations should have been spending all along. Anyone reading this and who has spent time in a legacy environment, knows that it is basically a futile exercise of keeping the plates spinning. On-premise failed because it could not get management to understand the value on in-house IT.<p>As I said, the costs are the same. A gallon of water weighs what it weighs regardless of location.

So, if I am using vi bindings for my main editor, I don&#x27;t have to switch to using  completely different editor bindings on remote systems.

While many editors do have &quot;vim modes&quot;, I have ultimately been unhapy with most of the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried (evil mode for emacs is ironically one of the best).<p>Finally, there is the configuration. Both emacs and vim are extremely customizable. While VimL is certainly not the greatest language, it is at least fairly familiar to programmers with experience with ALGOL-family languages. It&#x27;s also somewhat straightforward to write plugins for vim in other languages, such as python and lua. Emacs otoh, uses Emacs Lisp. And while I admire lisp, it is certainly very unfamiliar to many potential emacs users, and can often be much more verbose, especially for setting custom key bindings.<p>With all that said, there are things I miss about emacs. Probably the biggest is that several modes let me customize how auto-indentation worked.

It needs a modern UI. Emacs Lisp should be replaced with a modern language like JavaScript. Its display backend should be replaced with something modern like embedding a browser engine and rendering to HTML5. (I have literally seen this suggested on &#x2F;r&#x2F;emacs). At any rate it should be accessible via a browser in the cloud, because in the future everybody will develop in the cloud. If somehow the maintainers do all of these, then it would only serve to effectively transform Emacs into Visual Studio Code, and it would make a shitty clone of Visual Studio Code at that. So modern. There are parallels with the efforts, started in the late 90s, to make Linux into an inferior clone of Microsoft Windows to increase its popularity.<p>The problem is, much of what today&#x27;s twentysomething webdevs consider modern is mere fad. It is not objectively better (and is sometimes objectively worse) in terms of user affordance than what we had in the 90s. The current trends in UI design obscure distinctions which were bloody obvious in the days of bevelled gray buttons. Browser engines run like pigs, especially when compared with simple bit-mapped windows, and developing in the cloud hits a brick wall when your network connection goes down.<p>I want you to try something. Try to imagine Emacs not as an ancient editor in need of modernization, but as a programmers&#x27; tool <i>from the future<\/i>. It may be a grim future indeed, one in which programmers learned some harsh lessons -- that not all programming is webdev, and the dominance of webdev in the field today is likely to be short-lived; that CPU and RAM are cheap, but not free; that networks go down; that software the user can&#x27;t examine and completely control is software that is potentially hostile to the user; that the job of a program&#x27;s UI is to enable work and not to dazzle the user; and that programmers have a higher duty to expand their users&#x27; minds, making them capable of more than when they started, and not to simperingly cater to 1984&#x27;s notions of what an absolute beginner should experience. (The implications of the fact that Stallman learned many of these in the 70s and 80s is left as an exercise.)<p>But a program from far enough in the future is just as incomprehensible to today&#x27;s users (especially today&#x27;s generation-Z webdevs) as a program from the distant past, the difference being that the future program is likely to be much, much more advanced -- and today&#x27;s users can learn a lot by understanding it on its own terms as they try to unlock its secret power. So it is with Emacs -- an omni-tool designed to be shaped and sculpted by the user into just the thing for the task at hand <i>as the user works with it<\/i>. No kidding --hacking something together in Emacs Lisp is so easy, for many data munging tasks it compares favorably to <i>regular<\/i> Lisp. Such hacks may not be beautiful or elegant or even production-ready, but if they let you get a job done quickly, they&#x27;re valid. When you combine Lisp&#x27;s eldritch power with the ubiquitous buffer abstraction and all that enables, you have a juggernaut for information workflow optimization -- and by comparison, Visual Studio Code is explicitly designed <i>not<\/i> to be extensible in such an ad hoc fashion.<p>Try this in your editor: Emacs has a command M-. If you are working on some Emacs Lisp and you type M-. on a symbol with a function binding, Emacs will jump to the function definition, opening the file it&#x27;s compiled in if necessary. If you keep drilling down like this, eventually you will hit bedrock: the primitive functions of Emacs implemented in C. If you compiled your Emacs from source, and you say M-. on one of these, Emacs will <i>remember where its own source lives<\/i> and take you straight to the C file and line where the primitive is defined. This, my friends, is the quintessence of open source.<p>Plus, Emacs can talk to text terminals and bitmapped displays, and  almost everything works the same either way. When I finally get my VT330 working, I&#x27;m going to hook it up to my sweet-ass Ryzen box, fire up Emacs, and take advantage of all its modern -- nay, <i>futuristic<\/i> -- power from my 1980s terminal. Why? <i>Because I can.<\/i> More practically, this means Emacs can communicate with its user over very low bandwidth channels -- making it ideal for working with remotely, cloud or otherwise.<p>And all this in an editor, several instances of which can be supported by a cheapass SBC like the Raspberry Pi. It&#x27;s a bloody miracle of design, even as its hackishness is made manifest.<p>Emacs doesn&#x27;t <i>need<\/i> to be changed to suit the whim and caprice of today&#x27;s developers. Emacs is eternal, an emanation of the Tao; if it were to somehow disappear, somehow some way we would re-make it from scratch. It&#x27;s not without faults, it can be improved, but the ideas behind it are transcendent and unmoving, and should not be compromised in favor of webdev fads.

I blog and I want that information freely available, but I also need an income. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the fact that people on HN actively find ways around paywalls which I think people on HN tend to find surprising because I spend so much time criticizing the idea that &quot;You people want good writing and you want it all for free, so you basically expect writers to be slave labor for you.&quot;<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that this is not an easy problem to solve because in any business, some of the things you provide will be provided for free. For example, businesses that serve food have bathrooms available for free.<p>In busy downtown areas or areas with a lot of homelessness, you will see local establishments with signs saying the bathroom is for customers only and some even have security codes so you can&#x27;t just walk in off the street and head to the bathroom. But they don&#x27;t charge for use of the bathroom.<p>If you are a small shop, figuring out what to do for free and what to do for pay is a thorny issue because time is money and it&#x27;s easy to end up in a situation where you are de facto slave labor.<p>For some businesses on the internet, your members who are there because it is free can be part of the value you are bringing to the table and if you try to charge and you drive those people away, you may kill the business because now your paying customers have no reason to pay you. The membership base was part of your value position and you&#x27;ve just thrown the baby out with the bath water.<p>So before you go acting like businesses who give stuff away for free are somehow nefarious actors, stop and realize that successful businesses have to pursue models that are viable and those models have real world factors. This is not just something decision makers at companies can arbitrarily decide willy nilly. You need to be taking the landscape of your marketplace into account when trying to figure out what piece of your product is the piece you charge for or monetize and what piece is something you give away for free.<p>Historically, TV was free to viewers. You just needed to own a TV, but subscription channels came later. It got monetized with advertising and having a large audience helped you monetize it. That large audience was valuable to your advertisers, so giving it away for free to viewers was part of how you made your money.<p>So this model wasn&#x27;t born with the internet. It existed before the internet. And there are valid arguments to be made concerning things like &quot;If you aren&#x27;t paying for it, you are the product, not the customer&quot; and lots of different angles to look at such questions.<p>But at the end of the day, there is no free lunch. You somehow need to pay the bills. And sometimes the method that actually works effectively isn&#x27;t as straight forward as &quot;Well, just charge people for using the darn thing.&quot; Sometimes that doesn&#x27;t work at all and in other cases it may work, but will limit your growth. Sometimes giving part of it away for free is how you grow to the point of being able to make serious money."],"time":["2020-05-07 22:07:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tamaharbor"],"id":[23109225],"kids":{},"parent":[23104875],"text":["I ordered take-out from Longhorn Steakhouse last week, they threw in a feee dessert...

We probably won&#x27;t need it fully up and running for another week or two so hopefully bugs will be out by then.<p>For context, there are two ways of doing digital contact tracing.<p>A centralised system which tracks everyone all the time and runs a central algorithm for deciding whether someone is at risk on all that data. This is what China, South Korea, and Taiwan have done. Advantage: it seems to work. Disadvantage: government has a database of literally everyone&#x27;s movements. In SK they also use CCTV and other data, it&#x27;s a nightmarish panopticon.<p>&quot;Minimally disclosive&quot; contact tracing. This keeps as much data as possible on the device and only share some of it with other devices or central servers. Obviously, designing these protocols is a balancing act between privacy and functionality. Different groups have designed protocols that make different choices there.<p>The two main competing protocols are DP-3T, on which Google&#x2F;Apple have based their API and PEPP-PT &#x2F; ROBERT which some countries including the UK have been building their solution. Until very recently, Germany was also using PEPP-PT but they have switched to DP-3T.<p>Both protocols make trade-offs between the amount of information which leaks and the usefulness of the tool. That&#x27;s important. Installing an app based on either will strictly reduce your current privacy.<p>Both frameworks use pseudo-random rotating keys which are exchanged over Bluetooth.\nIn PEPP-PT a central server manages a rotating private key which is used to generate a set of time-gated ephemeral IDs for each device. Devices exchange and log these IDs.\nWhen a health authority determines that someone is infected, they issue them a key which allows them to upload all their logged IDs to the central server. (Optionally, they can just allow them to self report which NHSX seems to be doing) The server is able to determine who the infected person&#x27;s phone has logged a contact with and notify those people. A random sample of additional people also receive notification messages which their phones are able to discard as invalid decoy messages. Because relatively rich data goes to the server, real time data on interaction patterns of the infected is available and notification algorithms can be tested and tweaked. Since we don&#x27;t know exactly how Bluetooth propagation and covid infection map to each other, this may end up being an important step.<p>In DP-3T, the keys are generated on the devices and IDs are stored only on the devices. If a central server authorises you to do so (based on a confirmed diagnosed infection), you broadcast the IDs of all the devices you have been in proximity to. All devices regularly download a list of IDs and check the list for one of their own rotating ID numbers. If they match, the user is notified and is able to pre-emptively isolate.<p>The second approach reduces the consequences of a nefarious central operator but at the cost of sharing more information with more people (since everyone sees the list of possibly-infected IDs). In other words, even in privacy terms, this is not a perfect approach either. That information can be used to carry out re-identification attacks and reveal infected users if certain conditions are met.<p>From a privacy point of view, I think many people would prefer the latter (possibly allow malicious attacker, if they are able to do certain not-so-easy things to determine that they were infected) since most people in the UK will not consider that deeply private and secret information about themselves. Many of my friends who got it have posted about it on FB, twitter, etc. The former, which gives a state actor more information seems like a greater breach of privacy.<p>A final point which I think is super important: we don&#x27;t know if either of these minimally disclosive options work in practice. No-one has used them in the wild yet. If they both worked then we could say - DP-3T has fewer privacy implications, they both work, therefore it is strictly superior.<p>Since we don&#x27;t know whether they both work (or even if either one works), we are instead left with a balancing act between privacy and usefulness which is not an easy one.<p>Of course, if due to API support reasons, only the OEM supported protocol can be made to work then regardless of any theoretical arguments, that is the one that we will need to use. I suspect we will know by the end of the weekend if their implementation works in practice.<p>I would like to see statutory safeguards put in place for this data. If they really need it then I get that, but it is important that if we do not have the technical safeguard we have legal ones.<p>(Also, Google&#x2F;Apple had a difficult choice to make here because they operate everywhere.
