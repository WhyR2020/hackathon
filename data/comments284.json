This is an entity with a special position in the stock market which has the privilege of redeeming ETF units to obtain their underlying stocks, and well as parcelling up stocks and trade them for a unit of ETF.<p>See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;viewer?url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackrock.com&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;literature&#x2F;whitepaper&#x2F;viewpoint-etf-primary-trading-role-of-authorized-participants-march-2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;viewer?url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackrock.com...<\/a> for details<p>But essentially, ETF act like stocks, but there&#x27;s always a flexible amount of outstanding units (unlike stocks in companies, which usually have a fixed number of units outstanding). Investors buy&#x2F;sell ETFs between each other most times, and the AP doesn&#x27;t get involved (and thus units outstanding doesn&#x27;t change). But at some point, demand for ETF units grow to be bigger than the numbers available for sale (everyone is holding it and not selling, for example), and the price of each unit grows. At some point, it makes sense for the AP to buy up the set of underlying stocks, parcel it up and trade them for an ETF unit (from the ETF issuer - like vanguard), and sell it for an arbitraged profit. This then increases the number of units outstanding for the ETF, and thus, reduces demand, and stablizing the prices.<p>The opposite also happens - when there are too many sellers of an ETF, the AP will purchase the ETF and redeem the underlying stocks from the issuer, and sell those stocks for an arbitraged profit. So the end result is that the value of each individual ETF unit almost exactly match the value of the parcel of shares it represents (as the AP is financially incentivized to buy&#x2F;sell and arbitrage any profit out of this difference)."],"time":["2020-09-21 06:31:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RickJWagner"],"id":[24542238],"kids":{},"parent":[24539605],"text":["Old guy here.

Will you be getting the same amount of money? How would you live if that money wasn&#x27;t available?<p>But the more important thing is, do you want to have fun now? Do you want to go out, party, vacation, hit up the clubs? Or do you want to stay home, save money. Maybe buy computer gear and AR or whatever the new fads are as they come? Maybe you want to save and go on vacation 3-4 times a year. Or maybe you want to save completely, get to a $1&#x2F;$2&#x2F;$10&#x2F;$30M and then retire and do what you want to do. So when you answer that more clearly it helps to kinda figure out what you want to do.<p>Now if you want to have fun and enjoy your school career, I wouldn&#x27;t put any money in the market, I would just go spend it. The reason being is your career should pay well. Now are you good at it?<p>Are you going to go for a FAANG job or a regular job? Do you want to work for someone or start your own business?

YOu have to decide, do I want to swing for the fences or use a lazy portfolio. So if it&#x27;s the former you can buy stocks that are the next AAPL like TLSA, or the stock you think is the next TSLA. You can split it up in a few stocks if you think you can pick better than the average market. Alternatively, you can go with the lazy portfolio and just throw it into Index funds knowing in 20 years you will be golden, and since you are going to get a decent job you will be able to contribute each month and grow it and life a safe life. To do this, look up bogleheads lazy portfolio or canadian couch portfolio in Canada.<p>Now if you really want to live life, and say you wanted to spend $1000 on a party, you go and risk that and put it on options.

That involves a persistent investment of time for a lifetime (a never ending process of reading and learning), and I happen to enjoy it. I could never stand to pay someone else to earn mediocre returns on my money. It&#x27;s a beautiful time to be an investor, between zero-fee trades and easy access to a lot of excellent information and tools (in most cases now packaged with a common brokerage account).<p>My advice would be to do exactly what you&#x27;re doing in regards to index funds, since this is your first money going into the market. If this very richly valued market drops at some point, it&#x27;s going to sting, don&#x27;t let that dissuade you from the long-term course, which is: investing as a matter of routine over time, you&#x27;re in it for a lifetime, not a short-term flip; and during that lifetime, there will be many ups and downs. Always do your best to hold a long-term mentality about what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish.<p>Depending on your personality, your preferences for learning about investing and managing your own money (it&#x27;s incredibly boring to many people in my experience), you might consider setting aside a small slice of your investment money to invest into specific companies that you&#x27;re interested in (ideally sticking to higher-quality, well-known, longer track record companies, so as to improve your odds of avoiding the Nikolas out there). Use that stake as a self-interest booster to practice reading about a company, following their progress, read their financials, read their quarterly and annual reports, read some of their archived annual reports. Practice basic due diligence on an investment that you&#x27;re interested in (eg AMD, whatever it happens to be). Get used to the terminology, teach yourself to be able to digest financial information about companies rapidly, so that it&#x27;s second nature. Then with a better grasp, begin practicing comparing companies, which will help you build some baseline comparison capabilities (so you&#x27;ll be able to more rapidly grasp good or bad numbers from a company). Occasionally read business news, although don&#x27;t bother with the bulls &amp; bears type junk, the clickbait of the business &amp; financial news world; read about concepts and events (like mergers &amp; acquisitions, or stock issuances, IPOs, conflicts), to further educate yourself about how the markets work and get a feel for that world. This basic learning aspect doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time, an hour per week, kept up over time. The end result is extremely valuable: considerably improved financial literacy; it gives you a leg up, as the vast majority of populations even in affluent nations tend to have a weak understanding of financial markets and stocks.<p>I&#x27;m biased in my recommendations, I&#x27;m a modified value investor in terms of strategy. I look for what I perceive to be mistakes in price vs value in the market. If you have an interest in managing your own money over time, you&#x27;ll likely gradually learn to lean into what you&#x27;re good at.<p>I&#x27;d recommend a few introduction level books, from the perspective of my bias:<p>Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, by Roger Lowenstein. Not primarily to learn about Buffett, rather, to learn about the concept of value as it pertains to investing.<p>Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street, by John Brooks.<p>The Little Book That Still Beats the Market, by Joel Greenblatt.<p>Margin of Safety, by Seth Klarman. This book is excellent, however it has been out of print for some time. You may be able to find a copy of it somewhere though (there have often been PDFs of it floating around).<p>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, by Philip Fisher.<p>Peter Lynch has a few worthwhile books as well. Some of this will seem out of date, it&#x27;s not. The lessons are eternal.<p>A lot of people will jump to recommending The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, I absolutely do not recommend his books for anyone new to investing. They&#x27;re extremely dense, even for an average investor with years of experience.<p>I&#x27;d read this article by Warren Buffett from 1984 (The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www8.gsb.columbia.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;columbia-business&#x2F;superinvestors\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www8.gsb.columbia.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;columbia-business&#x2F;sup...<\/a><p>There is always a wave of people that come around during the heady days in markets, proclaiming that value investing doesn&#x27;t work, that markets are too efficient or the like. In the 1984 article (linked above) by Buffett, he references this as well, it was being argued to be an out-of-date approach just the same four decades ago; one might be inclined to question the authors of those arguments for what they&#x27;re revealing about their particular interests. That&#x27;s all bunk. I made a killing buying in March during the brief crash, by doing nothing more than specifically taking advantage of the sudden and considerable price vs value discounts that were made available (like Square trading for a mere three to four times sales; a belligerent discount vs their growth and potential), an inefficiency event in the market. It&#x27;s down to being able to stand apart from the emotional crowd and make your own determinations about value. The approach will always work, and it applies to everything we do economically throughout life, not just investing in stocks."],"time":["2020-09-21 17:18:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andreasmiller98"],"id":[24543188],"kids":{},"parent":[24539605],"text":["AlleAktien.de for high quality stock research and insights — its in German, however"],"time":["2020-09-21 15:33:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["JacKTrocinskI"],"id":[24540881],"kids":[24541728],"parent":[24539605],"text":["Open a Roth IRA, max out your yearly contributions and invest out of that.

It explains how to convert screenshot and video capture provided by DOSBox into web-oriented formats, with some welcome considerations about pixel aspect ratio.  This is a good basis!<p>&gt; but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore we use the -sample option that does not introduce any new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.<p>There are 2 ironic things:<p>* modern world drifts away from pixel-to-pixel rendering, and indeed the web page presenting the captures constrains it (img in a div in a main with max-width:42em. So, web viewing does introduce some smoothing<p>* the CRTs-based screens of the days were not that crisp! Especially the color ones, they had a &quot;shadow mask&quot;, a grid of RGB spots which had no reason to be aligned with the pixel locations (this is explained e.g. on &quot;How Analog Color TV Works: The Beginnings&quot; by &quot;Technology Connections&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dX649lnKAU0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dX649lnKAU0<\/a> or jump straight to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=576\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=576<\/a> for explanations and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=665\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dX649lnKAU0?t=665<\/a> for close-to-screen example )<p>&gt; The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5 which makes the output look stretched horizontally.<p>Because modern format and&#x2F;or modern displaying program tend to assume square pixels, which originals were not.  Same issue on Amiga (pixel aspect ratio was even different on North-American Amigas and European Amigas) and many others, until VGA then LCD with digital links became established.  Consider older CGA&#x2F;EGA PCs. You mechanically can&#x27;t fit 640x350 640x400 640x480 640x512 pixels on the same 4:3 area and still get square pixels in all cases.  Some machines had border, which somehow can help, but in a number of cases, e.g. the Amstrad CPC, users didn&#x27;t notice much but the pixels were still not squares!<p>&gt; The old CRT computer monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the images to an aspect ratio of 4:3.<p>The intention is right. Some people don&#x27;t even notice extremely wrong aspect ratio, the author and I do.<p>Still, I agree the PNGs of this article are good as &quot;pristine capture format&quot;.<p>The job that the author does to restore aspect ratio is based on repeating the lines and columns.

Nothing in it was new to me or anyone here, but most people don&#x27;t hear&#x2F;see these things.<p>Most people in this movie were early employees, before we knew how bad it could get. Back then, social media was connecting people in new ways. Facebook in the early days was fucking magical. It had the potential to change the world for good. And then... it didn&#x27;t. For example, the inventor of the Like button talked about how the goal was to spread love and appreciation. I believe him that he didn&#x27;t for-see it would someday cause a rise in suicides among young women. How could anyone? And that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re speaking up now.<p>I agree with the criticisms. Lack of diversity, culpable people trying to save grace, Netflix making money off it and not being mentioned, etc.<p>But it&#x27;s not for you or me. It&#x27;s the most succinct, visual description of what&#x27;s happening right now, made for the average person, on a streaming platform people respect.

The height of irony in The Social Dilemma was the shot where LinkedIn and Google (separately from YouTube, which is fair game IMO) were listed among these evil addictive technologies and somehow Netflix, a pioneer of autoplay and binge watching, didn&#x27;t make the cut.<p>That aside, the insidious thing about this movie is that many of the issues in brings up are real. There are real problems with social media addiction, ad tech, and filter bubbles. Changes do need to be made. Some might even need to be forced onto the big tech companies. However, these problems are not the root of all evil, as The Social Dilemma would have us believe.<p>They are certainly not the primary cause of societal upheaval we&#x27;ve been seeing. Political polarization in the US has been rising since the 90s, well before social media became dominant. Racism and police violence have never really gone away. Blaming tech for everything both makes it harder to fix the real problems with tech and easier to ignore the problems that exist elsewhere in society.<p>Off the top of my head, some things that deserve just as much blame for the problems this movie pins on technology:<p>1. The death of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FCC_fairness_doctrine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FCC_fairness_doctrine<\/a>)<p>People can see distorted views of the world without the help of social media. One can argue that even now, Fox News and other mainstream media have a greater role in shaping public opinion than social media does. Not to mention the conglomerization of local news (driven by capital rather than tech) and the nationalization of media (enabled by tech, but driven by the MSM).<p>2. The slow death of the middle class, in the US and elsewhere.<p>An underlying assumption of The Social Dilemma and its line of argument is that people are dumb and easily manipulated. I suspect the educated elite, well-represented in the movie and over-represented here on HN, are particularly succeptible to this kind of thinking, myself included. But I think the reality is that most people care about their livelihoods more than anything else, and the polarization and upheaval we&#x27;ve been seeing (from Brexit to Trump) can largely be attributed to different reactions to this erosion of the middle class. The left might attribute it to unregulated capitalism and a failing social safety net. The right might attribute it to globalization, immigration, etc. The underlying phenomenon is the same, and has very little to do with tech, unless you&#x27;re talking about factories and shipping costs.<p>3. Some problems have always been around - social media just makes everything more visible.<p>The last century saw two world wars, plenty of revolutions and armed conflict outside of that (which seems like a gross understatement, but there are too many to list), the death of the British Empire and the rise of many new nations, lots of social upheaval in the US... the list goes on. There&#x27;s plenty to say about the 21st century as well, but looking back on history, I don&#x27;t know if things have really gotten that much worse.<p>To put it differently, many on HN (myself included) love to tinker with tooling - editors, note-taking apps, what have you. But at the end of the day, we have to get back to the real work, and use those tools to accomplish meaningful things. If you look at social media and Internet technologies as tools for society, then yes, it&#x27;s valuable to scrutinize them and see how they can be improved. But at the end of the day, we also need to get out into society and get to work, with whatever tools we have at hand."],"time":["2020-09-21 00:56:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["holtkam2"],"id":[24538956],"kids":{},"parent":[24536929],"text":["This should be required viewing for all high school students."],"time":["2020-09-21 03:37:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24538117],"kids":{},"parent":[24536929],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-21 00:54:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["cm2012"],"id":[24538468],"kids":{},"parent":[24536929],"text":["Documentaries are the worst way to put forth a legitimate argument (in this case, the argument is that social media is bad).

My ears were ringing throughout the whole call. This is unacceptable. Well-engineered mute buttons on keyboards shouldn’t need to go to software, they should immediately send a signal to the motherboard’s DAC—ideally on a separate wire or connection—to say terminate this signal. Then it’s less of a concern if it takes the OS a few seconds to react to the change, because our ears have been spared.<\/i><p>&quot;Should not need to go to software?&quot;  I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I have a Yamaha AV receiver on my desk. The huge volume knob has the best user experience than any software-based solution, unlike menus or hotkeys, it&#x27;s always in my reach and instantaneously responses to my inputs. It has smooth mechanical damping, giving a satisfying touch and feel. I can immediately turn the volume down in a second if there&#x27;s misbehaving, non-normalized loud audio. I did it from time to time.<p>On the other hand, I clearly know it&#x27;s software-driven. The knob is nothing but an user interface. It&#x27;s an optical rotary encoder, not a real potentiometer. When the knob is turned, it chops a beam of light, and an optical sensor converts the optical pulse to a digital signal, which is then sent to a GPIO pin on the application processor in the AV receiver. The firmware on the application processor receives an IRQ, then commands the DAC via the system bus (could be I2C) to increase or decrease the volume in a 0.5 dB step. It&#x27;s 100% software driven, not hardware driven. The software can fail, yet the software never let me down.<p>We can get another conclusion from this: Special-purpose computing is more reliable than general-purpose computing. The operating system handles everything, and has numerous failure modes due to its unpredictability. Furthermore, it&#x27;s in a constant state of change to bring the &quot;Next Great Things&quot;, who cares if the audio mixer or the TouchBar becomes a bit slow?

Like a lot of things on the USB-C MacBooks interactions like sound and power feel more like interfacing with a what people may call a &quot;device&quot; rather than a computer, there are tangible layers that have to handshake between your real world action and the hardware catching up sometimes seconds later.<p>(This is all the non-touchbar model, so it&#x27;s not just that)"],"time":["2020-09-20 22:06:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vidanay"],"id":[24535867],"kids":[24536827],"parent":[24535408],"text":["I have accomplished this by using an external audio mixer at my desk.

You shouldn&#x27;t get into the situation of wanting to quickly adjust audio levels in the first place (although I agree that any latency in adjusting the volume is inacceptable).<p>Normalization (especially the real-time case) is an interesting topic. I&#x27;ve experimented with crude algorithms in the past to take all audio samples in a fixed window and then normalize them all to the same level [0]. But it&#x27;s harder than you&#x27;d think. First there is a difference for humans in how loud they perceive the same sound to be at different frequencies. So any measurement function needs to take that into account. ReplayGain does this btw [1]. Then, there is the problem that if you make this window too short, you turn the audio into a garbled mess. If you make the window too long, you increase latency. This is a big deal for streaming settings. And last, you have the problem that silent periods aren&#x27;t silent. E.g. if the person takes a breath, the level is increased to amplify the muffled sounds of the road nearby to levels to make you think they stand in the middle of a highway :). It&#x27;s an interesting problem and while I doubt that it&#x27;ll be solvable by simple hardcoded algorithms, ML might solve it.

I like using plain old analog headsets since they make it easy to have control over the sidetone level from the headset mic, and they&#x27;re usable in many situations where a usb headset would not be.<p>To simplify using one headset with a few different devices (pc, desk phone, ipod&#x2F;phone), I wound up buying a little Behringer Xenyx 302USB bus-powered mixer. If you have a bunch of analog devices to mix, you&#x27;d want something larger, but for a PC with a headset and one or two other analog sources or outs (like a pair of desk speakers), these things are just about perfect. They use off the shelf TI PCM2902C converters, have excellent audio quality, work driver-free on Linux, OSX, and windows, and seem to last pretty well.<p>The real beauty of these little mixers (or the myriad other comparable ones) is that all the common adjustments I need to make- my own mic monitor level, the other party&#x27;s output level, and the overall headphone level, each have their own rotary fader on the mixer. There&#x27;s also some minimal eq available. The mixer is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t waste much desk space, and in the event of a surprise volume spike, the master volume fader is right by my hand, and I&#x27;ve saved myself from being blasted many times.<p>If you pair something like this together with an effects host (I use pulseeffects on Linux and love it), its easy to apply a compressor or limiter to the stream from the VC app that I use to reduce transients, or to add an expander to help on multi-party calls where one callers mic gain is too low.<p>The 302USBs have gotten a little tricky to find lately since they seem to be popular with new podcasters.

If I can’t start the next book until I finish this one, but I don’t want to read this one, I might as well go watch TV. Before you know it, you’ve stopped reading for a month and you’re asking “what have I done?!” <\/i><p>Yeah I&#x27;ve found that many people have a weird hangup about this.  I guess it&#x27;s because of how they learned to study in school.  You&#x27;re &quot;supposed to&quot; finish the book.<p>In my mind, the point of reading is learning&#x2F;retention&#x2F;permanent change, not &quot;completionism&quot; in finishing the book.  I just get a bunch of books from the library, and read the PARTS of the ones I feel like reading, that I feel have some relevance.  I get 5 books for every one I finish, and I don&#x27;t feel bad about it.<p>Often when I get to a &quot;bad part&quot; (and most books are filled with bad parts), I just read the first sentence of every paragraph, and nothing is lost.  Paradoxically, you may get more retention that way!  The bad parts have low information density.<p>But there has to be some retention, and I have a couple tactics for that:<p>- I take notes on every book I read.  Key point: it&#x27;s not a lot of notes.  It&#x27;s not page-by-page notes, and I don&#x27;t do it while I read.  It can be 4 sentences for some entire books.  If you can&#x27;t remember the notes you want to write after 24 hours, then the book might not be that good.<p>- I take notes in a wiki and use hyperlinks.  If what you read doesn&#x27;t cause you to think of some other book you read, or something someone said, then you probably didn&#x27;t learn anything.  Everything is related, and different authors say the same thing in different ways.

Everything has tradeoffs and I am making no absolute statements. Anyway, in no particular order:<p><pre><code>  - Performance. It&#x27;s possible for Java to be within 50-98% of the speed of even the most hand tuned native code, which is pretty remarkable considering the language comforts it provides.\n  - Backwards compatibility. I have code that&#x27;s 15 years old I still use. Programming hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed _that much_ in the past 20 years, but a lot of other languages act like it&#x27;s changing by the year or even month. I deeply value not spending time fixing breaking language changes or dependency problems (for the most part).\n  - OOP. I know we&#x27;re in the cycle now where &quot;OOP is a failure,&quot; but that&#x27;s just wrong. Just like it was wrong when &quot;OOP was the solution to everything.&quot; I don&#x27;t go crazy with it, rarely use inheritance, use interfaces only occasionally, but do find it&#x27;s nice to keep myself organized in terms of scope of code and responsibilities.\n  - Typing. I know it&#x27;s not perfect, but I really lean on the type system in Java. I think this might be because I&#x27;m a bit of a messy programmer to be honest, so this helps me keep a handle on things. When I work in Javascript I find things getting out of control quickly, whereas I can make statements about the entire codebase in Java that help me stay on track.\n  - Tools. I&#x27;ve been using Idea as an IDE for 15 years or so and it feels like an extension of my mind. I can&#x27;t even remember what the keyboard shortcuts are anymore, I just do them. It really helps keep the focus on the problem at hand rather than the details of implementation. We&#x27;re finally coming out of the &quot;IDEs are bad&quot; cycle so I see more people using them again, that&#x27;s good for everyone.\n  - Simplicity. One major thing that people have forgotten with Java is that you can write simple code with it. It feels like the number one complaint is over engineered &quot;AbstractFactoryImpl&quot; codebases, and I hate those too. But it&#x27;s also possible to write simple, easy to follow, understandable code.\n  - Exceptions. I used to hate these too, then I had to write some code that _really had to work and handle everything_ and suddenly they were pretty nice.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn terms of downsides:<p><pre><code>  - It&#x27;s pretty bad for scripting. A lot of that could be fixed with extensions to the standard library that provided easy helper methods. We shouldn&#x27;t be constructing URL objects for anything, just do it. I&#x27;m very jealous when I see a nice Python script for doing something with data from an API.\n  - It does tend to want a lot of memory. This isn&#x27;t as much of a problem anymore thanks to Moore&#x27;s law, etc.\n  - Library support for new services. People tend to write a Javascript, Ruby and Python library for everything, which is super nice. Java is not as common these days.\n  - Some other stuff I&#x27;m probably forgetting right now, I&#x27;ll update this if I think of anything else. As I said, nothing&#x27;s perfect.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd in a general note: Don&#x27;t underestimate the power of true expertise in a language. I find that in a lot of the cases when I&#x27;m reading about something new, it&#x27;s hard for any upside to overcome deep experience. In that way, the best language for anyone is probably the one they know best, so maybe I&#x27;m biased."],"time":["2020-09-20 21:18:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimbob45"],"id":[24540646],"kids":[24543435,24540993],"parent":[24534629],"text":["Everything Java does, C# does better.

The functional part of java is not really functional ( allows immutability). They just are trying to survive ,and are trying to add all kind of features to java, just to play catch up. I heard they are planning to add pattern matching in the latest version.\nThe guys who make some excuse, like kotlin or scala is hard, can really be compared to an older car mechanic saying tesla is BS because their knowledge will become obsolete if it takes off. If you really think a language is hard , you are not supposed to be in the programming business. Also these same guys just use java to program the web. Heck, java is fast but the cost of lost developer productivity in waiting for compilation cant be justified cant be justified for the saved 100 millisecond of processing time. What matters on the internet is the perceived speed and the page load time, and there are so many other ways to achieve that. Like simply upgrading to http2. Or preloading html , js and then “hydrating” the page. The entire source code of the forum dev.to is opensource and you can visit the website to see how fast it is. And its not written in java. This is just an example. Facebooks wasnt written&#x2F; hosted on the “enterprise” java. While java is fast and is suited for low latency data processing ( like trading system, or big data), I hate that even with the love it receives, 98% of the so-called java guys just use it for web programming. - Also scala beats java at the thing java does best- fast processing.

Cunningham&#x27;s Law touches on this [1].\nThe objections come in waves. In the earliest stage of a thread, they tend to be rapid negative reactions to the article. It&#x27;s not that these are a community consensus, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re the fastest reactions to feel, and the fastest comments to write—especially when the topic is provocative, when most of us are reacting from cache [2].<p>&gt; Then a second wave of objections is generated by the first wave. Readers come to the thread, see the comment section dominated by those initial &#x27;triggered&#x27; responses, and feel some version of surprised-shocked-dismayed at how the commenters all seem to be reacting in that way. This propels them to write defenses of the article, often carefully expressing more moderate or balanced views than the first wave—but they probably wouldn&#x27;t have been motivated to post anything if there hadn&#x27;t been the first wave of comments to object to!<p>&gt; These second-wave comments tend to get more upvotes, perhaps because more people tend to share the more moderate view, but also because those comments tend to be more reflective [2] and therefore better written.<p>&gt; This explains why the top comment in a thread so often begins (ironically) with &quot;Wow, I can&#x27;t believe the comments here&quot;—or from the current thread: &quot;All of these comments make me think HN has never interacted with a 5 year old&quot; [3]—followed by a defense of whatever those objections were objecting to.

Of course there is the fear that it will never be relevant. However, if you accept the thesis that the good idea is not valuable in itself, then you realise that it is not really valuable to pivot without a really good reason. A good idea that is never relevant is just as worthless as a bad idea that is never relevant.

It&#x27;s the result of a negative prediction error in the nucleus accumbens. You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure.<p>Subconsciously, then eventually, consciously, you wonder if it&#x27;s worth it. The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing small things that you know are going to work. As a biologist, I frequently put in 50-70 and sometimes 100 hour workweeks. The very nature of experimental science (lots of unkowns) means that failure happens. The nature of the culture means that grad students are &quot;groomed&quot; by sticking them on low-probability of success, high reward fishing expeditions (gotta get those nature, science papers) I used to burn out for months after accumulating many many hours of work on high-risk projects. I saw other grad students get it really bad, and burn out for years.<p>During my first postdoc, I dated a neuroscientist and reprogrammed my work habits. On the heels of the failure of a project where I have spent weeks building up for, I will quickly force myself to do routine molecular biology, or general lab tasks, or a repeat of an experiment that I have gotten to work in the past. These all have an immediate reward. Now I don&#x27;t burn out anymore, and find it easier to re-attempt very difficult things, with a clearer mindset.<p>For coders, I would posit that most burnout comes on the heels of failure that is not in the hands of the coder (management decisions, market realities, etc). My suggested remedy would be to reassociate work with success by doing routine things such as debugging or code testing that will restore the act of working with the little &quot;pops&quot; of endorphins.<p>That is not to say that having a healthy life schedule makes burnout less likely (I think it does; and one should have a healthy lifestyle for its own sake) but I don&#x27;t think it addresses the main issue.<\/i><p>link to comment: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5630618\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5630618<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-20 07:19:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dlkmp"],"id":[24532359],"kids":[24534713,24534589],"parent":[24531718],"text":["Oracle code base and test cycle description: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18442941\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18442941<\/a><p>I&#x27;ve referred to this comment a couple of times in discussions with people I&#x27;ve worked with.

You can think of them as adolescence, mid-life, and rebirth.<p>The first pivot happens when the company is 5-8 years old (since the 1970s at least; older before then), and serves to define the company. The System 360 for IBM, defining it as the provider of mainframes for enterprises. MS-DOS for Microsoft, defining it as the dominant PC OS. The Macintosh for Apple, defining it as the most user-friendly consumer brand out there. GMail and Maps for Google, defining it as the conglomerate of the Internet age. Mobile for Facebook, defining it as the service that connects people regardless of where they are.<p>The second pivot happens when the company is 10-15, at the height of its dominance, and usually results from it entering the hottest new technology wave with a vengeance. It looks like it succeeds for a while, crushes early entrants, serves to legitimize that technology wave, but ultimately peters out as the company can&#x27;t keep up with the changes that it introduces. The IBM PC for IBM, which legitimized the PC market but ultimately fell to clones. Internet Explorer for Microsoft, which legitimized the Internet but ultimately was eclipsed by Google&#x27;s many products. The Newton for Apple, which legitimized the PDA market but ultimately was too early. Google+ for Google, which legitimized social networking but ultimately failed to gain traction.<p>The third pivot is when the company realizes that they basically incapable of innovating, and returns to the roots they established with the first pivot to live out their old age. Open-source consulting for IBM, leveraging their massive installed base of enterprise customers. VS Code, XBox, and Azure for Microsoft, recognizing that they are fundamentally a platforms company. The iPhone and iPad for Apple, refocusing on their strengths in UX and delivering top-quality consumer electronics products. Alphabet for Google, realizing that they&#x27;re fundamentally a conglomerate that lets a thousand flowers bloom (and cancels 990 of them).<p>Libra is Facebook&#x27;s second pivot.

You just don&#x27;t understand a very fundamental concept of design. It even applies to engineering. It&#x27;s okay—many people have the same frustrations as you do.<p>But those who care about the details achieve truly high quality results overall. It extends to all areas of the design, not just to the parts you can&#x27;t see.<p>In the movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit,&quot; there&#x27;s a scene in a dark room where Roger Rabbit (an animated character) flies across the room, knocks a hanging lamp around, and the lighting becomes so dynamic that all the shadows move around including the animated character&#x27;s shadow. Here&#x27;s the scene in question: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_EUPwsD64GI\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_EUPwsD64GI<\/a><p>This was such a small detail that it would have been forgivable if the animators had left it out entirely: if they had not moved the lamp, kept the shadow steady, no one would have really noticed the difference. It would have been 100 times easier to animate and the effect wouldn&#x27;t really have been that different.<p>But they did it anyway. The term was later coined, and &quot;bump the lamp&quot; is used throughout Disney (and probably other organizations) to mean something akin to &quot;go the extra mile&quot;—but I see it as having a special significance to design.<p>You&#x27;re right, most people won&#x27;t notice. By that logic, you could cut corners a lot of other places too. You could be lax about button colors matching exactly, or per-pixel sharpness on the map and buttons. No one would probably notice.<p>But if you go for every detail like it was the most important detail, you have the possibility of reaching a level of design quality that is superlative, and some people will notice. Others will not notice directly, but will see that the piece exudes style and quality subconsciously, due to the attention to small details. If you carry this into other areas of your work—programming, customer service, market strategy, marketing, and more—then you have a chance to create something of true quality.<p>If you don&#x27;t pay attention to detail at that level, well, you might have the chance to actually get something done. Yes, it&#x27;s a balance, like everything else. But you have to know that it won&#x27;t be quite as good, and understand that yes, you are sacrificing something, even if you can&#x27;t see it.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-20 18:53:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chris_wot"],"id":[24534227],"kids":{},"parent":[24531718],"text":["Some guy asked cpercival if he had won the Putnam.

Oh, half of the code I&#x27;m about to write is implemented elsewhere - quick, figure out how to juggle the dependency graph to somehow route control from here to there and back. This data I want to convert is not of the right colour - oh, I need to pass it through three sets of conversion layers to get back essentially the same, but with a correct type tag on it. Etc.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s utterly and mind-numbingly boring, unless you architectured the whole codebase yourself, at which point it&#x27;s somewhat fun because it&#x27;s your codebase, and who doesn&#x27;t like their own Rube Goldberg machines?<p>&gt; At this point, I&#x27;ve learned a coping strategy: just forget the project scope and focus on your little plot of land. Doesn&#x27;t matter that the software I wrote half of is going to help people do exciting stuff with industrial robots. What matters is that the customer changed some small and irrelevant piece of requirements for the 5th time, and I now have to route some data from the front to the back, through the other half of the code, written by my co-worker (a fine coder, btw.). So a bunch of layers of code bureaucracy I&#x27;m not familiar with, and discovering which feels like learning how to fill tax forms in a foreign country. If I start thinking about the industrial robots I&#x27;ll just get depressed, so instead I focus on making the best jump through legacy code possible, so that I impress myself and my code reviewer (and hopefully make the 6th time I&#x27;m visiting this pit easier on everyone).<p>&gt; Maybe it&#x27;s a problem of perceptions. Like in the modern military - you join because you think you&#x27;ll get to fly a helicopter and shoot shoulder-mounted rockets for daily exercise. You get there and you realize it&#x27;s just hard physical work, a bit of mental abuse, and a lot of doing nothing useful in particular (at least until you advance high enough or quit). And so I started coding, dreaming I&#x27;ll be lording over pixels on the screens, animating machine golems, and helping rockets reach their desired orbits. Instead, I&#x27;m spending endless days pushing people to simplify the architecture, so that I can shove my data through four levels of indirection instead of six (and get the software to run 10x faster in the process), and all that to rearrange some data on the screen that really should&#x27;ve been just given away to people on an Excel sheet with a page of instructions attached."],"time":["2020-09-21 17:14:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Arjuna"],"id":[24538433],"kids":{},"parent":[24531718],"text":["Originally posted by OrdaGarb on April 26th, 2015...<p>I have a slight fascination with sweeteners. About five years ago I imported a kilo of &quot;Neotame&quot; sweetener from a chem factory in Shanghai. It was claimed to be 10,000-12,000 times sweeter than sugar. It&#x27;s a white powder and came in a metal can with a crimped lid and typically plain chemical labeling. Supposedly it is FDA-approved and a distant derivative of aspartame.<p>US customs held it for two weeks before sending it on to Colorado with no explanation. When received, the box was covered in &quot;inspected&quot; tape and they had put the canister in a clear plastic bag. The crimped lid looked like a rottweiler chewed it open and white powder was all over the inside of the bag. I unwisely opened this in my kitchen with no respirator as advised by the MSDS which I read after the fact (I am not a smart man).<p>Despite careful handling of the bag, it is so fine in composition that a small cloud of powder erupted in front of me and a hazy layer of the stuff settled over the kitchen. Eyes burning and some mild choking from inhaling the cloud, I instantly marveled at how unbelievably sweet the air tasted, and it was delicious. For several hours I could still taste it on my lips. The poor customs inspector will have had a lasting memory of that container I&#x27;m pretty sure.<p>Even after a thorough wipe-down, to this day I encounter items in my kitchen with visually imperceptible amounts of residue. After touching it and getting even microscopic quantities of the stuff on a utensil or cup, bowl, plate, whatever, it adds an intense element of sweetness to the food being prepared, sometimes to our delight. I still have more than 900g even after giving away multiple baggies to friends and family (with proper safety precautions).<p>We have been hooked on it since that first encounter. I keep a 100mL bottle of solution in the fridge which is used to fill smaller dropper bottles. I&#x27;ve prepared that 100mL bottle three times over five years, and that works out to about 12g of personal (somewhat heavy) usage for two people in that time. Probably nowhere near the LD50.<p>I carry a tiny 30mL dropper bottle of the solution for sweetening the nasty office coffee and anything else as appropriate. Four drops to a normal cup of coffee. We sweeten home-carbonated beverages, oatmeal, baked goods (it is heat stable), use it in marinades, and countless other applications.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe. The actual quantity used is so incredibly tiny that it seems irrelevant. I&#x27;d sweeten my coffee with polonium-210 if it could be done in Neotame-like quantities. Between this, a salt shaker loaded with MSG and a Darwin fish on my car, I&#x27;m doomed anyway.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9440566\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9440566<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 01:50:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wallflower"],"id":[24534051],"kids":{},"parent":[24531718],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=121413\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=121413<\/a><p>&gt; fiaz MANY days ago | parent | favorite | on: Ask News.YC: How to re-motivate yourself?<p>&gt; APOLOGIES for making this post so annoyingly long, but I really hope you find value in the words below.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nI&#x27;m going to first share a personal experience from my early trading days to illustrate where I&#x27;m coming from. I used to wake up at 4:30 am everyday in the Chicago suburbs to beat rush hour traffic and make it into downtown Chicago at 6:30 am. In order to wake up so early, I fell into a habit of sleeping at 9:00 pm and like a robot waking up at 4:30 am. This simple routine was indirectly helpful when things seemed darkest.<p>For the first six months, I lost money and was ridiculed constantly by other traders who were more successful than me (which was about 20 other guys CONSTANTLY using me as a punching&#x2F;whipping bag). The only thing that kept me going was the fact that some of the very same traders that would be making wise cracks at me for losing money were some of the most successful people I knew at the time. For better or worse, if I needed a trader to model myself after, it was the same people that were telling me how bad a trader I was - and although I was not open to really hear what they were saying, they were right about my skills in every way (but their feedback was always packaged in some sort of insult).\nAfter racking up some rather hefty losses, I was determined to quit at one point during month four, but because I had a habit of waking up at 4:30 am I simply &quot;forgot&quot; that the night before I told myself I would quit and spare myself further humiliation...by then I was warned that I was now on the red list of traders ready to be cut. Also, my personal savings were starting to approach zero (the base &quot;draw&quot; for house traders was enough to pay for food; you usually make your money on a percentage of your profits, and I was deep in the red at the time).<p>To say the least, there were many excellent reasons to be &quot;reasonable&quot;, forget about my dreams, and quit.\nAfter 4 consecutive &quot;failures to quit&quot;, I realized that I didn&#x27;t quit because somewhere deep down I was hanging on to a dream, however remote at that point: that I could somehow be as successful as the other traders that I knew. At the same time I realized that I had hit rock bottom in that I couldn&#x27;t even succeed in failing! Very tough times indeed...\nAn interesting point to note here is that although my losses were starting to get very large, the people who were funding me as a trader kept me because I had one redeeming quality: EFFORT, and this helped build tenacity. Other traders who barely traded but had a fraction of my losses were cut much faster because they didn&#x27;t put forth much effort. They were not willing to take losses and be bold&#x2F;brave and fight it out; I was willing to take risks, and this saved me from getting cut faster than others.<p>Slowly I began to reinterpret the constant humiliation I was suffering: perhaps the other traders were right about their &quot;jokes&quot; and there might be something in what they are saying that will help me get out of the red. I also realized that since I had failed at quitting (which was now the ULTIMATE failure), there was no further failure for me and that if I took baby steps they were surely to succeed (this translated into taking smaller trades&#x2F;profits).<p>Only after improving upon my abilities as a trader and channeling my energies appropriately did I succeed and earn everybody&#x27;s respect as a trader (and you have no idea how this made me feel!). I quickly made enough in commissions to be trading my own account, and be successful as an independent trader onward. When I look back at those final months of 1999 (yeah that&#x27;s right, I was losing huge cash at the end of 1999 when the entire market was going crazy UP!), there was more good than bad even when I was getting my ass handed to me. It&#x27;s just that I was intentionally creating my own feedback (I&#x27;m right everybody else is wrong) instead of seeing the results I was getting (losses&#x2F;insults) as feedback and information that would help me be successful.<p>I kind of snicker every time I see somebody ask for feedback on their startup on YC.News only to end up justifying themselves by telling everybody why they did what they did when they get negative feedback, which is the feedback of greatest value. If somebody tells you how crappy your idea is, thank them that they even spent a few brain cycles considering your idea.<p>The lessons I learned from this that are perhaps relevant to your questions:<p>- Determine if you believe in yourself to succeed as an individual (I know this sounds odd, but for a moment just examine your thought patterns and your actions and see what message you are sending to yourself; do you listen to the voice that says you can&#x27;t or are you paying attention to the feedback from your efforts and the results you are getting?)<p>- Search deep down inside and see if the project you are working on is something you believe in or not. If you can&#x27;t sell yourself, then you shouldn&#x27;t bother trying any further...<p>- ANY attention you get for your efforts is good attention. If you get LOTS of negative feedback, then be grateful - you&#x27;ve jumped the first hurdle of getting people to give a damn about what you are doing! :)<p>- There is responsibility and accountability that goes with both success and failure. You need to be ready for both because they can be equally painful in equal ways. The amount of accountability that comes with success can be more unbearable than the accountability that accompanies failure. I personally know of some very talented people who enjoyed phenomenal initial success only to find just as fast that they were in over their heads.<p>- The more you resist the possibility of failure then you are less likely to recognize possibilities that will help you succeed. If you are afraid to fail, then most certainly you are afraid to succeed. This sounds counterintuitive but it&#x27;s based upon the fact that fear makes your mind less supple and less responsive to the changes that will push you out of the game - or conversely it will lessen the impulse to jump on the opportunities you need to succeed.<p>- The results you get has everything to do with your users&#x2F;market and less to do with you as an individual; it&#x27;s sometimes hard to separate these two. See the other side of the equation and what side you are on before trying to solve it. Don&#x27;t ever think you are above the feedback of your users...EVER!<p>- Don&#x27;t have expectations (this is just setting yourself up for failure). Because you are starting out you may not know what is best to help you succeed - ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re lacking motivation. Keep in mind that whatever results you get from your efforts will lead to more possibilities (in the form of additional information).<p>- Have some behavioral &quot;context&quot; within which to exercise discipline and structure. Seek to grow your efforts within this context. My context was my sleep schedule. It was a routine that was so ingrained that my drive had a laser focus. This might not work for some, but it worked for me.\nFinally, I will add that in my opinion failing hard and fast is MUCH better than failing slowly. The faster you know for certain something isn&#x27;t going to work out, the sooner you can cut your losses and move on to your next idea. When you eventually succeed, you will look back at all the times you were quick to cut your losses and get to where you are...\n---------------------------------------------------------<p>Please do NOT contact me asking for advice in trading&#x2F;investing.

The problem is that application concerns are orthogonal to implementation concerns and the point of programming languages is to abstract the implementation concern away from the application programmer. The hardware engineers &#x2F; os engineers should focus on providing transparent access to system resources. Application concerns just don&#x27;t map onto resource consumption in my experience.<p>I found the articulation of mobility&#x2F;cloud rather odd. I thought it was going to be about lambda (AWS) and cloud runner (GCP) and other cloud serverless offers (???) which encapsulate a collection of functionality and abstract the concerns of providing a callable interface and resources to run the functionality. Instead it outlined a scheme for failover and fault tolerance, which seems to rely on centralised naming and a global OS. I can&#x27;t see that OO has much to do with serverless, and I can&#x27;t see that it is really implicated in the failover story articulated here either. I would make similar comments about the section on reliability.<p>What is really strange is that the future of OO doesn&#x27;t seem to be focused (according to this paper) on the concerns of maintainability, abstraction, readability and reuse that I think made it an attractive line for development in the past, and this is perhaps why it hasn&#x27;t persisted as &quot;the way and the only way&quot; of software development into the current decade. I think that the community has dead-ended on these challenges and is now casting about for other stories to move forward on, which is basically the death-nell for this line of programming languages I think. I think this is probably because everyone knows that the four challenges I mention are extremely hard - even to define and more so to metricate, let alone solve - and those who take them on will be out published by folks working on virtually anything else. Also, sadly for comp sci, these are fuzzy, soft and human problems to do with people and organisations - and computer scientists scorn those who do not deal with bundles of cut and dried efficiency equations and derived bounds.<p>How to move forward - well I do have a plan. The way forward is to infiltrate all funding bodies and then strangle all the maths grants that are avoiding the rigor of pure math funding by pretending to be something to do with software development or AI. The freed up money can go to engineers solving problems that matter and the theory folks can go and justify their work to the funding programs that they should be justifying their work to.

I don&#x27;t think it is the fault of either systems themselves, it is just the nature of this kind of work. Although, I&#x27;d be remiss if I don&#x27;t mention the advances Vega [3] has brought. In general, I think we do have reasonably expressive systems available today for interactive content, only that custom use-cases require a non-trivial effort to get meaningful results, as the article notes. As a result, I do not think better tooling is what is going to shift the needle here, unlike what the article notes in the challenges section.<p>The change has to come from the way incentives and incentives alone are structured. I care more about investigating deeper into a line of research rather than disseminating research in the most accessible manner at every tiny milestone (a published PDF paper). While I care about disseminating research, I care more about getting all the &quot;insider knowledge&quot; about a method before I go around acting as the evangelist. And this takes time, as any researcher would acknowledge. This is what motivates researchers in the first place. The dissemination is a less systematic part of science and involves people problems beyond any single researcher or organization. Consequently, it is also the part where researchers are least invested in.<p>In this sense, I think interactive publications like Distill will evolve to be more like Foundations &amp; Trends (FnT) [4] than your usual fast-paced conference with bleeding edge ideas. FnT is extremely well-written, broad scoped and I&#x27;ve enjoyed every issue I&#x27;ve read. There is a market for something between a broad survey and a deep reference textbook. Like both, it takes years to distill knowledge to be accessible. Distill-like publications are poised to fill this gap. This is certain to be much more than just a niche art. But hoping distribution as widespread as cheap (in terms of the writing effort) PDFs seems like wishful thinking. Of course, this in no way means the pursuit of such idealized systems is in vain as history reminds us every time.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikibooks.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LaTeX&#x2F;PGF&#x2F;TikZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikibooks.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LaTeX&#x2F;PGF&#x2F;TikZ<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matplotlib.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matplotlib.org<\/a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vega.github.io&#x2F;vega&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vega.github.io&#x2F;vega&#x2F;<\/a>\n[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nowpublishers.com&#x2F;FnTs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nowpublishers.com&#x2F;FnTs<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 09:33:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["phendrenad2"],"id":[24536897],"kids":[24537158,24540814,24540721,24537072,24537361],"parent":[24526845],"text":["I think that there&#x27;s a disconnect between academia and industry in the field of computer graphics.

There are stable libraries for most things you need in a web server, and those are mostly the same libraries Google is using internally, so they&#x27;re well tested. The green thread&#x2F;goroutine approach means you don&#x27;t have the problems which come from &quot;async&quot; and threads in the same program; there&#x27;s only one concurrent task construct.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for that.

Now, everybody gets ownership semantics.  Any new language that isn&#x27;t garbage collected will probably have ownership semantics. Before Rust, only theorists discussed ownership semantics much. Ownership was implicit in programs, and not talked about much.<p>Tying locking to ownership seems to have worked in Rust. A big problem with locking has been that languages didn&#x27;t address which lock covers what data. Java approached that with &quot;synchronized&quot;, but that seems to have been a flop. (Why?) Ada had the &quot;rendezvous&quot;, a similar idea. Rust seems to have made forward progress in that area.<p>I used to say that the big problems in C are &quot;How big is it?&quot;, &quot;Who owns it for deletion purposes?&quot;, and &quot;Who locks it?&quot; At last, with Rust we see strong solutions to those problems in wide use.<p>Much work has gone into Rust, and it will have much influence on the design of later languages. We&#x27;re finding out what happens with that model, what&#x27;s useful, what&#x27;s missing, and what&#x27;s cruft.<p>In the next round of languages, we&#x27;ll probably have to deal directly with non-shared memory. \nTotally shared memory in multiprocessors is an illusion maintained by elaborate cache interlocking and huge inter-cache bandwidth.

The goal is creating correct and secure <i>programs<\/i> -- that have as few bugs and security flaws as possible&#x2F;required -- as cheaply as possible. While a memory safe language in the style of Rust is one means toward that end, that eliminates an important class of bugs at the cost of language complexity, it is not the best way toward that goal, at least not that we know, and it is certainly not the only one [1]. I.e. the hypothesis that if I want to write a program that&#x27;s as correct as possible&#x2F;needed as cheaply as possible then I should necessarily use the language that gives me the most sound guarantees regardless of the cost this entails is just some people&#x27;s guess. It&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s a good guess or a bad one because it&#x27;s clear that we&#x27;re talking about specific sweet-spots on a wide spectrum of options that could be very context-dependent, but it&#x27;s still a guess, with good arguments both in its favour as well as against.<p>&gt; In Rust, there are choices to be made, some important enough to have dedicated syntax.<p>Not only that, but those choices are exposed in the type signature and are, therefore, viral.

We&#x27;re aiming at supporting cloud workloads, i.e. those modern, full Linux distribution images currently being run by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) tenants.<p>Our primary target is not to support client or serverless use cases, and as such our code base already diverges from the crosvm and Firecracker ones. As we add more features to support our use cases, we believe that the divergence will increase while at the same time sharing as much of the fundamental virtualization code through the rust-vmm project crates as possible.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cloud-hypervisor&#x2F;cloud-hypervisor#firecracker-and-crosvm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cloud-hypervisor&#x2F;cloud-hypervisor#firecra...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-20 20:06:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stonogo"],"id":[24537458],"kids":[24538925],"parent":[24534430],"text":["The README refers to use cases but does not specify any.

I’m not sure if I grabbed it from that book, but one of his quotes I enjoy is: &quot;The underlying bureaucratic key is the ability to deal with boredom. To function effectively in an environment that precludes everything vital and human. To breath, so to speak, without air. The key is the ability, whether innate or conditioned, to find the other side of the rote, the picayune, the meaningless, the repetitive, the pointlessly complex. To be, in a word, unborable... It is the key to modern life. If you are immune to boredom, there is literally nothing you cannot accomplish.&quot;<p>I find him to be a breath of fresh air, in his books and interviews, in describing how miraculous yet constrained our lives are.
