Relatively good and bad things can happen in response to them. Good things subsumes Mark&#x27;s &quot;goals&quot;, bad things covers the &quot;restrictions&quot;, and &quot;agency&quot; is implicit that in order to have consequences, you must have actions.<p>But the part that makes games <i>games<\/i> is that the scope of those consequences has an upper. Bad things can happen, but they can only be <i>so<\/i> bad. And, importantly, you have a good understanding of how bad they can be <i>before<\/i> you make the choice.<p>The reason we actively seek out and play games is because we know the average result of our choices in the game is significantly better than the worst possible result. Therefore, it&#x27;s a safe experience to opt into. This is what makes games <i>feel<\/i> like games. It&#x27;s the sensation of a free lottery ticket.<p>Looking at games in these terms raises some interesting questions around the fringes. A stock trading simulation where you invest and win fake money is clearly a game. Trading your actual retirement savings on the stock market is clearly not a game. What about a &quot;game&quot; that trades using virtual money but lets you convert that to real money afterwards? What if you have to buy in with real money to play that game? What about trading on the real market but starting with a small enough fixed pool that you can safely afford to lose?<p>What if you are a professional poker player who needs to win in order to pay your bills? Conversely, what does it mean to hold a regular job with performance reviews if you happen to already be independently wealthy? Is your job now a game? What if you sink thousands of hours into an MMO in order to gain some powerful item only if you beat a dragon. Given the large opportunity cost of that time, is that boss fight still a game?<p>My claim is that the structure of the activity itself doesn&#x27;t tell you whether or not it&#x27;s a game. You need to know the context of the player because that&#x27;s what determines the severity of the consequences. Chutes and ladders is a game. Chutes and ladders with a mob boss who will murder your family if you lose is not.<p>Something I&#x27;ve observed in my own life is that when it feels like too many things are not fun, it&#x27;s often because I&#x27;m in a place where the negative consequences of them are too severe, or at least I perceive them to be.

(even though he relativates it a bit) And rather think the opposite.\nAll games ultimately have real world relevance, by training a certain or many skills, useful for the real world. (some games of course more, than others)<p>Or they even have direct realworld relevance, as the winner in a competition, for example the olympic games, gets real fame and reward. (also in e-sports)<p>But for example the olympic games were created, to get the young greek people to train certain skills, so they would be better warriors in a real fight.<p>Now, most computer or card games, do not have that intention, they are intended to be fun.<p>And why are they fun?<p>Because they provide a challenge and everyone enjoys mastering a challenge. Because that is pro evolution.\nAnd we as a species, we were very successfull, because we could adopt to very different challenges. And traditionally trained for that as childs with various games, like &quot;catch&quot;. A game that trained many important skills for hunting or fleeing from a predator. (reflexes, speed, evade, sneak, timing...) Not so important anymore, in civilized, policed rich societys, still important in poorer areas.<p>So the traditional idea of a game is, training a real world scenario in controlled and save setting. But theory is dull, so kids do it, because &quot;it is fun&quot;. (and it is fun, because of various success during the game, that makes the brain releas happy hormones, along with other hormones from the movement itself)<p>Now sadly, that idea got messed up along the way and games today are often played for compensation for lack of joy at boring jobs, which do not give the rewarding feeling, or as time killing for those who lack a meaningful occupation. So quite some games train a not so relevant skillset. They trick the brain in thinking what it is doing is pro evolution (you get more powerful, you evolve, you make friends, join a strong tribe, you slain powerful enemies, ...), while in reality, it is not. At least not doing it as a main purpose, which many addicted gamers do. \n(Apart from that, also hardcore gaming can of course lead to real world benefits, making real friends, learning organizing skills, time management, communicate effectivly, using the right tools, etc. but I am talking about addiction here. When the game becomes the purpose and the gamer exists for the game and not the other way around.)<p>So ... games are awesome. They can teach you various things. They can take you to other worlds, inspire your creativity, let you find people you lack in &quot;real live&quot;, blow of steam, finding reward - but they are bad, if they become your main purpose of existence.<p>Anyway, I believe, much more of learning in schools etc. should be in the form of games. When you play being a roman soldier, (wheter it be in a computer game, or theater, or reenactment) you will much more understand about that time, than reading facts in a textbook. If you can play with a lego mindstorm robot in class, you will understand much more about robotic, than reading about it.

This matters deeply because there is <i>another<\/i> important Greek philosopher who, if he existed, lived a much more impoverished and simple life, namely Diogenes [0]. This contrast between Socrates and Diogenes is worth carrying into the rest of the piece.<p>Kierkegaard was Christian, and living in an era where Christian foundational beliefs were considered scientifically supported. As a result, his philosophy cannot escape the Christian mindset. While the author name-drops existentialists, folks like Camus and Nietzsche, they don&#x27;t seem to grok that existentialism aggressively rejected the same trappings of society to which Kierkegaard felt encircled and trapped, particularly the religious trappings to which Kierkegaard felt such obligation and wonder.<p>At least Kierkegaard was right to criticize Hegelian dialectic as &quot;nonsense&quot;. Plain language philosophy [1] is so much simpler, although it wasn&#x27;t ready yet in Kierkegaard&#x27;s time.<p>The author uncritically accepts Kierkegaard&#x27;s view that Christian myths much be accepted as paradoxical or absurd yet true. When countervailing evidence disproves each myth, we are not merely being fervent or zealous if we hold on to those stories, but actively denying reason and empiricism.<p>The author concludes by suggesting that we look inward to an intuitive religious or spiritual path, and ignore the distractions of society. Further, they insist that the philsophical truths revealed here or there by Kierkegaard or his biographers are ageless and that the &quot;peculiar challenges of our moment&quot; are not &quot;the meaning of our lives&quot;. That is high-minded, but simply not true.

In some situations apologizing feels right, in others it doesn&#x27;t, so there&#x27;s not much sense in generalizing from a single scenario to the general case.<p>I think ultimately it comes down to matching expectations: almost all people involved in software development expect bugs. The question is how much effort do they expect me to put into reducing the quantity and severeness of those bugs. When I go to a dentist I expect them to make every possible effort to avoid harming me; generally this is not the expectation of software developers going about their day. A feature that takes one hour with reasonable effort at ensuring quality could easily take a day or a week if you make _every possible effort_ to ensure it is bug-free. Different pieces of code (at different times) could have different amounts of impact, so it takes a wider understanding of the code&#x27;s context to decide how much effort I&#x27;m going to put into chasing bugs. When in doubt, I match expectations with the relevant stakeholder(s). Then the situations where apologizing feels right are either those where I didn&#x27;t meet the expectations, e.g. I was in a hurry to push so I didn&#x27;t take the time to properly test and I should have known better (not very frequent); or situations where I didn&#x27;t take the time to properly match expectations (though sometimes that&#x27;s on the other party, but it takes two to match expectations).<p>One other thing regarding responsibility - I think that taking responsibility and apologizing are different things.

This is my second Show HN for Booste – looking forward to your thoughts.<p>Booste is a command-line interface (CLI) that takes code written on your local editor&#x2F;IDE and executes it in EC2. It runs remotely, in a pre-configured environment, but works with your local tools thanks to a background filesync process.<p>I want to fix the “it works on my machine” issue by bypassing personal machines entirely. As if Docker and Heroku had a lovechild.<p>How I came to building Booste:<p>Being a mechanical engineer turned software dev, there were countless times where my laptop (glorified tablet) couldn’t handle the workload needed, so I made Booste v1: a tool to host full desktop apps on AWS and stream it over RDP (remote desktop protocol) to clients. Some may recall the Show HN of Booste v1 six months ago.<p>Booste v1 sucked. Unusable latency, crap unit economics, and an infrequent pain point.<p>Through it all, the most common customer request was for a hosted VS Code. Prospective users wanted the perks of a cloud IDE (namely no-setup environments) but wanted to use their own tools. Diving deeper, it seems that most large companies build out their own (usually buggy) version of remote “devboxes”. The need seemed consistent and clear.<p>After the first Show HN and a failed W20 interview, I pivoted. I gutted the graphical desktop component, zoomed in on developers, and rebuilt as a CLI: Booste v2.<p>Running any shell command proceeded by the world ‘booste’ will trigger the CLI. The CLI tunnels that command through SSH to EC2, executes it there, and streams the stdout back down to your command line. Filesync makes sure EC2 is ready with your code.<p>Where “npm start” would run an app on localhost, “booste npm start” runs the same app in the cloud, visible to your team by URL. You can edit the code locally (VS Code, Sublime, Vim) and the save is synced and hot-swapped on the live URL within a second.<p>How the environment sharing works:<p>- The creator of a “Codebox” (EC2 instance) gets a barebones Ubuntu VM, on which they can set environment variables, install interpreters and packages, or set up databases. (pre-built env templates coming soon).<p>- Team members join the codebox by ID and password with a single “booste join” command.<p>- Codebox members get repos placed next to each other on the directory tree, so code doesn’t clash.<p>- There is “booste clone” feature in the works, where you can clone someone’s config without actually entering and messing with their codebox.<p>Under the hood:<p>-The CLI is built in Python using the Click library<p>-Codebox infrastructure is automated with the AWS SDK.<p>---Currently, they are EC2 instances, for the sake of getting the beta live. I plan to migrate to a more flexible containerized setup in the near future. Containers make much more sense.<p>-I built a Dropbox-like filesync, inspired by the rsync.<p>---It monitors a chosen directory on your local machine and syncs it with the codebox.<p>---When files in that directory are added, modified, or removed, the codebox reflects this within a second. Only differentials are sent.<p>---All communication is encrypted with frequently cycled keys, unlike rsync.<p>---Bulky files (ML data, dependency packages), which would otherwise slow rsync to a crawl are ignored by a customizable .boosteignore file.<p>-Since files sync asynchronously (on edit), the only latency is from ssh. There’s a 0.5 - 1 second delay on booste commands.<p>I’ve moving from closed to open beta. Fueled by covid and the now mandatory remote development teams, I made a free tier for you. \nGive it a try!

Several things. One thing that’s different is large-scale labor action.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be a Chomsky essay without a paean to the labor movement.<p>I think that the &quot;Green New Deal&quot; is the wrong name. The &quot;New Deal&quot; was a principally economic initiative. Climate change affects the economy, but climate change is really about physics. The appropriate analogy would be to the Manhattan Project, not the New Deal. (Nuclear technology has also had a massive effect on the economy!)<p>One unfortunate consequence of the naming trend &quot;Green New Deal&quot; has been an excessive focus on economic remedies which overshadows the most important scientific advances. Recently the most important advances have been in the production and price of lithium batteries.<p>There are approximately 500 trillion pounds of lithium in the ocean, as well as many cheaper sources on land. The lithium iron-phosphate chemistry is not dense enough for use in cars or portable electronics, but on a cost basis it is quickly eclipsing all other forms of energy storage. At present, the development of this technology is limited mostly by low demand, which is utterly ridiculous when you consider that the widespread adoption of grid-scale energy storage is absolutely essential to there ever being a near-zero-carbon electricity market.<p>The other key technology that needs to be developed further is the heat pump. Heating buildings with gas accounts for a large fraction of our carbon emissions and can&#x27;t be easily replaced by Joule heating because the electricity requirements are so large. Therefore the near-zero-carbon replacement for gas heating must be some variety of heat pump, be it vapor-compression, magnetocaloric or otherwise. The current commercially available air-source heat pumps are limited to a minimum outdoor air temperature of about -20 C, which means that they are not viable for year-round heating in many large global cities, including e.g. Chicago, Moscow,  Harbin, et cetera. Ground-source heat pumps by contrast have high installation costs which increase with the desired power output. Improvements in one or the other are needed to reach the necessary endpoint where nearly all of the human population can stop relying on gas heating."],"time":["2020-04-24 23:25:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["claydavisss"],"id":[22972724],"kids":{},"parent":[22972479],"text":["Many of the newly unemployed lack the skills to build infrastructure.

It was actually the New Deal that stopped the bounce back.<p>The politicians behind the new deal saw the Great Depression as an opportunity for social revolution, not as an economic recovery program. It is no secret that many of the primary architects behind the New Deal were strongly inspired by early socialism and fascism.<p>Further I would say Noam Chomsky has absolutely zero credibly in any topic related to economics. He is a weirdo socialist and we could go down 3 levels deep of what type of socialist exactly he is, but needless to economics and political science would agree that his ideas are not practical. So why take a advice from him on this.<p>You don&#x27;t need a &#x27;New Deal&#x27; you need to apply your budget and countries strategy with the long run goals you have and make good investments. The New Deal was the exact opposite, it was the embodiment of &#x27;lets throw shit on the wall and hope for the best&#x27; often doing massive damage in the process. Mass slaughtering of pigs and destruction of other foods being the most absurd examples of such idiocy. The Blue Eagle program might be the worst regulation ever passed in American history. The list goes on.<p>Depending on what exactly you want to achieve, their are far, far better solutions then having the government bureaucrats blow billions of 100s of billions on politicians pet projects. Its totally contrary to how good government contract is done.<p>Just as with the original New Deal this Green New Deal is not about achieving results.

I have been working remotely since 2012; the challenges of remote work are not new to me. I work with 30+ people, and our clients are in different timezones. Our team includes full-stack developers, designers, product leads, and other support staff.<p>First Challenge: Schedule of work hours or team availability.  \n Back in 2012, each member of our team started working from our respective homes. We started with seven team members; it&#x27;s a small team. Initially, people are productive while we work as individual contributors. However, efficiency and productivity dropped very low when we started to work on the same project because everyone has the flexibility to choose when they want to work as long as they complete the required hours per week. We partially solved this by setting standard work hours that everyone in the team will follow.<p>Second Challenge: Quality of work is affected by many factors.  \n Working alone remotely is initially fun, but eventually, employees feel lonely. Keeping focus at work is also hard due to distractions, like games, social media, house-related errands, etc. Monitoring employees&#x27; honesty on work hours and work done is also a challenge. \n Since our team mostly live in the same town, we decided to work in the same place. We converted my whole dorm into an office, removed the walls, joint the rooms, and made it look like a real office. Centralizing our distributed team to work in the same place doubled or tripled our team&#x27;s efficiency and productivity. You can imagine how it made it easier to do daily standups, do design planning, pair programming, code reviews, etc. Employees became happier, and the bond between got stronger; we also eat meals together, we go on retreats, we play games together, our employee retention rate is 90% since we started. Over the years of working remotely, we have also built a tool that we use internally to manage and monitor employees and projects.<p>Now with the Corona Virus, our team is back temporarily in working from home, and most of us can&#x27;t wait to start working together in the office again."],"time":["2020-04-25 13:50:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrisco255"],"id":[22970930],"kids":{},"parent":[22970602],"text":["I&#x27;ve been working remote for better part of a year.

It&#x27;s all or nothing if you want it to work long-term.<p>Whenever you have a case where some team members work in an office together, and others work remotely - it creates undue stress on personal relationships. Even if your team makes a great effort to be inclusive, there will always be times (lunches especially) where important conversations will happen in-person, and the remote person will be left out. In the worst case scenario, it can lead to being intentionally left out of even important technical conversations (Example: I had a remote coworker on a sibling team who scheduled a meeting about a technical architecture issue he wanted to have input on. The in-person team didn&#x27;t show up to the call, but then had the meeting in person without him and told him the outcome of the decision.) The remote workers will end up feeling hobbled from a  relationship building standpoint - and their growth opportunities will feel limited.<p>Those issues can be easily avoided by keeping teams either all-remote, or all-in-person. When you are in an all-remote team, everyone is on the same level communication-wise. So you&#x27;ll see real effort go into using slack and other tools to build up comaraderie.

As a matter of fact things have never been easier. While on-site you constantly have people around you, and countless distractions and annoyances, this is not the case at home.<p>This isn&#x27;t the case for everyone of course - if you have kids, families, pets and whatnot, I&#x27;m sure that changes.<p>In addition, since I am a really die-hard linux user and I know my way around a system and networks, it&#x27;s safe to say I do most of the work locally on my computer. rsync, mounting small partitions over sshfs with just the files I need, tunneling and so on, I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference after spending two hours writing a few shell scripts for common stuff. Generally I am a command line guy, I rarely bother with fancy IDE&#x27;s and vim is often my first weapon of choice. With a couple of macros I&#x27;ve been able to simplify just about all common tasks to a few keystrokes. And being really familiar with the code that already exists, I rarely need reference. As long as I have SSH and the most basic of tools like vim, grep, git, find and whatnot, I feel right at home, no pun intended.<p>But for people who are used to more modern, fancy stuff(coming from a 30 year old...), this might sound like a nightmare. Also if your work involves a lot of graphics, it&#x27;s probably a nightmare. Looking at people using rdp...

But there was another strange side effect of the lockdown - I started exercising on daily basis(having weights, pull up bar, yoga mats and whatnot and 5 minutes every couple of hours). To my greatest surprise, in the last month and a half I&#x27;ve gotten in a better shape then ever. In terms of body fat I&#x27;m certainly in the single digits without loosing muscle mass.<p>So in the case of people who have the chance to work in solitude, have a good working ethic, can handle their work efficiently over the internet, don&#x27;t require social interactions and can take care of their physical and mental health(highly specific demographic, I know), at this point I have 0 arguments against remote work.

I ended up having to close my business and move on, though I did eventually get all of my money back.<p>I&#x27;ve built multiple successful businesses since then and Amazon has recently had many business reps try to get me to sign up with a business account, because we purchase lots of items on Amazon&#x2F;month.

Why not use existing policy?<p>Edit: One example Google could give of precedent is that they removed videos of people encouraging and participating in the Tide Pod Challenge: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;17&#x2F;16902990&#x2F;youtube-tide-pod-challenge-video-take-down-community-guidelines-removal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;17&#x2F;16902990&#x2F;youtube-tide-pod...<\/a><p>However, I&#x27;d actually be fine with them removing video of people drinking bleach to combat coronavirus.

Allowing their platform to be used for dissemination of potentially harmful advice puts them squarely at risk for lawsuits and bad press, both of which have very highly potential costs. At the same time, it presents relatively little potential profit. If someone is harmed following the advice they found on their platform, YouTube was just following WHO advice.
