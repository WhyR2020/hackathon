By contrast, connectionists often complain that there are no good\nclassical models of learning [4.2 Arguments for connectionism].<p>There is no special need for a specific model of &quot;learning&quot; in a classical\nsetting. Given an inference procedure, such as induction, adbuction or\ndeduction, that can derive new facts and rules in a logical language from\nobservations and a pre-existing theory (i.e. a pre-existing set of facts and\nrules), all it takes to &quot;learn&quot; is to store the newly derived facts and rules\nto a database.<p>I mean &quot;learning&quot; in the sense of Mitchell&#x27;s definition of _machine_ learning,\nas (informally) the ability of a system to improve its performance from\nexperience. In this sense, a system that starts with a database of logical\nfacts and rules and adds new facts and rules derived from new observations\nis &quot;learning&quot;.<p>You can find many examples of learning in a classical, logic setting in the\nearly (&#x27;70s and &#x27;80s) machine learning literature, particularly with\npropositional logic learners such as decision list and decision tree learners,\nthe most famous of which are J.

Let&#x27;s say you have a dataset and would like to create synthetic data using it and a GAN. Then you wish to estimate the distribution D of the data with a GAN. To do so the GAN learns the joint distribution P(X1, X2, ..., Xn) (where in the image case each X is usually a pixel) such that one may sample from D and obtain a new, synthetic image. Indeed, one will generate novel data but the distribution D that was estimated is merely a description of the original data at best and in practice a little bit (or a lot) off.<p>Now turn to the machine learning problem we sought to solve with the new synthetic data: what is the P(y|X1, X2, ..., Xn) where y is usually a class like &quot;bird&quot;.

Primarily, I was one of the main designers on giantbomb and gamespot over the years.<p>The publishing industry is kind of terrible, and the line between real journalism and critique died somewhere around 2008. If I were to pick a point, I&#x27;d look to when Jeff was fired by CNET after he gave Kane and Lynch an unfavorable review. But you can see it in the degradation of every major gaming news outlet that used to have full-time employees with a platform stable enough to not bow down to PR teams.<p>That type of blowback would never happen today because any journalistic wall between the PR folks pushing these products and the content creators no longer exists. YouTube has successfully weaponized content. We like to talk a lot today about how great it is that we don&#x27;t see ads. That&#x27;s kind of lie. They are certainly there and we see them everyday, it&#x27;s just now embedded in the content itself. The journos can&#x27;t compete, because the PR firms block access to coverage unless the story is preconceived. As an example, back in the day we used to boycott Call of Duty &quot;review&quot; events where they&#x27;d fly you in a helicopter at a hotel so you could play the game for 6 hours with someone over your shoulder.<p>Fandom and &quot;fun&quot; content creation was always a loose proposition (&quot;will i still be doing this at 40&quot; was the bar night saying), but now it&#x27;s just a quick hit slog. I sympathize with these folks to a degree. They&#x27;re all independent, they all have no idea if this will be a job even next year, so of course they will take on any sort of shilling to keep their dream going. They need to hustle. It&#x27;s like running a one-person startup.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about the 10s of thousands of other sad bedrooms where this is pushed as a real industry and a way of life. When startups fail, we engineers and designers fall back to jobs with the skills we learned. It&#x27;s not as easy for people whose skill was trying to be funny on camera. There&#x27;s a lot of people chasing the dream at the moment, and of course that&#x27;s no different than trying to be a movie star, but part of me winces when I open up twitch and see that all this awkwardness is so public and often permanent.<p>If anyone is curious about where some of this could go, I&#x27;d recommend reading Super Sad True Love Story by Gary Shteyngart, a sort of near-future fiction that got a lot of this stuff right before it happened.

My specialty is PHP and iOS&#x2F;Android development, and back then there might be 3-5 bids on gigs after a client listing was up for a few days. Now it&#x27;s 10-20 the very first day. My market at least seems to be saturated.<p>I also look on LinkedIn, Indeed and Glassdoor. From what I can tell, just about everything has moved to enterprise, SEO and cybersecurity. The prerequisites now are AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and specific job roles or languages experience rather than general programming or problem-solving acumen. The vast majority of jobs are full-time.<p>I can find a full-time job for $100,000 per year much more easily than a part-time job for $50,000. Has anyone had any luck working part-time or remote sustainably?<p>I&#x27;m concerned that as we head up to the next economic downturn and beyond, that programming will get more and more specialized to the point that it becomes IT. So more about support and maintaining existing infrastructure than breaking new ground or solving new problems. I also feel that most of the new disciplines like SEO and dev ops arguably have little or nothing to do with programming and probably shouldn&#x27;t be grouped with it. They are representative of the ethical&#x2F;legal shortcomings of search engines, and conceptual issues with software architecture planning vs agile spinning (chasing profit at all cost rather than paying down technical debt). I guess to me, they represent a shift from the egalitarian future of the 90s and twenty-teens to one where profit trumps quality of life for certain people.<p>Am I misguided here? Is there any chance of getting programmers back to having somewhat independent lives like they enjoyed in the 80s and 90s? This last year I&#x27;ve been considering walking away from programming because it&#x27;s not about the money anymore. I just don&#x27;t know if I can give up my whole psyche in 1 and 2 year blocks of my life toiled away on someone else&#x27;s problems anymore.

Optimistic enough that I&#x27;m willing to make a full switch over to it instead of hopping into Windows or wrestling with Wine to get Clip Studio working.<p>Grants like this are great news, both because the influx of money is important, and because increased industry focus is good for pushing projects like this in the direction of being the kind of stable software that you can rely on industrially.

Hundreds of companies already support it, so why not join them instead of re-inventing the wheel?<p>I think I know what im talking about, because my (smart) home automation is based on KNX, I use Alexa voice commands or a KNX app on my mobile devices to controll all my KNX compatible devices, a server gets the commands and allows me to control the lights (on&#x2F;off&#x2F;dimming), to inquire an set the temperature in each room, to control the inner blinds as well as the outer shutters (open&#x2F;close), to get data of water consumption, electricity consumption from many devices like the cooking plate, the owen, the lights, the AC, ... to get values from my weather station like wind speed, wind direction, sun intensity and much more ... I also have fire detection sensors, movement sensors, air pollution and water leak  sensors which can trigger alarms... I can inquire on my phone if I forgot to turn off the owen in the kitchen, if the main door is being or has been left opened. Through Alexa I have also connected my Roomba as well as my TV and all the media devices connected to it (using the Logitech Harmony hub) but those two things are not KNX, everything else is.<p>Being able to control all this through Alexa is super fun. When I go to bed I just need say &quot;Alexa good night&quot; and Alexa tells my KNX shutters to move down to 100%, all my lights in any room to 0%. When I leave the house I say &quot;Alexa, good bye&quot; and Alexa checks if my appliences are turned off, turns the lights off and lowers the heating in all the rooms a bit. Also as im super lazy, if I finish cooking and throw myself on the couch but forgot to turn of the kitchen lights I just need to say &quot;Alexa turn of the kitchen lights and turn on netflix&quot;.<p>What is also nice is that I can program (control and combine) everything myself.

The amount of control the chaebol companies (like Samsung) have over the nature of the South Korean economy is dare I say criminal.<p>A chaebol can own 51% of a company to get voting rights.  That company can own 51% of another company, and 51% of another company, and so on.  Multiply it all the way through a chain of companies, and you can get many companies near the bottom of the chain where the chaebol actually owns a small minority of the companies and yet controls those companies nonetheless.  This leads to extreme agency-principal problems where many companies end up doing things not in the shareholder&#x27;s interest.<p>The difficulty is that these ownership chains are not clear because accounting regulations don&#x27;t require that level of transparency.  So it&#x27;s difficult to know if you&#x27;re buying stock in a company that is in a position to actually care about your interests as a shareholder.  It&#x27;s safer to assume that you&#x27;re going to get screwed as a shareholder.  The ability of startups to grow up and become real success stories like the Facebooks and Amazons of the world are extremely rare.<p>So the chaebols get to reap all the benefits of raiding these smaller companies and never have to worry about their own positions being disrupted.  A small company at the bottom of one of these chains can be forced to sell all their intellectual property at dirt cheap prices to a chaebol, and there&#x27;s nothing other shareholders can do about it.  The professor said in the US, securities laws make it easy for shareholders to sue a CEO from doing such stupid things.  Not effective in South Korea.  Heck, they apparently even have these temp CEO gigs where a guy off the street is hired to be a CEO and is paid handsomely to take the fall and spend some time in jail when legal troubles like that ensue.<p>Corruption is big in South Korea, and it&#x27;s no wonder why there are so few new Korean startups that actually become household names.  It&#x27;s not for lack of effort or chance.  Further evidence that corruption is big in South Korea, look at how often those big-time chaebol executives get thrown in jail and then they get to walk out free again to pursue their normal life because they&#x27;re too important to the Korean economy.  As a Korean Canadian, it boggles my mind why Korean people accept this status quo.  There is admittedly a deep reverence for these companies that brought South Korea out of poverty creating economic growth the likes of which is rarely seen.  But even so, I don&#x27;t see a nice future if people don&#x27;t stand up more for themselves, including the labourers who get exploited by these companies because they&#x27;re the only viable employer in town."],"time":["2019-12-19 03:21:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ada1981"],"id":[21834482],"kids":{},"parent":[21828120],"text":["Yikes it’s early.

It&#x27;s standard industry practice for companies to claim ownership of everything a software engineer comes up with, even &quot;on their own time&quot;.   The problem is it&#x27;s extremely difficult to say, figure out when someone might have invented some super clever idea which can be pantented &quot;on their own time&quot;.   This was true when I worked for MIT, VA Linux, IBM, and Google.   At VA Linux it was the VC&#x27;s which insisted on that clause in the employee&#x27;s contracts.   So anyone who think this is some evidence of Google being, or becoming, evil is either seriously misinformed, or just engaging in unthinking hate of Google, or both.<p>In fact, Google has one of the most permissive IP policies that I&#x27;ve seen at any company except for VA Linux Systems. \n The default is that the vast majority of work done by an employee can be released under an open source license.  Sure, there&#x27;s a process that you have to go through, and unless what you want to do intersects with work that you are doing for your team that isn&#x27;t intended to be released publically, or competes with a critical company initiative, the default answer is that it will be allowed to be released.<p>This is <i>not<\/i> true for many, if not most companies, and as a responsible open source maintainer, I make sure that people understand they have permission from their company before I accept their open source contributions.  Otherwise, I would be putting them, and the project, at risk.   (Note that because of this, there are many employees which are not allowed to participate in open source development, because their employers will not give them permission to release code written by an employee under an open source license, whether written &quot;on their own time&quot; or not.)<p>At Google, once you get this (mostly pro forma) permission, you can work on open source projects on your own time, or on 20% time, using company laptops, or using GCE resources, etc.   When I was hired at Google, my manager and I cut a deal such that I could work on Linux Kernel and community projects for 50% of my time, instead of the normal 20%.   Sure, the overlap between what was good for Google and what was good for ext4&#x2F;Linux was pretty broad, but Google also paid for me to travel to various conferences in Asia, Australia, Europe, etc.<p>Also unique to Google is there is a process by which you can get permission for you to out-and-out own the work done on your own time, as opposed to Google owning it and releasing it under an open source license.   If you take that option then it really has to be done on your own time, and must not use any company resources, meaning not on a company laptop, or on a company network, etc.   This is rare, and I&#x27;m not aware of many other companies that give employees that option."],"time":["2019-12-18 14:22:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["raphlinus"],"id":[21826031],"kids":[21826469],"parent":[21823413],"text":["Counterpoint: I open sourced a <i>lot<\/i> of stuff while I was at Google.

I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for the company to be able to say that for everything the company does even if you have no contact with it.

Pentatonic scales are those same modes with some notes omitted. Blues and harmonic minor scales are those same modes with some notes inserted.

If you want to compose pop music (including rock and electronic music) the risk is to lose yourself in complicated harmony &quot;rules&quot; that are mostly irrelevant to the style you want to play (on top of my mind parallel fifths prohibited in classical theory but they are commonplace in rock&#x2F;metal) and only useful to analyze classical pieces.<p>Personally as a guitarist I kind of hacked my way into music theory to being able to improvise over and compose pop&#x2F;rock&#x2F;electronic by only using intervals and scale degrees. I can hear chords progressions, I know why a V I cadence works, can identify and play in modes (dorian, lydian...), but I can&#x27;t name the notes so transcribing into a DAW is cumbersome but at least I can compose freely. Not ideal but considering the minimal time I invested it&#x27;s a very good return for me.<p>Concretely the idea is to focus only on patterns and formulas. The steps would be to learn to play and hear intervals, then construct chords, e.g. Major chord is 4+3 semi-tones, minor is 3+4, another +3 is minor 7 or +4 for major 7. Then by using a scale (e.g white notes on the piano for key of C major&#x2F;A minor) it&#x27;s easy to find the chord on each degree. After that learn a few common chords progressions and being able to identify them in everyday songs should come naturally. Finally practice composing melodies by targeting chord tones and you are ready to start composing.<p>I found this video does a very good job at providing this overview: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0<\/a> (edit: the second half of the video)."],"time":["2019-12-18 14:51:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["reilly3000"],"id":[21827338],"kids":[21827802,21827396],"parent":[21822225],"text":["Oh man I&#x27;ve been waiting SO long to say this: get a music degree.

They should be able to help with theory.<p>- Learn multiple instruments. Just like learning additional programming languages, adding another instrument furthers your enlightenment significantly.<p>- Play lots of music with consistent daily frequency.<p>- Listen to LOTS of different kinds of music. Listen actively, picking apart melody, rhythm, chords, and structure. It really helps to transcribe songs you like to develop a critical ear.<p>- Hang out with lots of different musicians.<p>- Spend time in a good DAW &#x2F; digital audio workstation. Like your IDE, it can help you create music while giving you the power of a good linter and test suite. Record simple melodies then practice editing them in a Piano Roll view.<p>- Music doesn&#x27;t move fast like programming. Some of the best educational materials available today are 75+ years old.<p>- Improvisation is one of the best paths towards discovery IMHO, but you have to be learning other musical idioms to expand your own improvisational pallet.<p>Have fun.

In general, these people haven’t gotten very far in making up their own system, so their advice is pretty worthless! My other hot take is that the existing system of musical notation and terminology that we have is actually pretty good, and it’s hard to figure out ways to improve it.<p>Music theory is a pretty broad subject and there are a ton of pathways through music theory that take you to different parts of it. I would start by trying to figure out a “map” of the different parts you are interested in.<p>Almost any course will start with major&#x2F;minor diatonic scales, then intervals, and then chords. If you combine notes with rhythm, you get a melody. If you combine chords together, you get harmony. Figuring out how harmony works usually starts with “functional harmony” which is where you learn about tonic&#x2F;dominant&#x2F;subdominant chords and cadences. The main gotcha here is that there are a couple competing systems for writing names of chords, and you should at least be aware of them so you’re not surprised by a “V6 chord” because that name means two different things depending on which system you use.<p>This gives you a pretty good foundation for understanding music or writing your own. It’s also not too hard to get this far on your own. Music will still seem mysterious and weird, but that’s normal.<p>From there you can go in a bunch of directions—there’s atonal music, jazz, traditional counterpoint, nonfunctional harmony, modes, alternative scales, alternative tunings, etc.<p>I recommend the book <i>The Musician’s Guide to Theory and Analysis.<\/i> Personally, I would go through the first chapters until it introduces strict counterpoint, and then consider the rest of the book as a “menu” that you can read in any order (kind of). For the second edition, that means doing chapters 1-8, and then you can feel free to skip around chapters 9+. Don’t just follow the book with pencil and paper, actually play the exercises on a real instrument and train your ear (and get an ear training app, if you think it will help).<p>Finally, I recommend buying a stack of staff paper from the local stationary store. It shouldn’t be hard to find. Alternatively, you can use a computer program to write music, but the choices are a bit intimidating. I’m using Dorico these days but it’s $100. Don’t rely on tabs if you want to improve theory.

The general approach I&#x27;d recommend is trampolining between on-paper theory and ear training, with the specific goal at each stage being the ability to identify by listening the structures that you&#x27;re learning about on paper. The text I&#x27;d recommend is Aldwell&#x27;s Harmony and Voice Leading, which is very focussed on the techniques of classical Western concert music but is still, along with its exercises, the best bet I can think of for building a solid foundation of knowledge that you can bring to other musical styles.<p>The most important thing I can recommend while starting out is to focus your ear training on hearing scale degrees (e.g., if I play a C major chord and then play a random note from the C major scale, you should be able to identify which note that is out of C, D, E, F, G, A or B). A lot of naive ear training resources recommend learning to hear intervals (e.g. a perfect 5th, which is the interval between C and G or E and B), but intervals only really have meaning in the context of a key, and so understanding them in that context is much more important. A good app for training with this on iOS is Politonus: it&#x27;ll play a few chords to establish a key, and then it&#x27;ll play a random note from the key and prompt you to guess which one it was. As you improve with this, you can have it play multiple notes at a time, or even notes outside of the key."],"time":["2019-12-18 22:36:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pfarrell"],"id":[21825737],"kids":{},"parent":[21822225],"text":["This video “8 Facts About the Circle of Fifths You May Not Already Know” has a click-baity title and the most clear, simple, understandable description of why the Circle is like the periodic table of music.

You might have read for example, that Major Scales all have the same pattern starting from the root note, which is Whole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half.<p>We can represent that in code as an array of integer counts of half steps, eg: [2,2,1,2,2,2,1]. From here, we can take an array of the note names, [ C, C#&#x2F;Db, D, D#&#x2F;Eb, E, F, F#&#x2F;Gb, G, G#&#x2F;Ab, A, A#&#x2F;Bb, B ], then start on the index of the root note of the Major Scale we want. Lets do that by removing the notes not in the pattern below. We end up with the C Major scale:<p>[ C, -, D, -, E, F, -, G, -, A, -, B ](Returning to C for the final step in the pattern)<p>You can do this starting from any note, using that pattern, and end up with the right scale.<p>I was surprised to learn that while there are some edge cases, a huge portion of musical scales follow a pattern you can use to generate a named scale from the root note. It works for Major, Minor, Pentantonic scales, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor and so on.<p>This was a breakthrough for my understanding of music, and made me realize that memorizing scales is more about memorizing scale patterns, which drastically decreases the amount you need to memorize and lets you use foundational building blocks rather than arbitrary knowledge to play.<p>Another breakthrough for me while building the chord finder, was noticing that much of music theory is like that. It&#x27;s all about learning the building blocks and applying it in real time, so that it sticks in your memory. All major chords are made of the same pattern, so if you have the root note, the major scale pattern, and the major chord pattern, you can quickly figure out any major chord, and later any complex chords, from there.<p>Chord progressions are the same! They follow patterns based on the scale. So when people say learning scales is important, they&#x27;re not being preachy, it&#x27;s because they are the basis for all music theory patterns.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whichchordisthis.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whichchordisthis.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-18 14:36:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pocket_titan"],"id":[21825990],"kids":[21826080],"parent":[21822225],"text":["I&#x27;m a huge fan of <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openmusictheory.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openmusictheory.com&#x2F;<\/a>.

Do a harmonic analysis of every single song you learn and check it over with your teacher.  THERE IS SIMPLY NO SUBSTITUTE FOR LEARNING WITH A TRAINED AND EDUCATED MUSICIAN.  I learned this the hard way.<p>&gt; [I] have never been able to sift through a vast array of music theory blogs and tutorials to find something that made sense.<p>I like to think of music theory as a LANGUAGE.  Sifting through blogs and tutorials is kinda like googling &quot;how do I learn Chinese?&quot;  yeah there&#x27;s probably a lot of resources out there but it&#x27;s not going to feel very productive to just dive in in this way.  You wouldn&#x27;t feel confident about learning Chinese using online resources so why would you feel confident learning music theory in this way?<p>The real problem with trying to learn from online resources on your own is that there&#x27;s no feedback... you will absolutely have gaps in your knowledge and persistent misinformation that cannot be corrected because nobody is monitoring your progress.<p>Also learning from online resources can often feel hollow. For example, I can teach ANYBODY what a major scale is in 15 minutes.  However, to truly and deeply understand the major scale can take years, it&#x27;s more than just the rules about how to construct one.  You have to really go over ideas many times and a teacher will be able to know your strengths and weaknesses and how to improve.<p>If you learn piano from the ground up (use a book series like Alfred&#x27;s Adult All-In-One) with a teacher, I guarantee that after those 3 books (which will take years to get through), you will have a decent grasp on theory.  Don&#x27;t try to tackle these books on your own, there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that&#x27;s not explicitly covered in these books.  If you try to tackle it on your own I guarantee you that you will not get the full benefit and you will very likely teach yourself incorrect technique and you will be left with a lot of misinformation.
