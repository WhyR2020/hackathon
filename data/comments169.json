The idea is to buy up the copyright on content that you know is being infringed on and then sue the infringers. I got side tracked by other things that seemed faster and easier, but I still wish someone would take up this idea and use it to purge the internet of large-scale willful plagiarizers.<p>This is not about suing platforms like YouTube. What clued me in to this opportunity was actually the company Upcounsel, which is&#x2F;was a sort of eLance for lawyers. I caught them cut and pasting one of my articles. When I looked into it more deeply, it looked like they&#x27;d hired an SEO firm to build a massive content farm around the basic strategy of taking the top two results for a search term, merging the content into a single article, rearranging a few words, and then publishing the result as their own.<p>All of those articles live in one of their sitemaps. It&#x27;s about 10k articles. I spot checked them and could find the original plagiarized sources for 70% of these articles within five clicks. Just search the article title and start clicking on other search results. So that&#x27;s maybe 14k potential instances of copyright infringement.<p>The reason I thought Upcounsel was a reasonable target is for two reasons.<p>A) They passed my own moral filter, which is higher than just &quot;what makes me money.&quot; I think it&#x27;s outrageous to pass off plagiarized legal advice as legitimate. These are people who should know better too. And I reported this to one of their investors who reported it to their CEO, so I know they know.<p>B) They briefly had money. It actually seems a little bit expensive to file these lawsuits. I&#x27;m not 100% on the details, but it&#x27;s things like needing to actually register the copyright ($800) and only have the ability to sue in federal court ($10k to really get going). Upcounsel raised a $12M round and I thought you could probably win a chunk of that just for the fact that an embarrassing lawsuit could really cripple a company that&#x27;s trying to move quickly from milestone to milestone.<p>The key to making the financial side work is proving willful infringement. That can allow up to $150k&#x2F;instance.<p>The key operational issue for this side project it a process for buying copyright. I never practiced the actual pitch. &quot;Hi, I want to buy your copyright for the purpose of suing someone who is infringing on it. I will give you a perpetual license back, i.e. I have no interest in using this content myself.&quot; There are a couple of variants on the pitch and you&#x27;d probably have to experiment.<p>This is something that really needs a lawyer and I only talked to a lawyer about one issue. I bought a session with someone on Upcounsel (thinking that using their services to sue them would make for a good story). And what I asked was about acquiring of copyright. Would it be enough to just acquire a license or would I need to be the actual copyright holder? I thought the license would make for an easier pitch to copyright holders. But the legal advice I got was very clear that I needed to be the actual copyright holder in order to file suit.<p>Part of the underlying theory here is my belief that this work was done for Upcounsel by an SEO firm rather than invented in house. If it&#x27;s a firm, then that means there are other past clients who would be targets for a lawsuit. Unfortunately, Upcounsel has basically announced they&#x27;ve gone out of business and so they aren&#x27;t a good target anymore.<p>Summing all that up, it looked like a decent risk where you might spend $50-100k per target to win&#x2F;settle for $500k+ with the most annoying thing probably being how slow this would move. That&#x27;s a good business, right? Plus, these people are in the wrong, so it&#x27;s something you could feel good about. I mean--suing people is a pretty violent act. But the target balances it out. You&#x27;d be like Omar in The Wire executing Rip&amp;Runs on drug dealers.<p>Last, as a publisher myself, this sort of thing wouldn&#x27;t worry me. I&#x27;m sure one of our authors has passed plagiarism by us, but there&#x27;s no way we ware willful infringers. We pass articles through plagiarism checkers, respond immediately to reports, ban authors, etc. What makes this whole idea work is that there are companies now who made plagiarism core to their business strategy. They aren&#x27;t necessarily wrong to do this since there aren&#x27;t any forces, legal or social, which seem to be punishing them."],"time":["2020-02-24 00:29:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dt3ft"],"id":[22398871],"kids":{},"parent":[22397720],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;20-things.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;20-things.com<\/a> - not counting on it to become anything, but as a learning sideproject, I&#x27;m glad I spent so much time developing it."],"time":["2020-02-23 20:18:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hermitcrab"],"id":[22399835],"kids":{},"parent":[22397720],"text":["I wrote up an analysis of 13 failed commercial software products here:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;successfulsoftware.net&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;27&#x2F;learning-lessons-from-13-failed-software-products&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;successfulsoftware.net&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;27&#x2F;learning-lessons-f...<\/a>\nit is from 2010, but I think it still pretty relevant.\n(TL:DR mostly a lack of market or marketing)"],"time":["2020-02-23 23:01:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brlewis"],"id":[22400305],"kids":[22402631,22400593,22400914],"parent":[22397720],"text":["First I&#x27;ll explain what I mean by &quot;failed&quot;.

It is way too big of a project for a single person. In the past in its simplified version(it started as a shopping cart software back in the day) I was betting on the fact that I can overcome money with time, which I had plenty of(still do). But you see, 10 years later, I am still not done. I took various paths in architecture and it just kept on evolving and finding itself. I reacted to the current state of the markets and tech and so it go me to where I am right now - massive concept where time no longer suffices. So I am currently trying to figure out how to simplify the architecture so it could be made by a single person within a year. So far I am stuck. I would have gave up a long time ago but this is just something I don&#x27;t see being beating with a better idea to do in my spare time. It also served as a learning tool that allowed me to get to be a pro at what I do and earn and live like I do. So I have lost no time by working on this at all.

Not that long ago I inherited a project which on the surface looked shiny and nice. I was however aware that it was a mess underneath. Mind you, I was completely unprepared for the utter crap that awaited me. In all fairness it is the worst thing I have ever seen by light years. It took me two almost 2 weeks to find where a bug was coming from (it was written in a way which no debugger could trace it back, no logs, everything was surprised). After fixing it eventually, I decided to scrap it and build the whole thing from scratch. At the end it took me just over a month (Saturdays and Sundays included) and another 2 weeks from another developer to get a replacement project from an empty file. And here are the two painful truths about the whole endeavour: it took us collectively under two months to build, document, test, and run it in production. A grand total of around 20-30k lines of code. It took the people before us 3 and a half years to make their version which was anti patterns, top to bottom and in those 3 years the company invested around half a million Euros in salaries alone. If argue that this is the most painful thought. Not even the fact that this has been my first weekend this year in which I&#x27;m actually relaxing and not working. So my word of advice-if you end up in a similar situation, scrap everything, do it from scratch. Take a piece of paper, write down the business logic, draw a diagram of the structure of your application around it, pick the most appropriate stack and go for it. Avoid shiny new toys, profile everything and remember that sometimes it&#x27;s better to let an application crash in order to find it&#x27;s weaknesses."],"time":["2020-02-23 20:08:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["angarg12"],"id":[22398920],"kids":[22399085],"parent":[22398426],"text":["A colleague told me an anecdote tangentially related.<p>He was working on a service and managed to hack together some code that barely worked.

The book&#x27;s philosophy is to be like Athena, not Ares. You don&#x27;t want bloodlust, but you do want to be just aggressive enough to win conflicts, and yet not put others off. The solution to many conflicts is not just confrontation, but things like alliances and other unconventional warfare. Sometimes you want to win wars without firing a shot. You have boxing training, and learning to be patient while being punched in the face lends you to more options.<p>The first chapter&#x2F;strategy is to Declare War. It&#x27;s good to let go of grudges. But sometimes, something is just getting in the way, slowly chipping away at you. You have to commit to a war until you either win or lose. You shouldn&#x27;t just try to win a single battle, but rather win or lose several battles in a sequence where you wouldn&#x27;t have to fight any more battles. Sometimes you just want to establish yourself as a porcupine and discourage them from bullying you.<p>On a slightly different path is The 50th Law, also by Robert Greene, which is an annotated biography of 50 Cent, and how he built a persona to survive in a violent world.<p>There&#x27;s training that could help you too.

I don&#x27;t like it, but I wanted to learn about it.  There is something important to understand about fighting (which I assume you already know): hardly anybody wins a fight without getting hit at least once.  Fighting is as much about getting hit as it is about hitting.  So if you want to fight, you either need to want to hit someone so badly that you don&#x27;t care about being hit, or you need to be the kind of person who kind of likes being hit.<p>Most aggressive people I know are aggressive because it suits them.  They have very high stress tolerances.  If you get in a conversation with them, they will simply turn up the stress levels until everybody else drops out.  Then they win.  Sun Tsu said, never stand on dying ground.  What that means is that if you are losing hit points faster than your opponent, all they have to do is to stand there until you die.  You have already lost.<p>Asking your boxing instructor for advice is not necessarily the best place to go.  Every person has strengths and weaknesses.  A boxer needs to be able to stand in a place where they can&#x27;t run away.  Then they fight another person.  The only way to win is to make sure that the other person is losing hit points faster than you are.  You must be aggressive.<p>A ninja, on the other hand will simply hide outside your window until you are asleep and then kill you with a poison blow dart (totally made that up, BTW -- I don&#x27;t think ninjas actually did that, but you get the point).  If it doesn&#x27;t look like it will work out, they will run away and kill you another way.  Aggression is not necessary.<p>People who are successful with aggressive strategies will usually advise aggressive strategies.  Boxers and other sports oriented martial arts practitioners intentionally choose a system of engagement that enforces their preferred strategies.  I always loved listening to people talking about martial arts and saying, &quot;Well, in a real fight, that wouldn&#x27;t work.  Your martial art is so crap.&quot;  I&#x27;d always be thinking, &quot;Well in a real fight, I&#x27;d be running away so fast that you&#x27;d never, ever catch me&quot;.  I mean, I&#x27;m a <i>very<\/i> fast runner (true fact: For my black belt exam they sent 20 people after me to help me understand that you can&#x27;t win every fight.  I ran away.  Apparently I was the first person to try that approach).<p>I&#x27;m going to hazard a guess that you actually don&#x27;t have a problem with aggression.  You have a problem with winning.  Similar to aggression, there are people who will simply turn up the heat until they bake everyone else out.  You say that you don&#x27;t work in a horrible politics-only corporation.  This says to me that you don&#x27;t like dealing with people stealthily stabbing each other in the back to get what they want.  If you start playing the politics game, there will be someone who will think, &quot;Yay!  Another play partner for me to crush&quot;.  And they will make your life a living hell -- because they can either generate that hell at an incredible rate, or they can tolerate any hell that you can throw back at them (and may even enjoy it).<p>No matter what strategy you pick to win, there will be someone who <i>loves<\/i> that strategy and who is willing to go just that little bit farther than you are.  They are willing to put up with just that little bit more than you are.  Just so they can win.<p>Imagine that there are 6 people.  A guest comes by and drops off 5 cupcakes.  Oh!  Not enough.  One person may think, &quot;I won&#x27;t have one.  Then there will be enough&quot;.  Another person may think, &quot;I&#x27;d better rush to get a cupcake or else I won&#x27;t get one&quot;. And yet another one will simply walk up and take all 5 cupcakes.  &quot;Each of us had an equal chance to get all five of these cupcakes.  You guys were just too slow.  This is the only fair method of distribution&quot;, they will say as they devour <i>all of the cupcakes<\/i>.<p>It is not aggression that wins the cupcakes.  It&#x27;s being a jerk.  It&#x27;s being willing to go just that little bit further.  It&#x27;s being willing to tolerate the stares and arguments.  It&#x27;s being able to confidently reply to any complaint, &quot;Well, you are just mad because you are a loser&quot;.<p>And you know what...

I had kids.  I wish I were kidding.  Children love to exercise their defiance and sometimes they simply ignore you repeatedly.  Aggression is a natural response and somethings it speaks more loudly than volume or words and when aggression is in full blossom children no longer claim ignorance though they don&#x27;t always end their defiance.<p>Having and managing children in combination with the time limitations of balancing a military career with a corporate programming career has taught me professional confrontation with minimal words.  In most cases a 1 word answer is enough and preferrable: <i>yes<\/i> or more commonly <i>no<\/i>.  Some people might find that offensive when I provide a one word answer to their 20 minute question, but I don&#x27;t care. When I am trying to make a point and people want to play fuck fuck games I will ask a question repeatedly until the other person distills their answer down to a single word.  There is absolutely no reason to develop this communication behavior unless you are consistently short on time and frequently surrounded by nonsense.<p>Counter-intuitively an aggressive posture is good for convincing people to not be in a hurry.  Hurry is an excellent one word answer for <i>panic<\/i> or <i>I have absolutely no idea what I&#x27;m doing but I want to look important<\/i>.  I have never heard this expressed so eloquently as I have from dumb Army guys: <i>slow is smooth, smooth is fast<\/i>.  In other words don&#x27;t hurry, but instead be deliberate, plan, conduct rehearsals, and make fewer mistakes.  You will get done much faster.  Unfortunately, the corporate is completely lost on this concept.<p>When you need to express aggression in writing... don&#x27;t.  Treat it like sarcasm and don&#x27;t put it in writing where its value will be lost and the result is only confusion.  Save aggression for face-to-face communication only, particularly in front of a group if you have leadership responsibility.  Even then its only the appearance of aggression that is important and only when a situation demands it.  If it becomes common people will learn to ignore it and you.  In writing its best to be immediately confrontational, but phrase it in a way that sounds helpful.  An example: <i>What do you need from me to publish those documents today?<\/i>.  You are phrasing a pointed command with a specific deadline as a kind suggestion to volunteer some assistance.<p>If still you wish to be assertive, not aggressive, in a personal confrontation do so because your opinion is important for health of the organization.  Do not do so because you are dumb blunt weapon to beat somebody with.  The goal is to push things forward and prevent selfish people distracting others with their foolishness.<p>If you must exercise aggression or confrontation do not ever make it passive.  People will view this as cowardly or untrustworthy.  You should always be trying to build stronger and positive relationships and nothing will burn down those bridges faster than cowards lighting torches to hurt the organization.  Always strive for the moral high-ground with directness, clarity, and brevity.

This is what I primarily worked on, along with being responsible for making sure NFL.com was accessible, and working on the build&#x2F;test&#x2F;deploy pipeline for NFL.com and the NFL.com App (which is react-native). 1.5 years ago my boss and I left and joined System1.<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of the website was farmed out to contractors, so we weren’t given too much business support to really push some of these open source projects forward and give them the same level of &quot;marketing sparkle&quot; that a company like Facebook would encourage. For example, part of me was STOKED to see NextJs come out, because it was a better version of react-wildcat. But to be honest part of me felt like with that extra level of marketing sparkle react-wildcat could have been what NextJs was built on to begin with.<p>I don&#x27;t really fault NFL for this because these projects didn&#x27;t drive any revenue. Also the way NFL.com&#x27;s business model worked didn&#x27;t really give engineering a &quot;wedge&quot; to increase profits, so engineers were all considered a cost center. E.g. at most adtech or publishing companies you can write a few lines of ad related code and prove revenue increased in an A&#x2F;B test 24 hours later. NFL had no problem selling ads directly because of how amazing their brand is, so fancier code wouldn&#x27;t really make a difference.<p>Also career-wise I learned even though I got to touch decently high profile open source projects like React Helmet, React GPT, and React Metrics, it didn&#x27;t really transition to any benefit in job interviews. Before leaving NFL I interviewed at top FANG level companies and got rejected at the phone screen. Even non-FANG companies didn&#x27;t really seem to care. Keep doing those leetcode problems kids!<p>Most of the original team members from that era of the NFL have moved on to different companies after it became pretty clear that more and more work was going to become outsourced. I got lucky and really clicked with my boss at the NFL, so when he left I tagged along and fumbled (no pun intended) into an absolutely excellent opportunity at System1.

Lots of logs. We tried to use Splunk to get some insight from those. It kinda worked and their sales team initially quoted a high-but-reasonable price for licensing. When we were ready to move forward, the price of the license doubled because they had missed the deadline for their end of quarter sales quota. So we kicked Splunk to the curb.<p>Having seen that the bulk of our log volume was noise and that we really only cared about a few small numbers, I looked for a metrics solution at this point, not a logs solution. I&#x27;d operated RRDtool based systems at previous companies, and that worked okay, but I didn&#x27;t love the idea of doing that again. I had seen Etsy&#x27;s blog about statsd and setup a statsd+carbon+graphite instance on a single server just to try out and get feedback from the rest of the engineering team. The team very quickly took to Graphite and started instrumenting various codebases and systems to feed metrics into statsd.<p>statsd hit capacity problems first, as it was a single threaded nodejs process and used UDP for ingest, so once it approached 100% CPU utilization, events got dropped. We switched to statsite, which is pretty much a drop-in replacement written in C.<p>The next issue was disk I&#x2F;O. This was not a surprise. Carbon (Graphite&#x27;s storage daemon) stores each metric in a separate file in the whisper format, which is similar to RRDtool&#x27;s files, but implemented in pure Python and generally a bit easier to interact with. We&#x27;d expected that a large volume of random write ops on a spinning disk would eventually be a problem. We ordered some SSDs. This worked okay for a while.<p>At this point, the dispatch system was instrumented to store metrics under keys with a lot of dimensions, so that we could generate per-city, per-process, per-handler charts for debugging and performance optimization. While very useful for drilling down to the cause of an issue, this led to an almost exponential growth in the number of unique metrics we were ingesting. I setup carbon-relay to shard the storage across a few servers- I think there were three, but it was a long time ago. We never really got carbon-relay working well. It didn&#x27;t handle backend outages and network interruptions very well, and would sometimes start leaking memory and crash, seemingly without reason. It limped along for a while, but wasn&#x27;t going to be a long-term solution.<p>We started looking for alternatives to carbon, as we wanted to get away from whisper files... SSDs were still fairly expensive, and we believed that we should be able to store an append-only dataset on spinning disks and do batch sequential writes. The infrastructure team was still fairly small and we didn&#x27;t have the resources to properly maintain a HBase cluster for OpenTSDB or a Cassandra cluster, which would&#x27;ve required adapting carbon- I understand that Cassandra is a supported backend these days, but it was just an idea on a mailing list at that point.<p>InfluxDB looked like exactly what we wanted, but it was still in a very early state, as the company had just been formed weeks earlier. I submitted some bug reports but was eventually told by one of the maintainers that it wasn&#x27;t ready yet and I should quit bugging them so they could get to MVP.<p>Right around this time, we started having serious availability issues with metrics, both on the storage side- I estimated we were dropping about 60% of incoming statsd events, and on the query side- Graphite would take seconds-to-minutes to render some charts and occasionally would just time out. We had also built an ad-hoc system for generating Nagios checks that would poll Graphite every minute to trigger threshold-based alerts, which would make noise if Graphite was down and the monitored system was not. This led to on-call fatigue, which made everybody unhappy.<p>We started running an instance of statsite on every server which would aggregate the individual events for that server into 10 second buckets with the server&#x27;s hostname as a key prefix, then pushed those to carbon-relay. This solved the dropped packets issue, but carbon-relay was still unreliable.<p>We were pretty entrenched in the statsd+graphite way of doing things at this point, so switching to OpenTSDB wasn&#x27;t really an option and we&#x27;d exhausted all of the existing carbon alternatives, so we started thinking about modifying carbon to use another datastore. The scope of this project was large enough that it wasn&#x27;t going to get built in a matter of days or weeks, so we needed a stopgap solution to buy time and keep the metrics flowing while we engineered a long term solution.<p>I hacked together statsrelay, which is basically a re-implementation of carbon-relay in C, using libev. At this point, I was burned out and handed off the metrics infrastructure to a few teammates that ran with statsrelay and turned it into a production quality piece of code. Right around the same time, we&#x27;d begun hiring for an engineering team in NYC that would take over responsibility for metrics infrastructure. These are the people that eventually designed and built M3DB."],"time":["2020-02-22 20:53:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ksec"],"id":[22392638],"kids":[22393183],"parent":[22391270],"text":["How does it compare to TimescaleDB [1] ?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timescale.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timescale.com<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-22 20:01:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jmakov"],"id":[22392085],"kids":[22392362],"parent":[22391270],"text":["So how does this compare to e.g. Clickhouse?"],"time":["2020-02-22 18:16:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MichaelRazum"],"id":[22392040],"kids":[22393417],"parent":[22391270],"text":["Ok everything open source was not good enough.

So the process of development involves a shifting discovery of new aspects of the domain as things which were unconscious become consciously learned.<p>The other aspect of complexity is the technology applied to the problem. Computer technology is inherently complex, and the imperfect mapping between domain problems and technology adds a third angle.<p>The best books I&#x27;ve seen for dealing with these problems are &quot;Clean Architecture,&quot; &quot;A Philosophy of Software Design,&quot; and &quot;Principles of Product Development Flow.&quot; The first two explain how to build good systems that encapsulate complexity and are geared towards changeability. Such systems are flexible as new aspects of domain complexity are discovered over time. The latter book takes a higher level view of how to design projects to cope with the discovery process in a way that is economically viable and justifiable to the people financing projects, and also in a way that arranges work so that developers can actually be productive and not become swamped by the complexity problem or bad processes and practices."],"time":["2020-02-22 19:50:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Gibbon1"],"id":[22390358],"kids":{},"parent":[22382536],"text":["&gt; As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned.<p>Ditty of mine from around 1988 or so.

Your job creating software is not to meet the requirements, it&#x27;s not to change and add stuff as the requirements change. That&#x27;s viewing the work, once again, as requirements-driven. No matter what your process or paperwork, the work is ultimately user-driven, not requirements-driven. Your job is to scope a domain, anticipate change in that domain, and provide easy-to-use configurable software that anticipates that change. You do that by knowing the users and the work, not by reading requirements or responding to updated requirements. That kind of thinking removes the key piece of the entire work, the user.

Instead, more and more everything has some unique tech stack, a byzantine testing and deployment deployment system, the entire thing fun of tons of complex one-of code everywhere ... then we stick on new features one at a time every time there&#x27;s something a user wants that it doesn&#x27;t have.

Writing code on paper&#x2F;whiteboard is completely different from a text editor.<p>Just think about how you write code.  You write a few lines.  Run it in your head.  Notice a mistake, add a newline, remove some brackets and it&#x27;s all good.  Oh wait, you just noticed this can be simplified.  Ctrl-A delete all, reduce entire 20 line function into 5 lines.<p>None of this is possible on paper&#x2F;whiteboard, especially in a timed interview setting.  Paper&#x2F;whiteboard is effectively immutable.  You get one chance to write it down correctly and that&#x27;s it.  There&#x27;s just no time and it&#x27;s too difficult to even add a newline somewhere.<p>So you put a 20 year programming veteran in front of the whiteboard and they can&#x27;t do fizzbuzz because writing code like that is so foreign to what they do.  They can&#x27;t just write something and fine tune it, which is how software is written. It must be perfect on the first try.  they freeze up and fail.<p>There is zero excuse for companies to not give a laptop for interview coding.  Even if it&#x27;s Linux boot CD with nothing but vim and nano, that&#x27;s still so much better than whiteboards.  And these days companies use hackerrank during the phone screen.

I interview other SDEs. I ask them problem solving coding questions, algorithmic coding questions, data structure questions, and whiteboard architectural design (not at the same time, but it could be any of these)<p>2) Our process is REQUIRED for a company of my size. You would not believe the amount of candidates we get. We have a high bar for hiring, but fundamentally we have to be efficient with our time. That completely removes as an option superior interviewing techniques like &quot;spend a day with the dev team working on a small real task&quot; or &quot;do this take home test over the weekend and then the interviewing team will review it with you&quot;.  Both of these are better at uncovering good candidates than a whiteboard coding interview, but don&#x27;t scale, and are themselves controversial in the industry from candidates who are unhappy of the time they require.<p>3) A common criticism of &quot;algorithmic&quot; questions (leetcode) is that they don&#x27;t reflect the reality of day to day work. If a lot of people even at FAANG are working on typical 3-tier front-end-back-end-database systems, utilizing the tools and systems other employees built before, why bother evaluating if the candidates could build the next generation of such systems if asked.<p>Because once these people are inside the company, we&#x27;d like to think that everyone passed a similar tech bar. That means that if a new database or distributed system does need to be purpose built for a high scale system, and someone applies internally, you can be flexible with the kind of interviewing process you put an internal transfer through - you already know they passed a high technical bar, and are likely qualified to work on the hard stuff.<p>4) another common misconception is people underestimate the complexity of &quot;typical&quot; systems inside the FAANGs of the world - compared to their prior job experiences. A payment processing integration at Amazon scale is not a payment processing integration at your company&#x27;s scale. An internal CRM build at Google scale is not an internal CRM build at your company&#x27;s scale.<p>The 10,000 foot view is similar, but the expectation would be that the system would be 1&#x2F; built out faster, 2&#x2F; built out better, and 3&#x2F; scale better than a comparable project on a less technically strong company.<p>5) Coming back to the interview process. What that means, is that when we ask a candidate to solve a hard algorithmic problem on a whiteboard in 20 minutes, or deep dive into the inner workings of a complex data structure, or show how they could combine multiple data structures to solve one problem, we are not validating &quot;Can this candidate write an algorithm in 20 minutes on the job at their desk&quot;<p>What we&#x27;re checking is &quot;Can this candidate do something really hard, ambiguous, and time-sensitive in the Computer Science domain, when prompted to.&quot;  The real life challenges will be different, but if they CAN do the first one, they&#x27;ll likely be able to do the second one.<p>Of course we miss out on candidates who are terrible at these skills, or can&#x27;t code on a whiteboard, or are overwhemled by the interview stress and can&#x27;t perform. But we are willing to do that because of Point (2) above. We&#x27;d rather say no to a &quot;maybe&quot; candidate than hire someone who can&#x27;t perform.<p>Despite what people state that ability with algorithmic performance on a whiteboard does not translate to on the job success, that is not my experience. Remember - I&#x27;m not looking to see if a person can spit out A* search algo on a whiteboard from memory.<p>I&#x27;m looking to see how they approach a problem they haven&#x27;t seen before, how they break it down, what kind of assumptions they make, what ways they simplify it, how they consider ideas and tradeoffs, and finally how their ideas translate to code (fluently or not)<p>6) The majority of people I see cannot execute that last paragraph well enough to join a team at my company and be productive. Sorry, hackernews readers, but that&#x27;s just the case. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;can&#x27;t solve fizzbuzz&quot; level of incompetence - these are good engineers who are likely stars at their smaller companies, and who can be relied upon to get the job done. But they would not thrive at a FAANG-level company because they lack some ability - either clarity&#x2F;coherence of thought, or ability to understand their techncial domain in depth enough, or because they just aren&#x27;t fluent at translating ideas into code.<p>edit2:<p>7) All this to say...if you&#x27;re not FAANG++(Dropbox, Salesforce, etc I don&#x27;t know)....stop copying us.

It is likely that the reforms of the 1970s broke the US [0] and if it wasn&#x27;t them then something changed (maybe access to cheap oil, maybe other nations recovering from WWII) that really broke the environment where the US understood how to be successful. The US has to ask itself how effective its &#x27;capitalist economic system&#x27; really is.<p>* It has a higher tax:GDP than China [1]. That is to say, the nominal ratio of money siphoned into government vs money retained by private citizens is less free than China&#x27;s. There isn&#x27;t really a point of comparison here because the two countries are so different (eg, China has state ownership) but there is some shock value in just how large the US government is in the economic sphere.<p>* It has socialised access to capital. Large banks have the power to create new money and the US government steps in during crisises to pick winners and losers when the lenders are proven to be incompetent at taking risks (eg, 2008 era). China does this too, but the battle becomes which government is more astute at supporting bad risks rather than which system is more effective. China is probably more long-term strategic, using the money to build useless infrastructure instead of the US using money to uselessly boost asset prices.

This is done by thinking of the full distribution as if it were its average.  In this case, the pot is distributed using a pull from a uniform random distribution: The assets of a pair are combined into a pot, and a number, s, from 0 to 1 is drawn.  One person gets s of the pot.  The other gets 1 - s.  On average, s = .5.  When s = .5, the Gini coefficient of the pair after the transaction is zero.  Their pair of assets are equal.  As ABS(s) approaches 1.0, their inequality becomes larger.  For example, in Russian Roulette, s is either 0 or 1.  With p = the portion of the pot that came from one person, then, when ABS(s - 0.5) &gt; ABS(p - 0.5), the transaction increases inequality.  When s is a constant 0.5, every transaction will either reduce inequality or maintain the perfect equality.  The system increases inequality in the population until it matches the inequality in the pool from which s is pulled.  There&#x27;s nothing surprising there unless you make a simplifying assumption that s = 0.5, the average of its distribution.  Using this simulation to model economic systems comes down to choosing a distribution for s: whatever you choose, that&#x27;s what you get.  UNIFORM(0.49,0.51) will result in lots of equality.

Data Engineering touches more aspects of your engineering projects than most people think. Curious what this crowd has to say about my idea here. Also, I&#x27;m looking for work. If you like my thoughts, hit me up.<p>I think there are 4 buckets of data engineering problems, each with their own challenges and solutions.<p>Operational Data Engineering\nThis is the detritus that grows like weeds as parts of other projects and often isn&#x27;t recognized as a data engineering problem. We need to pull a file off an FTP server or hit an API and do something with it. Next thing you know, there are dozens of these little things that are not individually hard, but having visibility into dependency trees and failure cases becomes difficult because they are spread out everywhere and it&#x27;s not obvious where to look when things go wrong. Tools like Apache Airflow are a good solution even if you don&#x27;t use them in other ways because they can centralize monitoring, logging, and graphs. Scaling isn&#x27;t resource intensive for these tasks because they are discrete. You can fan out. The scaling challenge for this type of data engineering is really about tending your garden and keeping things coherently organized.<p>Business Logic Data Engineering\nThis is processing where the data is highly structured and sometimes even ordered or sequenced. It&#x27;s hard to scale because you can&#x27;t just throw things into a stream and apply multiple workers. You have to have a managed process and likely shared in-memory state that collects the worker results and applies strict rules to a process. This is the opposite problem from big data. It&#x27;s small data, rigidly organized, and carefully managed.<p>Data Science Data Engineering\nThis is sort of classic ETL with a twist. ETL systems are typically pretty static once the E, T, and L are known quantities. But working with Data Scientists requires that your pipelines have to be pretty flexible because scientists are doing experiments. But they also have to be repeatable and comparable, which means your pipeline has to maintain version. This is also the area where you are most likely to encounter Big Data, so you have to be prepared to change your mental model and be able to use tools like Hadoop and Spark to bring compute to where your data is.<p>Analytics Data Engineering\nThis is classic ETL pipelines that move data from point A to data lakes or data warehouses. The key thing to understand here is what you are modeling at the endpoint. If it&#x27;s a legit data warehouse, you are modeling business processes. If you aren&#x27;t doing that, you are--by definition--pushing data to a lake. Understanding your endpoint is key to choosing your reporting and analytics tools to lay on top of your data source. Data lakes are a good use case for ad-hoc, SQL-driven reporting tools like MetaBase.

There is a large community of mathematicians out there who simply cannot join these communities because the learning curve is too high and much of the documentation is written for computer scientists.<p>&gt; 2. Even if a mathematician battles their way into one of these communities, there is a risk that they will not find the kind of mathematics which they are being taught, or teaching, in their own department, and there is a very big risk that they will not find much fashionable mathematics.<p>&gt; My explicit question to all the people in these formal proof verification communities is: what are you doing about this?<p>I think many of the formal proof verification communities are trying to address these. I will focus on Metamath, especially its set.mm database that focuses on classical logic + ZFC ( <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.metamath.org&#x2F;mpeuni&#x2F;mmset.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.metamath.org&#x2F;mpeuni&#x2F;mmset.html<\/a> ), but much of the following applies to all of them.<p>I think the main problem is that too many mathematicians expect computer systems to have all the capabilities of a well-trained graduate mathematician. Yet the problem is hard. Computers are much better at some things (they don&#x27;t get bored or sleepy), and humans are much better at other things (seeing the big picture &amp; having insights into how to combine &quot;unrelated&quot; ideas). Much would be better if the formalization and traditional mathematics communities had more &quot;meetings of the minds&quot; &amp; communication in general.<p>Focusing on these questions:<p>1. The high learning curve is true for all systems, that&#x27;s true. To be fair, mathematics has a high learning curve, you don&#x27;t learn how to do it in a week. The problem is that although tools are very good at <i>verifying<\/i> formalized proofs, they are not great at coming up with the proofs themselves. I do agree that the documentation could be improved so &quot;non computer scientists&quot; could do things more easily. I think much of what&#x27;s needed is for traditional mathematicians to engage with the formalization community, to make it clearer what&#x27;s missing. There also needs to be work (and funding) on improved tooling, which implies a need for more funding (I&#x27;ll discuss that below).<p>2. &quot;They will not find much fashionable mathematics.&quot; There&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem here. It takes a while to get proofs up to the &quot;basics&quot; of mathematics as expected by people work on &quot;fashionable&quot; mathematics. Here I think the solution is to have many people working to build up those basics. Take a look at my visualization of Metamath set.mm; note that it took many years for it to build up, and only when many people joined did it start seriously growing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XC1g8FmFcUU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XC1g8FmFcUU<\/a><p>The <i>real<\/i> bottom line is that there really needs to be more funding on tools &amp; formalized systems. Metamath isn&#x27;t funded at all to my knowledge. Lean and Coq have some funding, but nothing like the funding of many other fields. We should be impressed about how far they&#x27;ve come in spite of that.<p>A broader problem is that mathematicians typically accept a proof if a paper <i>seems<\/i> to be okay to another mathematician. When the math and proofs were simpler, that was probably fine, and since computers weren&#x27;t very capable that&#x27;s all we could do anyway. But today&#x27;s math (and proofs) are far more complex, and it&#x27;s becoming absurd to leave that as our standard of proof.

By formalizing it to that level, we will substantially increase our intellectual powers and make vast new fields tractable for formal reasoning, which also makes them tractable for programming.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether the beauty-contest winner will be LEAN (as Buzzard is promoting in this blog post), Metamath, or what.

If I tried writing a text without using the internet, I&#x27;d be very limited in what I can write and how.<p>- I&#x27;m given plenty of time. If there&#x27;s a rush task, the client will ask beforehand if that&#x27;s OK with me and pay extra. I can write a text in 45 minutes but then the client pays extra. The clients acknowledge that I&#x27;m existing in the real world where I might want to have time off, go on a vacation or just have a family or health crisis.<p>- I&#x27;ll be given detailed instructions on how to succeed in my task because that&#x27;s the most desirable outcome.

The articles are so focused on the drug that the associated therapy sessions feel like a neglected footnote.<p>Meanwhile, journalists and internet commenters both ignore the very real risks of framing psychedelics as a DIY miracle cure for people with difficult to treat mental health issues. Before this current phase, the universally accepted advice for psychedelic experimenters was to never use psychedelics if you had underlying mental health issues and to always have a sitter present to monitor and guide your trip. The reframing of psychedelics as a miracle cure has triggered a wave of people ignoring that advice, dosing alone at home without any form of supporting therapy to frame their trips.<p>If you spend some time browsing Reddit, it&#x27;s not hard to find bizarre stories of people triggering week, month, or even year long episodes of worsened depression, derealization, PTSD-like symptoms, or HPPD from psychedelic experimentation. If &quot;big pharma&quot; produced a drug with possible side effects like that, we&#x27;d be hearing a very different story.

Even so, both the company’s property loss and business-interruption loss will be mitigated by substantial insurance recoveries that Lubrizol will receive. But, as the late Paul Harvey was given to saying in his famed radio broadcasts, “Here’s the rest of the story.” One of the largest insurers of Lubrizol was a company owned by...uh,Berkshire.<\/i>&quot;<p>Whoops. I wonder if they&#x27;re going to introduce a policy against such self-insurance?<p>&quot;<i>Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years – even decades – to surface and ripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big One” may come from a traditional source, such as wind or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and they will be big –very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our resources, and we will be eager to add to our business the next day.<\/i>&quot;<p>This is somewhat concerning. Property&#x2F;casualty has been a relatively stable insurance market, as Buffett notes. (Major hurricanes not withstanding. I seem to recall reading that, if life insurance had been more common among gay men when the AIDS epidemic occurred, the life insurance industry would have been bankrupt.)<p>But, there are large-scale new things trundling down the pike. Global climate change, for one. I don&#x27;t know if BH is involved with flood insurance damages, but large regions of the world are likely to be exposed to them that had not been before. There aren&#x27;t any statistics to cover those changes. It&#x27;s gonna be interesting.<p>&quot;<i>Over the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come into being.

Leary, Ram Dass (who was then still Richard Alpert), Ralph Metzner, and others from their group were staying at Millbrook and continuing their research with psylocybin that they&#x27;d started at Harvard when Hollingshead turned up and offered Leary LSD.  Leary at first turned his nose up at LSD, but eventually tried it.<p>Then, Alpert reported, Leary did not speak for days.  Everyone in the group was scared, and Alpert told everyone to stay away from the LSD while they waited for Leary to come back to them.  After five days Leary finally spoke and the first word out of his mouth was &quot;Wow&quot;.  Then they all tried it.<p>I can&#x27;t find it now, but I also remember hearing an episode of the Psychedelic Salon[1] podcast where Lorenzo Hagerty talks about how he came across an old letter of Myron Stolaroff&#x27;s where the latter warned another psychedelic luminary about Hollingshead, calling him a consummate liar and saying that he shouldn&#x27;t be trusted.<p>Incidentally, Stolaroff was deeply hurt by being conned by yet another psychedelic luminary, Al Hubbard, another legendary and mysterious Johnny Appleseed of LSD.<p>Psychedelics certainly do seem to attract tricksters (perhaps because they also attract naive idealists, who are irresistibly ripe pickings for the tricksters).  Hollingshead, Leary, and Hubbard were all tricksters, as was Sasha Shulgin, who was very fond of practical jokes.<p>There was an interesting &quot;psychedelic reunion&quot; between Leary, Hubbard, Humphrey Osmond (who coined the term &quot;psychedelic&quot;), Sidney Cohen and others at Oscar Janiger&#x27;s home in 1979.[2]<p>I found the video of this reunion fascinating because it seemed that all these larger than life psychedelic pioneers, who&#x27;d probably all done psychedelics hundreds if not thousands of times seemed quite ordinary, uncomfortable, unenlightened, and even gruff and sour to one another.<p>For instance, Leary seemed to desperately need to be the center of attention and Hubbard seemed extraordinarily uncomfortable and taciturn while Leary needled him.  Later I learned that Hubbard absolutely detested Leary.  That explained it, and provided evidence (if any more was needed) that psychedelics didn&#x27;t inevitably turn people in to saints or enlightened beings who love everyone and who&#x27;s feathers couldn&#x27;t be ruffled by anything.<p>A couple other interesting recordings were the &quot;Lone Pine Stories&quot; with Myron Stolaroff [3], where he talks about being given LSD for the first time by Hubbard, and a Q&amp;A session[4] by Stolaroff and Gary Fisher, who&#x27;d treated schizophrenic children with LSD.[5]<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psychedelicsalon.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;people&#x2F;myron-stolaroff&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psychedelicsalon.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;people&#x2F;myron-stolaroff...<\/a><p>[2] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U-sfDEEcMQ8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U-sfDEEcMQ8<\/a><p>[3] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mMZ-oopMBog&amp;list=PLCB4ED9E989E17EF6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mMZ-oopMBog&amp;list=PLCB4ED9E98...<\/a><p>[4] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qMUO0dP77rI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qMUO0dP77rI<\/a><p>[5] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maps.org&#x2F;news-letters&#x2F;v07n3&#x2F;07318fis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maps.org&#x2F;news-letters&#x2F;v07n3&#x2F;07318fis.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-22 19:57:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rwallace"],"id":[22393758],"kids":[22393885],"parent":[22375796],"text":["&gt; Based on the recent observation, LIGO scientists estimate that these heavy pairings should be almost as common as the lighter binary star systems that astronomers have been studying for decades.

We worked with a lot of hiring partners to create a UX curriculum that would be easiest to jump into a first UX career from, and it was clear in doing that research that a <i>research-first<\/i> perspective with less emphasis on design is what would get students hired faster in a field that can be notoriously difficult to break into (relative to software engineering).

Usually it’s not split like that - there’s always an outlier student or two but not half totally happy and half frustrated, so we started to dig in.<p>Two things happened:<p>1. We realized half of the students were expecting a design-heavy experience, and we hadn’t communicated well enough what to expect. There were pieces on design, but you wouldn’t come out of this curriculum as a UI designer, and students were expecting that.<p>2. We decided to try and help those students who wanted the UI emphasis, hired more folks, and started creating curriculum in a pretty rushed manner to help them reach their goals. In retrospect that was a huge mistake; there simply wasn’t enough time to build a full design-heavy curriculum in flight, and the students who wanted design-heavy curriculum were very disappointed.<p>That cohort was (rightly) frustrated because we tried to do too much too late. I recognized that was a risk going into those curriculum changes, but took on the risk because the most important thing is making students successful and happy. In retrospect it was the wrong call.<p>I wish like hell that I could go back and make everything perfect for that cohort of students; there are about 20 of them and I’ve spent time one on one with every one.
