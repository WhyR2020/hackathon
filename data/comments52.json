As you can see we&#x27;ve built in the ability to gracefully handle a lot of traffic but it&#x27;s not ideal because you need to wait in a queue until we have enough capacity. So I wanted to jump on here and give you an update of a release we&#x27;re putting out next week.<p>FastOrSlow does actual browser simulations from around 12 locations around the world. When we first architected it, we wanted to provide as many locations as possible including places like South Africa. That meant in some cases we needed actual bare-metal servers. So we built it on bare metal in data centers around the world.<p>We experienced some moderate popularity about a month ago and realized we needed to do a better job of scaling on demand. So we re-evaluated moving on to AWS. Around the same time AWS launched in Cape Town and a few other locations, and so we were able to get the kind of coverage we wanted globally.<p>So we kicked off an AWS migration. We&#x27;re days away from moving into AWS and using spot instances to ramp up and down fast based on demand. But as I said, you caught us by surprise.<p>So please give FastOrSlow a try today, but know that by around late next week we&#x27;ll be doing a much better job of handling your requests FAST without having to wait in line.<p>Thanks for your interest and patience.

From at least the time of de Moivre, around 1740, the problem of estimating an accurate true value from multiple differing measurements was recognized in its own right as a problem.  By 1810, Gauss and Laplace had discovered the basics of statistical estimation, the form of the normal distribution, results including the central limit theorem, and regression techniques such as non-linear weighted least squares.  Now, almost 200 years later, the problem still exists, and is being worked on in various forms and circumstances.<p>To give a simple example, take 1000 frames of well-exposed video of a still scene, with constant illumination, and constant exposure settings on the camera.  Now try to estimate how many photons, within a constant multiplicative factor, are coming from each point in the scene.  Most of the measurements will show a normal distribution, but at the extremes of exposure, something more complex is going on (perhaps to do with sensor non-linearity, censored sampling, or something else).  This is one of the basic theoretical problems in HDR imaging, and is an active area research (i.e. unsolved, as of today).<p>It&#x27;s very hard to get past that paragraph -- which is the first one in answer to the question &quot;why?&quot;."],"time":["2020-05-09 08:12:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nobrains"],"id":[23123018],"kids":{},"parent":[23118309],"text":["So, in an atom, how much volume does the electron cloud occupy?

I&#x27;m genuinely asking.<p>My theory is that this is a good example of why HN discourages editorializing in titles. The current title here (&quot;Stack Overflow reduces global workforce by approximately 15%&quot;) sets you up to think that this is a layoff announcement by SO. But from reading the first paragraph, I think this is just an externally-facing quarterly update on the business overall. I suspect that nothing about the layoffs here was news to anyone in the company, and they had plenty of internal communications around it already. And even here, the language about layoffs seems fine to me:<p><i>This has been a tough week at Stack Overflow, and taking care of each other is more important than ever right now. Like companies large and small, we have had to make difficult choices in order to reflect the market conditions. This week, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 15%. Most of the affected employees were furloughed, except for employees and contractors in regions where furloughs were unfortunately not an option. These actions primarily affected sales and customer success teams within our Talent business, which is dependent on the hiring environment.<p>We made these decisions with great care and only after assessing and leveraging all other options. We’ve paused all non-critical hiring, suspended our travel budget for all of Q2 and Q3, and cut marketing and software costs significantly.<p>Reducing our headcount was a painful but necessary decision, of no fault of the employees affected, and one that I take full accountability for as the CEO. We did this in order to ensure that we can serve our customers and community in the long-run.<\/i><p>What is the problem with that, specifically?<p>The rest of the post reads like a perfectly normal update, written in a slightly formal tone, which seems appropriate to me. If you&#x27;re running a business with hundreds of employees, tens of thousands of customers, tens of millions of readers, and other stakeholders like partners, vendors, and investors, you probably are going to be a little more formal with your tone. It takes uncommon skill to write the kind of updates that Buffet or Bezos manage to pull off. Just because this is anodyne doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;bullshit&quot; or this guy &quot;incompetent&quot; or &quot;an asshole&quot;.<p>Can someone point out anything specific that they found so off-putting about this quarterly update on the business?"],"time":["2020-05-08 14:09:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cosmodisk"],"id":[23113724],"kids":{},"parent":[23111523],"text":["I could probably understand why they did this,as hiring will be non existent for the upcoming months,but pages upon pages of BS about core values,culture, viruses,and whatever else comes along just left bad taste in my mouth."],"time":["2020-05-08 13:54:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sebleon"],"id":[23112757],"kids":{},"parent":[23111523],"text":["For a second, I thought this title claimed that stack overflow reduces the need for software engineers by 15%.

We&#x27;ll see it first in interest payments to finance the federal government rising and eventually forcing cuts to entitlements and defense spending.<p>This would appear to set up a situation in which the Fed will try to err on the side of &quot;caution&quot; - adding too much rather than too little liquidity into the economy.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that the Fed always gets what it wants in the end.<p>See:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;global-dollar-short-squeeze&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;global-dollar-short-squeeze&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-08 18:14:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vikramkr"],"id":[23114525],"kids":[23114626,23114622,23114785,23114772],"parent":[23114286],"text":["To preempt the apparently inevitable &quot;wow stocks went up on this news why wall street be like that&quot; posts : the reason futures are up currently and the market will be up when they open in a but is because this is better than expected.

I&#x27;ve seen front ends built using a myriad of techniques and frameworks.<p>Leaving bytes and bundle weight aside, in 2020 JS frameworks like React are far and away the best approach for front-end engineering from a large organizational standpoint.<p>1)Not difficult to hire for. JS frameworks are currently in the sweet spot where they&#x27;re both widely popular and &quot;cool&quot;. Consequently it&#x27;s not hard to find good candidates. That wasn&#x27;t the case 5 years ago where React&#x2F;Angular developers were still uncommon.<p>2) The HUGE and helpful community of developers. There are so many excellent resources for learning and solving problems with JS frameworks. JS developers are eager to show off on medium and similar sites. I&#x27;ve never seen such a large and enthusiastic community. This will inevitably subside as JS fall out of favor but I hope it doesn&#x27;t for a long time.<p>2)Rapid UI development.

For one, genetic diversity in life is critical for survival given diversification means at least a few strands can survive sudden unexpected events. i.e if everything were giant dinosaurs there may have been no life left after the dinosaur extinction. The other answer is that we are pre-built to aesthetically enjoy thriving nature (which is probably meant to drive us towards protecting genetic diversity).<p>However given the human backlash to human trashing the environment, I could easily see us settling on an equilibrium where life is not, at least for the most part, the kind of wild chaotic world that it was before us, but a world where the environment is increasingly managed to some degrees by humans. You see this as nations getting richer stop eating cats, dogs, care more about preserving the environment, raising better treated wildlife, etc.<p>In that case, perhaps humans can help facilitate a new epoch in nature where genetic diversity is not just a biproduct of a random process, but a conscious goal. Granted this would require a much deeper knowledge of nature, humility to know when we can&#x27;t control everything, and a cultural shift towards being stewards of nature. But given the shifts that have already occurred in human thinking around nature, I don&#x27;t think this is outside the realm of possibility.

More specifically, I was not really concerned of how they did their encryption, as long as they did it well, and I had Keybase just in case I needed to encrypt, rather than than actually using it daily like some here.<p>Looking back on my usage of Keybase, I realize that encryption to me is a feature, not a tool or an app. I prefer my conversations encrypted, but I don&#x27;t seek out an app that does it. I would like my files to not be tampered with, but I just kind of assume that&#x27;s the default on Dropbox at el, even if it&#x27;s not.<p>From this view point, it might be a good thing that Zoom acquired Keybase. I would have rather it be Slack or Google or Microsoft, but Zoom will have to do. If they don&#x27;t murder the acquisition right away, there is a chance they turn Zoom and all their future tools into a more secure environment, in which case it&#x27;s a win-win for all."],"time":["2020-05-08 07:06:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kylehotchkiss"],"id":[23102771],"kids":{},"parent":[23102430],"text":["Keybase was cool tech that for years I hoped would find a profit model and more everyday use case.

These are the right people to work on that, the security problems are similar in keybase and zoom, and an outside team with an established track record will help Zoom regain credibility. And Zoom probably had lots of cash on hand to buy whatever they wanted.<p>So that all makes sense. I wouldn&#x27;t expect the keybase product to stick around though.<p>Not because, as other commenters had said &quot;Zoom doesn&#x27;t care about security.&quot; Because they did an acqui-hire to get a team to help them with security, not because they wanted the product. I expect this <i>will<\/i> result in Zoom&#x27;s own security improving, it&#x27;s not some kind of smoke and mirrors trick.
