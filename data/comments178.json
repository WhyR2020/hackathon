When I entered, the sole barber was slumped on a sofa looking at a computer screen. He didn&#x27;t seem particularly happy to have a customer. The shop was messy, a white cat wandered around, and I had to step over a live turtle in a tank on the floor to get to the barber chair.<p>As the barber cut my hair, I asked him about the shop. He said that it was ninety years old—the area had escaped bombing during the war—and that his grandfather and father had run the shop before him.<p>If someone opened a similarly shambolic barbershop today, it would almost certainly fail, as Japanese consumers are picky about appearances. But he said he had a steady clientele, including customers who themselves were the second or third generation in their families to get their hair cut there. He also turned out to be pleasant to chat with, and I had no complaint about the quality of the haircut.<p>The cost of the haircut was on the high side, and as he lives behind the shop in a house he inherited he must have minimal overhead.

There is no end to taxation. Especially because those who are not home owners can force more property taxes on the minority who own it.<p>Put another way..why should someone who can’t handle their personal finances be allowed to make decisions at govt level. This would never happen with employment. How can the unsavvy have-nots have a say about punitive taxation upon the haves who get to gain nothing from the punitive taxes.

The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer.

For example, many Linux system calls return a signed size_t type with either the result or the negated errno constant. When an error occurs, the C library stub function simply negates that value and assigns it to errno which is likely a <i>thread-local<\/i> variable.<p>The C standard library provides many examples of bad design. All the hidden global data, the broken locale handling, the duplication found in so many str* and mem* functions... Freestanding C lacks most of the standard headers and is a better language for it.

This book is fantastic because it will bring your attention to what happens under the hood in a very entertaining way.\nI am not a C programmer nor was trying to become one. Just trying to be familiar with low level programming and computer internals in general. But I enjoyed reading the book a lot. One of the the stories I remember is about the programming contest at Carnegie-Mellon University. The rules were simple that the program had to run as fast as possible and the program had to be written in Pascal or C. Here are some paragraphs extracted from the book about the result. \n“The actual results were very surprising. The fastest program, as reported by the operating system, took minus three seconds. That&#x27;s right—the winner ran in a negative amount of time! The next fastest apparently took just a few milliseconds, while the entry in third place came in just under the expected 10 seconds. Obviously, some devious programming had taken place, but what and how? A detailed scrutiny of the winning programs eventually supplied the answer. The program that apparently ran backwards in time had taken advantage of the operating system. The programmer knew where the process control block was stored relative to the base of the stack. He crafted a pointer to access the process control block and overwrote the &quot;CPU-time-used&quot; field with a very high value. The operating system wasn&#x27;t expecting CPU times that large, and it misinterpreted the very large positive number as a negative number under the two&#x27;s complement scheme. “"],"time":["2020-02-15 06:45:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["makecheck"],"id":[22331997],"kids":{},"parent":[22325088],"text":["Using C as a lowest-common-denominator for game engines makes sense but I do <i>love<\/i> having Objective-C (despite the platform limitations).

Blankenship was in Legion of Doom, which was deeply inside critical computer systems for most of the 80s, including banks, military facilities, telcos, and other vital infrastructure. They published and disseminated how-to guides for infiltrating systems, and they were active on underground BBS systems. Blankenship may have moved away from illicit activities, but he still communicated with the same people, and SJG&#x27;s BBS was swarming with elite hackers.<p>Yeah, the Secret Service should have been savvy enough to figure out that it was a harmless game, but they were still playing catch-up. Given Blankenship&#x27;s history and the cross-section of criminal hackers and the SJG BBS, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that they raided them.<p>During the glory days of 80s hacking, groups like LoD and a handful of others had access to things that would scare the hell out of the public today. Imagine what a huge news story it would be today if it was announced that a single group of hackers had access to systems that control power grids, telcos, credit bureaus, banks, military bases, and all manner of other corporate and government entities. That&#x27;s really what it was like back then; a bunch of teenagers infiltrating everything plugged in.<p>Most hackers back then were just exploring and learning. I&#x27;m not suggesting that Blankenship or LoD did anything all that nefarious; they certainly weren&#x27;t out to bring the system down, and they didn&#x27;t take advantage of their access for any financial gain that I&#x27;m aware of (discounting theft of services to the tune of a few hundred thousand dollars worth of phreaked phone calls).<p>It&#x27;s a funny story about an interesting time. I&#x27;m inclined to cut the gov&#x27;t a little slack for overreacting because the potential for harm (from hackers) was high, even if few of them harmed anything.

Table partitioning&#x2F;sharding. RDBMS storage engines don&#x27;t tend to scale for common hybrid access patterns (e.g. contended inserts+reads on tables with many indices and uniqueness constraints) past a billion rows or so. You can scale them yourself, though, by splitting a table&#x27;s dataset into multiple tables (all with the same schema) and getting the RDBMS to direct reads&#x2F;writes appropriately.<p>2. ETL ingest tables for separate datasources. If you have e.g. 100 different scrapers for various APIs used in your data warehouse, all writing into your DB, then even if they all are writing data with the same schema, it&#x27;s operationally very challenging to have them write to the same physical table. Much simpler to have them write into their own staging tables, which can have their own exclusive-access locks, get their own deduping, get TRUNCATEd separately between batch loads, etc. They can <i>copy into<\/i> a shared table, but this step is often unnecessary and skipped.<p>3. Matviews built for extremely expensive queries that exist for running specific reports against. These are effectively materializataions of subqueries shared by common customer queries. As such, there might be hundreds or thousands of these.<p>In the end, none of these are really tables (&quot;relations&quot;, in the relational-algebra sense); they&#x27;re all operational implementation details. Partitions are literally &quot;parts&quot; of larger tables; ETL ingest staging tables are distinct &quot;inboxes&quot; to a shared table; and reporting matviews are &quot;caches&quot; of queries. All of these things <i>could<\/i> be separate first-class object types, hidden inside the logic of the DBMS, not presented as &quot;tables&quot; per se, despite taking up storage space like tables. But—in most-any RDBMS I know of—they&#x27;re not.

There is currently one ISO standard (ISO 31320-2, key-based style modeling) for database design.

Do you want a rule of thumb to recognized poorly designed databases? Check for ID attributes in every table (there are many other ways in which database design can suck, though).<p>How do you recognize good database diagrams? They can be easily translated into natural language (predicates and facts), and two (technically competent) different people would translate them in the same way, i.e., the model is unambiguous.

It&#x27;s also a good example of why datamodeling is important no matter underlying tech-stack this data model is going to be implemented on.<p>Also, I prefer modeling the app, business or process in Chen&#x27;s ERD first as I think it is much better at capturing modeling details than UML and other ERD-variants.<p>Also, just as each object class in OOP should do only one thing, each entity should be saved just one table. Eg. that &quot;Employee&quot; table in the first chapter of every beginner database book with a &quot;Manager&quot; relation as a foreign key to itself is an absolute catastrophe and very . The moment your CEO decides you are now in a matrix-organisation, everything breaks down datamodel-wise. The Employees go into one table, the Organisational Structure type into another - they are related by foreign keys and it&#x27;s not that different from good OO modeling as people say. The tables containing organisational structure should probaly also have columns with a from- and to-date and a relationship to a Department table so different departments can be organised differently throughout their lifetime.<p>Also, entities which have some sort of lifecycle should also be split into different tables. So there should be a table for &quot;Prospective Employees&quot;, &quot;Current Employees&quot;, &quot;Resigned Employees&quot;, &quot;Former Employees&quot;, etc. An employee&#x27;s day of resignation can now be not null and go into the right table. You can always UNION these three or four tables together into one big view or materialized table, and at the same time you will avoid a massive amount of WHERE statements that each need their own indexes, picking out just the right employees from that big generic Employee table in every effing query.<p>Also, columns with endless NULL values are a &quot;code smell&quot; in a relational database. Whatever value is hiding in the few rows with values probably belong to another entity and should have been stored in another table with the name of that &quot;thing&quot;. Eg. the employee&#x27;s day of resignation again.<p>Also, 99% of all business datamodels can be implemented in a relational database using just tables, views and queries created in standard SQL. You will rarely if ever need user defined functions, generators, connectors, stored procedures, foreign code blobs and other exotic and vendor specific extensions.<p>Also, I recommend reading everything by Joe Celko."],"time":["2020-02-16 02:27:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bunchOfCucks"],"id":[22331853],"kids":{},"parent":[22324691],"text":["Same ones as before."],"time":["2020-02-15 01:20:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["xuebin100"],"id":[22326332],"kids":{},"parent":[22324691],"text":["1"],"time":["2020-02-14 14:34:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["m_ke"],"id":[22328412],"kids":[22330344,22329665,22328873,22328834,22330708,22328957,22331088,22331773,22332143,22331041,22330485,22330584,22332829,22331198,22330686,22328836,22328431,22329737],"parent":[22328026],"text":["It&#x27;s crazy to me that we allow politicians to run targeted ad campaigns.<p>I randomly looked up Andrew Yang on good a few days ago on my phone and had ads from two billionaires take up my whole screen.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Ke3aWBH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Ke3aWBH<\/a><p>Without campaign finance regulation majority of the billions donated to campaigns is going directly into pockets of Google, Facebook and cable monopolies.

This type of diagram was developed in 1972 by Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman who were both graduate students at Stony Brook University. These diagrams are also called structograms, as they show a program&#x27;s structures.<p>&gt;Overview: Following a top-down design, the problem at hand is reduced into smaller and smaller subproblems, until only simple statements and control flow constructs remain. Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams reflect this top-down decomposition in a straightforward way, using nested boxes to represent subproblems. Consistent with the philosophy of structured programming, Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams have no representation for a GOTO statement.<p>&gt;Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams are only rarely used for formal programming. Their abstraction level is close to structured program code and modifications require the whole diagram to be redrawn, but graphic editors removed that limitation. They clarify algorithms and high-level designs, which make them useful in teaching. They were included in Microsoft Visio and dozens of other software tools, such as the German EasyCode.<p>&gt;In Germany, Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams were standardised in 1985 as DIN 66261. They are still used in German introductions to programming, for example Böttcher and Kneißl&#x27;s introduction to C, Baeumle-Courth and Schmidt&#x27;s introduction to C and Kirch&#x27;s introduction to C#.<p>&gt;Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams can also be used in technical writing.<p>When Ben Shneiderman and Ike Nassi (who were grad students at the time) submitted their paper about them to Communications of the ACM, it was quickly rejected on October 4, 1972, with the most brutal rejection letter Ben Shneiderman has ever received.<p>But then they submitted it to the unrefereed ACM SIGPLAN, where it was published in August 1973, and since then it has been cited many times, widely implemented by many tools, and used for educational and documentation purposes. It&#x27;s a great example of the importance of persistence for people whose new ideas are brutally rejected by respected authorities:<p>Flowchart techniques for structured programming:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;953349.953350\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;953349.953350<\/a><p>Scan of the brutal referee&#x27;s report:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;members&#x2F;bshneiderman&#x2F;nsd&#x2F;rejection_letter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;members&#x2F;bshneiderman&#x2F;nsd&#x2F;rejecti...<\/a><p>&gt;My first thought was to write a referees report which would by its sarcastic nature be funny. For example, I thought of writing that it was a sound, useful theory, but it wasn&#x27;t practical because it would be difficult to design flowcharting templates to be manufactured and sold.<p>&gt;I guess, however, that it is best to come right out and say that I feel the best thing the authors could do is collect all copies of this technical report and burn them, before anybody reads them. My opinion is that it shows the inexperience and ignorance of the authors with respect to programming in general, and their misunderstanding of so-called structured programming.<p>&gt;To say that [BEGIN body END] should be written as [NS diagram] is ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is having to write [DO i=1 TO N; DO J=1 TO N; S = 0; DO K=1 TO N; S=S+A(I,K)*B(K,J) END C(I,J)=S END END] as [NS diagram].<p>&gt;The authors mention that &quot;the ease with which a structured flow-chart can be translated into a structured program is pleasantly surprising&quot;. My retort is &quot;yes, just erase those silly boxes!&quot;<p>&gt;Flowcharts are a crutch we have invented to try to understand programs written in a confusing style. This was due to our ignorance of the programming process and what was needed -- after all, programming is only 20-30 years old. So-called &quot;structured programming&quot; helps to limit us to, as Dijkstra calls them, &quot;intellectually manageable&quot; programs, in which case flowcharts are completely useless and in fact a hindrance to programming. They shouldn&#x27;t be used.<p>&gt;I shudder at the thought of further explorations revolving around the context-free nature of this [flowchart] language.<p>Ben&#x27;s rejection letter story:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;members&#x2F;bshneiderman&#x2F;nsd&#x2F;rejection_letter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;members&#x2F;bshneiderman&#x2F;nsd&#x2F;rejecti...<\/a><p>&gt;Rejection letter from the Communications of the ACM<p>&gt;Ben Shneiderman, June 12, 2003<p>&gt;Our submission of the structured flowcharts to the Communications of the ACM was quickly rejected, on October 4, 1972, by the Programming Languages Editor David Gries of Cornell University. He included a single anonymous reference letter which is on paper that has a Cornell University watermark. I assume Gries gave our paper to one of his colleagues (you can play the guessing game too), who wrote the most brutal rejection letter I have ever gotten.<p>&gt;The reviewer wrote: &quot;I feel that the best thing the authors could do is collect all copies of this technical report and burn them, before anybody reads them.&quot; As graduate students, this stinging rejection shocked us, but we kept getting enthusiastic responses from people around us. We sent the paper to the unrefereed ACM SIGPLAN Notices, where it was published in August 1973. It didn&#x27;t take long for others to produce extensions, software tools, and applications of structured flowcharts.<p>&gt;The next problem was theft of the idea. I had sent a draft to respected colleagues, and soon others published slight variations. One of these respected colleagues was Ned Chapin, who greatly troubled us by publishing what he called &#x27;Chapin Charts.&#x27; A friend of mine sent me his published paper with a note encouraging me to sue. For several years I feared that Chapin&#x27;s reputation and his frequent professional seminars would wind up leaving the idea tied to his name, but as the decades passed, the ending has proved to be a happy one. We called the idea &#x27;structured flowcharts, but they are widely known as Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams.<p>&gt;Another problem was the appearances of patents for variations on our idea, but these have not limited the widespread recognition we have gotten over the years.<p>&gt;I wish every graduate student or young inventor would have the pleasure of seeing his&#x2F;her ideas spread so far and influence the work of so many people. I also hope that the story of the bold rejection of our novel idea and its eventual international success, is an inspiration for anyone whose new ideas are rejected by some respected authorities.<p>More on Ben Shneiderman and NS diagrams:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11368430\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11368430<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11370099\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11370099<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22093072\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22093072<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-14 20:04:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Supermancho"],"id":[22329232],"kids":{},"parent":[22326669],"text":["This is a wonderful idea, but by the given numbering scheme, I can identify a slew of problems.<p>[1a.

When you hit a point of confusion or a knowledge gap of any size, pause everything and follow the concept graph all the way down until you bottom out or hit something you have seen before and understand, then backtrack and continue from where you first branched.

I tried to get an overall sense of what is it: \n   &quot;Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.&quot; - Ok that makes sense, but don&#x27;t know what big part is it made from.<p>2. What problems does it solve and why? what are all the solutions? What features does it have?<p>3. What is the overall architecture? What parts does it have? API server, scheduler, controller managers, etc...<p>4. I installed it so I had to learn networking. What is a network plugin? How do they work? Learned most things which needed to running them.<p>5. What is the structure of it&#x27;s API? You don&#x27;t need to go into great details, just to see the big picture, like main api endpoints: &#x2F;api&#x2F;v1, &#x2F;healthz, &#x2F;logs, etc, etc...<p>6. Kubernetes Objects model high level overview. What are objects in Kubernetes? What Fields do they have? What are Controllers, Pods, Labels, Deployments, etc.<p>7. Authentication. How does it work, what methods does it have?<p>8. Services<p>9. ...<p>And so on. So basically you take ONCE concept at once and read everything until you feel you got the thing. For example, if you already understand the overall concepts, you can dive into what a Pod is by reading the article about it. I usually try to read the minimum number of manual PAGES until I confidentially grasp the entire concept I want to learn about.<p>By splitting huge and complex systems into small subsystems like this, you can become productive much sooner.

What data structures are in the kernel?\nSo if you try to learn &quot;kernel development&quot; from day one and learn &quot;kernel development&quot; until you can &quot;develop for kernel&quot;, it won&#x27;t work.

To do complex things well, you need to be able to do the simple things without consciously thinking about them. Expertise is what happens when a large mass of related things become easy so you don&#x27;t think about them, so you can think about complex things made from the easy things.<p>For software, it&#x27;s often about decomposing problems vs infrastructure to work on them. There&#x27;s a great xkcd about that. Someone asks for an app that can take photos and tell if they&#x27;re in a national park (easy)... but also tell if the photo is of a bird (incredibly hard). Lack of expertise is why people don&#x27;t understand this. They don&#x27;t recognize that they are two entirely separate problems, jumbled together as if they were one problem.<p>An area of expertise for me is playing guitar. Now, melodies are for the most part made of scales and arpeggios. So playing scales&#x2F;arpeggios efficiently can be isolated from &quot;music&quot;. And they&#x27;re tied intensely to physical technique. So for instance, playing two notes per string is physically much different from playing three notes per string. By isolating scales and arpeggios into small chunks and practicing them independently, we can then easily integrate those chunks to form streams of melody, without having to do conscious thinking, because when playing music, <i>conscious thinking is the enemy<\/i>. It destroys rhythmic flow. But with a collection of instinct-level arpeggios and scales in my hands, I can just <i>play<\/i>, with my mind focused on emotions, ideas, and musical shapes, rather than which finger needs to land on which string to hit which note.<p>Programming is a lot like that. Once you&#x27;ve learned effective data structures, control flow, conditional behavior, etc, you shouldn&#x27;t have to think about it much while you&#x27;re coding, so you can focus on the <i>problem<\/i>, not the act of writing code.

This doesn&#x27;t change that there isn&#x27;t a big draw.<p>If there is a big feature for macOS Catalina, it would be SideCar.

But I take a lot of photos as well as long videos and heaps and heaps of screenshots from articles that I read. The internal SSD on my MacBook Air is only 128GB, so I had to resort to an external drive. With huge amounts of images and photos in a Photos library macOS keeps wanting to scan through all of them and it spends forever to do so.<p>I began creating new Photos libraries but at that point Photos libraries begin to feel rather pointless. In order to find photos I’d have to sift through multiple libraries and each of them would want to scan the whole library again.<p>Aside from that the big annoyance with importing into Photos (instead of syncing) is that it does not transfer albums and favorites, it only transfers the media files.<p>So I was manually selecting photos and organizing stuff but that takes time so I put off transferring photos and videos and screenshots from my phone for a couple of months.<p>Very recently I finally found an application for macOS that uses the iPhone backup protocol in order to transfer whole albums and favorites. But it cost $60 so I was hesitant to buy it because I was very low on money so it was a significant amount. Instead I started doing a full backup of the device. About 30% through the process my phone goes in to a reboot loop.<p>I speak with an Apple store, I speak with Apple and I speak with a data recovery specialist company. The data recovery specialist company told me that from the description I was giving them about what had happened, it was highly probable that data had been corrupted and that this would make it impossible to recover anything. They could have a look at it for a fee of $150 they said, and recovery if possible would cost between $400 and $1000. Naturally this was way above what I could afford. So I went through with factory reset on my own instead, which means accepting that the data was gone.<p>I lost a couple of months worth of photos and videos and screenshots. Which sucks. At the same time though, nothing much exciting happened in these months anyway so it’s not a disaster either. But I would have preferred to not lose the data because there were a select few memories in there from that time that would have been nice to keep.<p>I am also growing worried about my data in general, as the drives I use are starting to age. I can’t afford new drives at the moment but began looking at renting storage from Hetzner.<p>Anyways, in terms of what’s on the phone I now have iCloud photos turned back on on the 5GB plan and try to transfer regularly using the macOS third-party application that I mentioned. After losing the data on my phone I shelled out those $60 for said application. It’s still a bit more cumbersome of a procedure compared to storing more in iCloud but at the same time I think this is pretty ok. This way, as long as I keep transferring to my computer when iCloud is full I always have the photos transferred or they are in iCloud.
