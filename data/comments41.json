While low band spectrum (850MHz) has decent penetrating power, the majority of 5G is deployed at ~5GHz and mm-Wave frequencies, where you won&#x27;t get much of any signal through a wall, or even on the other side of the building. This is why so many 5G base stations have to be deployed; the coverage just isn&#x27;t as good. But the improvements in base station handoffs and spectral efficiency will increase a carrier&#x27;s total capacity, even if the end user doesn&#x27;t see a massive benefit.<p>There are scenarios where you might see massive speeds, though. 5G heavily leverages Carrier Aggregation, where a client can connect to multiple channels at once, increasing bandwidth, and beam-forming, where the &quot;shape&quot; of the signal is modified to steer maximum power to the physical location of a client. If you happen to be near a base station with good Signal to Noise Ratio while downloading something large, the base station can allocate multiple channels and use beamforming to finish your download at Gbps speeds and get you off the network faster, freeing up spectrum time for more users at lower SNR&#x27;s and bandwidths.<p>There is potential for much more impactful deployment of 5G cellular in rural areas where there aren&#x27;t many buildings or walls blocking high frequency signal.

In the past, I spent over 7 years working on Apple Mail, and today I am really excited to share a new email client I&#x27;m building: Mimestream, a native macOS email client for Gmail.<p>Mimestream is written in Swift, and uses AppKit+SwiftUI for a clean, stock appearance. It&#x27;s designed to be fast, lightweight, and use a minimal amount of disk space. Mimestream&#x27;s advantages over using the Gmail web interface includes features like multiple accounts, a unified inbox, system notifications, swipe actions, dark mode, (some) offline support, tracker prevention, multiple keyboard shortcut sets, and more.<p>Mimestream differs from other email clients because it uses the Gmail API rather than IMAP, so it supports more Gmail-specific features like categorized inboxes, Gmail&#x27;s search operators, first-class labels support (apply multiple via <U+2318>L, set colors, etc), synced aliases, synced signatures, etc. I&#x27;m planning a lot more work in this area, including server-side filter configuration, Google Drive support, G Suite directory autocomplete, and more.<p>The app is a traditional email client that makes direct connections to Gmail and stores your data on your Mac. There are no intermediary servers with access to your account or copies of your messages. Mimestream is free for a limited time during the public beta, but will eventually be a paid app by the time it gets to the Mac App Store.<p>I hope you enjoy trying out the beta, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!"],"time":["2020-09-09 18:04:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dugmartin"],"id":[24426291],"kids":[24428985,24429652],"parent":[24422432],"text":["Interesting to see the Gmail API being used for a general purpose email client when Google has a very visible note on the overview page that says:<p>&gt; Note: The Gmail API should not be used to replace IMAP for full-fledged email client access.

It doesn&#x27;t even seem to use the current up&#x2F;down orientation on initial render and then stick to that, which would at least be better than just having up and down hardcoded to specific sides of the screen.<p>[EDIT 2] Made it through the free part of Human Body, confirmed, 3-month option is still not responding to touches at all."],"time":["2020-09-09 20:12:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mgraczyk"],"id":[24423993],"kids":[24426269,24426166],"parent":[24423463],"text":["Great content, glad to see something for kids that is more useful than YouTube Poop Nursery Rhymes.<p>I wonder if someday you could use automate some of the video using something like this Tennis video generator that was shared here yesterday: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24398474\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24398474<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-09 20:14:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["artur_makly"],"id":[24428472],"kids":[24428937],"parent":[24423463],"text":["Our FAV app for my 7yr old.

I&#x27;m picturing a pipeline from science research, to exploratory&#x2F;researchy content creation, to deliverable content creation, where the middle bit gets little attention.  For examples...<p>Most intro astronomy content, K thru undergrad, gets the color of the Sun either simply wrong, or handles it misleadingly.  Resulting in even first-tier astronomy graduate students likely knowing it wrong.  Clips from Tappity show false color photos and art of the Sun.  Which if not handled carefully, is setting kids up for this morass of common misconceptions around Sun color.  What might &quot;handled carefully&quot; look like?  Good question.  Do you know of any context where that gets discussed?<p>Similarly, the Tappity &quot;exploded&quot; layers of Earth graphic[3] is variously misleading and aphysically colored (better than many).  Which is pervasive for such graphics.  Do you know of any community which might say &quot;variants of this common graphic abound, variously wrong - let&#x27;s put in the collaborative effort necessary to create one correct, and open license it&quot;?<p>Education content for kids often says the Sun warms the Earth.  But that&#x27;s only half the story, and I&#x27;ve never seen content which does the whole.  Earth is doing a bbq roll between too hot Sun and too cold deep space.  Even young kids might grasp the concept that with something uncomfortably hot, and another uncomfortably cold, you can attain comfort by alternating.  But we don&#x27;t say that.  Does anyone know of a setting for &quot;here is a commonly taught story that&#x27;s incomplete - let&#x27;s create exemplar content that fills it out&quot;?  Cold at night, at altitude, with cloudless skys, especially when dry... it&#x27;s a story that&#x27;s actionable, if not cut short.<p>Chemistry education content is famously bad.  Chem ed research describes it using adjectives like incoherent, leaving both teachers and students steeped in misconceptions.  But now XR content is coming.  And some of it is nifty.  But much of it is the usual wretched, now in 3D.<p>There seems a body of <i>badly<\/i> needed effort and work, very poorly incentivized, that&#x27;s not getting well addressed.  Do these examples bring to mind any efforts to address this need?

And I&#x27;ll answer 2 questions, not 1.<p>1. Why do we need Bayesian estimation? Can&#x27;t we just all use MLE, and live in harmony? If MLE was good for Gauss and Laplace and Fisher, why isn&#x27;t it good for me? Answer: for many problems the likelihood function is unbound. In fact the cases where the likelihood function are bounded, so the MLE makes sense, are few and far between. But if you think of the likelihood as a function with a hump somewhere, you have several choices for a single number that best describes the function: mode, mean, median for example. MLE corresponds to mode, can we use the mean instead? Also, does it not even make better sense to use mean rather than mode? Sure it does, and if you use mean you become a Bayesian. But can the likelihood be unbounded and have a finite mean, you ask? Yes, it happens quite often, sufficiently often that in practice people don&#x27;t worry about that.<p>Once you start using mean instead of mode (and therefore you can proudly call yourself a Bayesian), you get a number of side benefits: you get parameter uncertainty estimation for free, and you can start multiplying your likelihoods with various functions that make your life easier. You can interpret those functions as regularization functions, or prior, you can even start talking about expert knowledge, and delve into philosophical meanderings. No need to do that , there are enough people on the internet who do that.<p>2. Why Monte Carlo? Because calculating means of high-dimensional distributions is not easy. In most cases you are hit with the curse of dimensionality. Separately, the distributions that you work with are not known only up to a multiplicative constant. So the problem is how do you estimate the mean of a vector (v1, v2, ...., vn) when you know its distribution, but only up to a constant? The answer is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and if you learn that, you get special powers.<p>So why do Bayesians need Monte Carlo?

This effectively makes those measurements less predictive.<p>To me, this suggests that all the polling and analysis are a waste of resources and attention.

Putting some recent numbers [2] over the size of the MBS market would show that the Fed owns a little less than a 1&#x2F;5 of all US MBS.<p>Also, he mentions that the Fed has been purchasing roughly $100 billion per month in MBS securities since April, but this leaves out the fact that a non-insignificant number of MBS in their holdings are either i) reaching maturity, or ii) being prepaid.  The second issue is more prevalent now - with the low-rate environment that exists in the US many people are refinancing their mortgages to take advantage of lower rates, but in any case it isn&#x27;t uncommon for mortgages to be paid off before their maturity date.

During these rains, an entire township (Naya Nazimabad) sank underwater and many areas are still waterlogged. This township was built on top of a low-lying lake that was reclaimed. The approval of such projects involves dozens of authorities, each of whom charges an &quot;expediency fees&quot; and corruption is deep rooted within them. An officer who comes in for a 2-4 year tenure on low government salaries is incentivized to maximize his earnings during his short tenure.<p>The second is the lack of engineering involvement. The government sector doesn&#x27;t exactly attract the top talent at good salaries. The tenders on the other hand are awarded based on nepotism and personal gain. There is a long list of botched projects in the civil sector. None of the desalination and water treatments plants are operational, in the entire city, for example. They have not been for years now.<p>The sewerage infrastructure in many parts of the city, as exists right now, is worse than the French sewers built in the 14th century[1]. These sewers are open-top and become dumping grounds for garbage due to lack of a garbage collection infrastructure. The encroachments around and above these sewers fall victim to Tragedy of Commons[2]. The whole thing is a mess with no easy solution and if this years&#x27; heavy rainfalls become a future trend, the situation will be unsustainable. Many homes were waterlogged for days and weeks with no power or connectivity (cell towers have around 24-48 hours of standby power after which they went down).<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_sewers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_sewers<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tragedy_of_the_commons\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tragedy_of_the_commons<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-09 11:14:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["game_the0ry"],"id":[24432180],"kids":{},"parent":[24403076],"text":["Remember - PK also has nuclear weapons, and they are not very careful with them.[0]<p>As a Pakistani myself, I can&#x27;t be more disappointed with my country of origin.<p>For the Pakistanis here - it&#x27;s worth criticizing our home nation and elders, otherwise it won&#x27;t get any better.

No &quot;this&quot;, easy reuse of logic via react-like &quot;useXYZ&quot; hooks and a general fast development. But two things really bugged me:<p>* You need to be really careful when passing around values and how you handle them. Destructure a Proxy object? You instantly lose reactivity. Not using a reference to proxy object in computed? Changes won&#x27;t trigger the computed function. There is a lot of magic involved and while it may seem that it takes a lot of &quot;thinking&quot; from you, once it doesn&#x27;t work you will have to rethink and maybe even ditch some of the underlying language&#x27;s features.<p>* &quot;ref&quot; vs &quot;reactive&quot;, where &quot;ref&quot; is used for primitives which need a proxy object wrapper and &quot;reactive&quot; is used for objects&#x2F;arrays. Now, my primary problem is that you again have to use specific operations based on whether your using ref or reactive. A &quot;ref&quot; array can be easily set to an empty array via `arr.value = []`.

The reality is, most farmers in Xinjiang are independent entities. They are the little guys. They grow cotton or any other produces on their land, and sell the produces to distributors. Many of these farmers are minority ethnicity, Uighur included, but there are others as well. These people lived in villages and in the country side for generations.  Farming and the &quot;primary&quot; sector of the economy is how they make a living for generations. They are the low to middle income bracket of the society. They depend on agriculture to raise families, provide food on the table, raise children, and take care of the elderly in the family.

They grew cotton on their farm, and one day they are told &quot;The U.S. stops buying your product because they want to protect you from forced labor&quot;, and because of that, you will be out of work. The farmer sits there and think &quot;Wait, I am farming because I need money to feed my families&quot;. This ban sounds like its standing with the Uighur people, but in reality, it hurts them the most. Rights to live, rights to livelihood, rights to income and bringing food to the table is also human rights.<p>Target companies or organizations that actually committed forced labor and present concrete evidence. Maybe require a document of the name of the farmer, require disclosure and certifications of the practices of the producers. There are many ways this could be done to both protect legitimate producers, farmers, and rule out the bad actors. Or at least act like you are trying. A blanket ban blew the covers off of the PR statement this is about protecting human rights and stand with the people. Instead, the actual intent is to suppress the Chinese economy, and prevent the people living there from getting richer and achieve a better quality of life. Its sad that there are people in the world who don&#x27;t really care about other people&#x27;s quality of life.
