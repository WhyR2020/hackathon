Between the heavy metal or rock or rap of the 1980s and those genres now? Nuances distinguish them. You don’t need to resort to nuances to tell the difference between the music of the 1970s and 1950s or the 1950s and 1930s.<p>I find this comparison completely ridiculous. It is not just that I can tell difference between Madonna and Lady Gaga or 1980 metal against todays one. It is also that the actual difference between 1970s and 1950s music is that they changed genre. Metal must be metal, if it was different then metal if would not be metal. It just so happens that new genres did appeared between 1980 and now. Contemporary techno progressive music is incomparable to anything in 1980. Also, 1980 music is ridiculously easy to distinguish as 1980 music. And not just that new genres appeared, the music in 1980 was not consumed the way it is consumed now - all the time for free huge selection by own personal choice. Back then, you had either to pay or listen to one of radio stations. So the people moved more in lockstep.<p>&gt; Renaissance linear perspective for the visual arts ...

People can do hyper realistic drawings today, the ones that are hard to distinguish from photography. They are stunning pieces of craft. But, at this point, it is craft that you can learn if you study enough and have talent. You are not discovering something new when you do it - but if they are your thing there are artists focusing on this particular thing.

Considering the scale and complexity of a large &#x27;enterprise&#x27; org AD deployment, I found it hard to believe that Microsoft would come away with nothing.<p>The most realistic outcome seemed like the DoD would rely on AWS for most infrastructure simply because the people at the top wouldn&#x27;t know better and regulatory capture. I figured they would, almost begrudgingly, bring Azure into the mix, simply because Microsoft makes it nearly impossible these days to retain a completely on prem AD deployment and how in the hell is a bureaucratic monstrosity like the DoD going to disentangle itself from Active Directory?<p>Another scenario is that if whomever is in charge of making the final decision is a bit more forward thinking and has some vision, they&#x27;ll go all in on a multi-cloud strategy for maximum redundancy and resiliency and we might see GCP get thrown in the mix. I think it&#x27;s really hard to argue against this strategy for an org as important as the DoD frankly. Some people often make the argument that starting with one cloud platform and incrementally moving beyond that is the way to go, but I strongly disagree with this. A true multi-cloud strategy has to start by incorporating multiple platforms from the beginning or else you&#x27;re extremely likely to get locked into a single platform due to organizational inertia. Not to mention the cost benefits. Locking yourself into a single vendor basically removes all your leverage to take your business and go elsewhere. You really can&#x27;t bluff your way out of that one either, because what are you going to do? Go redeploy all your applications that were built with proprietary platform specific tools on a _different platform_? Nope.<p>I think the most unlikely, but also most interesting outcome would have been the DoD goes all in on GCP and the chromebook style of computing, basically tearing everything down and starting from scratch. If ever there was an opportunity for that, this would be it, though there are many arguments against that. I think there&#x27;s a scenario in which something similar might have been possible for AWS, but in reality it doesn&#x27;t seem possible, because AWS doesn&#x27;t really have a competitor to G-Suite &#x2F; Office365. I know they have WorkDocs, but that&#x27;s not exactly the same thing.<p>Having used all three, including Azure, myself though, I really didn&#x27;t believe a Microsoft only scenario would come about. Among other reasons, and to be fair its been a while, but last I remember Azure&#x27;s annual downtown far exceeds the other two platforms, which seems like a pretty critical point when considering the systems running on here may hold soldiers lives in the balance.<p>Anyways, I do hope we see a more reasonable scenario come about eventually.

IMO the quotes from the maintainer responses are quite interesting. The authors have a bit of an axe to grind in their rebuttals to each point.<p>The largest bullet (&quot;It&#x27;s not really a vulnerability&quot;) is a bummer, and it mirrors some of my own experiences with reporting security issues internally. With about half of my reports, the response is &quot;because of X, this is not a problem&quot;, where X IMO boils down to &quot;I cannot imagine how this could be abused, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem&quot;. Basically, send a proof-of-concept or GTFO. In some cases I have gone on to make a PoC just to get the issue resolved. In others I get too tired of arguing that the code is clearly broken and the fix is easy to apply and just move on.<p>Sometimes there is no help. For one of my customers I submitted a simple curl PoC. It broke into their stack and got sensitive data easily. They &quot;fixed&quot; the issue, but did not bother re-running the PoC. It still worked. I pointed out the fix was incomplete, and was told &quot;that issue was already fixed&quot;. I re-submitted the PoC as a new issue, this time with a one-line code patch that resolved it (a broken regex that allowed partial matches). It&#x27;s still pending.<p>It&#x27;s not my intention to say &quot;it&#x27;s all bad developers&quot; - in the work they also point out that the majority of developers trust and rely on the official Oracle JCA documentation. It was referenced commonly in the github issue responses. The authors point out that the JCA docs are quite incomplete, not mentioning typical constraints for common parameters (e.g. should &quot;iterations&quot; be 1, 10, or 10000? You don&#x27;t know from the docs, it&#x27;s just asking for an integer value)."],"time":["2020-09-04 17:29:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lol768"],"id":[24377708],"kids":{},"parent":[24363101],"text":["I&#x27;m confused.

And let&#x27;s set aside the fact that in the end it&#x27;s all going to regress to supervision, without which you can&#x27;t optimize. Let&#x27;s also set aside the fact that performance against a &quot;gold standard&quot; SemEval dataset doesn&#x27;t mean shit in a lot of real world applications.<p>So you try out the standard issue &quot;top of the line&quot; algo, like YAKE, which is so fucking slow in pure Python that it&#x27;ll choke a Bayesian optimizer. You sit around for a while debating whether or not to port it to Cython, having little idea if the effort will pay off because you aren&#x27;t sure how well YAKE is going to work to begin with and it might get bested by another algo anyway.<p>So you go looking through the literature and you&#x27;re delighted to find that within just the last few months, there have been some really cool and promising algos coming out with solid benchmarks, and there&#x27;s code available to boot. Yay!<p>So you download the &quot;weakly supervised&quot; statistical one and it turns out to be a fucked up polyglot of Bash, C++, and a stale version of OpenJDK, some of which you have to compile yourself with g++, and then you have to dump your corpus into text files even though you&#x27;ve already got it in memory, run it through a tokenizer you neither want nor need, and then read the results back out of other text files. Sure, there&#x27;s a docker version. It&#x27;s full of bloat and solves some of the more negligible problems at hand.<p>Then you download a graph-based algo and it&#x27;s such an undocumented mess of spaghetti it might as well have been written by an Italian restaurant. So you spend a really unreasonable amount of time just trying to figure out which function even takes your text as an input, and you read through a bunch of other functions trying to figure out if it needs to be pre-tokenized or not and if it wants the input as sentences or not or whatever. It also wants your input as a text file.<p>Then you download a language model-based algo and you think you&#x27;re going to run the BERT variant you have at hand, but you double check the paper and it happens to perform way better with ELMO and then if you&#x27;re lucky you don&#x27;t spend a whole day trying to get AllenNLP running because you&#x27;re using WSL on a laptop without a GPU and the non-gpu Tensorflow dependency is shitting itself all over the stack trace. You finally get the environment going in all its bloated glory even though you just wanted the pre-trained ELMO model, which you finally get deployed to Cortex or whatever and breathe a sigh of relief. And then it turns out your corpus is so domain specific that your matrix is sparser than swiss cheese because it&#x27;s chock full of unks.<p>What have you learned after all this?

Rust&#x27;s guarantees are built on these, and they are currently defined by the current rustc implementation. Until a complete and detailed standard is published, Rust will not have a stable AI, and cannot enjoy multiple implementations (which inhibits its portability). Even the bit about Cargo stems from this: without a specification, Cargo&#x27;s implementation is the de facto explanation for to properly link external, compiled libraries against rust binaries.

You should be getting both guidance navigating your company&#x27;s politics from your manager, and overall career growth by working on their team. Sometimes they won&#x27;t be technically stronger than you, but in those cases they should be helping you grow in other ways (giving talks, mentoring others, taking on leadership tasks). In cases where they are technically more proficient you should be learning from them, perhaps not actively but at least they&#x27;re pointing you in the right direction. During all this you&#x27;re enjoying spending time working with this person professionally.<p>In return what you offer your manager is someone who&#x27;s capable of doing work and becoming increasingly capable of working with less direction. Eventually you take ownership of initiatives. You should advocate for your team where appropriate, but never fanatically. You should be brave enough to speak up if you&#x27;re worried about their course of action.<p>The main dynamic is this: In return for them helping you grow and navigate, you&#x27;re trying your best to be someone who&#x27;s self-sufficient, capable and someone they don&#x27;t have to worry about.<p>There are a few things you should definitely not be doing. You shouldn&#x27;t be spending too much time with them outside of work (an occasional happy hour or office event is a-ok). You shouldn&#x27;t be getting drunk with them. You shouldn&#x27;t be getting counseling or guidance on intensely personal issues like romantic relationships or personal life goals. Your relationship should pass a simple smell test: if you were to tell someone you were engaging in a behavior with your boss would they be shocked or surprised. If so it&#x27;s probably not appropriate. Here&#x27;s an example: &quot;I eat lunch with my boss a few times a week.&quot; Seems fine to me. &quot;I&#x27;ve eaten lunch with my boss every day for the last six months&quot; Seems a bit off to me. Of course different people will have different limits-- it&#x27;s up to you to set healthy boundaries that work for you.<p>Finally, when one of you moves on from the company, feel free to have any type of relationship you want with the manager. You&#x27;re both now two independent people. I would still overall caution from becoming too intimate with them, but it&#x27;s your life and you should trust yourself to steward it correctly. The reason I caution is that it&#x27;s because you really don&#x27;t know this person on a deeper level, and you might be surprised with what you find out. Most likely you&#x27;ll maintain some professional friendship, perhaps even help each other out for several years, but after that lose touch. Ideally, you&#x27;ll always look back on working with this person as a time of great fun, enjoyment and growth."],"time":["2020-09-04 23:08:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["draw_down"],"id":[24381548],"kids":{},"parent":[24378560],"text":["Nope!"],"time":["2020-09-05 07:14:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["goatinaboat"],"id":[24378654],"kids":[24378828,24378903,24378920,24378843,24378672],"parent":[24378560],"text":["A manager who is your friend is either a bad manager or a bad friend.

In the 1960 lots and lots of innovative reactors were build, often with relatively low budgets at that. The amount of untapped potential in nuclear energy is incredible. We don&#x27;t need fusion, fission is plenty energy dense, if we can&#x27;t figure out how to make fission practical, we want with fusion either.<p>Yet here we are in the year 2020 and we are still building new PWR reactors. But the reality is, in the US it is essentially impossible to build anything else. Regulations are designed so that the only reactor that can really get approval is a PWR.<p>If you attempt to build anything new, you have to basically pay the government to study your design and after a unknown amount of time and money, the government might develop a new regulatory framework. By the time that happens of course you have run out of money already, no buissness plan that depends on the government figuring out how to regulate a new type of reactor would ever really happen.<p>The good thing at least is that the DoE in the last 5 years seem to have realized that their whole approach was a problem and they have done a lot of good things to try to change. Outside of the US the energy sector is government controlled or to small for a nuclear reactor startup to have a large enough market to make a new reactor worth it.<p>Canada has established itself as basically the only viable place for new reactor development, with Terrestrial Energy and Moltex Energy (moved from Britain to Canada because regulation).<p>So, good luck to NuScale, I hope they can prove me wrong and deploy many of these in an economical way."],"time":["2020-09-03 20:54:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zymhan"],"id":[24367344],"kids":[24367736],"parent":[24358850],"text":["Previous Discussion 2 days ago<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24345288\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24345288<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 20:48:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jvanderbot"],"id":[24371236],"kids":{},"parent":[24358850],"text":["&quot;The design is based on Multi-Application Small Light Water Reactor developed at Oregon State University in the early 2000s.

It&#x27;s a very informative and thought provoking book.<p>&quot;Bullshit&quot; grossly misses some fundamental aspects about modern markets and power structures and as a result turns into an insipid, meandering grievance without substance.  The commentary mistakes social-welfare states which have monopoly enforcement on: credit repayment (legal tender), and authoritarian control of the means of production (permitting) as capitalism (_private_ ownership and deployment of goods and services).  As a result, the entire subsequent criticism that follows in the book is misguided.  If I had to summarize it: &quot;Economic (consumer&#x27;s-goods) producers are supremely inefficient in the deployment of labor, resources, time, production quantity which results in a social malaise&quot;.  It implicitly pathologizes the choices of people who work in the &quot;bullshit&quot; jobs as unable to make nuanced, multivariable decisions.  Yes, it may be the case a security camera would be a more efficient observer to an empty lot than paying a human, bored out of their mind, to sit in a hut. But that critique denies the economic calculus the hut worker made, that this job was the most ideal option out of the many different dimensions available to them.<p>If the set of available options cannot be combined to produce desired results, it&#x27;s not possible to combine inputs among a further reduced set of options to produce the desired results (&quot;regulation&quot;).  The only option is to increase the set of available options (liberalization, de-monopolization), to produce different outcomes.  The entire book fails to address to roll of entrepreneurship, e.g. a speculative endeavor by an individual or group that they can deploy labor, resources, time, production quantity in a more ideal and enjoyable arrangement.  The absence is a shame because instead of the book being a diatribe, it could have been a powerful call to action to improve our lot."],"time":["2020-09-03 21:00:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lucasnortj"],"id":[24367665],"kids":{},"parent":[24365811],"text":["Bullshit jobs was a tremendously tedious book but then that is to be expected from someone who  is an anarchist; an ideology that competes with Marxism in its idiocy"],"time":["2020-09-03 21:16:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["fskg"],"id":[24374127],"kids":{},"parent":[24365811],"text":["He tweeted this out recently:<p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;davidgraeber&#x2F;status&#x2F;1277208664873603075\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;davidgraeber&#x2F;status&#x2F;1277208664873603075<\/a><p>&gt; this is why I like the phrase &quot;white supremacy&quot;.

There was some relief but there were also unpleasant side-effects, and I just had a strong feeling these treatments were not really addressing the core problems, and indeed I even felt like the symptoms were fairly normal reactions to the life experiences I&#x27;d endured.<p>Later I tried to heal myself with nutritional and exercise-based approaches, and relatively conventional emotional approaches like meditation. Again, some mild&#x2F;temporary improvements were noticeable, but they were inadequate, and it still felt like there was something deeper I needed to connect with.<p>About 8 years ago, I found an approach that involves identifying and releasing traumas, attitudes, behavioural patterns, self-perceptions and defense mechanisms that are held in the subconscious mind, particularly ones that have been attained in early life and have snowballed through repetition compulsion [1] (a concept that Freud first articulated).<p>I&#x27;ve been undertaking these approaches continually since I discovered them, and bit by bit all the symptoms have resolved.<p>My experience has confirmed, at least to me, that these conditions are &quot;adaptive responses to adversity&quot; (or something else related to that concept), and that in order to heal the symptoms, I needed to understand their basis at a very deep level; as Jung said, &quot;making the unconscious conscious&quot; [2].<p>Once that had been done, adopting new, healthy attitudes and behaviours and living free of those symptoms has been fairly easy; i.e., healthier behaviours just emerged naturally once the causes of the unhealthy behaviours were identified and understood.<p>If any researchers or laypeople are interested to know more about the techniques I&#x27;ve used and the results I&#x27;ve experienced, I&#x27;m happy to be contacted (email address in profile). None of the approaches I&#x27;ve used or their underlying hypotheses are novel; it&#x27;s been written&#x2F;spoken about extensively by veteran experts on mind+body health including Maté and Bruce Lipton.

What I mean by this is that I sincerely doubt the authors intended to protect lies, deceit and libel.  It would make no sense whatsoever to create a law that effectively says &quot;You can lie cheat and steal all you want and this shall be protected by the highest law in the land&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the text from the first amendment:<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;<p>Some might say:  Well, libel is addressable through other legislation.<p>Well, yes and no.  It just so happens I was involved in a libel case many decades ago.  In this case a newsletter (this was before internet days) had given a competitor a monthly column to author.  This competitor decided to dedicate one column to attack our company and print a bunch of outright lies about our products.  Things like &quot;they don&#x27;t test&quot;, &quot;they ship their customers untested products&quot;, etc.  I mean, this guy knew nothing about us and yet he focused an entire page to defaming me and my company.<p>A meeting with my attorney resulted in letters to the publication&#x27;s entire board as well as the author&#x2F;competitor.  The only way I can characterize the reaction from the other side was &quot;they shit in their pants&quot;.  I came to learn a libel lawsuit is a very serious and potentially financially crippling event for someone without the means.  Large companies can manage them but individuals can lose their home, savings, job, etc.<p>I wasn&#x27;t interested in destroying lives or taking their home and savings.  They agreed to print a solid retraction, fire the competitor&#x2F;author and hire someone without skin in the game to pen that column.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem:  Retractions don&#x27;t work.  We saw an immediate and lasting hit to product sales.  It took about a year to recover from the hit piece.  Reputation is something that is hard to regain, particularly when people enter a fearful mental state.  In retrospect I should have been smarter and should have gone for a financial settlement of sorts to compensate for the damage they caused.  Our competitor actually gained sales and status in the industry as a result of this hit piece.<p>My point is that lies are like climbing to the top of a hill with a feather pillow, ripping it open and letting the winds take the feathers in all directions.  Fixing the damage caused by lies requires finding every single feather, which is impossible.<p>Sometimes I think we need to rethink this one aspect of the first amendment and either modify it or bolster it externally (through separate legislation) in order to prevent the kinds of lies and manipulation that have been a part of the press since, well, according to Jefferson, the very founding of this nation."],"time":["2020-09-03 17:31:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mensetmanusman"],"id":[24365575],"kids":{},"parent":[24361744],"text":["“  I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. “<p>This is the best quote, because they sensed to be true what we now know is true for pew research data.

At this point Assembly is in the Cobol universe - a handful of people know it to an extent at which they can work with it. But in the case of React... That really isn&#x27;t the case - the fundamental problem I see with React(and the entire NPM universe for that matter) is that they try to make a simple solution more simple by making it more complicated and convoluted. On a more general note, the web is broken. It has gone against it&#x27;s core principles and design. HTML was meant to serve readable documents and that&#x27;s it. Javascript&#x27;s purpose was to add some interactivity. But in this day and age, according to reacters anyway, HTML is pretty much Assembly or Cobol, while javascript is C.

When certain stocks sit at a one penny bid-ask spread all day, that&#x27;s a sign that penny ticks are too economically wide. It&#x27;s consumers and ordinary investors that pay the cost in terms of higher spreads.<p>You can think of the bid-ask spread as the cost of liquidity. It&#x27;s how much more you pay for immediate execution. The tick size therefore acts like a price floor on the cost of liquidity. Why are we imposing a price floor, one that&#x27;s much higher than the free market price, on end-consumers? If we reduced tick sizes from $0.01 to $0.001, the cost of trading for most retail investors on most stocks would fall by 50% or more.<p>It blunts the price discovery process. It incentives HFTs to compete in an arms race of speed to capture queue position, rather than provide better prices.

I remember vividly being active on various eMule mod forums back in ~2005. There was a very active scene back then with some eMule Mods that really pushed things further, MorphXT, Xtreme, StulleMule, eFmod, Sivka, ionix, NeoMule and ScarAngel come to mind.<p>So much drama with leecher mods (leecher was negatively connotated in regards to the ed2k-protocol) that tried to download more than uploading or upload to clients only that had proven to pay back with higher speeds. But also really innovative ideas like downloading from clients that used a thin HTTP server within the client, leveraging your ISPs proxies (Webcache&#x2F;Peercache feature) for higher download speeds. Also so many discussions where the network should be heading with the main Client devs famously mute in regards to those discussions and drama.<p>The main benefits of eMule&#x2F;ed2K, compared to torrenting, were file discoverability (serverless thanks to Kad search) and longetivity of files. It was actually relatively hard to find a file that was dead, because people kept sharing as long as they downloaded, often much longer. Download speeds were much slower than Torrents, even back then, and that was an advantage because that kept so many files alive. Great times that basically ended because of „p2p sheriff“ companies, Torrents and the dawn of One Click Hosters like Rapidshare that promised privacy and better download speeds.<p>To this day I am wondering if eMule would still have an active userbase if it had some sort of mechanism that (via opt-in) allowed clients to download from trustworthy „friends“ only and pipelined those downloads from the „public“ ed2k network through these friends and their friends&#x27; networks.

I&#x27;ve used exclusively Vim for over 10 years and it&#x27;s too comfortable to switch to anything else, so I&#x27;m losing out on a lot of productivity, or at least that&#x27;s what my colleagues, who have never used Vim, claim.<p>Pithy claims aside, it has been an interesting journey actually using Vim for producing C++ code for large projects. There&#x27;s a strong DIY element and you end up with a setup that&#x27;s much more customised than a vanilla IDE - on the one hand giving you a certain degree of comfort in your work, but on the other a lot of what you do is unportable to other people. The language server protocol has been a pretty good development, I&#x27;m keeping an eye on what comes out of those efforts, though I&#x27;m not using one personally right now.<p>My current setup consists mainly of exuberant-ctags for static indexing, YouCompleteMe for intellisense and simple navigation, rtags for rich search and light refactoring and fzf for searching. As to why I ended up settling on these plugins:<p>- ctags:<p>Absolutely essential. Yes, a full semantic index straight from the compiler is better, but ctags is more than good enough for just telling you &quot;where is this defined&quot;. When paired with fzf, you can type part of the tag, space, part of the directory and you&#x27;ll get all tags in that directory. That&#x27;s due to fzf doing super simple substring matching in the TAGS file&#x27;s lines based on your query, there&#x27;s nothing smart going on here. This tool is also very good when you are developing multiplatform software, because the compiler cannot see all places where a function or class is defined, since you have one definition per platform. Technically being able to query a plethora of language servers, one for each configuration, would be ideal, but we&#x27;re not there yet, and such a setup sounds way too fragile for my taste.<p>- YouCompleteMe:<p>Aside from C++, it provides amazing completion support for many other languages. It can even deal with java project files, if the readme is to be believed. Other than for C++, I mainly use it for python. It&#x27;s also good in plaintext files for completing words and file paths. I really love its substring matcher, just type gTFBT to get &quot;getTheFooBarThing&quot;. Downsides: 1. if your build system cannot produce a compile_commands.json file, you will need to write some python code to specify compilation flags; 2. compiles each file individually, so if some of your headers aren&#x27;t freestanding, you&#x27;ll get spurious errors when editing them.<p>- rtags:<p>Basically a language server from before the LSP protocol existed. Mainly developed for Emacs, but the Vim integration is good enough. Continuously indexes your source based on a compile_commands.json file. It can show you who calls a function or uses a variable, class hierarchies, virtual method overloads and more. I&#x27;ve seen it get confused if you jump branches and require you to delete and recreate the index, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that lately.<p>Apart from those I use a bunch of standard productivity plugins like unimpaired, surround, nerdtree, etc. etc. Vim 8&#x27;s gdb integration has been very welcome, too. I struggled to find a good interface to gdb previously, as everything seems to want to be Visual Studio and give you a restricted clicky interface, whereas I just wanted the current vim buffer to be synchronised with the instruction pointer and to write gdb commands directly.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m substantially slower in Vim than my colleagues in other editors and IDEs. Colleagues across the company use Vim, Emacs, VSCode, QtCreator, and Code::Blocks. The Windows developers are all on Visual Studio naturally. I haven&#x27;t noticed being slower than any of them. The above plugins are enough for the odd rename-refactor I have to do, and anything more substantial is so infrequent, that doing it manually doesn&#x27;t really have an impact. Also, developing on Linux, I always feel like any graphical application will just disintegrate or cause an unrecoverable freeze in the graphics driver at any random keystroke.<p>Back in the day I had to make do with just ctags, cscope and debugging straight from the commandline, lol. I do believe that Stallman&#x27;s refusal to allow easily plugging into GCC&#x27;s AST, like one can just use clang for indexing, held back C++ development tools on the Linux platform significantly. Eclipse&#x27;s CDT, KDevelop, Anjuta, Code::Blocks, NetBeans, etc. - they all suffered from having to write their own C++ indexers that were always inferior to getting semantic information straight from the compiler. I&#x27;m extremely grateful to the open-source community for the continuing work on development tools, and try to donate where I can. Watching the development tools landscape change over the years has been interesting - things don&#x27;t so much improve, as they evolve chaotically with an overall trend towards improvement. Like anything else on this platform. So far many IDEs have come and gone, but Vim is eternal.<p>I will say that using Vim is entirely up to your taste, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be substantially faster or slower than an IDE, so use what you like. It is much cheaper than Qt Creator or CLion (AFAIK for both you need a license to develop commercial software), so that might be a factor for you. Companies tend to have a big Windows development team, with a few Linux developers, so they buy bulk Visual Studio licenses and individual Linux IDE licenses, making the latter end up costing more per developer."],"time":["2020-09-03 21:34:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["parhamn"],"id":[24363960],"kids":[24364513],"parent":[24363225],"text":["Is there a LSPs in a box somewhere yet?"],"time":["2020-09-03 15:44:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wffurr"],"id":[24364218],"kids":{},"parent":[24363225],"text":["I didn&#x27;t think setting up YCM was too bad.

There&#x27;s very little likelihood this kind of thing would happen in well over 90%+ of the USA.<p>First off - if you&#x27;re renting - you&#x27;re not putting holes in the walls that go to the exterior and there certainly aren&#x27;t any already existing. I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of that in the USA - particularly for apartments.

If you had a balcony, that&#x27;s where it&#x27;d go, at best. Thirdly - where&#x27;s your power coming from!? Most of these units are 220V and usually there is only one or two 220V power outlets in American homes these days and they&#x27;re always dedicated to the washer+dryer. Maybe you have a third for an electric oven&#x2F;stove. (Or an electric water heater) You&#x27;d have to run new power lines and that involves tearing up the walls. You could try to find 110V mini-split AC units but they&#x27;re pretty uncommon in the USA (and much less powerful). As well, not having that AC on a dedicated breaker means you&#x27;ll be giving up all other outlets on that breaker whenever the AC is on, which could be a lot of essential outlets in esoteric places.<p>Great insight for someone who lives in Japan and someone who wants to see what it looks like to install AC in Japan.
