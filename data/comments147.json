In 2015, the company abandoned the self-serve market that had driven its original momentum and pivoted instead to vague and indefinite enterprise offerings that were (and are) hidden behind schizophrenic marketing, an impossible sales process, terrible customer service and a general approach of trying to extract the maximum amount of money from clients rather than providing them with value. From 2015 on, everything (including the internal culture) became mumbo-jumbo, a cloud of dishonesty.

First off, congrats to Optimizely &#x2F; Dan and co for the acquisition. For us Optimizely has always been a role model, especially from the technical side of things (I&#x27;m the founder of Kameleoon, but currently serving as CTO, so obviously I have a tech background). Optimizely was (and still is, in many ways) a great platform. And it did create (or at least, heavily helped develop) a whole market.\nHowever I agree with Feynman&#x27;s comment, the main problem with this company (and even looking from aside, it was quite obvious for us) was that they raised way too much money and made promises to their investors that were completely impossible to fulfill. Basically, it looked like they wanted to be compared to AirBNB, but their potential was honestly never the same, and this was quite clear from someone with a little insight into the business. Because of that, they started making mistakes after mistakes, burned way too much money and it all went downhill.<p>They&#x27;re not the only ones with that problem - almost all competitors &#x2F; actors in the field raised too much for the side of the market, from my opinion. Dynamic Yield is probably the one that did the best at that game, with a great exit when the hype was at its peak. But all the other ones are clearly in trouble (even Optimizely exit, I am sure, is clearly not a success for their investors, etc). The only actor that has a reasonable overall strategy is VWO (somebody asked if they&#x27;re were profitable - of course they are, since they did not receive any funding, they have to. While Optimizely clearly never was), because it stayed lean and avoided the pitfalls of over investments (going to all continents on the planet, having 20 offices all over the world, etc). Hats off to Paras for that. We try to stick to the same strategy at Kameleoon, even if we had to raise a bit of capital. But you don&#x27;t need to raise $200 millions to have a great CRO platform - we proved this for a fact.<p>About the switch to Enterprise - anyone in this industry will tell you it was absolutely necessary. Impossible to sell experimentation to SMB and expect to be profitable, you need larger customers. Because contrarily to Mailchimp for instance, a SMB customer paying $50 (or even $500) per month for a CRO platform won&#x27;t be able to operate it on its own and will churn. The problem with Optimizely pivot to Enterprise is not the pivot in itself, it&#x27;s how they did it (I heard some horrors stories from people inside Optimizely, not sure if they are true, but one thing is clear - it did not go well).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s still an exciting field, from the technical side of things, there are still many innovations to be done and we hope to spearhead that at Kameleoon :-)"],"time":["2020-09-04 13:46:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["designium"],"id":[24366183],"kids":[24366904,24366608],"parent":[24365479],"text":["I hope the founder exited well.

I&#x27;ll be grateful for the experience of selling experimentation into the European market, even if Optimizely was on a flat trajectory.  It is one of the most difficult things to sell.  The problem with experimentation is you are selling hard work.  Everyone says they want to be data-driven, but no one wants to do hard work.  No one wants to tell an executive he&#x2F;she is wrong and their idea sucks.  No one wants to do the work of building a culture.  It is akin to selling religion.<p>I&#x27;ll be most proud of the companies I sold to that then started doing internal webinars on how to do hypothesis-driven product development and really engaging in bottoms-up approach to experimentation.  Those deals took 12-36 months to close, but you felt like you were changing how they ran their business.<p>I see a lot of folks throwing shade on Optimizely here.  I think that is ridiculous.  Not many companies can grow to 300 employees and over $75 million in annual revenues.  Even fewer companies get to IPO.  Everyone&#x27;s thoughts about how Optimizely used to be worth more are BS.  Valuations are perceptions of product&#x2F;market strength rather than the reality. We shouldn&#x27;t be looking at this as a failure.  Rather we should look at this as a natural course of a business finding its product&#x2F;market fit.<p>Form a market perspective, Optimizely was hemmed in by big players like Adobe and Oracle who bought competitors to round out their marketing suites.  Adobe and Oracle do not care about their experimentation products and will give it away for pennies, so it isn&#x27;t like they are driving innovation. On the low-end, Optimizely created a bunch of fast followers.  VWO, ABTasty and Kameleoon, just to name a few copied not only the Optimizely tech but also their marketing in some cases and then just sold for cheaper.  Ultimately, the market decided that Experimentation technology just wasn&#x27;t super valuable (you still need to generate the test idea yourself).  The technology could be copied easily and many people didn&#x27;t care enough about it to change their cultures.<p>Outside of the market forces, Optimizely definitely made some mistakes.  You could make the argument that pricing and product development had issues in the past few years.<p>I think those were not the core issues.  I think the basic mistakes they made were in execution.  It is less sexy to talk about but ultimately if you have a great product and a need in the market, you still can&#x27;t win if you don&#x27;t execute properly.<p>Marketing execution was poor, Sales enablement was haphazard, Partnerships with other tech firms or agencies changed almost daily, and culturally, the organisation struggled to maintain the original culture it had around transparency.  It failed to realise that competitors had caught up to a bunch of core functionality it thought was unique.  It failed to market the new features that were differentiable.  It is easy to blame pricing or moving into &quot;enterprise&quot; as the issue because that is what people see on the outside.  I think that is unfair.  Many companies have done the same thing and it worked.  It is all down to execution.<p>Ultimately, I think Optimizely built a real market and culture in the tech world that experimentation matters and data matters.  The fact that you have a ton of copycat companies prove that others see it as valuable as well (I wonder how they&#x27;ll fair in the future).  Regardless of where it goes as part of Episerver, it will have brought loads of people into the world of experimentation, and I think that is a good thing for the world."],"time":["2020-09-04 11:43:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24365892],"kids":{},"parent":[24365479],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-03 18:43:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[24366609],"kids":{},"parent":[24365479],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Sz20v\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Sz20v<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 19:49:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dblooman"],"id":[24369440],"kids":[24371782,24374946,24369529,24373098,24374582,24369925],"parent":[24365479],"text":["Any alternatives to Optimizely?"],"time":["2020-09-04 00:08:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scottmcleod"],"id":[24370849],"kids":{},"parent":[24365479],"text":["Shot themself in the foot.

The court only found that a single program exposed by Snowden was illegal.  Snowden released a bunch of other information that was a violation of the NDA he signed when he was given a security clearance.<p>2. Even if all the information he disclosed revealed illegal activity, Snowden&#x27;s actions make him ineligible for whistleblower protection.  Whistleblower protection for the intelligence community[1] is only provided if a person follows the proper procedure to securely notify their Inspector General and&#x2F;or Congress.  Since he&#x27;s not automatically protected, it would take Congress or the President to decide to offer him protection.  Snowden (allegedly) did not even attempt to notify the proper authorities before going public with the information, so not only is he ineligible, it&#x27;s not likely that anyone will take pity on him.<p>3. There&#x27;s a chance that this ruling won&#x27;t stick as the legal system chugs along and a few more judges look at it, and even if they were willing to help Snowden, nobody in Congress is going to take action until there is some permanence with the ruling. IANAL, but I think this would be decided if the Supreme Court either decides to decline or hear the case.  If it&#x27;s declined, then it&#x27;s pretty much final.  If they decide to hear the case, then it could be another year or so before they make a decision.<p>[1] IC whistleblower protection is a little different than standard whistleblower protection: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intelligence_Community_Whistleblower_Protection_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intelligence_Community_Whistle...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 13:23:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["harry8"],"id":[24363072],"kids":{},"parent":[24362047],"text":["Crimes are no issue for the persecution of Snowden.<p>Clapper lied, on camera, under oath, admitted it and has had zero consequences.

I have even created a HackerNews account to be able to comment on it.<p>I have been searching for this type of ORM in Typescript for a while. I agree to write raw SQL for queries. So easy and expressive and one less layer of abstraction. I also agree on the value of the respository pattern and methods for CRUD operations to not write this SQL by hand. Making the loading  of associations an explicit decision is also the right way to go. The Rails community has good experience with performance surprises of automatic loading of relationships.<p>Personally I found the most useful ORM in Ecto for the Elixir (Erlang) language: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.html<\/a> (ignoring the query capability). It follows very much the repository pattern like Kiss ORM. The API is a bit more succinct  (you only define a schema for each table and use a generic repository instead of subclassing for each table) but that might be possible only due to Elixir&#x27;s language capabilities like meta-programming.<p>One piece of Ecto that might be a win to implement in Kiss ORM is the &quot;Changeset&quot; pattern to give a canonical, succinct and productive solution to validate data (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.Changeset.html#content\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;ecto&#x2F;Ecto.Changeset.html#content<\/a>). For example have a look at how Ecto unifies validation (checked without hitting the DB) and constraints (checked by hitting the DB) in a single API. This type of functionality increases the usefulness of the repository&#x27;s CRUD operations.<p>Thank&#x27;s for your initiative to create KISS ORM.

I&#x27;m pretty happy&#x2F;relieved to see other people playing around in the same space.<p>My perspective was (and is) that for portable devices (phones&#x2F;laptops) that are interfacing with locally hosted services, having SSL for those services is really important because your device probably isn&#x27;t configured to check what network it&#x27;s on before automatically pinging 192.168.1.x. This is doubly important if you have other people occasionally hopping onto your network and connecting to those same services. It&#x27;s imo bad practice to ask everyone connecting to your network to install certificates or set up a certificate manager. I wouldn&#x27;t do that for any of my personal devices if someone asked me to.<p>To push this a step farther, I imagined a world where my services could handle not just renewing their own certificates, but also updating their addresses if they were moved to a different network&#x2F;address.

Bachrach<p>Location: PARC - Bldg. 31<p>Subect: Comments on &quot;Draft Ethernet Overview&quot;<p>Organization: GSL - 44<p>I have read with dismay your presentation &quot;Draft Ethernet Overview&quot;. As I am sure you are aware, technically or conceptually there is nothing new in your proposal. Perhaps appropriately, you have chosen a coined jargon utilizing discredited scientific conceptual expression in which to frame your ideas. I find your analysis on the proposed interconnection lacking in technical credibility. Quantitative statistical analysis would show that your proposed system would be a failure. You have tried to adopt a scheme inappropriate to the intended engineering application. A random transmission scheme such as you propose, along with the quasi-de-randomizing hardware you invoke to patch the obvious deficiency, would place in fact an undo hardware, software, and scheduling problem on the individual stations.<p>You should seriously reconsider your basic premise and formulate fully and logically all the parameters necessary to evaluate the system. Your transmission medium or environment is not quantum noise limited. Simple analysis shows that imposing a poisson (i.e., random) statistics on message transmission drastically reduces the available effective bandwidth. Such a system is effective (reasonable) only in the limit of negligible average bit transmission rates. In fact you will want to maintain as high an effective transmission rate as possible. This requires a synchronized system. The fallacy in your conception is that the stations should be transmitting randomly. One possibility for a synchronized system would be time division multiplexing. You should seriously study how the telephone companies handle this problem. For example, the A.T.T Long lines T2 buried microwave link multiplexes close to 10^7 - 6 KHz channels.<p>Most importantly, you should fully define your engineering application before proceeding further. You specify an undefined message packet length, a 1 mile or 1 mile diameter look and 256 stations working ad 3Mbs rate. What is the nature of the station? How many bits transmitted does an activity require and what is the expected average rate that the 256 stations will be seeking use of the bus in the contemplated application? What is a tolerable dead time for a given station to acquire a full set of data? The worst case delay for your 1 mile loop is 2~ usec. what effect dos this have on far stations getting locked out, etc. . . ?<p>Robert Bachrach"],"time":["2020-03-08 13:00:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["timthorn"],"id":[22517548],"kids":{},"parent":[22517113],"text":["Should be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080528221818&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bytecoder.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;05&#x2F;25&#x2F;xerox-1974-ethernet-would-be-a-failure-robert-bachrach-response&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080528221818&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bytec...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-08 12:40:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tyingq"],"id":[22524576],"kids":{},"parent":[22517113],"text":["There&#x27;s an interesting interview where Metcalf shares his memory of the memo.<p>An excerpt:<p><i>&quot;Metcalfe: My mom used to say if you can’t say something nice about someone you should just hold your \ntongue. But Bachrach was a not nice person. Or is for that matter; he may still be around for all I know. \nHe was sort of a grouchy physicist on another floor in another lab, and he read my memo. And this is a \nphysicist. The phrase you didn’t catch in his now famous memo -- this memo’s posted all over the world \nbecause everyone thinks it’s a hoot that he wrote this memo -- he said the problem with Ethernet was that \nit was not quantum noise limited, which is a very physicist thing to say. Of course it’s not quantum noise \nlimited! That wasn’t the point. But he resented the fact that we were not using every shred of bandwidth \nthat was capable. I told you how we decided on the clock speed. There were gigabits per second of \ncapacity on that cable, and we were using a pitiful few megabits of it. But he was concerned that it \nwasn’t... And he did a nasty thing, and it was sort of an early lesson in nastiness, which is he wrote a \nmemo. He didn’t come see me. He didn’t say, “I just read your memo and I have a few questions about it”. He didn’t do that. He sent a memo to my boss’s boss accusing me of writing something that wasn’t \nnew and it wasn’t quantum [noise limited], completely making an idiot of himself. But it didn’t feel that way at the time. It felt kind of nasty. The next thing I know I’m in my boss’s boss’s office having to explain how this guy’s an idiot. Which he is, or was. To put it more kindly, he was from a different universe. I was in a computer science universe, he was in a physics universe. We were solving different problems and he should have minded his own business. Or at least come talk to me before sending a memo to my boss’s boss, so maybe I could save him the embarrassment. There are many places where I go where that memo is on the wall, pinned to some cubicle -- “the old Bachrach memo” -- because it’s just such a great example. Now Bachrach, I ran into him a decade or two after that unfortunate memo, whereupon he was letting it be known that he’d helped invent Ethernet.

One of the ways the virus kills people is by detroying their ACE2 receptors, which your lung cells need in order to function. Downregulating them is unlikely to prevent the virus from getting into your cells, rather it will just leave your cells with less healthy ones left over after the virus destroys the ones it uses to enter your cells.<p>As evidence from this epidemic, smoking cigarettes upregulates your ACE2 receptors, and smokers are less likely to get serious illness from COVID-19. Of course if they do get seriously ill then they&#x27;re more likely to die, but this is probably just because of the lung damage caused by smoking. At the very least it seems irresponsible to put out a statement like this without saying that all the available evidence currently points the opposite way, as does the evidence from the SARS epidemic."],"time":["2020-03-09 16:52:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ComputerGuru"],"id":[22526803],"kids":[22527227,22527190,22526851,22527116],"parent":[22525762],"text":["Where can one obtain raw (anonymized) data on individual cases?

Right now, I have to insert the full code snippet I want to run every. single. time. For scenarios where I want to modify the code snippet each time, this makes perfect sense, and is a valid first-class use-case that should stick around.

My own bias strongly suggests to me that adopting a model like this might lead to slightly more widespread success. Your bias may disagree. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s closer to the truth.<p>Regarding the SHA idea, the way I concretely imagine this might work is that you&#x27;d introduce an alternate, optional block start like &quot;`js SHA256:xxxxxxx&quot;, with the hash being applied to everything between the first and last lines (I think you might want to include the trailing newline after the script in the hash input - this will make life easier for those using editors that enforce one trailing newline).<p>This would indeed introduce massive redundancy - I now have to hash my blocks of code in order for them to run - but it would mean that people looking for code to run could straightforwardly and safely reference random stored functions (via something along the lines of &quot;@github-actions run <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;.......\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;.......<\/a>. SHA256:XXX&quot;) and they&#x27;ll only be run if the code matches its own checksum _along with_ the checksum in the run link.<p>I also think that perhaps there might be an explicit &quot;reference&quot; syntax, like &quot;@github-actions ref&quot; or something, for scenarios where the bot would be ignoring the code in question, and only running it when someone references it later. Perhaps in this scenario an alternate header format could be used that doesn&#x27;t cause the bot to be notified; perhaps this could be as simple as removing the @.<p>I&#x27;m imagining scenarios where issues get created then closed as a stashing ground for code snippets."],"time":["2020-03-09 17:51:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22525069],"kids":{},"parent":[22524781],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-09 14:15:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["poooogles"],"id":[22528365],"kids":[22531553,22528596,22528539,22529888,22529254,22528722],"parent":[22527921],"text":["The fact that we (the UK) only fined Facebook £500k [1] is an utter scandal.

The coolness factor and emerging business cases finally pressured them to make available snippets of their content that can be surfaced independent of presentation -- but as a twist, instead of sending composed documents, they largely turned to shipping around context-free snippets of data.

A lot of better writing about web standards back then is still relevant now. Keeping presentation separate from the structure of the document is a must and seems to be forgotten today. It also helps with you JavaScript if you keep everything nice and separate. I don&#x27;t particularly like the Asian guru terminology but It was all the rage at the time and everyone thought it was cool for some reason.<p>&gt; When a new medium borrows from an existing one, some of what it borrows makes sense, but much of the borrowing is thoughtless, “ritual,” and often constrains the new medium. Over time, the new medium develops its own conventions, throwing off existing conventions that don’t make sense.<p>This was quite apparent at the time IIRC. A lot of places at the time wanted a web page to almost like a printed page in a magazine and there was even a lot of magazine and newspaper style layout demos that you would find dotted about the web. Many of these designs are quite dated today because the designers were used to designing things for print rather than for web and never assumed that the content would change.<p>So the page looked great until you put some real content in it that was too long and then the nice layout wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>I also remember Lorem Ipsum was used everywhere because it &quot;flowed like real text&quot;. Except it really didn&#x27;t and you quickly found that it was utter nonsense.<p>Lorem Ipsum would look like it took the space on the page quite nicely and things would look decent on the PSD. Once you put in English or God forbid a RTL language like Arabic it didn&#x27;t work and everything again looked off and half arsed.<p>&gt; But beneath questions like “how do I make my pages look the same on every platform” and “how can I make my fonts appear identical on the Macintosh and Windows” is an underlying question – “how do I control the user’s browser?” Indeed, the word control turns up with surprising frequency.<p>I remember in the mid 2000s (I only just left University). I thought it was the absolute height of skill to have my website look the same on every browser that was available. Then I encountered a Macintosh and I realised that it was I was trying to do was impossible because Mac OS Snow Leopard had different mechanism for rendering fonts than Windows. It shook me to the core at the time, I think I barely said anything to anyone for 2 days as I didn&#x27;t really want to accept the fact that what I thought was pinnacle of ability with CSS wasn&#x27;t actually possible.

(See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ocregister.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;31-million-power-plant-built-at-john-wayne-airport&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ocregister.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;31-million-power-plant...<\/a>)  So I was very interested in exploring similar solutions for where I worked, but at a smaller scale: The building already had an emergency generator for essentials (security, emergency lighting, water, and elevators); the only thing missing coverage was the data center.  But Bloom was too immature at the time.<p>And today, I&#x27;m lucky enough to be in an area that was not affected by PG&amp;E&#x27;s recent Public Safety Power Shutoffs (work also was not affected), but there&#x27;s no guarantee that I&#x27;ll be similarly lucky next time around.  And my apartment is all-electric, with gas being used only to provide hot water.  If heating is needed, and the power is out, them I&#x27;m stuck.<p>Until reading this article, I occasionally would think of Bloom Energy, and how a Bloom Box would be nice as a temporary or last-resort thing, where a generator might otherwise be installed.  And I was getting annoyed at how some communities banning new natural gas installations would block that, even though PG&amp;E is not really in a state to be trusted.<p>And now I read this article.  And I am really annoyed.  No, a Bloom Box is not the best or most efficient technology compared to, say, wind power.  But when you have natural gas available, and an unstable electric grid, a Bloom Box always seemed to me to be a good backup power source.  Except who knows what&#x27;s going to happen to them now.  Maybe someone will be able to iterate on the technology, and hopefully not become so loaded down with funding&#x2F;debt that they feel the need to promise the stars."],"time":["2020-03-09 05:40:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["forkexec"],"id":[22523432],"kids":{},"parent":[22521961],"text":["IIRC, the fuel cells wear out and better technologies are more expensive to produce.<p>My mom lives in Paradise and she would&#x27;ve bought a FC generator with an ATS if such a mythical creature were affordable and lasted at least as long as a natural gas generator.<p>It seems like more work needs to be done to produce FC cells that last far longer even if they&#x27;re physically larger.

So take what I&#x27;m saying with a grain of salt:<p>* Don&#x27;t count on contracting or remote work as a fallback. I&#x27;ve been trying my luck at it without success. The last time I did it was 5 years ago but it&#x27;s totally saturated now, with most of the clients going through upwork.com and freelancer.com with 10-50 applications per gig. Go see for yourself under common searches like PHP or React.<p>* The jobs really will all dry up. Go on something like indeed.com right now and see how many there are. Now imagine the same scenario after everyone has cut their workforce by 10-50% like after the dot bomb in 2000 or the housing bubble popping in 2008. Your selection may change from software developer to driving a delivery truck so it&#x27;s good to have something you can fall back on. In my case it&#x27;s moving furniture, but, at 42 I&#x27;m getting too old to do it. There will probably always be work in warehouses and restaurants though, like in the old ITT tech commercial.<p>* Assume that any possessions other than big ticket items like a home or car are only worth 10% of their value. You can get 25% at a pawn shop generally, but not after a recession when everything gets dumped on the market in triplicate. So all of the consumer electronics in your home are probably worth less than $1000 and won’t sustain you for long even if you sell all of them.<p>* Find your poorest friends or relatives right now and ask them how they get by. This is a good time to learn about donating plasma, collecting unemployment insurance, signing up for food stamps, etc. You’ll be able to make about $300-600 per month through these sorts of tools, but it will take all of your time. The US no longer has an operational social safety net (compared to healthy economies in, say, Europe) so the psychological toll of poverty has a way of locking people into its cycle by paying just barely enough to keep you in a state of slow decline. Best to avoid that by arming yourself with knowledge and knowing your rights.<p>* Consider getting involved in politics. The problems looming in this next recession are severe and exacerbated by the fact that no real legislation happened to correct the original causes of the 2008 great recession. Expect there to be no cash or credit available. Millions of people will be calling for reforms and there could be ways to help in causes like a new version of Occupy Wall Street. Assume that politicians are asleep at the wheel on this so any help from them will either not come or be too little too late. We’ll have to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps again.<p>This will be the third severe recession I’ve gone through since I graduated from college in 1999. Unfortunately my brain has adapted for survival instead of contributing to society at the level I had hoped for. I’m planning on the next recession lasting at least 3 years, starting around the time of the election. If it starts by summer, then Trump will almost certainly lose, so in the meantime we can count on an influx of capital from the private sector to keep us afloat. But next winter could be quite grim. Try to have enough money on hand to make rent until spring, roughly $3-6,000 for the average American. Note that the bottom half of the country has no savings, so there’s nothing they can really do to hedge against what’s coming."],"time":["2020-03-09 23:41:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Gusen"],"id":[22528447],"kids":{},"parent":[22527383],"text":["So you are telling us the Dow Jones is down 6,000 in the last week because of a sickness with a death rate of 2.3%...are you sure it could not be something else?\nGlobal stock markets have lost $6 trillion in value in six days.

This was all before the coronavirus. My rationale for this was simply that we were in the longest bull market in modern history, we were likely closer to the top than the bottom and because of certain FIRE tendencies [1] I decided my time horizon had shrunk to less than 5 years, at which point I decided it was more prudent to get out of equities.<p>For the last several years I wondered what triggered the eventual correction. By &quot;correction&quot; I mean there&#x27;ll eventually be a reversion to mean that will, for a time, cause the market to be oversold. Traditionally this is a good time to buy but it can be hard to get anywhere near the local bottom (this is where the term &quot;dead cat bounce&quot; originates).<p>I didn&#x27;t think it would be anything like 2000. We have some tech giants around $1T market caps now but they are money generating machines the likes of which probably hasn&#x27;t been seen since the era of Standard Oil and the rail barons (whereas 2000 was purely speculative). It didn&#x27;t seem like real estate would be the trigger either.<p>I thought it might be the possibility of a trade war with China but, on further inspection, it seems China may well be more vulnerable to that than the US. Still, China has a way of thinking long term that&#x27;s simply nonexistent in US politics.<p>Certainly when I heard about this new virus, I didn&#x27;t think it would be it. AFter all, we&#x27;d had SARS. But SARS was in some ways too effective and it basically burned out really quickly so never threatened a pandemic.<p>But this? The problem here isn&#x27;t the disease. After all, for most people, it&#x27;ll likely just be a bad flu. The problem is the changing behaviour it will cause because there seems to be such a long period of being contagious while asymptomatic while being highly contagious.<p>Some airlines are down 40%+ this year. Some cruise lines are even worse off than that. With travel being impacted, so are hotels, restaurants, tourism, etc. Any large public gatherings are likely to be curtailed (either officially or just effectively as people stay away).<p>As soon as I saw there were cases in California where the source couldn&#x27;t be identified I thought &quot;well that&#x27;s game over for containment&quot;.

I&#x27;ve got a friend who is a nurse and they&#x27;ve been told to use each mask (N95) for 8 hours putting it in a brown paper bag while they are on break&#x2F;eating.

Fair enough. Seems like a silly proclamation to make but there&#x27;s a class of people who like to make these claims. Suspiciously these people tend to be the folks who are uniquely driven, but that&#x27;s just my bias, I suppose.<p>----------------------------<p>I do think a lot of this sentiment from Musk and others in this thread come as a result of a pretty naive way of looking at learning. For illustration purposes, let&#x27;s go with a story.<p>When I was in high school, I fell in love with the band Rage Against the Machine. Because I was a curious sort, I listed out all the books listed in the linear notes of _Evil Empire_ and tried to read as many as I could. I have a distinct memory of sitting on the floor at my childhood home with a copy of Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s _Mismeasure of Man_ and a dictionary. I was smarter than average, I guess, but I really was floored at just how many words in that book I didn&#x27;t know. I may&#x27;ve made my way through 1&#x2F;3 or 1&#x2F;2 of the book before I was too exhausted to continue.<p>In college, I studied philosophy. For whatever reason, I fell in love with the subject and exclusively focused on that in college. Well, that love lasted until roughly senior year when I realized that I had fallen out of love with the subject and had zero interest in pursuing the subject as a career. That really sucked for me since I had put all my eggs into one basket. I hadn&#x27;t really focused on taking courses which provide hard, technical skills which I could leverage into easily acquired job opportunities. It also sucked that I graduated in 2007 and while the full on financial crisis hadn&#x27;t hit just yet, the easy throws were there so I had a hard time finding a job. I luckily got a job at an academic library and moved on with my life focusing on developing the skills needed for a long-term job.<p>The sense that I had squandered my time in college was a malignant wound on my psyche and I would&#x27;ve been sympathetic to the views that Musk and others hold now. One day when I was shelving books in the stacks, I happened upon Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s _Mismeasure of Man_. I remember reflecting on the memory of me in high school and picked the book up to see, almost on a lark, whether it was still mystifying to me. I scanned a paragraph here and there as I flipped through the book and was absolutely shocked. Those words which were barriers to the high school version of myself? Easy. I knew them. Not only did I know them but I knew the historical backstory and context to the topic that Gould was presenting. I knew the pro arguments, the con arguments, the responses each side would have to the cons. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.<p>Ever since that experience, I&#x27;ve been left with a fairly firm belief that we just do not have adequate ways of quantifying learning when it comes to the liberal arts<i>. It isn&#x27;t tangible. We can&#x27;t easily do tests to see if people can communicate more clearly. Whether they can analyze arguments. Whether they have a cultural context to understand why people believe what they believe. As a consequence a certain set of people love to disparage the whole enterprise. It&#x27;s really unfortunate since it seems pretty self-evident that those skills, that awareness is extremely valuable, both to the individual and to the society as a whole. It&#x27;s fair for someone to disagree on the merits and I am sure there are thoughtful people who do, but the larger belief that this experience inspired is a humility when it comes to casting aside things which aren&#x27;t easily measurable. That cynicism has stuck with me and has proven to be extremely valuable in my professional life since the KPIs and measurements which organizations love to fetishize are those which just so happen to be the easiest to measure.<p><\/i> Yes, Gould was a biologist. Yes, that book was about evolutionary biology and certain specialties in psychology. But the crux of the book was a really in the liberal arts sphere of things."],"time":["2020-03-10 15:51:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["planetzero"],"id":[22531286],"kids":[22531316],"parent":[22531186],"text":["Unless you&#x27;re going to college for engineering, math, the sciences, or to become a doctor, college really isn&#x27;t for learning.<p>It&#x27;s for having fun and to some degree networking.
