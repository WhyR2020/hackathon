During one summer hike with nice weather forecast for the week, I indeed had hot and sunny days but also rain, wind, cold temperatures and even a sudden snowstorm.<p>- Staying dry really matters, once wet you get cold much faster.\n- Sleep really matters. If you can&#x27;t find a reasonable place or shelter to rest after an exhausting day, your ability to carry on the next day sharply decreases. Learned that on my caribbean trip where I got stuck above a waterfall one evening, was raining, got wet, cold, no place to lie down and rest and had to admit I wouldn&#x27;t have the strength to climb back the next day.\n- When stuck or in a tough spot, remember that under stress you might not think as straight as you could. Do an inventory of your equipment. My first sleepless night in the rain I used my emergency blanket: such a mild protection, took me a day to realize a had a bigger tarp that proved much more useful as a protection against the elements.\n- A bright colored jacket helps rescue teams to locate you. (like a red &#x2F; orange one)\n- Have a map of the terrain, learn to orient &#x2F; situate yourself. Being lost is not the same as facing a difficult position, better not combine those issues ;)\n- Better have some way of communication and people aware of your whereabouts.\n- When cold, cover your head, you lose up to half your heat there.

Then I felt things went downhill.<p>&gt; One such effort was the Semantic Web. The dream was to create a Resource Description Framework (editorial note: run away from any team which seeks to create a framework), which would allow metadata about content to be universally expressed. For example, rather than creating a nice web page about my Corvette Stingray, I could make an RDF document describing its size, color, and the number of speeding tickets I had gotten while driving it.<p>&gt; This is, of course, in no way a bad idea. But the format was XML based, and there was a big chicken-and-egg problem between having the entire world documented, and having the browsers do anything useful with that documentation.<p>The author completely falls short to describe the evolution of the SemWeb over the past 10 years. Tons of specs, several declarative languages and technologies have been grown to not just get beyond the verbosity of a serialization format such as XML, but also move away from the classic relational data model.<p>Turtle, JSON-LD, SPARQL, Neo4J, Linked Data Fragments,... come to mind. And then there are the emerging applications of linked data. If anything, the Federated Web is exactly about URLs and semantic web technologies based on linking and contextualizing data.<p>The entire premise of Tim Berner Lee&#x27;s Solid&#x2F;Inrupt is based on these standards including URI&#x27;s.<p>Linked data and federation isn&#x27;t just about challenging social media, it&#x27;s also about creating knowledge graphs - such as wikidata.org - and creating opportunities for things such as open access and open science.<p>Then there&#x27;s this:<p>&gt; httpRange-14 sought to answer the fundamental question of what a URL is. Does a URL always refer to a document, or can it refer to anything? Can I have a URL which points to my car?<p>&gt; They didn’t attempt to answer that question in any satisfying manner. Instead they focused on how and when we can use 303 redirects to point users from links which aren’t documents to ones which are, and when we can use URL fragments (the bit after the ‘#’) to point users to linked data.<p>Err. They did.<p>That&#x27;s what the Resource Description Framework is all about. It gives you a few foundational building blocks for describing the world. Even more so, URI&#x27;s have absolutely NOTHING to do with HTTP status codes. It just so happens that HTTP leverages URI&#x27;s and creates a subset called HTTP URL&#x27;s that allows the identification and dereference of webbased resources.<p>You can use URI&#x27;s as globally unique identifiers in a database. You could use URN&#x27;s to identify books. For instance urn:isbn:0451450523 is an identifier for the 1968 novel The Last Unicorn.<p>So, this is a false claim. I could forgive them for inadvertently not looking beyond URL&#x27;s as a mechanism used within the context of HTTP communication.<p>&gt; In the world of web applications, it can be a little odd to think of the basis for the web being the hyperlink. It is a method of linking one document to another, which was gradually augmented with styling, code execution, sessions, authentication, and ultimately became the social shared computing experience so many 70s researchers were trying (and failing) to create. Ultimately, the conclusion is just as true for any project or startup today as it was then: all that matters is adoption. If you can get people to use it, however slipshod it might be, they will help you craft it into what they need. The corollary is, of course, no one is using it, it doesn’t matter how technically sound it might be. There are countless tools which millions of hours of work went into which precisely no one uses today.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what the conclusion is here. Did the &#x27;hyperlink&#x27; fail? did the concept of a &#x27;URI&#x27; fail? (both are different things!) Because neither failed, on the contrary!<p>Then there&#x27;s this wonky comparison of the origin of the Web with a single project or a startup. The author did the entire research on the history of the URI but they still failed to see that the Internet and the Web were invented by committee and by coincidence. Pioneers all over the place had good ideas, some coalesced and succeeded, others didn&#x27;t. Some were adapted to work together in a piece-meal fashion such as Basic Auth.<p>And that&#x27;s totally normal. Organic growth and distribute development is the baseline. Yes, the Web as we know it today is the result of many competing voices, but at the same time it could only work if everyone ended up agreeing over the basics.<p>The fact of the matter is that some companies - looking at you FAANG - would rather have us all locked in a closed, black-box ecosystems, rather then having open standards around that allow for interoperability, and thus create opportunities for new threats to challenge their business interests.<p>I understand that the article is written by CloudFlare, a CDN company with its own interests.

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>172 page PDF [last update: March|3|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

Stalking by strangers and acquaintances has gotten out of hand in (at least) the past five years. (Any such behavior against me has since calmed down in the past year, after reworking my digital devices, but the effects have had significant impact on me. I also dropped out and gave up on life this past year, which may make me a much less interesting target to harass.)<p>Such technologies are part of an ongoing increase in information and power asymmetries that can be abused to harass innocent competitors, as has happened to me. I’ve had strangers come up to me in public and discuss specifics of my private life, including non public details about my since failed startup, and personal&#x2F;private comms. Concurrently, I was falsely accused of a serious crime and was put under the microscope and harassed on a regular basis by strangers regarding this. It became apparent that my life was completely owned at that point, digitally and publicly. It amounted to ongoing bullying which really pushed me beyond thresholds of learned helplessness already long since established.<p>There seems to be no recourse against this behavior. If you have a digital “kick me” sign attached to your back, there’s little you can do to remove it, short of avoiding being in public. Or, as in my case, one can drop out of life, go homeless, give up all of your assets, and prepare for suicide. Strangers can verbally harass&#x2F;own&#x2F;gaslight others, maintain perfect plausible deniability, have perfect encryption to cover their tracks, and devastate people who aren’t equipped to deal with this behavior.<p>Evolution of survival going forward is trending towards resilience to increasingly sophisticated psychological violence and harassment, as well as the ability to accept being an unwitting voyeur in all public places.<p>One of the most difficult aspects to this was reporting these incidents (admittedly, under duress in the heat of the moment), and being told that I must be delusional and mentally ill. To me, the delusion is genuinely believing that technology is not used to stalk or harass people in public. As a counterpoint, I will say that being stalked repeatedly does increase your paranoia, so you’ll start to look over your shoulder at every turn. If you believe that all of your devices and accounts are hacked and being used to harass you, the complete lack of digital privacy can have a profound impact on sanity.<p>To this day, I’m utterly freaked out by the presence of personal cameras, to the point where I’ve nudged people in the community to be aware of the cultural impact of holding phones vertically in coffee shops or other public places. As most people are of course good natured, I’ve noticed a trend in the places that I frequent towards people being more prudent in this regard. I personally cover the public facing back camera on my phone with my index finger as a matter of habit by now, to avoid pointing it at strangers in public. Personally I believe responsibility amongst the tech elite would include immediate installation of physical shutters that open only when a camera is in use. Shutters can be colored blue or yellow, perhaps as a culturally standardized signal that the camera is “closed”.<p>There’s clear benefit to tech such as Clearview but the potential for abuse by irresponsible or immoral actors is tremendous. As someone pointed out, such tech can be rolled yourself. It seems that the problem is therefore out of control. Welcome to the age of unwitting voyeurism.<p>Edit: I did make a comment on the linked NYT article, including my real identity. In this comment, I called out at least one person involved in shenanigans against me. This person name dropped {} as someone who would recognize him, before he trashed my startup without seeing it, encouraged me to drop out of my continuing Computer Science studies at the local University (due to the bad rep I would receive for doing so as a middle age adult, so he said), and then threatened my career&#x2F;reputation if I told the truth about specific stalking incidents, all in one conversation. Not long thereafter, I experienced a stalking incident in public by two men with walkie talkies who harassed me about said startup, mentioning non-public specifics about an engagement we were seeking. In retrospect, these men could have been using tech such as Clearview to more easily enable their stalking and harassment of me. The location of this incident was the playground of wealthy folks in my city’s most affluent public area.

The idea was that you, as an author, would <i>pick<\/i> one of these services, set up an account with it, and <i>point<\/i> it at your RSS feed URL; and then you&#x27;d put a link to that service on your page, which your users could then subscribe to, in place of subscribing to your site itself. Just like a regular email-notification service, but with the webhook part &quot;turned around&quot; so that it&#x27;s the service poking your server, rather than your server poking the service.<p>&quot;RSS Readers&quot; were never meant to happen; RSS was never meant to be used as a direct link between authors and users. If you think about it, such a direct M:N link is exactly the opposite of what an author with a simple static resource-constrained blog wants—their whole user-base would now constantly be polling their (or their ISP&#x27;s) dinky little server! (But it&#x27;s fine in practice, since we eventually got Cloudflare and PuSH.)<p>If you&#x27;re a content author with a full-on web-app, you <i>can<\/i> call out (with webhooks, or messages in a message queue, or even API calls to a service like Sendgrid or Twilio), and so, for you, RSS is unnecessary. As we&#x27;ve seen higher-level PaaS-style personal web hosts like Netlify, Squarespace, and WordPress.com supplant the old-school Apache public_html&#x2F;-style hosting, fewer and fewer authors have <i>needed<\/i> RSS, because they&#x27;ve had access to other methods to deliver notifications directly.<p>As well, microblogging (mostly in the form of posting links to your new blog posts on either a Twitter account, Facebook page, or subreddit dedicated to your blog) <i>also<\/i> take the place of notifications of new content on the blog, as well as providing the bonus feature of moving the &quot;comments section&quot; of your posts outside the blog itself, such that you no longer need to host or moderate it. Many people today combine a static-site-generator blog on S3&#x2F;Github Pages&#x2F;etc. (having no real &quot;front page&quot;, only at most an &quot;all posts&quot; archive for web spiders) with an external, mostly-ephemeral social-network-microblog &quot;index&quot; of their blog.<p>RSS still exists for those authors who it serves, of course; but it&#x27;s always been an author-side feature, and so, if you&#x27;re seeing it less, it&#x27;s because fewer authors need it.<p>(And, if this annoys you as a consumer-of-feeds, know that RSS is probably not the universal-notifications-infrastructure you want. Please don&#x27;t write gateways that scrape pages and spit out RSS. If anything, emit emails. Mail readers are a strict superset of RSS readers, and usually do everything RSS readers do better than RSS readers do those things; but that&#x27;s a topic for another post.)"],"time":["2020-03-06 02:52:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mc3"],"id":[22501199],"kids":{},"parent":[22497184],"text":["I&#x27;d really prefer RSS instead of marketing emails I choose to opt in to.

So my option to buy a book that was in public domain started at $17.95.  My experience at this point was that I would come in and look for something and it usually wouldn&#x27;t be there.

Employees that didn&#x27;t hit or beat their average call duration targets got put on a performance improvement plan, and then ultimately laid off.<p>That average call time was then steadily reduced in stages.  It was a great success, the average call duration dropped rapidly.  What was happening was employees would &quot;accidentally&quot; disconnect customers if they came close to the target call time.  Or just randomly drop calls early on if they were worried their average was too high.   Customer dissatisfaction was significantly higher.  Call volume was higher (but not everyone bothered to call back).  Average call duration was down though, so big success!  Customer retention was getting worse, but that, of course, was tracked under a different silo by a different team who had nothing to do with the support org.<p>At one stage, they actually dropped the target average call duration to less time than it took to reboot a NTL router &#x2F; set top box, which was the very first thing customers were advised to do by support agents.

You see, there&#x27;s not just one NaN, but many, with different &quot;payloads&quot;, intended to indicate the source of the error leading to a NaN.  The payload gets propagated through arithmetic.  But what happens when both operands are NaN, with different payloads?  The standard says that the result is one or the other of these NaNs, but leaves unspecified which.<p>The old Intel FPU chose the NaN with the larger payload, which gives results independent of the operand order.

And so we get non-commutative addition and multiplication.<p>The compilers, of course, assume these operations are commutative, so the results are completely arbitrary.<p>One practical effect:  In R, missing data - NA - is implemented as a NaN with a particular payload.  So in R, if you write something like NA+sqrt(-1), you arbitrarily get either NA or NaN as the result, and you probably get the opposite for sqrt(-1)+NA.

Even that was stressful, and involved multiple trips; I would have had an even easier time if I had a similarly-sized van (of the cargo variety, or even a minivan if all the middle and rear seats are removable) or pickup.  Yet, it was still possible.<p>This same vehicle comfortably hauls myself and 4 passengers (and has done so a multitude of times, with passengers ranging from fussy nieces&#x2F;nephews in car seats to coworkers to drinking buddies to grandparents and everyone and everything in between).  Hell, it can do so even while hauling a bit of cargo in the back.  It gets me to work and back.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to towing capacity since I don&#x27;t tow anything (I don&#x27;t even have a hitch, though I&#x27;ve been tempted to buy one).  I know plenty of people who do tow with their SUVs, though.  I also know that there are times I wish I can tow (for example: a trailer would&#x27;ve also helped with moving logistics).<p>&gt; they do not handle inclement weather better than a smaller car with similar technology—such as all wheel drive—which many have.<p>This is patently false when you take ground clearance into consideration.  I sometimes need to be able to drive through a foot (or more!) of snow, and would prefer to do so without my headlights being used as a snowplow, thank you very much.<p>&gt; In addition to the higher sticker price, owners of big cars pay hundreds if not thousands of dollars more every year in gas because the gigantic car is so much less fuel efficient.<p>Hm, if only there was a drivetrain that used electricity from my house or a public charging station instead of petroleum.<p>(Not that my SUV has such a drivetrain, given that it predates the relatively-widespread availability of electric SUVs by nearly two decades, but still)<p>&gt; SUVs and trucks are now so profoundly gigantic they no longer fit in the already pretty large suburban American garages constructed to store said cars.<p>Clarification: <i>some<\/i> SUVs and trucks are too big to fit in garages.  The author apparently lacks zero comprehension of the idea that there&#x27;s such a thing as &quot;mid-size&quot; and &quot;compact&quot; SUVs and pickups, instead pretending that literally the only options are Canyonero-esque monstrosities.<p>Has the author never seen a CR-V?  Or a RAV-4?  Or a Rogue?  That category of SUV (a.k.a. &quot;crossover&quot; SUVs) accounts for more than 50% of the American SUV market.  When those stop fitting in garages, then sure, go ahead and start punching that strawman again.<p>The Ranger and Tacoma are also still reasonably-sized, though I&#x27;ll admit they&#x27;ve grown a fair bit since the 90&#x27;s&#x2F;00&#x27;s.<p>&gt; Large vehicles mean roads wear out faster and need more repairs<p>&quot;Large vehicles&quot; being semi trucks, the author surely means.  One semi causes the equivalent damage to a road as thousands of cars.  The difference between a sedan and even a full-size SUV (let alone compact or mid-size) is negligible in comparison.<p>----<p>Like yeah, sure, I&#x27;m happy to mock the folks buying big SUVs and pickups to compensate for certain idadequacies, but if you could avoid throwing those of us who actually do need those capabilities under the bus that&#x27;d be great."],"time":["2020-03-06 06:03:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rv-de"],"id":[22499291],"kids":{},"parent":[22497198],"text":["F&#x27;ck SUVs - I&#x27;d love to see a movement directly aimed at these embodiments of egotism and antisocial personality disorder."],"time":["2020-03-06 00:00:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["m463"],"id":[22499343],"kids":{},"parent":[22497198],"text":["The tesla cybertruck should be able to park itself.<p>The tesla model s could pull itself into and out of the garage for almost 4 years now.<p>(in regard to the original article)"],"time":["2020-03-06 00:07:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["avalys"],"id":[22497827],"kids":[22497941,22497984,22498100,22510227],"parent":[22497198],"text":["Article is written by someone who does not own a truck or SUV and consists mainly of him sneering in superiority at those who do.<p>Aaron Gordon, whoever you are:  mind your own damn business."],"time":["2020-03-05 21:29:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alasdair_"],"id":[22490300],"kids":[22490340],"parent":[22490045],"text":["All FAANG+M companies in Seattle have had similar advice today - it was recommended by the King County health department a few hours ago."],"time":["2020-03-05 03:11:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["femto113"],"id":[22491097],"kids":{},"parent":[22490045],"text":["Overhead in SLU today “at least I can finally find an empty conference room”.<p>For non Seattle folk SLU is South Lake Union, home to many Amazon buildings as well as Google and Facebook"],"time":["2020-03-05 05:58:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["01100011"],"id":[22490260],"kids":[22490352],"parent":[22490045],"text":["I don&#x27;t work at MS, just a valley tech company.

Maybe a company could have a hybrid of that idea, allow people to work at home but also have a office that&#x27;s sorta more like a co-working space but open to their employees only.<p>Then another thing that&#x27;s lame about remote work is you have to limit the location people can work remotely due to employment regulations, so if your company is in California you aren&#x27;t allowed to hire someone from Ohio without doing a bunch of extra paperwork and expenses. I got a job offer for a company in San Francisco but wasn&#x27;t sure about it 100% or if it&#x27;d last so I thought trying remote would be interesting and then transition but the HR person told me no even though she was interested in me. But I guess they didn&#x27;t want to register in other states, paying taxes in multiple states, payroll, some states require worker comp and probably applies if you work from home even, etc as it would create a bigger Nexus for a company with a handful of requirements for a state the HR person has never even visited or has an address in the state even (so they have to pay for a virtual office service, a agent for the company in the state and add extra costs and administration since some states won&#x27;t accept a out of state address for some paperwork). So many companies unless it&#x27;s already big with locations all over the US rather just deal with a single state for now... Then businesses large enough to meet the requirement have to file equal opportunity reports, what location do you put down? Someone&#x27;s house (then fill out a separate form for every house - so 50 employees is 50 locations if no office in the area they could visit?), the virtual office address or what? Sounds like some say the office they report too, but if you worked remotely for a company in California from Ohio where they don&#x27;t have a brick and mortar regional office seems to complicate things. Maybe in that case you report to their California office even if you never fly to or visit California? Seems like the laws were written never considered the possibility of working remotely and different answers depending on who you ask.<p>But the whole remote thing can get even more confusing, like apparently if you work for a company in New York remotely and a few other states they wants you to pay income taxes even if you never visited the state due to them considering it telecommuting even if you never psychically commute there, so double taxes even though your state will let you credit taxes paid to others, I expect NY would be much higher... Plus there&#x27;s conflicting info and other things if you look up this type of stuff.<p>Someone lived in Tennessee and was found to owe Taxes to New York. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biglawinvestor.com&#x2F;new-york-telecommuting-tax-penalty&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biglawinvestor.com&#x2F;new-york-telecommuting-tax-pe...<\/a><p>&gt; If you work remotely for a company based in New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Nebraska or New Jersey, even if you physically never step foot in those states, you may be subject to state income tax in those states.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t make sense according to what the HR person said, if they had to setup in your own state to hire you wouldn&#x27;t it credited as payroll taxes in your state instead of New York? Then if you lived in Ohio full time and tried to claim New York taxes as a credit for working full time, I wonder if that&#x27;s a huge red flag as they&#x27;d probably assume you psychically commuted instead of working remotely. Especially if you live in a lower tax state where due to the credit given to higher taxed New York so you ended up owning nothing to your state, paying all your income to state not close enough to commute to everyday by car.<p>Then I know Delaware is popular for incorporating too even if a company puts their HQ in California... Surprised everyone at the GooglePlex in California isn&#x27;t considered to be working remotely in Delaware?<p>Then some states say you owe taxes just for checking email while waiting in the Airport during a layover, so some companies track where employees are and pay taxes in multiple states, but some companies aren&#x27;t capable enough to deal with this stuff since the big assumption is a employee is just staying at one location and seems like a grey area. So technically if you send your employees to a conference or trade show in another state, opening up another can of extra compliance, however I feel like a lot of companies probably just ignore this unless they make it a regular thing.<p>Then remember seeing if you are a contractor like a plumber, a business and employee is expected to file and pay taxes in every single city they visit a customer so that can add up too - but not every state allows cities to tax people and some have proposals to simplify this. Some contractors might visit a city one off if they aren&#x27;t big enough but I guess some might just limit their service area but I know we had a roofer come from a hour away once, and tons of little small cities in between. So if a one off job, and then some cities expect you to keep filing even if zero and not all cities even put the forms online. I know one idea was to just let the state administer the city taxes as part of the regular state tax forms, then the state would forward the money to each city what they are owed and take a 1 or 2% cut for doing it, but cities wasn&#x27;t happy with this idea and rather do it themselves. Then in some states like Michigan, was reading tax software won&#x27;t even handle cities.<p>Confusing stuff... I guess this is something you&#x27;d have to probably hire a knowledge HR person to help you deal with this stuff, but who knows if the know all the little details when dealing with multiple states. I guess for a single person it&#x27;s not worth it, so easier just to tell someone from Ohio no if they aren&#x27;t willing to move to California right away. Seems like every states have stuff like this, be cool if some state encouraged fiber internet, remote work and relaxed regulations for remote companies - I guess instead people are forced to move even if they could work remotely technically but can&#x27;t due to the bureaucracy and red tape burden getting in the way. So sounds like states will end up losing both residents and income instead of making some money they make zero. Same with how some affiliate programs banned people from Ohio participating, sending them a email with a short notice to stop sending traffic. However I guess the larger corporations like Google probably can hire people remotely nationwide since they are big enough to handle the extra burdens imposed by every state where they have people working remotely. Then cities and county has extra stuff too... Also wonder how OSHA works with remote, if you are on the clock and run to the bathroom in your house and ended up tripping and stubbing your toe... Is that a accident report just as if you worked from the office? Then what about the employment posters if working remotely - and even some cities have their own too... I guess make them available on the internal website maybe as I doubt someone would hang those on the wall in their bedroom. but another thing to monitor and keep up to date across all the locations people work remotely from. Also looks like some states even require you to reimburse them for internet access, but some make you track what&#x27;s person or business? Sounds a bit annoying but might be a good perk... Free internet from your company if you work from home!<p>Maybe the tech and culture isn&#x27;t holding back remote work, but the government putting all these artificial limitations. I wish we&#x27;d have some modern tax reforms and even take advantage of tech. My favorite idea I&#x27;ve had for a while would just cut all payments for a flat tax, sorta like how PayPal takes a transaction fee for every payment. Have the gov take a transaction fee and have some agency that&#x27;s responsible for redistributing it to states and cities, so as a business it&#x27;d be super simple.<p>Stuff like this is a bit discouraging, you&#x27;d think 2020 remote work would be easier. As someone who dreams of a startup, I think making a MVP&#x2F;prototype and seeking investors to relocate to a bigger city, renting office space would be the best path and just hire people locally would be simpler. Unfortunately I feel it&#x27;s a disadvantaged though since talented people all across the country or even world that could be a good fit but can&#x27;t just easily hire them remotely due to all the red tape. Just seems crazy if you hire someone remotely from across the country, you have a pile of regulations to follow like a brick and mortar business locally would. So I could see why a business in California would say no to wanting to deal with hiring people remotely, they have so much stuff in Ohio to deal with just for one person. Seems easier to just say no or require relocating to where the company is located. Just seems like the ways the regulations are or read doesn&#x27;t really consider remote at all. Not sure if places would embrace it, seems like remote businesses would cut down on things like property taxes too... Why cater to Google across the country when you could try and force them to build a local regional office?"],"time":["2020-03-06 01:22:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lykr0n"],"id":[22499206],"kids":[22499273,22499265],"parent":[22498626],"text":["Working from home is the worst.

Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>172 page PDF [last update: March|3|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

If you go to the emergency room, you will receive and be charged for emergency care. This is expensive because it&#x27;s for emergencies. Call your doctor first!<p>2. Local doctor&#x27;s offices have protocols for COVID-19 testing already. This might involve some combination of staying in your car until a practitioner comes to escort you, keeping your hands folded across your chest so you don&#x27;t touch anything, wearing a mask to minimize the spread from coughing, and going in a separate entrance, and staying in a reserved back room that will be carefully disinfected after you leave. Again, <i>do not go to an emergency room and sit in the waiting room just to be tested<\/i>.<p>3. The COVID-19 test itself is being paid for by government funds, as stated in the article. However, you will still be billed for medical services rendered such as the administration of the test. This is one reason why a local doctor is much cheaper than going to a busy emergency room.<p>4. Do not assume that you&#x27;re positive for COVID-19 before working with a professional to understand the risk factors and diagnostic criteria. They will likely screen you over the phone to reduce the rate of false positives.<p>5. If you are concerned about the cost, <i>please ask your doctor what your options are<\/i>.
