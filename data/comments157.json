Story above, technical details below:<p>Part 1:<p>A couple years ago, I noticed that the number of photos I was tagged in kept going up and down, as a couple of people I knew would disable their accounts occasionally, and re-enable them a couple weeks later.<p>I manually the images from them, but wanted a way to automatically scrape any images I was tagged in, so I wouldn&#x27;t need to do this manually.<p>I got myself a Facebook Graph API key and created a sample app with full account permissions, only to discover that Facebook won&#x27;t let you export photos you&#x27;re tagged in (that you didn&#x27;t take). The numbers the API reports are wrong, and there&#x27;s no indication that it&#x27;s being purposely redacted.<p>As a result, I wrote a tool that crawls a profile given a set of authenticated cookies, and essentially clicks the download link automatically on every photo. This worked decently well for a couple years, and continues to work to this day.<p>Part 2:<p>I had some spare time on my hands in December 2019, and wanted to write a tool to browse chat logs from across a variety of services (Facebook Chat, Hangouts, SMS), such that you&#x27;d be able to click a name and see a chronological discussion, regardless of what service it was on. I downloaded the Facebook data dump, figuring that was the easiest way to get access to my Messenger data.<p>The Messenger dump revealed a few things that surprised me:\n* The character encoding is messed up, and requires decoding as Latin1, then re-encoding as UTF-8<p>* Some messages are straight up missing, despite being in the UI. The dump is supposed to include attachments (images are included), but is missing audio messages &#x2F; voice snippets, presumably among others.<p>* If a user has deleted their Facebook account, the username will appear solely as &#x27;Facebook User&#x27;, so now you need to figure out who you were actually talking to. Some conversations were very obvious, but others involved wasting a ton of time on and involved dumb techniques (like finding Adium logs of the same chat from an old computer).<p>To identify certain conversations, I started scrolling back through certain Facebook posts (which I wrote), to figure out who had been at certain events with me (to narrow things down). I read a bunch of comment threads that didn&#x27;t appear to make much sense to me, until I realized that anyone who deletes their account also has their comments removed, so basically all old comment threads are somewhat nonsensical if anyone in the conversation has since deleted their account. For comparison, deleting a reddit account changes the ownership of a comment&#x2F;post to [deleted], which seems much more appropriate.<p>Presumably wall posts (including happy birthday messages) from people who have since deleted their accounts are also removed, which is exceedingly shitty - if someone sends you a greeting card and then dies several years later, it&#x27;s not like the post office comes to your house to take your cards back in the middle of the night.<p>Part 3:<p>Because of this, I figured that the only way to mitigate future data loss on Facebook is to consistently archive things. Since the &#x27;download your data&#x27; tool is basically useless, I started work on a tool that scrapes the site and &quot;decompiles&quot; pages into raw directed graph DB rows, which can be re-rendered into a new version of the site. It features a reasonably complete implementation of Facebook&#x27;s TAO (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;facebook-engineering&#x2F;tao-the-power-of-the-graph&#x2F;10151525983993920\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;facebook-engineering&#x2F;tao-the-...<\/a>) on top of PostgreSQL, and works decently well - notably, it also maintains things like proper links to profiles and stores all assets offline.<p>Writing a bug-compatible &quot;decompiler&quot;&#x2F;&quot;recompiler&quot; taught me several things about how the site works (or rather, doesn&#x27;t). Here&#x27;s a small list of errata I&#x27;ve discovered along the way:<p>* Objects can have multiple FBIDs<p>* FBIDs can contain comments&#x2F;reactions<p>* Since there may exist multiple FBIDs for a given object, it&#x27;s quite common for multiple comment threads to exist for a given item, such that commenters on one don&#x27;t see the responses on the other (and vice versa). Several of my friends have confirmed finding disjointed discussions on their posts after discovering this bug.<p>* Facebook has several types of deprecated reactions that they store in the DB, which cannot traditionally be viewed from the site anymore. Sucks to be you if you reacted to something that way.<p>* Certain objects can get lost in their UI, with no easy way to find them. Uploading a photo in a post will put it in your Timeline Photos album, but uploading a photo as a comment to someone else&#x27;s post will basically make it impossible to find again.<p>* The number of reactions&#x2F;comments on a given post is often wrong - this isn&#x27;t the traditional bug due to eventual consistency, but rather is due to not adjusting the counts for items when a person deletes their account. To a certain degree, this will show you how many people that interacted on something have departed the site."],"time":["2020-03-02 19:12:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["basch"],"id":[22464950],"kids":[22465028,22467758,22465312,22465013,22465403,22465163],"parent":[22464649],"text":["This is a semantics argument.

Through his gentle ministrations he turned the company into a graveyard, driving Schenectady, NY from a middle class heaven into a rust-encrusted hellhole.  Jack&#x27;s financial acumen provided for monotonically increasing stock prices through his tenure.  He did this through financial manipulation that would have landed lesser mortals in jail for securities fraud.  Upon the sale of the General Electric Reinsurance (GE Re) to Swiss Re, Jack&#x27;s fraud was uncovered to the tune of $19.2BB.  This, however, didn&#x27;t affect St. Jack, who had moved on and left Jeff Immelt to hold the bag.  In the financial crisis of 2008, GE Capital&#x27;s &quot;investments&quot; into derivatives imploded and GE was within one day of failing to meet payroll and default on many obligations.  Jack&#x27;s good friend, Warren Buffet, however, came along with $5BB in cash and saved the company for a slight premium.<p>Jack was known as a sharp negotiator and a master of project management and contracts.  His marriage failed one month after his wife of many years became &quot;vested&quot; in the pre-nuptial agreement.  Suzie Welch was unavailable for comment at the time of publication.  Welch demanded full commitment and high levels of performance from his employees.

He also trained all managers in &quot;ethics&quot; as a means for them to know and understand the limits of ethical behaviour, to know where the gray zone was in relation to those limits, and then to be able to &quot;cluelessly&quot; operate beyond the gray zone limits.<p>He is survived by countless GE customers who cheer the ongoing demise of the company, by arrogant former employees and managers who remain unemployed due to their catchphrase &quot;this is how we did it at GE&quot;, and by many retirees doomed to eat catfood since their no-decision investment in GE stock has left them in penury."],"time":["2020-03-02 20:49:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gumby"],"id":[22467439],"kids":[22467487,22468386],"parent":[22464733],"text":["Welch was destructive for GE and the cult of his approach has been destructive for the industrial sector.<p>He turned around GE for the short term, but undermined the fundamental model of a conglomerate (there are good arguments for and against conglomerates, but GE was an is one).

He worked as a golf caddie, newspaper delivery boy, shoe salesman, and drill press operator, throughout middle school and high school.<p>Welch joined GE in 1960 as a junior engineer after his PhD in Chemical Engineering. He was frustrated with the bureaucracy, and planned on leaving, but decided to stay after an executive insisted he&#x27;d work on creating a small-company atmosphere.<p>In 1981 at the age of 45, he became the youngest-ever chairman &amp; CEO of General Electric. He dismantled many layers of management, finally fulfilling his wish that nearly led to him leaving GE to begin with.<p>In his 20 years as CEO, he grew the company from $12 billion to $410 billion in market cap. Fortune magazine named him &quot;Manager of the Century.&quot;<p>He fiercely believed in free markets. Even despite the comments in this thread on his anti-Climate Change perspective, he believed that &quot;every business must embrace green products and green ways of doing business&quot;, as that&#x27;s what the people, and thus the markets, wanted.<p>Another interesting note: &quot;Regarding shareholder value, Welch said in a Financial Times interview on the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, &quot;On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world.

For example, it&#x27;s currently borderline impossible to create a HEIC file on Windows, even though it would allow 10-bit wide-gamut files to be sent to an Apple IOS user and be displayed correctly, which is at least <i>something<\/i>. Adobe Lightroom refuses to support arbitrary colour spaces on export (why!?), and doesn&#x27;t include Display P3 in the fixed list that it does support.<p>But if you do somehow manage to create a HEIC file (or any wide-gamut file format) on Windows, it will show it incorrectly anyway, but not in all apps. Some will work. But only if you manually configure a profile for your monitor. But then your desktop colours will shift, which will make your previously valid sRGB CSS colours display incorrectly with sRGB stretched to the wide gamut because <i>fuck you, that&#x27;s why.<\/i><p>To my knowledge it is currently impossible to solve any such problem. Colour management in the Windows, Linux, XBox, PlayStation, and Android space is an unmitigated clusterfuck. Apple meanwhile is pretending that Display P3 is the <i>only<\/i> wide gamut that exists, because they use it.<p>One CSS attribute implemented on one platform with one usable colour space will not solve this. It won&#x27;t even begin. It&#x27;s like reading an article about the finer points of cake decoration in the midst of a famine. It feels almost insulting. Like I should feel ashamed for starving, and not being one of the rich elite that can afford cake. But nobody has cake, they&#x27;re all pretending.<p>Right now, in 2020, the <i>only<\/i> still image interchange format that more or less works is an sRGB, SDR, 8-bit JPEG. You can&#x27;t have anything else. No 10-bit. No other gamut. No HDR. No compression better than the one invented in 1992.<p>Okay fine, I admit it. There is a way to solve this problem. Download DaVinci Resolve and create a new movie. Import your HDR image as a still image &quot;video&quot; clip. Export the single frame movie, or a slideshow if you please, in whatever HDR format you prefer. Upload to YouTube. Share YouTube link.<p>This, seriously is it.

(Did you enroll in CS classes thinking &quot;I&#x27;m so looking forward to hitting sprint targets!&quot;?)

Yes, the other things may still matter, but the stuff you focus on and <i>talk<\/i> about week after week are the various scrum related ephemera. (One may include OKRs, which you may not discuss as often but which may represent another extrinsic factor looming in the background.)<p>There&#x27;s some evidence to suggest that extrinsic motivation may dampen one&#x27;s intrinsic motivation, and so a pet theory of mine is that, to the extent scrum does that, it has a certain deflationary effect on the overall morale of an engineering organization.

This article tracks with my experience and with what several repair people have told me. Many of the &quot;name brands&quot; of yesteryear have consolidated and moved their factories offshore to save money. They&#x27;ve also started designing compressors specifically to last 5 years or less, and repairing or replacing a compressor costs more than a new fridge.<p>The other trick (more common on washing machines) is to build electronic control boards that last 5 years or less, so when the washer breaks you have to pay $500 for a new control board. Washing machines used to have mechanical controls that lasted 30 years. Now we have electronic controls with no moving parts that theoretically could last forever but they die in a couple of years, usually because of poor power supply design or overheating.<p>This is deliberate. The companies have figured out that customers will tolerate it and go buy a new appliance every 5 years. Every company wants that recurring revenue stream.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t competition solve this problem?

Or if the rest of the team is working full-time, it may be too much effort to keep them in the loop of everything that has changed since it is moving at a faster pace than what their time allows.

As in- somehow - his actions should be vilified, yet the scammers <i>ON THE VIDEO<\/i> are provided the benefit of &quot;allegations&quot; against them?<p>It&#x27;s very clear to me that we have lost trust in our public institutions because they have failed us. It is trivial, given a lack of a certain moral compass, to set up an international call center scam like the one in this story. I receive at least 3-4 of these calls <i>per day<\/i> on my own phone - the scale is absolutely immense.

Before you accuse me of advocating for vigilante justice, there is precedent for this sort of thing: the TCPA, passed by Congress in 1991, provides for a Private Right of Action against these telephone scammers - meaning that private individuals have the right to sue the scammers, rather than waiting for collective government action. However, this no longer works with the international scale of modern phone scams.<p>It&#x27;s a classic tragedy of the commons. The cost of making phone calls over VoIP is basically zero at this point. I believe that the solution is simple: first, make the economics work against the scammers by making VoIP more expensive and use those funds to create an abuse reporting and enforcement mechanism; second, make the source of all phone calls completely transparent to end-users (or at least power-users). VoIP abuse must be taken seriously otherwise there will be no public telephone network left for the rest of us.
