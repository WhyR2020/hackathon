In short, there was a rather large backlash against “enterprise” technologies like XML, WS-* and Flash (in some circles) in favour of HTML Microformats, REST and JSON. This is roughly around the same time when AJAX moved from shipping XML (2003-4) to shipping bits of HTML (PJAX) or using JSON APIs via AJAX or JSONP. The thinking of the day was if XHTML 2.0 was dead on arrival, then we should probably back out the E4X changes as “from another era.” CORS is a great example, the original CORS was “Authorizing Read Access to XML Content Using the &lt;?access-control?&gt; Processing Instruction 1.0” from 2005: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;2005&#x2F;NOTE-access-control-20050613&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;2005&#x2F;NOTE-access-control-20050613&#x2F;<\/a> which in 2007 became a header, then several headers, then the CORS specs we’re a bit more familiar with by 2009 as Chrome was introduced.<p>Worth noting that compiling new syntax to old is also not new — anybody remember CoffeeScript? I’d say if there’s a new part, it’s the prevalence of implementations of standards and of polyfills for them in both TypeScript and core-js via Babel such that you can confidently write code in new syntax knowing you wouldn’t have to rewrite it later. Nobody remembers CoffeeScript or sees it today because it was generally all converted to JS long ago — it wasn’t a syntax we could build on top of. Arguably, if it was, you’d still see projects using it today, but it’s hard to modify syntax in an unambiguous way (for parsers I mean) while also simplifying the syntax as CoffeeScript did. Implementing standards are safer, though until implemented and shipped in multiple browsers, anything could still change. There are a few places where TypeScript has to be changed or will be changed due to changes in the JS standard...<p>To illustrate how messed up standards can still be though, I’d present “decorators” —- seemingly a solved problem in Babel or TS but apparently very hard to implement as a standard: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-decorators\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-decorators<\/a> I’m beginning to think JSX will ship in browsers before decorators do ;-)<p>That said if there’s something the web community learned from ECMAScript 4 and XHTML2 it’s that usage, what people want to use and working code, always wins out over arbitrary standards. If two options are good enough, the one folks implement and use will win when it comes to standards. To this end, I’m pretty sure future standards required 2 independent implementations to actually graduate and become standards instead of remaining proposals. Not sure how that will change if Chrome ever becomes a larger monoculture than it already is... maybe web developers will have to vote with their codebases as standards bodies write and distribute polyfills to encourage their spec to “win”."],"time":["2020-05-30 07:38:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zwetan"],"id":[23360073],"kids":{},"parent":[23354637],"text":["&gt; The closest thing we had for ES4, was probably Flash Actionscript 3.<p>No.<p>Flash = a browser plugin<p>ActionScript 3 = a programming language<p>ActionScript 3 can run in other runtimes than just Flash<p>Adobe AIR is another runtime, target desktop (Windows, macOS) and mobile (iOS, Android).<p>Redtamarin is yet another runtime (based on the avmplus) target the command-line and server-side (Windows, macOS, Linux)."],"time":["2020-05-30 12:32:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["userbinator"],"id":[23364092],"kids":[23364600,23367320],"parent":[23363735],"text":["As noted in the first post, the Z80 is still much easier to generate code for than the 6502.<p>I see everyone there seems to be referring to free&#x2F;open-source compilers, but I know of one commercial compiler for Z80 (IAR) whose output is quite good, and I have linked to in this previous comment I made on a different article about Z80 C compilation:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18902501\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18902501<\/a><p>If one didn&#x27;t know better, it would look almost like handwritten Asm.<p>On the topic of architectures which are difficult to compile C to, I can also think of several more: 8051, low-end PIC series, and these: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpldcpu.wordpress.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-terrible-3-cent-mcu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpldcpu.wordpress.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-terrible-3-cent...<\/a><p>...and most of those have C (or at least C-subset) compilers too."],"time":["2020-05-30 21:56:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dialamac"],"id":[23366600],"kids":{},"parent":[23363735],"text":["The accepted answer is somewhat true but also has some glaring inaccuracies.<p>The fact is that there are&#x2F;were some very effective C compilers for Z80, none of them free and far from it.

As the article points out, they&#x27;re made from similar materials, using the same fabrication technologies, except that PV panels include some plastic; and TEGs typically use exotic, scarce semiconductors based on heavy metals, like bismuth telluride or lead telluride, rather than abundant, cheap semiconductors like silicon.  (Silicon is too good at conducting heat to make a good TEG.)  I guess Kris De Decker just really doesn&#x27;t like plastic!  But a much bigger issue is that PV panels usually last decades, except for the small minority that get smashed, while TEGs tend to get burned up because you have to put them in a fire to make them work, and even aside from the danger of accidental overheating (because your water tank emptied out, say, or the air currents in your wood stove were different from usual) the Arrhenius equation governs a wide variety of TEG and PV failure mechanisms.  So TEGs are not &quot;more reliable&quot;.<p>The article argues that solar panels are not being recycled because they have plastic in them.  This is false.  The truth is that solar panels are not being recycled because almost all of them still work, even those manufactured decades ago, and manufacturing is growing rapidly, so there is not a sufficiently large pool of broken solar panels to supply any significant fraction of the demand for silicon.<p>TEGs are not &quot;less costly&quot; than solar panels.  Solar panels are <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarserver.de&#x2F;pv-modulpreise&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarserver.de&#x2F;pv-modulpreise&#x2F;<\/a> €0.17 per watt now.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dx.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;yb3981-diy-150-c-thermoelectric-power-generator-peltier-module-white-silver-2050639.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dx.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;yb3981-diy-150-c-thermoelectric-power-g...<\/a> is a TEG rated for 150° which can theoretically produce about 3 watts for US$9: 15 times as expensive.  Typical PV capacity factors are around 20%†, so even if the TEG got a 100% capacity factor — which it won&#x27;t, since you don&#x27;t have a constant 3-watt load to hang off it — it would be three times <i>more<\/i> costly.  (Is there a cheaper source for TEGs somewhere?)  This also tends to show that more energy and materials are needed to manufacture TEGs than equivalent solar panels, since that&#x27;s what most of your money goes to buy.<p>(150° is about the limit for bismuth-telluride TEGs — bismuth alloys and intermetallics tend to melt at low temperatures.  It is not true that, as the article says, that &quot;the hot side of bismuth telluride modules withstands continuous temperatures of 150 to 350 degrees&quot;, nor are Bi2Te3 modules &quot;the most efficient ones&quot;.)<p>The article argues that TEGs are &quot;100% efficient&quot; because any energy not harvested by the TEG is used to heat your house.  Aside from this being undesirable in the summer — a significant concern for many of us here in the &quot;global south&quot; that Kris De Decker pretends to care about, from his apartment in Spain — it&#x27;s also the case that burning up kilowatts of precious energy directly into low-grade heat is an extremely inefficient way to heat your house.  The apartment I&#x27;m in here is primarily heated by an air conditioner with the capability of functioning backwards, in which mode it produces about 3 kilowatts of heating in exchange for a single kilowatt of electricity, for 300% &quot;efficiency&quot;.  (This is not a violation of thermodynamics; the Carnot cycle is reversible, and the indoor and outdoor temperatures just aren&#x27;t that far apart.)  Producing the same amount of heating with the oven or a wood stove would waste two kilowatts of gas or wood.<p>Additionally, wood stoves are seriously fucking bad for your health.  They produce massive amounts of carcinogenic smoke.<p>TEGs do have real merits — I&#x27;ve loved them since I was a kid.  They can provide <i>small<\/i> amounts of power, at <i>very low<\/i> efficiency, in a totally autonomous, independent, and portable way.  You might be able to charge your phone, run a reading light, or trickle-charge a battery.  But they are not an alternative power source for your house.  They are not going to run your vacuum cleaner or your e-scooter, contrary to the misleading illustrations in this article.  A normal household vacuum cleaner needs 500–2000 watts, and at 5% efficiency that would mean running 10 to 40 kilowatts of heat through your TEG, a power level at which you will quickly cease to appreciate the space heating effect.  However, as John Nagle pointed out in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23356206\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23356206<\/a>, the end-to-end efficiency in the Lebanese study cited was not 5% but 0.04%, because most of the energy in the fuel goes right out the chimney, and most of the rest goes directly into the house, not through the TEG.<p>So what could have motivated such a mendacious article?  Did Low Tech Magazine get an advertorial contract, similar to The Atlantic&#x27;s famous <i>David Miscavige Leads Scientology to Another Banner Year<\/i> deal?  Does Kris De Decker simply have no interest in whether what he&#x27;s writing is true or false, scraping together whatever argument he thinks he can trick people into believing in order to support his preconceived conclusion?  Either way, this article destroys the credibility of Low Tech Magazine.  (Unless it&#x27;s a false-flag operation?  Maybe someone is impersonating Kris De Decker to discredit him?)<p>† In polar countries like Germany, the Netherlands, or England, PV capacity factors may worsen to 10%.  Near the Arctic or Antarctic Circle things are even worse, and within them of course you can&#x27;t use solar power without a seasonal energy store, which is totally impractical for most uses."],"time":["2020-05-30 07:02:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thescriptkiddie"],"id":[23358472],"kids":[23360454],"parent":[23348578],"text":["Randall Munroe (xkcd) did a video [0] a while back to promote his book &quot;How To&quot; where he addressed several (mostly silly) ways of powering a hypothetical home using only energy gathered on-site.

No product dominates the market for decades due to hype and subterfuge, let alone hype and subterfuge deployed decades earlier. It&#x27;s always the product. It&#x27;s just that what matters about the product to most people is often not what matters to some minority that insists that “technical excellence” is defined by their own preferences. In the famous VHS vs. Betamax war, the technically superior product won, it’s just that it was superior in matters that appealed to many and inferior in matters that appealed to few. The few famous cases where it <i>was<\/i> the marketing (diamond rings, maybe?) stick in our mind because they&#x27;re the exception, not the rule. Blaming marketing problems is often an excuse to overlook product problems.<p>Second, the problem with the message of &quot;code written in Haskell is more correct than code written in other [more popular] languages,&quot; isn&#x27;t that the industry doesn&#x27;t care about correctness. Correctness translates to cost (to a degree), and the ability to write software as correct as it needs to be more cheaply is actually quite compelling. Rather, the problem with it is that it&#x27;s simply not true (or, rather, hasn&#x27;t been shown to be true), certainly not to any degree big enough to matter. That, in and of itself, does not make it a <i>terrible<\/i> message; after all it&#x27;s just harmless hype, right? What makes it a terrible message is that it is <i>very clearly<\/i> not (shown to be) true and yet some Haskellers seem to actually believe it, drunk on their own kool-aid, which makes you think of them as out of touch with reality.

It&#x27;s in the importance of code. Programmers in general, but Haskellers in particular, are obsessed with code. As a result, they grossly overestimate its importance to software. Ask yourself how long it takes you to produce, say, 1000 lines of code of sufficient quality, and then look at a software produced at your company and divide the size of the codebase by the number you came up with. You&#x27;ll find that the true cost is several times that. The &quot;pure&quot; cost of producing code is not where most of the cost of developing software is. Maybe it&#x27;s in what you mockingly call &quot;emotions&quot;, but it certainly isn&#x27;t in programming-language semantics.

No matter how much I love the idea of the language, there&#x27;s a couple superficial things it gets wrong and one fundamental thing, or at least I believe it&#x27;s fundamental, perhaps some academics have proof one way or the other.<p>The superficial things are things that are not really part of the language, but more of its standard library, part of the &#x27;prelude&#x27;, or things the community has agreed upon:<p><pre><code>  - the I&#x2F;O monad (and others) can throw errors\n  - prelude is full of bad practice like use of strings and linked lists\n  - there&#x27;s something wrong with how function names can&#x27;t be namespaced\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThere&#x27;s more than this, and they&#x27;re not just things I came up with, they&#x27;ve been fought over in the community at length. Other preludes exist, I&#x2F;O libraries that don&#x27;t throw errors, even whole different systems for doing I&#x2F;O exist. It&#x27;s not that solutions are hard or impossible, they&#x27;re there, it&#x27;s just that the way the language is managed it&#x27;s not likely that they&#x27;d ever be applied in a way the entire community, and especially those drawn to it by any marketing would experience them.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m making a fool of myself and things changed in the past couple of years, things were really developing at a rapid pace when I left, but it seemed all the improvements happened around haskell, not to the language itself. When Stack and LTS-Haskell emerged it was the most amazing thing that I saw happening to Haskell in like 10 years, but given the lackluster response Snoyman received from the core team it seemed like they didn&#x27;t even realize it even though the entire community had like an upheaval.<p>In my opinion, Haskell&#x27;s marketing is fine. It&#x27;s being marketed to every college student anywhere that goes to a good enough university that it teaches functional programming. In addition to that there&#x27;s raving fans (myself included) that extoll its virtues to anyone who would hear. What it needs is a better retention rate. It needs that people who learn it, immediately realise it&#x27;s fit for production use, that it&#x27;s not just a fun experiment and a educative way of looking at things. For that we need something like a Haskell 2.0, designed by the community to incorporate everything we learned about Haskell&#x27;s flaws and make it an absolute powerhouse of productivity. Maybe Haskell should be split into two flavors, one the teaching language with the linked lists, strings and funny pattern matching, and one that&#x27;s got a prelude that will set you up with the perfect base to build the next compiler, database, service or web application.<p>If all those smart people who learn Haskell and tinker with for a bit, actually stayed around and used it to build awesome stuff, Haskell would truly have an enormous foot print on the world.<p>(not really relevant but the fundamental thing is that Haskell&#x27;s performance is really hard to predict, this is true for many garbage collected languages, but for Haskell it seems to be extra bad because of the way its paradigm just doesn&#x27;t map 1:1 to how computers are built)"],"time":["2020-05-30 20:11:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xixixao"],"id":[23362861],"kids":[23362923,23363221,23366435,23363129],"parent":[23362648],"text":["Javascript is not popular because it has Java in the name name..."],"time":["2020-05-30 19:27:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bryanrasmussen"],"id":[23358851],"kids":[23358949,23360568],"parent":[23348885],"text":["Following this article I would have to say my 2-year-old is obviously also a hacker and we should not imitate him because we have to spend all our time standing next to him ready to save his life when he does something really stupid to get the result he wants, but not well."],"time":["2020-05-30 07:56:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacobolus"],"id":[23360238],"kids":[23361453,23361835,23360439,23361127],"parent":[23348885],"text":["&gt; <i>As adults, we can&#x27;t progress at the same speed as kids,<\/i><p>This is definitely not true.

As a kid, I learned computer programming partially by making little Visual Basic programs and partially by making a couple dorky little 2D games.<p>At no point do I ever remember stepping back at my &quot;work&quot; and being frustrated to the point of giving up that whatever I was building didn&#x27;t look like some professional thing I was trying to emulate.<p>I was mostly just happy that I could put something together, understand it and learn from it, and then see all the possibilities I could add to it and refine.<p>That feedback loop of &quot;learn something new&quot;, &quot;mess around with it&quot;, and then sort of spontaneously refine it and add new features, was super fun, and is what drove me to software engineering as a career.<p>For example, if I wanted to make a game, I would learn how to import a &quot;sprite&quot;. I&#x27;d spend a little time drawing a crappy spaceship, and then be thrilled to see it on the screen, responding to key presses. Then, excitedly, I&#x27;d add an enemy. Then, &quot;cool, I can have him shoot bullets and add to a counter every time I dodge one&quot;.<p>At no point did I say &quot;my spaceship sucks, and I have no idea if I&#x27;m doing this scoring code right... I&#x27;m a loser and I&#x27;m done&quot;. I was having too much fun in the process for that.<p>But now? My attempts at making a game all start and stop with &quot;I want to make an overhead shooter&quot; and then I try to draw a pixel art spaceship and after a few hours of comparing what I do with the art in &quot;real&quot; games, get frustrated and give up. I want it to look and feel a certain way, and when I don&#x27;t get that, I feel like the whole project is doomed to failure.<p>I don&#x27;t feel this way with what I do professionally, which is primarily front and back end web and mobile app development. When I have to learn something new, I&#x27;m confident enough in my ability to learn and improve.<p>But my hobby stuff, and particularly artwork? Not happening, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get past this.<p>Some of this, I wonder, comes down to expectations of adults vs kids. As a kid, I never expected my stuff to be perfect or professional, and neither did anyone else.<p>Your picture of your kid&#x27;s wall hit me. As a kid, I would proudly display my creations, and not care if someone nitpicked it. And of course, nobody did, because I was &quot;just a kid&quot;.<p>But, honestly, if an adult proudly displayed a bunch of amateur artwork he&#x2F;she drew, that would be really weird, right?<p>I&#x27;m capable of professional quality web development work, because it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve focused on for the last 6-8 years, but if someone were to see my amateur &quot;pew pew&quot; spaceship game, it would just be sad... if I haven&#x27;t magically developed good skills here at this point of my life (&quot;this point&quot; being any point at which you are considered an adult), then I must just be bad at it, right?<p>I&#x27;m sure I can improve, but the combination of being embarrassed by everything I produce, along with a preoccupation with what everyone would think of it, and an impatience for being able to produce something good... it feels like a lot of barriers to get through.<p>And as a kid, I don&#x27;t know what the &quot;end goal&quot; was, other than it was just fun to mess around. When I did release something online, I wasn&#x27;t bothered by criticism and was happy at the praise, but mostly I just liked making the actual thing.<p>As an adult? Somehow the end goal feels like it&#x27;s about the end result of releasing the thing, more so than the actual process of making it.<p>There&#x27;s something about the lower expectations placed on a kid, and a lack of comparing everything I make to the gobs of talented people on Twitter or Pinterest, combined with a focus on the fun of just &quot;messing around&quot;, that makes the whole process of getting better at something (and discovering new things along the way) much less frustrating."],"time":["2020-05-30 20:07:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kungato"],"id":[23360536],"kids":{},"parent":[23348885],"text":["I thought we called this Front-end Development"],"time":["2020-05-30 14:03:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["heinrichhartman"],"id":[23360458],"kids":[23360507,23364213,23361311,23360900,23360715,23361118],"parent":[23358989],"text":["Sphere packings are quite a deep and fascinating area of pure mathemaics.

I’ve come across plenty of small startups or individual founders that carried on far too long after they should have admitted failure because of the sunk cost fallacy. Team keeps taking sacrifices - cut all costs, less pay, work for equity, etc. But while you’re small enough you can do this nearly indefinitely. Taking funding forces you to aim for something bigger and you’re either going to win, close down, pivot, or get acquired.

After that happened, the toaster would only toast if you <i>held the lever down<\/i>.<p>I do get the feeling that a lot of people are starting to place more and more value on reliability.  Most of us don&#x27;t want appliances that randomly fail after a year or two.  The trouble is that it&#x27;s bloody hard to tell if a given &quot;premium&quot; toaster with &quot;excellent build quality&quot; has an Achilles heel like the timer in my departed toaster. You just can&#x27;t tell if a toaster will last based on its price, marketing buzz-words, heft, etc..<p>To manufacturer&#x27;s, the trick seems to be to keep customers coming back without taking them out of the market with a product that simply lasts.  Their ideal toaster is one that reviewers will say is &quot;built like a tank&quot; and &quot;should last generations&quot;, but has a hidden flaw that bricks it after a couple of years."],"time":["2020-05-30 23:36:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sandworm101"],"id":[23364773],"kids":[23364872,23364855],"parent":[23363646],"text":["No.  I once owned one of those toasters.

If someone continues to violate Rules beyond that point then their account may be permanently suspended.&quot;<\/i><p>Somewhere a counter was just incremented.

There is not a need for complicated IPv4 nat schemes. You could use native ipv6 addresses that are reachable directly from the internet. Since you have so many ipv6 addresses you do not need Routers&#x2F;Nats.<p>Anyhow in a few years time some might be using something simpler like an open source like Heroku. If you could bin pack the services &#x2F; intercommunication on the same nodes there would be speed gains from not having todo network hops going straight to local memory. Or something like a standardized server less open source function runner.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KISS_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KISS_principle<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hype_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hype_cycle<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-29 23:42:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Bob_LaBLahh"],"id":[23356870],"kids":{},"parent":[23354418],"text":["Kubernetes is getting more popular because:<p>1) It solves <i>many<\/i> different universal, infrastructure-level problems.\n2) More people are using containers.
