You use the Terraform language to define resources for your target system, e.g. a load balancer in AWS. You then run Terraform and it checks the desired configuration vs the running configuration, and it shows the differences. If the new config is what you want, you apply the changes, and it updates the production system.<p>Ansible is much more of an imperative system, sort of &quot;executable YAML&quot;. You define a series of tasks in a YAML file. There are predefined tasks for standard things that you need to do when configuring a system, e.g. creating a directory or generating a config file by merging Ansible configuration variables with template. You can and should make these tasks idempotent, but as the system gets more complex, it becomes difficult and runtime can be slow as it compares tasks one by one to the running system.<p>Both systems suffer somewhat from difficulty in writing code. The fundamental task is to transform configuration variables and templates into running resources. To do that, you need loops, if&#x2F;then&#x2F;else logic, etc. Ansible has some constructs, but it is basically string manipulation, with a backdoor of being able to write modules in python. Terraform has a better syntax to define resources. Logic is generally things like ternary operator and list comprehensions. Terraform 0.12 improved this tremendously, but it is still somewhat weak. Ansible has a bit better management of config variables. Terraform tends to make you serialize things through environment vars, and it&#x27;s awkward to define structure sometimes. Both would benefit greatly from first class functions and programming logic, even as they are &quot;functional&quot;, just transforming data.<p>I love them both, and I hate them both. Terraform is best for provisioning complex infrastructure. Ansible is great for setting up instances, and it&#x27;s easy for everyone to understand, dev and ops. Here is a complete example of deploying a complex, full-featured app to AWS using Terraform and Ansible: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cogini&#x2F;multi-env-deploy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cogini&#x2F;multi-env-deploy<\/a><p>I feel like we are suffering through a period where the tools are immature. People are focusing on syntax, but we are missing fundamental parts of the way the system should work. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cogini.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;is-it-time-for-lisp-in-devops&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cogini.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;is-it-time-for-lisp-in-devops&#x2F;<\/a><p>The exact same thing is going on in the Kubernetes world. Back in the .com days, we would laugh at the &quot;HTML programmers&quot;, but now we are &quot;YAML programmers&quot;.<p>There are a couple of fundamental ways of managing the new cloud systems, all of which are better or worse depending on what you are doing. There are declarative systems like Terraform or CloudFormation. There is imperative with tasks, like Ansible. There are things that talk directly to the API like boto. There are tools like Pulumi which take a library approach in a general purpose programming language. Dockerfiles are crying out for higher level solutions, which are being developed. Ultimately I like the approach of a dedicated syntax like Terraform, but with more programming capability, or Pulumi."],"time":["2020-04-28 12:29:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["piahoo"],"id":[23005397],"kids":[23005413],"parent":[23005228],"text":["terraform manages infrastructure (e.g. creating VM).  \nansible manages configuration (e.g. installing tools on fresh VM)"],"time":["2020-04-28 11:57:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rad_gruchalski"],"id":[23005710],"kids":{},"parent":[23005228],"text":["Obligatory plug, you can use both together: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;radekg&#x2F;terraform-provisioner-ansible\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;radekg&#x2F;terraform-provisioner-ansible<\/a>\nI’m the author."],"time":["2020-04-28 12:54:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["johntiger1"],"id":[23013267],"kids":[23013539],"parent":[22999241],"text":["Duolingo recently introduced a dark pattern where ads are shown after completing every exercise.

Because of those findings, some researchers are now thinking community spread in places like the Bay Area may have started as early as January.<p>I say this because reading this article, they mention that Vietnam quarantined an entire district in Hanoi back in February when the entire country only had 10 cases at that point in time. They also banned travel from and to mainland China in early February. Those measures done early may have saved them from tens of thousands of infections. Vietnam has essentially relied on aggressive contact tracing coupled with strict lockdowns&#x2F;quarantining.<p>Here in Canada, we brushed off suggestions of forced quarantines of incoming travelers or banning flights to&#x2F;from Mainland China. We solely relied on travelers telling authorities if they experienced symptoms, which bit us in the tail when March came along and hundreds of new cases were popped up by the day.<p>We didn&#x27;t reverse our stance on restrictive measures till the virus had gotten out of a control. Even now as the growth rate has flattened, we&#x27;re still dealing with the fallout in long term care facilities as hundreds of elderly people have passed away due to caregivers&#x2F;visitors unknowingly infecting them.

But it assumes that the structure of the Universe is relatively constant, and that is not the case. For example, we live in a time when galaxies are clearly visible in the night sky; were we to have been born much sooner or later, we wouldn&#x27;t know about galaxies, and we might further be fooled into thinking that the Milky Way is unique or special.<p>Point (3) is really the one that Bostrom wants for us to conclude as true, but it&#x27;s completely inaccessible and unfalsifiable. Just like Christopher Columbus could never sail to the Garden of Earthly Delights, it&#x27;s not possible for us to falsify the proposition that we live in a simulation, whether it be a Spinozan world, a Great Programmer world, or whatever quasireligious interpretation one might want to use.<p>We can now freely embrace (2). We run plenty of simulations of pre-human life. One might object that we do not model all of the details of the inner experiences of such life, but of course there is no evidence for such inner experiences and we can ignore them entirely [2].<p>There&#x27;s other critiques of this argument. They usually boil down to some sort of post-selection [1]: Bostrom first post-selects to insist that there will inevitably civilizations which could plausibly simulate us, and then uses the post-selection to lock us into already being simulated.<p>And, of course, there&#x27;s a final argument from the outside: This would have all been <i>just as true<\/i> in the 1600s as it would be today, were the argument to be rock-solid. But then, computers would not have existed in the societies of the 1600s, so the argument would have to be prefaced by an introduction which doesn&#x27;t just wax poetic about how tiny future computers would be, but also explains computation, quantum mechanics, black holes, etc. However, in the 1600s, Spinoza [3] was able to put forth the argument that we are all simulated by the mind of God, and his deductions and rules were not much different from Bostrom&#x27;s. Spinoza and Bostrom seem to have the same conceptualization of the Universe, and are following the arguments that they think will lead them there best. But those arguments are hopelessly and obviously covered in the technology and ideas of the time. Therefore, if there <i>is<\/i> a way in which we are simulated, then the actual argument which proves it will have to come with a massive introduction which justifies it, not just by using our current words and ideas, but by introducing some sort of 25th-century mathematics and physics.<p>Oh, but wait, why would simulations become possible arbitrarily in the 25th century? We can iterate, and imagine that the hypothetical civilization which simulates us is <i>indefinitely<\/i> far in the future. When we predict this far into the future, not only do our models break down, but our <i>ability to model<\/i> breaks down.

If something is the same price on Amazon as it is elsewhere - the other place will lose until they have faster shipping or some other benefit. And this is coming from someone who buys a lot of stuff elsewhere and does a lot more than the average consumer when it comes to shopping. I do buy stuff elsewhere frequently. (I just spent $600 on soldering equipment through TEquipment, Louis Rossman&#x27;s store, and some Amazon stuff because I couldn&#x27;t find the stuff elsewhere for cheaper) The reason I do it isn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m anti-Amazon - I buy stuff through various sources because I&#x27;m a thoroughbred slickdealer. (And you can bet your butt I looked up all those items to see if there were ever any deals on them or if I could get them used for cheaper - odd stuff doesn&#x27;t get posted much about, sadly)<p>So, yeah, I buy stuff outside of Amazon... However, I&#x27;m a bit annoyed because I feel like the quality control is really bad at other sources far too often. With some shops I feel like they&#x27;re gonna call me up and say, &quot;Hey, I noticed you bought X, Y, and Z, do you want to buy this too?&quot; And this just pads delivery time by days. They&#x27;re slow to ship often enough as well. You buy an item online but you didn&#x27;t know the shop was closed for 2 weeks. Sometimes - it&#x27;s good. I remember I got $100 off my vacuum cleaner because they offered free overnight shipping for these vacuum cleaners - but I could get $100 off the price if I chose ground shipping. (Not an option online) That was worth knowing but that&#x27;s rare! Most of the time I get a call like, &quot;I noticed you bought X which is an accessory to Y, and Y wasn&#x27;t in your order, do you want to buy Y?&quot; No, of course not. I didn&#x27;t buy Y because you charge too much for it and I can get it for cheaper elsewhere!<p>On top of this - even big names mess up too often! I tried to buy an Elgato capture card off through Bestbuy this last week. It wasn&#x27;t even available anywhere else except Bestbuy. I used Google Shopping in the process because it was quicker&#x2F;easier than going through Bestbuy&#x27;s website. In the end - I got shipped a god damn microwave that I had to return today via UPS. Huge pain in the ass. I had to go to the local UPS store twice because I went <i>too early<\/i> (never thought that would happen!) to the UPS store the first time. (They&#x27;re open 11-5) Yes, that stuff could happen with Amazon but I feel like they might have slightly better inventory management than that and would recognize when a 50lb+ item is being shipped instead of a 1lb. Surprisingly, the shipping labels (both ways) were only for objects &lt; 5lbs. And yet UPS took them both times.<p>Target - same crap. Order something for store pickup even - no go. They cancel the order days later saying it isn&#x27;t in stock. Home Depot? Fulfills half your order when you clearly need the whole thing. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22795970\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22795970<\/a> I avoid store pickup when I can now. It&#x27;s usually faster for me to find the item(s) in store and go through self-checkout than to wait in line at pickup.<p>I&#x27;m not pro-Amazon but I am not pro-poor experience for the same or more price. There&#x27;s a reason Amazon is doing well compared to the competition and it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve made it much lower friction."],"time":["2020-04-28 01:36:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jtdev"],"id":[23006471],"kids":{},"parent":[22997193],"text":["Why do we hate Amazon again?"],"time":["2020-04-28 14:53:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justlexi93"],"id":[23001710],"kids":{},"parent":[22997193],"text":["I love Amazon because you can find the majority of the products that you are looking for from this online platform.

In the double slit experiment, it&#x27;s explained that the single photon has to be &quot;interfering with itself&quot;, so I don&#x27;t get it if by being a &quot;wave&quot; it means that the single photon is basically a bunch of &quot;magic&quot; photon ghosts that behave like a wave, but once it is measured or any other reason to &quot;collapse&quot; these ghosts &quot;disappear&quot;.

Or is it just a wave of these &quot;not yet collapsed&quot; probabilities of the photons locations that are interfering with each other right until we ask them to choose a location, then they just collapse magically into a single &quot;real&quot; photon. Another thing I don&#x27;t get is in the double slit experiment, a LOT of the measure before, measure after, etc, are told to be thought experiments, but it&#x27;s also claimed that someone managed to actually replicate them. Why isn&#x27;t there a video showing it? I obviously believe they happened, and understand why more or less (e.g. in the one photon at a time experiment, it&#x27;s spooky that over time you get the same pattern that indicates interference as if you shoot many) but the more spooky result is that thought experiment, that if you measure which slit the photon actually traveled through, you&#x27;ll see 2 slits on the screen vs the famous pattern. e.g. you&#x27;ll cause the wave to collapse back to particles.

Carbon dating. Sure, I get that carbon decays over time and this changes the proportion of isotopes. But why does this give you any information? That carbon didn’t come into existence just to be in that bone, it was made in the sun billions of years before that, so why does the age of the carbon tell us anything about organic matter? The key fact, which I think is not emphasized enough, is that the ratio of isotopes in atmospheric carbon is kept at a constant equilibrium by cosmic rays. So you can use carbon dating to tell roughly when the carbon was pulled out of the atmosphere. Without this additional fact, the concept of carbon dating makes absolutely no sense.<p>2. The tides. The explanation I was given is roughly something like “the tides happen because the moon’s gravity pulls the water toward it, so you have high tide facing the moon. There’s also a high tide on the opposite side of the earth, for subtle reasons that are too complicated for you to understand right now and I don’t have time to get into that.”<p>The first problem with this explanation is this: gravitational acceleration affects everything equally right? So it’s not just pulling on the water, it’s also pulling on the earth. So why does the water pull away from the earth? Shouldn’t everything be accelerating at the same rate and staying in the same relative positions?<p>The second problem is that, when viewed correctly, the explanation for why there is a high tide on the opposite side of the earth as the moon is equally simple to why there is a high tide on the same side as the moon.<p>The resolution to both these problem is this: tides aren’t actually caused by the pull of the moon’s gravity per se, but are actually caused by the difference in the strength of the pull of the moon’s gravity between near and far sides of the earth, since the strength of the moon’s gravitational pull decreases with distance from the moon. The pull on the near water is stronger than the average pull on the earth, which again is stronger than the pull on the far water. So everything becomes stretched out along the earth-moon axis.<p>3. This one isn’t so much a problem with the explanation itself, more about how it’s framed. I remember hearing about why the sky is blue, and wondering, “ok, more blue light bounces off it than other colours. But isn’t that essentially the same reason why any other blue thing is blue? Why are we making such a big fuss about the sky in particular? ” A much superior motivating question is “why is the sky blue during midday, but red at sunrise &#x2F; sunset”?

I don&#x27;t know enough about the Singapore app to comment on that but I would guess this is also an improvement on what they have.<p>These protocols are DP-3T, on which Google&#x2F;Apple have based their API and PEPP-PT which many countries including the UK have been building their solution. Until very recently, Germany was also using PEPP-PT but they have switched to DP-3T.<p>Both protocols make trade-offs between the amount of information which leaks and the usefulness of the tool. That&#x27;s important. Installing an app based on either will strictly reduce your current privacy.<p>It is also important, in understanding the privacy trade-off made, to understand the degree of <i>new<\/i> privacy loss from either framework. We are already pervasively geolocated based on our phone position, this just adds a possible layer of precision to that data. If GCHQ wants to track your movements, they do have tools which can do that relatively effectively already.<p>Both frameworks use pseudo-random rotating keys which are exchanged over Bluetooth.<p>In PEPP-PT a central server manages a rotating private key which is used to generate a set of time-gated ephemeral IDs for each device. Devices exchange and log these IDs.<p>When a health authority determines that someone is infected, they issue them a key which allows them to upload all their logged IDs to the central server. The server is able to determine who the infected person&#x27;s phone has logged a contact with and notify those people. A random sample of additional people also receive notification messages which their phones are able to discard as invalid decoy messages.<p>In DP-3T, the keys are generated on the devices and IDs are stored only on the devices. If a central server authorises you to do so (based on a confirmed diagnosed infection), you broadcast the IDs of all the devices you have been in proximity to. All devices regularly download a list of IDs and check the list for one of their own rotating ID numbers. If they match, the user is notified and is able to pre-emptively isolate.<p>The second approach reduces the consequences of a nefarious central operator but at the cost of sharing more information with more people (since everyone sees the list of possibly-infected IDs). In other words, even in privacy terms, this is not a perfect approach either. That information can be used to carry out re-identification attacks and reveal infected users if certain conditions are met.<p>From a privacy point of view, I think many people would prefer the latter (possibly allow malicious attacker, if they are able to do certain not-so-easy things to determine that they were infected) since most people in the UK will not consider that deeply private and secret information about themselves. Many of my friends who got it have posted about it on FB, twitter, etc. The former, which gives a state actor more information seems like a greater breach of privacy.<p>However, it is worth considering why the NHSX team has made this decision, there are epidemiological reasons to significantly prefer PEPP-PT.<p>First, it allows tweaking of the notification algorithm over time. DP-3T only allows notification of everyone in the contact with no risk indication, it&#x27;s binary.<p>Second, the greater information on the infection graph available to the central authority allows for better aggregate contact measuring which may shape increasing or decreasing distancing measures much more quickly than is currently possible since we currently have to use measures that lag considerably.<p>DP-3T requires more data exchange and on-phone calculation but I&#x27;m not convinced that is a convincing argument against it.<p>I tend towards selecting the solution with greater protection against state data collection and the fact that it will have API support and will therefore likely be able to run with a lower power requirement means that I would select DP-3T over PEPP-PT but I&#x27;m not the one who has to make that decision and I would love to see the internal decision making document.

We have Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Stories, but as the author points out, in most modern editions they edit out the darker ones. We have this Tolstoy collection because he is a famous author and people are interested in his stories. And guess what, they are super dark. Is that because Tolstoy was dark? No, it&#x27;s because the traditional stories of the time were much darker. Here&#x27;s an example of a Yiddish Folktale:<p><i>Moyshele and Sheyndele<\/i><p>Once upon a time there was a poor woodcutter who had a wife and two small children, a boy and a girl. The boy was called Moyshele, the girl Sheyndele. The woodcutter’s wife died and he married a second wife who was a very wicked woman and a cruel stepmother to the children. One day the woodcutter left the house to chop wood in the forest, and the stepmother got ready to go to market to do the Sabbath shopping. Before she left, she gave the children some food, putting Moyshele’s in a pot and Sheyndele’s on a plate. She said, “Moyshele, if you break the pot I’ll chop off your head, So you’d better not.” She told Sheyndele, “Sheyndele, Sheyndele, just you wait, I’ll chop off your legs if you break this plate.” Then she slammed the door and went to market. The children were afraid to eat lest they break something, but the rooster suddenly flew up on the table and knocked over the pot. It fell to the ground and broke into teeny-tiny pieces. Moyshele, seeing them, was terrified and began to cry. Sheyndele comforted him, saying, “Hush, Moyshele.Don’t cry.” And she took the shards of the pot and pushed them into a corner of the room. When the stepmother came home, she couldn’t find the pot. “Where is the pot?” she asked Moyshele. “The rooster broke it,” he said. The stepmother was very angry, but she pretended that nothing was the matter. Later she said to Moyshele, “Come with me and I’ll wash your hair.” So Moyshele went with her. She took him into another room and cut off his head, after which she cooked it for supper. When the woodcutter came back from the forest he said, “Where is Moyshele?” “I don’t know,” said the stepmother. Then they sat down at the table and ate the soup and the meat. Sheyndele, unaware of what she was eating, sucked the marrow from the bones and threw them out the window. A little mound of earth covered the bones and when the glad summer came again, a new Moyshele grew up out of it. Moyshele stood there on his little mound until, seeing a tailor pass by, he called, “Tailor, tailor, make me a pair of trousers and I’ll sing you a song:<p><pre><code>    Murdered by my mother, \n    Eaten by my father, \n    and Sheyndele, when they were done, \n    Sucked the marrow from my bones \n    And threw them out the window.” \n  <\/code><\/pre>\nThe tailor, hearing the song, pitied him and made him a pair of trousers. Moyshele put them on, and then a shoemaker went by. Moyshele called, “Shoemaker, shoemaker, make me a pair of boots and I’ll sing you a song:<p><pre><code>    Murdered by my mother, \n    Eaten by my father, \n    and Sheyndele, when they were done, \n    Sucked the marrow from my bones \n    And threw them out the window.” \n  <\/code><\/pre>\nThe shoemaker, hearing the song, pitied him and made him a pair of boots. Moyshele put them on, and then a hatmaker went by. Moyshele called, “Hatmaker, hatmaker, make me a hat and I’ll sing you a song:<p><pre><code>    Murdered by my mother, \n    Eaten by my father, \n    and Sheyndele,\n    when they were done,\n    Sucked the marrow from my bones\n    And threw them out the window.\n  <\/code><\/pre>\nThe hatmaker, hearing the song, pitied him and made him a hat. And Moyshele put it on and ran off to school.<p><pre><code>    One log there, \n    One log gone. \n    As for my tale— \n    My tale is done.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n- Weinreich, Beatrice.

But Tolstoy’s tales read more like an undigested rage at the world, unfortunately misdirected at children.<p>Yeah no. What&#x27;s the point of such a teaching story as the one above? Perhaps it&#x27;s a story to teach resilience; <i>Even if the world treats you so badly, that it sort of chews you up and spits you out, you can still make your way, though perhaps it might just be by telling your sad story and playing on people&#x27;s sympathies<\/i>."],"time":["2020-04-27 19:15:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["superimposition"],"id":[22998537],"kids":{},"parent":[22997417],"text":["Here&#x27;s free collection of Tolstoy&#x27;s Fables for Children<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publicdomainreview.org&#x2F;collection&#x2F;leo-tolstoys-fables-for-children-1904\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publicdomainreview.org&#x2F;collection&#x2F;leo-tolstoys-fable...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-27 20:31:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pmontra"],"id":[22998163],"kids":[22998541,22998209],"parent":[22997417],"text":["&gt; The publicists of the most recent edition issued by Simon &amp; Schuster, who seemingly did not read it, write of this book, “children will be able to take away important lessons, as well as laugh at silly mishaps and characters, from this timeless collection.”<p>This is possible but unfortunately the author of the article decided not to answer his children:<p>&gt; “Daddy,” my stunned four-year-old son asked, “why did the lion die?”<p>&gt; “Daddy Daddy,” my daughter asked, still wondering about the now-dead lion’s lifestyle, “why did the people feed the lion puppies?”<p>Instead he &quot;took the book away and hid it from&quot; them.

I basically have noticed improvements on all the dimensions that people typically drink coffee to &quot;solve.&quot;<p>Some of the effects I have noticed:<p><pre><code>  - Less anxiety throughout the day.\n  - Fewer &quot;highs&quot; and &quot;lows&quot; throughout the day. My energy level is pretty constant.\n  - Easier to wake up. I rarely snooze my alarm more than once.\n  - Easier to focus. My level of focus (over time) is more consistent.\n  - Better hydration. This means less headaches, etc.\n  - More energy. I generally have the energy I need to do what I want basically up until I go to sleep.\n  - I can burn sleep. It&#x27;s very easy for me now to go 2-3 days with very limited sleep, and then sleep 12 hours to recover.\n  - Coffee &quot;works.&quot; The one or two times I needed coffee, it actually worked to keep me awake and energized.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe reason for this is pretty obvious. Coffee stresses your adrenals and sends your body an &quot;awake&quot; signal. Caffeine&#x27;s half life is 6 hours, which means even if you have it &quot;before noon&quot; you&#x27;ll still have a substantial amount in your system while you sleep. This impacts sleep quality, which means you are accumulating micro amounts of sleep debt every night which you never pay off. Eventually, you struggle to get up in the mornings until you have had some coffee in your system. The &quot;I can&#x27;t function without coffee&quot; effect. This is a pretty much ubiquitous 21st century experience, as far as I can tell.<p>Furthermore, coffee impacts your body&#x27;s natural processes that it uses to wake up. Your body produces cortisol in order to wake up in the morning, which is a &quot;stress&quot; hormone, which is also induced by drinking coffee (which overall impacts the endocrine system). Hacking this system to overproduce hormones everyday isn&#x27;t great for when your body actually needs this system to wake you up.<p>For people considering quitting coffee I have the following advice:<p><pre><code>  - You will get a headache 24-36 hours after you quit. Take ibuprofen. (By the way, this should give you a hint to how long coffee actually meaningfully stays in your system.)\n  - You will feel weird for probably 2 weeks.\n  - You will have coffee cravings. (I found these hit when I was tired. I felt like I needed to drink coffee to fix my tiredness. I tried to replace this impulse with drinking water or herbal tea a lot of tiredness is caused by dehydration.)\n  - You will be tired sometimes. You&#x27;ll just have to deal with that, but it&#x27;s really not that bad of a sensation, and the solution: sleep :)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nPeople often think cutting coffee out is &quot;impossible&quot; but many people also haven&#x27;t gone a day or two without drinking coffee since they were 18, so, I would say it&#x27;s worth a try at least."],"time":["2020-04-28 02:35:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tsujp"],"id":[23005758],"kids":{},"parent":[22999128],"text":["Is there a mirror I don&#x27;t have to subscribe or sign in to read?"],"time":["2020-04-28 13:02:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devin"],"id":[23004199],"kids":{},"parent":[22999128],"text":["Coffee makes me sick.
