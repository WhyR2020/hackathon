Yes, the article is right to point out they support climate change action, or fight certain internet regulation, or gay rights but this is very, very mild, often non-partisan civic stuff and often just financial self-interest.<p>I don&#x27;t see Facebook or Google going around wielding the power of legacy media over politics, having a clear political slant in how they operate, or whatever. They mostly stay out of it, again probably for business reasons.<p>More importantly though I think the article romanticises smallness, citing Barlow&#x27;s cyberspace independence, advocating for less concentration, transparency and so on. It&#x27;s the usual anglosphere-centric argument. Just give people transparency and get rid of all the big bad guys and the enlightened citizens of the cyberspace will find their way out of it, nothing new about that.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is realistic.

It&#x27;s about as useful as the closet full of Lego sets I have.<p>And if people want to buy that content, why complain about the people providing it. No, it&#x27;s not typically hard work. And let&#x27;s all not pretend that it is. But. So what. Some people were just born wealthy. Some people just win the lottery. Or have some other windfall. Not all wealth is earned through hard work. That&#x27;s just the way it is. I mean, look at all the people featured in the article. They&#x27;re all attractive women.<p>And more power to them if they&#x27;ve found a way they don&#x27;t have to work hard to earn themselves some money.<p>But it really feels like the current creators are complaining about Throne because she doesn&#x27;t have to work as hard. Or that she&#x27;s had automatic reach due to her celebrity status. That she doesn&#x27;t even have to get nude to get this money.<p>And that&#x27;s the complaints made about the majority of creators by the people who cannot leverage the platform like they can.<p>And it&#x27;s not like the money sent to Thorne was going to affect the money sent to other creators. It&#x27;s not like OnlyFans has $X a month to split between creators based on subscriptions. No, individuals choose to subscribe to specific creators. The people signed up to subscribe to Thorne weren&#x27;t subscribing to OnlyFans because they like OnlyFans, they were signing up to OnlyFans to subscribe to Thorne. Take her away and they don&#x27;t even sign up.<p>And the cap limits are another thing in this debacle. They&#x27;re trying to put the blame for that on Thorne, but really, that&#x27;s a move that was going to come sooner or later. OnlyFans needs the subscribers more than the creators. The content is pretty fungible in all honesty. So OnlyFans will take measures to make sure the bleed is as slow as possible.<p>On the other hand, I get why they&#x27;re frustrated by all this. It can be difficult to watch someone waltz in and crush something you&#x27;ve been chipping away at for a while. It can be difficult to have the terms of a platform suddenly change under you and impact your income. Those are valid frustrations.

In my mind that invalidates the necessary consent required when the activity involves sex work of some kind, making it unethical from the buyer to acquire such a service despite it being legal locally. While trafficking is of course still illegal, I am unclear about the laws protecting trafficking victims from their &quot;buyers&quot; in non-consenting transactions.<p>Since it is practically impossible to confirm if a given sex worker is participating under duress or not, especially when it occurs &quot;remotely&quot; as in this OnlyFans situation, I would say it is always unethical to purchase such services.<p>In addition, what I would consider &quot;under duress&quot; is fairly broad, not only under threat of violence from traffickers, but also including economic duress where an individual feels that it is the only way to earn an income to put food on the table. In this vein, I would consider sex tourism to poorer countries a form of exploitation and thus unethical, even though one could argue the individuals from the poorer countries selling such services do so &quot;willingly&quot;.<p>This article writes that one of these women feels that she must engage in sex work through OnlyFans because it is &quot;the only way she can support her family...&quot;. It leaves a bad taste as I would not consider that she is participating in the transaction without duress, and thus actually consenting in the transaction. Would you be okay with it if you knew that the woman you were buying lingerie pictures &quot;had&quot; to do it? How would that not be a form of exploitation?<p>However, one can extend this argument to any type of work. &quot;She says her _____ work is the only way she can support her family...&quot;, replace with an arbitrary line of work and activity (woodcutting&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;basketweaving).

I built the first version of NoteBrook on top of couch&#x2F;pouch, and the biggest pain points were:<p>1. Pouchdb was before async&#x2F;await and typescript. The typings can be inconsistent, and its very difficult to properly manage the lifetimes of local databases because of the promise chaining.<p>2. A database technology for Real time replication Needs ACLs on a per-document basis. I built provisioning scripts to manage separate databases per user, as suggested, and its very cumbersome. It prevents me from lots of data sharing models like promoting one record to public view, or sharing a record with another user in a different tenant.<p>3.

Postgres, MariaDB). The data layer should allow me to specify the durability requirements of each write (down to the specific entity type) and enforce an atomic commit on all related records in one transaction at the level of the most strict entity in the commit. It should be trivial to shard because the syncing protocol the clients use itself should be available to the server. Multitenancy should be built in. It should support real-time ephemeral in memory data for collaboration&#x2F;chat scenarios, with optional durability thats eventually consistent.

Yeah I know (StackOverflow) and it doesn&#x27;t even relate directly to your problem ....But if you read the long bit below it might give you a bit of blue-sky thinking.<p>&gt;&gt;\nThe next is determining what behavior constitutes a possible bot. For your stackoverflow example, it would be perhaps a _certain number of page loads in a given small time frame from a single user (not just IP based, but perhaps user agent, source port, etc.)_<p>Next, you build the engine that contains these rules, collects tracking data, monitors each request to analyze against the criteria, and flags clients as bots. I would think you would want this engine to run against the web logs and not against live requests for performance reasons, but you could load test this.<p>I would imagine the system would work like this (using your stackoverflow example): The engine reads a log entry of a web hit, then adds it to its database of webhits, aggregating that hit with all other hits by that unique user on that unique page, and record the timestamp, so that two timestamps get recorded, that of the first hit in the series, and that of the most recent, and the total hit count in the series is incremented.<p>Then query that list by subtracting the time of the first hit from the time of the last for all series that have a hit count over your threshold. Unique users which fail the check are flagged. Then on the front-end you simply check all hits against that list of flagged users, and act accordingly. Granted, my algorithm is flawed as I just thought it up on the spot.<p>If you google around, you will find that there is lots of free code in different languages that has this functionality. The trick is thinking up the right rules to flag bot behavior. \n&lt;&lt;<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6979285&#x2F;protecting-from-registration-bots\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6979285&#x2F;protecting-from-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-01 22:06:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["issa"],"id":[24338222],"kids":[24338363],"parent":[24334657],"text":["I&#x27;ve had a lot of luck with variants of a honeypot.

Death certificates of beekeepers were examined for causes of mortality, and proportionate mortality ratios were compared with those for the general U.S. population. Beekeepers had a slightly lower than expected fraction of deaths from cancer. The deficit of lung cancers in male beekeepers was significant (p less than 0.05) and may indicate that fewer beekeepers were cigarette smokers. The frequencies of other cancers did not differ significantly from expectation. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed in four persons, and was expected in two. Mortality from diseases other than cancer showed no unusual patterns. At least two persons died from accidents directly related to the care of beehives. Analysis of a subgroup of 377 males with major roles in the beekeeping industry showed no substantial differences in distribution of causes of death.

Like seriously, don&#x27;t evacuate unless being in an out-of-gas car stuck on a highway somewhere is definitely better than being at home.

The basics are to focus on the pain and customer need instead of just grooming features that come in and delivering those features.  If you have trouble with this, I like to use a focus &#x2F; flare &#x2F; focus model.  First think through your solution (privately) and list out the benefits and drawbacks in terms of your user experience &#x2F; needs.  Then double down on imagining your user interactions and actually go talk to them about the idea.  Pay a lot of attention to where their reality and your assumptions don&#x27;t align.  Be very curious.  Then with that new grooming of the customer experience, focus on how to communicate the meaningful pain points to your engineering team.  If needed, you can even walk them through the journey you took.  At the end of the day, the more you can get them to empathize with your chosen customer, the fewer blindspots they will have and the better their intuitive solves will be."],"time":["2020-02-14 17:08:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Invictus0"],"id":[22327675],"kids":[22328345],"parent":[22325493],"text":["I&#x27;ve definitely seen some examples of over-technically focused engineers, but this piece goes too far to portray engineers as hapless sheep that need to be herded into a useful business purpose, lest they wander too far into an interesting technical problem and never return.

This is extremely hard to do without manipulation.<p>- People who complain about fake reviews are only seeing half the problem, the other half is that legit businesses who do it the fair way can&#x27;t compete. How do you launch a great product on Amazon with 0 reviews? Hope that 500 people buy it to maybe get 5 reviews? Alternatively you spend thousands on product ads hoping that enough people buy... or just succumb to the dark side and pay for reviews which is WAY cheaper.<p>- If you hate Amazon reviews, do your part and start reviewing the good products on Amazon.

The claim is that the FBI specifically requested that they <i>not<\/i> further secure this, which would prevent their current methods of easily accessing these backups.<p>Note that your backups generally contain your complete iMessage and SMS history, including all attached images and videos.<p>Theres little practical point in denying a backdoor into a seized phone if Apple&#x2F;FBI already have a copy of everything on it that they can decrypt and read because your backups are encrypted to <i>Apple<\/i>, not you.<p>(They do this because many, many people lose their device, and have forgotten their Apple ID password which then needs to be reset. The naïve solution to this is to simply encrypt the backups to an Apple key, which is always decryptable by Apple as required for restore after resetting your password via alternate ID verification. Unfortunately it puts every single user of iCloud backup at risk of bulk surveillance.)<p>The whole thing is rather performative, like they are showing off for the market. Indeed, people well respected (such as the author of TFA) are repeating this meme without any of the associated caveats.<p><i>Make sure you tell your family and friends to disable iCloud and more specifically, iCloud device backups if they value their privacy.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-02-14 10:54:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["use___net"],"id":[22325082],"kids":{},"parent":[22317114],"text":["its not poss!"],"time":["2020-02-14 10:08:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["rstat1"],"id":[22323004],"kids":[22323185,22323017,22324338],"parent":[22322524],"text":["So this release is exciting for me, because it contains my first ever open source contribution, in the form of a setting that allows one to disable that annoying dialog box that pops up when you close a window with multiple open tabs."],"time":["2020-02-14 02:02:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tony"],"id":[22323486],"kids":[22323679,22323874,22323766,22324072,22328628,22323515,22323705],"parent":[22322524],"text":["It&#x27;s faster than any Bash terminal I&#x27;ve tried so far on WSL.

WMD (and caches, but they have their limits) is why we don&#x27;t have a internet capacity crunch with our backbones flooding everytime Netflix releases something.  Yet no one in this thread nor the author of the article mentions the field. I think people understand how their cars work much better than they understand how the internet works."],"time":["2020-02-14 09:54:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bawolff"],"id":[22324200],"kids":[22324258],"parent":[22323797],"text":["Not a whole lot of evidence in this essay.

Real-world performance is not necessarily linear with technological progress.<p>2. Landmarks by which we measure progress may be far apart.<p>#1. We frequently compare computer memory to automobile engines and ask why engines have improved so little while memory capacity has skyrocketed.  It&#x27;s an unfair comparison.  If we were still using magnetic core-memory, as we were in the 60&#x27;s, capacities would now be only incrementally larger.  The growth of memory capacity has been driven by a succession of novel technologies, while the fundamentals of an automotive engine are essentially the same as they were a century ago.  We must ask, &quot;Why is it harder to come up with novel types of engines than novel forms of memory?&quot;.  Perhaps it&#x27;s due to complexity.  Computer memory is a very simple thing repeated many times.  Improving that simple thing yields great benefit with comparatively little effort.  An engine is a collection of many different parts that interact in complex ways.  Incrementally redesigning individual parts is unlikely to result in novel types of engines with fundamentally different capabilities. To come up with a new type of engine you have to design a very complex system all at once. Expecting memory and engines to improve at the same rate is not realistic.<p>#2. What landmark comes after sending men to the moon?  Sending them to Mars?  The Apollo missions were tremendously expensive and the scientific value of research conducted on the Moon was small compared to the progress achieved in getting there.  That may be why we stopped sending manned missions to the moon.  Why it&#x27;s taken so long to send men to Mars may be because the difficulty is much greater.  We need far more thrust to transfer orbits.  We need to sustain humans in space for long periods of time without protection from the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. We need to send squishy humans down a gravity well much more significant than the Moon&#x27;s without much atmosphere for braking.  We may have been making steady progress on all of these problems but, until we actually land a human on Mars, the Moon remains the high-tide mark."],"time":["2020-02-14 10:01:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["payne92"],"id":[22327471],"kids":{},"parent":[22323797],"text":["Progress in science and technology progress has supposedly &quot;stalled&quot;.<p>YET, today, we carry pocket supercomputers with nearly all of the world&#x27;s information at our fingertips.<p>Ten years ago this was not the case."],"time":["2020-02-14 16:46:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["beefield"],"id":[22324509],"kids":{},"parent":[22323797],"text":["I think the issue has been the slowly rising ideology that individuals know better individually than collectively what they want to achieve.
