Thanks for posting it whoever did.<p>I wrote this a long time ago, it&#x27;s mostly targeted at Lua 5.1 but more recent versions of Lua approach function environments differently, so keep that in mind.<p>I&#x27;ve written &amp; worked with quite a few HTML generation DSLs at this point. I put them into two groups:<p>1. Nested object return: the object is converted into HTML after executing the template<p>2. Evaluate and write to buffer: no return values, each &quot;tag&quot; is a function call that generates code in a background buffer (nested html typically accomplished by blocks or inline functions)<p>Approach 1 is what was used in this blog post. Approach 2 is what I ended up using for my web framework: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leafo.net&#x2F;lapis&#x2F;reference&#x2F;html_generation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leafo.net&#x2F;lapis&#x2F;reference&#x2F;html_generation.html<\/a><p>Approach 1 is used by React.

It lets you use your programming language constructs to do things conditionally, in loops, or whatever else your language provides.<p>I find that with approach 1 you tend to try to bend the language to convert everything into an expression that can be returned into the nested object you&#x27;re building. The example I have off the top of my head is how React devs will write some pretty nasty ternary operator expressions just to write some HTML conditionally directly inside of a JSX chunk. (The alternative would be pulling things out into temporary variables, which just creates a lot of noise)<p>As a fun aside for how far you can take things, for my implementation of approach 2 in my web framework, I ended up writing a syntax transformer that could pre-render static HTML chunks to plain sting that can be appended to the output buffer. Essentially removing those function calls and any HTML escaping that would be necessary during evaluation time of the template."],"time":["2020-02-04 23:15:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wruza"],"id":[22240234],"kids":[22240629],"parent":[22223542],"text":["Function environments, resumable coroutines and dsl-friendly syntax is what makes Lua feel so superior to js (in a sense of the language power, not in syntax, optimization or minor design details).

I don’t get it why the execution model should suffer just because someone finds it tedious to split their 300 C calls to few continuation callbacks.<p>The entire JSX thing could be replaced by something similar, seamlessly connecting code and hyperscript.

He took down the manager&#x27;s information and messaged him a week later with a proposal for revamping their software system. The autobody became his first client. The manager said that hundreds of people come in and out of that store every day, but my friend was the first person to point out that their software wasn&#x27;t very good.

It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras - families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting - saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all. I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axioms - you start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms.

The police presence itself is not as unusual or &quot;nationalist&quot; as some seem to be suggesting here.<p>For a concrete example - the musician Ted Nugent said at an NRA event that if Barack Obama were to become President, he (Nugent) would be dead or in jail by November. The Secret Service paid him a visit following that statement and (correctly) did not arrest him.<p>Investigating threats of violence against the leader of a country is common. In this case, the fact that a teacher made kids say it, is not really very different in this context.<p>Unfortunately, India does not really have freedom of speech. The right to say things that are encouraging political violence is not covered by India&#x27;s toothless right to free speech.<p>In this case, Modi is a similarly &quot;sacred&quot; figure to many, and he&#x27;s also the Prime Minister. Some people made children put on a play in which they suggest physically beating the Prime Minister, and then a video of this gets shared on WhatsApp.<p>Had the play been put on and nothing happened thereafter, it would have been an entirely different matter. The fact that it started spreading on WhatsApp now gives the police grounds to suspect that this is part of a conspiracy to call for political violence.<p>The police in this case have gone ahead and actually arrested the teacher and parent who wrote the script. If (and only if) they conspired to spread the WhatsApp video, under the existing terrible laws, the police may have a case. I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but it seems that way as a layperson reading the statutes. I hope I&#x27;m wrong."],"time":["2020-02-04 21:59:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nsenifty"],"id":[22239750],"kids":[22240114],"parent":[22237055],"text":["As many comments have pointed out, no kids are locked up.

She mentions that probability and law are intertwined, in particular in two aspects: degrees of proof, and aleatory contracts. It&#x27;s also been suggested that the originators of probability were either lawyers or sons of lawyers [1].<p>There&#x27;s another link that I&#x27;ve found fascinating: the philosophy of law put forwards by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr (Supreme Court justice 1902-1932), and the philosophy of modern machine learning. Holmes gave a famous talk in 1897, &quot;The Path of the Law&quot;, in which he said that law is nothing more than prediction. Throughout his life he thought and wrote about the relationship between predictions (by lawyers, by their clients, and by judges anticipating review by other judges), rationales (as written out in a judge&#x27;s decision), and &quot;scientific-style&quot; explanations (the general legal principles that emerge over time). He writes about how the law learns to draw separating lines between clusters of cases, in language that might have come from a modern textbook on k-nearest-neighbours.<p>Reading about Holmes [2], and reading about modern takes on explanation and prediction in machine learning [3], I think there are some striking parallels -- and I wonder if Holmes&#x27;s ideas might lead to new ways of thinking about explainability in machine learning.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxfordhandbooks.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;oxfordhb&#x2F;9780199607617.001.0001&#x2F;oxfordhb-9780199607617-e-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxfordhandbooks.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;oxfordhb&#x2F;978019...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndpr.nd.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;oliver-wendell-holmes-jr-legal-theory-and-judicial-restraint&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndpr.nd.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;oliver-wendell-holmes-jr-legal-theo...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;euclid.ss&#x2F;1294167961\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;euclid.ss&#x2F;1294167961<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-04 16:04:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bacr"],"id":[22241606],"kids":{},"parent":[22232383],"text":["Great timing: I just finished “Objectivity” the book she co-authored with Peter Gallison.

In both of these sites, a great deal of calculation had to be done by hand. Already in the 18th century at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, forms had been developed that divided the task of a complex calculation into small enough steps — so that, at least at the lower end, the Observatory could employ very cheap schoolboy labor in order to complete them economically.<p>Over the course of the 19th century, schoolboys were increasingly replaced by women as the cheapest and most reliable form of labor. We can read interesting correspondences from astronomers at Oxford and Harvard recruiting the first generation of women college graduates to perform calculations for half the wages of men. By the late 19th century, the Bureau of Calculation at the Paris Observatory was entirely feminized.<\/i><p>This is a trend that I&#x27;ve noticed in the ~30 years I&#x27;ve been doing this. As computer programming gets more advanced, with greater separation of concerns and finer granularity of tasks, it&#x27;s becoming more marginalized. My feeling is that programming will no longer be viewed as a lucrative career within the next 10 years, and that it will be largely replaced with algorithms generated by machine learning within 20 years.<p>I included the quote about calculation being largely done by women before it was automated because we&#x27;re seeing this happening today in developing countries. They&#x27;ll catch up to the developed world between 10 and 20 years from now, just in time to also be automated by AI.<p>I find this all tragic to some degree, because my fondest dream of making computer science available to everyone will also eventually lead to its undoing. This is simply not the future that I anticipated growing up. We&#x27;re going to end up in a world of ultimate competition and wealth inequality instead of automating the means of production so that everyone can enjoy the prosperity of their basic needs being met with something like UBI. So far the evidence for that is overwhelming, and I&#x27;m only seeing the smallest pockets of resistance.

Recognize you only have a few &quot;weirdness points&quot; to spend: so there is apparently no way to get more weirdness points to spend elsewhere by, for example, advocating for something weird, pushing it through, having it be a great success. This is why people who make weird movies that earn lots of money are never called up by Hollywood again. In conclusion of this point - David Lynch does not exist and has never had an effect on cinema whatsoever.<p>3. Advocate for more &quot;normal&quot; policies that are almost as good: As a general rule weird things that get accepted and mainstreamed have all sorts of proponents some of which are weird extremists some of whom are less weird. In pushing against racism, the more moderate policies were accepted not because everyone had switched from pushing more extremist views but because the extremist views existed to make the moderate look good (I believe this is part of the generally accepted narrative). If everyone pushing for something currently considered weird moderated their views then the moderated view would become the new weird.

Another book less charitable to Saudi, American, or even my own role in the country’s history is “Cities of Salt” by Abdelrahman Munif.

I feel statistical soft-ban systems are a much more reasonable way to handle this problem than the 100% confirmed binary signature permaban systems that seem an obsessive fantasy for some in the industry.

There are already discussions at the highest levels of the Bitcoin community to raise the cap[0].<p>Also what are forks and new coins if not new currency in circulation? The supply of &quot;bitcoin&quot; doubled when BCH forked. The supply doubled again when BSV forked.<p>&gt; Low and predictable inflation rate.<p>See caveats above. Also the inflation rate has appeared to have 0 impact on the price of BTC so far, so it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a meaningful metric. Payments for goods and services using BTC are almost always denominated in fiat with BTC being used as the medium of exchange (eg a seller wants $50 for some pills but accepts payment in $50 worth of BTC). BTC&#x27;s inflation rate is meaningless in this scenario.<p>&gt; Lack of a central authority. This makes Bitcoin resistant to censorship and voluntary manipulation of its parameters.<p>This is arguably somewhat true. However, there are very few meaningfully sized Bitcoin miners, and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume a single miner may have or be able to have &gt;51% of the hashrate if they desired. The core development team is also fairly small with a relatively small number of people and organizations controlling what ships.<p>As for censorship: exchanges censor bitcoin addresses and manipulate (eg lose, socialize losses) balances all the time. As long as bitcoin is beholden to fiat for its value, it&#x27;s far from censorship proof.<p>&gt; Low transaction costs and acceptable processing speed.<p>&quot;acceptable processing speed&quot; is laughable from a retail transaction perspective.<p>&quot;Low transaction cost&quot; is arguably somewhat true, but there&#x27;s also times of fee volatility as well as a times of high risk if you don&#x27;t pay enough fees to get processed quickly. Resubmitting transactions with higher fees is possible but complex and imperfect.<p>&gt; Security and irreversibility of transactions<p>&quot;Security of transactions&quot; is arguably true in the technical sense that the PKI protecting a transaction is so far unbreakable. However that&#x27;s just one attack vector: it&#x27;s untrue and meaningless for the vast majority of financial attack vectors. Sure double spends are exceptionally hard, but theft is rampant, loss due to technical error&#x2F;bugs is common, and then irreversibility is a liability not an advantage.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mhluongo&#x2F;status&#x2F;1092559017178734594\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mhluongo&#x2F;status&#x2F;1092559017178734594<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-04 20:55:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Doches"],"id":[22238636],"kids":[22238982,22239049],"parent":[22238508],"text":["By Betteridge&#x27;s law of headlines: _No_."],"time":["2020-02-04 18:52:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lazyjones"],"id":[22233034],"kids":[22233323,22234456,22233386,22233869],"parent":[22230710],"text":["What a load of nonsense.

It works essentially the same way as their current method, but Windows is responsible for protecting the encryption key (and has a broker than can house it at a higher privilege level).<p>But ultimately if you have a process running in the user&#x27;s context and can manipulate the TeamViewer client, you can bypass the Data Protection API pretty trivially (e.g. injected DLL, UI hooks, other misc memory hooks, etc).<p>So my question would be: Describe the scenario where a bad actor has the ability to arbitrarily read data within a user&#x27;s execution context, but not manipulate the TeamViewer Client also running in that same user&#x27;s context? Because I got nothing.<p>My security advice here is simple: Don&#x27;t save passwords to your local machine if you don&#x27;t want them saved to your local machine. And don&#x27;t leave backups of your saved passwords in insecure locations.

Almost every Chinese I saw during the trip wares a mask. In SFO airport, during the flight, Beijing airport, and on the street. Not many people wear gloves. One guy even wears goggles. I wore an N95 mask and vinyl gloves (couldn&#x27;t find surgical gloves, and masks are sold out for a lot of pharmacies) for the whole trip (like 15 hours), not the most pleasant experience but acceptable.<p>2. I filled in two additional forms on the flight which asked if I have been to Hubei (the province which Wuhan located in). One from the custom authority and one from Beijing authority, but the forms are almost identical.<p>3. When I tried to take a lift, I found Didi (Uber&#x2F;Lyft counterpart) requires every driver and passenger to wear a mask or everyone has the right to reject and report others if they don&#x27;t. I guess would I have to take the metro if I didn&#x27;t buy a mask in the US, but I&#x27;m also not sure if the metro staff would let me in if that was the case. Simply put, there are tons of public places that reject people that don&#x27;t wear masks, it seems to be a very hard time for people who are unfortunately couldn&#x27;t buy&#x2F;afford overpriced masks.<p>4. There are people on the street, but very few. It was the last day of the holiday, in prior years it should be crowded already because people migrate back from every province to Beijing.<p>5. When I back to my apartment, I found almost every apartment would have security guards stop visitors from entering the apartment, for those who live here requires to show a paper from the apartment to enter freely. Rumor says there are even apartments lockdown themselves that people cannot go out, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s true.<p>6. Although Beijing is always easy to buy everything online, food delivery choices only have very few options left for now. Not sure if it would back to normal after the holiday ends. Other than food and medical supplies, things haven&#x27;t changed much. And also delivery guys cannot enter the apartment, so people have to go outside the apartment to get the delivery.<p>7.

We&#x27;re well funded and backed by some of the top investors in the crypto &#x2F; blockchain space.<p>I&#x27;m on the product team, and we&#x27;re looking for both product and protocol engineers - but you can find all the roles we&#x27;re hiring for here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codaprotocol.com&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codaprotocol.com&#x2F;jobs.html<\/a>.
