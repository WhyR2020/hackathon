EdDSA has its problems, but malleability is not one of them, if one is following RFC 8032.<p>&gt;There are several ways to sign a document with EdDSA, and produce a valid signature. The three sources of malleability are:<p>&gt;We can add a multiple of L (the order of the prime subgroup) to s. Recall that B has order L as well, so it will absorb any cofactor. Basically everything happens modulo L, so adding L won&#x27;t change a thing.<p>This is prevented in RFC 8032 by checking that 0 &lt;= s &lt; L. Tink [1] does this check, and therefore is malleability free.<p>&gt;We can sign the same message with a different nonce r. This requires knowledge of the secret key a.<p>This proves that the signature of a message is not unique -- that is the signer can product multiple signatures -- but I haven&#x27;t seen anyone calling this a malleability issue. Malleability is about taking a triple (public key, signature message) and tweaking bits to produce another valid triple.<p>&gt;We can add a low order point to A, and subtract it from R. That way we produce a valid signature, but from a public key nobody vouches for. If the verifier checks the weaker equation, we can add a low order point to just R, and produce a &quot;valid&quot; signature with the same public key.<p>This is the second time I saw this claim. When I first saw it [2], I thought, wait, this test is missing in Wycheproof [3], but Bleichenbacher does NOT miss anything. That&#x27;s when I knew it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Modifying A or R instantly makes the signature invalid. Using the article&#x27;s notation, the signature is validated by checking that<p>B.s.8 == R.8 + A.h.8, where h = SHA-512(R, A, M) and M is the message<p>Multiplying the cofactor or not doesn&#x27;t matter, doesn&#x27;t introduce any weakness, as implied by the article.

Historically, the average P&#x2F;E ratio for S&amp;P 500 companies is around 16.

Other commenters have rightly pointed out how precarious this situation is in the longer term. I&#x27;m more worried about the callousness of the average person on this issue. American economics are so polluted with worship of great titans of business that nobody really seems that concerned that millions of Americans are facing perhaps permanent homelessness and long-term unemployment in the next few months.<p>Pumping failing businesses full of cash when millions of our citizens are struggling to buy food should not be normal. It is not a stepping stone of necessity to preserve our way of life. It is a choice to use capital to violate perhaps the most central tenet of capitalism: businesses must face the consequences when the punch bowl runs dry. This is socialism for corporations and we&#x27;re all footing the bill."],"time":["2020-04-09 18:32:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ghouse"],"id":[22823374],"kids":[22827278,22823560,22823654],"parent":[22822869],"text":["So, the GOP is pro-free market, except when they&#x27;re not?

FIRST is the most well known at this point, thanks to excellent promotion by Dean Kamen.  And Vex is great.  But I think Botball has long thought been historically the best of the three, if the goal is to inspire, teach, and enable students who otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have had an such opportunity.<p>BotBall is a shoestring nonprofit which was out very early doing competitions using Lego, motors and sensors, and MIT Handyboards: essentially a middle-school and high-school version of MIT&#x27;s 6270 class.  Botball competitions pit one robot against another and the robots are fully autonomous.  Once the lights go on, the robots are completely on their own.  Botball doesn&#x27;t do teleoperation at all.  This forces students to think of robots as complete systems of mechanical, electrical, sensory, and computational elements.  I think this is good.<p>But BotBall has a critical additional big plus: it is very cheap.  BotBall is a shoestring nonprofit and costs very little for schools to get started, and they work hard to allow schools to reuse most of their kits the next year even as the competition changes, so the rewnewal cost is extremely low.  This means that BotBall is a very good choice for Title-1 and other disadvantaged schools, as well as non-school entities.  One problem I&#x27;ve seen with some STEM ventures is their high cost, which is then offset by corporate sponsorship for schools.  And there are a lot of problems with that model, often resulting in bias in selection of schools, or in kids&#x27; educational experience getting sidelined in the name of corporate success.  BotBall is not only cheap for schools, but it&#x27;s so cheap that corporate, private, or academic sponsors can jump in without a need to win at all costs.  I myself have funded several Title-1 schools several times as a (mediocre) line item in NSF robotics and AI grants I&#x27;ve received, and highly recommend it."],"time":["2020-04-10 01:39:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bargl"],"id":[22828640],"kids":{},"parent":[22827073],"text":["When this whole mess is behind us, find a local team and volunteer.

Cohort analysis does not appear to have caught on in the CFR calculation world from what I’ve been reading.<p>Third, I’ve read that there are likely a significant number deaths that are probably attributable to COVID-19 that are not being counted as Covid-19.

Try a chunking approach, where you get a vector for each chunk of the document and horizontally concatenate those together (if your vectors are 50d, and do 5 chunks per doc, than you get a 250d fixed vector for each document regardless of length). This partially solves the issue of highly diluted vectors which is responsible for the poor results that some users are reporting.

We&#x27;re going to be teaching both of those as the default approach for using Redux going forward.<p>- We have a new &quot;Style Guide&quot; docs page that gives our official guidance on suggested usage patterns [2]<p>- On that note, I&#x27;m working on an ongoing major rewrite of the Redux core docs [3].  My current task is creating a new &quot;Quick Start&quot; tutorial, which will be a &quot;top-down&quot; intro to using Redux to stand alongside the existing &quot;bottom-up&quot; tutorial sequence.  The goal of the Quick Start section is to quickly introduce Redux concepts, and show RTK and hooks as the &quot;right way to write Redux code&quot;, without going into the details of how it works under the hood, so that folks can get started now and learn the underlying aspects later.  I&#x27;ve an early partial WIP draft PR up [4], and hope to finish the first draft in the next few days.  Once the Quick Start page is done, I&#x27;ll be turning my attention to rewriting the main tutorial sequence in order to remove outdated terms, clarify explanations, and teach simpler patterns (like using &quot;ducks&quot; files instead of splitting code across multiple files).<p>If anyone&#x27;s got questions on anything I wrote in the article or otherwise Redux-related, ask away!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux-toolkit.js.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux-toolkit.js.org<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react-redux.js.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;hooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react-redux.js.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;hooks<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;style-guide&#x2F;style-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;style-guide&#x2F;style-guide<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3592\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3592<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;pull&#x2F;3740\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;pull&#x2F;3740<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-09 16:08:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cameronfraser"],"id":[22822834],"kids":{},"parent":[22822198],"text":["I found I was just using Redux as a data caching layer and ended up using SWR hooks instead <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swr.now.sh&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swr.now.sh&#x2F;<\/a>.

That, in conjunction with hooks for any other stateful concerns we have, makes for a sane and pleasant dev experience.<p>IMO the biggest and best draw of Redux is how it allows you to completely separate your business logic from your UI layers. Your components only know about props and state and are rather trivial to test. Hooks are great for re-usable logic as well but my team made the choice to have hooks deal only with localized state concerns and have a robust Actions =&gt; Services =&gt; Reducer layer for everything that speaks to things outside that constraint. Its worked out wonderfully so far. Tests are a breeze and logic is highly portable. Our UI layer is thin and easy to change.<p>Its not all roses of course. The Redux store can turn into a rats nest of keys and values with no obvious structure (or worse, duplicated structures). It&#x27;s something that requires actually sitting down and modelling out your data structures. Sadly that&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t see very often (and I am just as guilty as anyone else). The Redux team came up with some good guidelines on this point (too lazy to track the link down but its on the main site) and I think they have some really good ideas. I think more than anything its important to consider your store in the same manner you would a database and approach it with that kind of mindset.

He&#x27;s right.  He&#x27;s absolutely right.<p>There is a duality between the much-hated EAV and table-oriented representations of data, especially if you are disciplined in your schema design so that the mapping between your EAV schema and a SQL table-oriented schema is natural.<p>I really would like to see automatic duality between EAV and relational models in RDBMSes.  This would give users great query expressive power.  EAV is perfect for &quot;graph&quot; queries, which are essentially recursive queries that chase relations without having to specify which relation types -- as long as all of them have the same shape, you can do this with EAV.  That means that you can write queries like &quot;give me all the things this user has access to&quot;, or &quot;all the users that have access to this entity&quot; while traversing arbitrary relations like &quot;user belongs to group&quot;, &quot;group belongs to group&quot;, &quot;access grant&quot;, etc.<p>EAV is, essentially, the most normal form you can construct.  And the more normal the form, the easier it is to apply CRDT techniques should you want to.  Also, if you normalize the keys (see SQLite4[0], yes, <i>4<\/i>, an abandoned project, but the docs are still there) then you get to trivially use any distributed ordered key&#x2F;value store, and you can distribute the key ranges, and it&#x27;s trivial.<p>Now, EAV is much hated.  But that hatred is wrong.  The problem is that RDBMSes aren&#x27;t exposing a dual of EAV <i>and<\/i> tables.  If you have an EAV schema you can create VIEWs that look like equivalent table-oriented schemas -- the reverse is also possible, but somewhat harder.  Using VIEWs to bridge the gap imposes a heavy burden on the query optimizer.  But SQLite4 and similar database designs essentially have EAV stores internally that they could expose with a lot less complexity than VIEWs impose.<p>We can haz EAV and table orientation at the same time.  We should have it.<p>Plus, as TFA says, you can combine EAV with timeseries, which allows you to have time travel in your queries, and even transactions (e.g., run a transaction now that has an effect in the future), which makes your data naturally copy-on-write, which greatly improves read performance.  Granted, you have to cleanup unnecessary history at some point, otherwise it piles up (vacuum), but that&#x27;s OK.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;src4&#x2F;doc&#x2F;trunk&#x2F;www&#x2F;design.wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;src4&#x2F;doc&#x2F;trunk&#x2F;www&#x2F;design.wiki<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 18:30:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mst"],"id":[22805023],"kids":{},"parent":[22803776],"text":["Slides available without a loginwall here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gotocon.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;goto-cph-2012&#x2F;slides&#x2F;iconoclasts&#x2F;ImpedanceMismatch.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gotocon.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;goto-cph-2012&#x2F;slides&#x2F;iconoclasts&#x2F;Impe...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 18:58:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["slowmovintarget"],"id":[22807290],"kids":{},"parent":[22803776],"text":["Rich Hickey&#x27;s talk on the design of Datomic is also something every programmer should see at least once: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Cym4TZwTCNU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Cym4TZwTCNU<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-07 22:46:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Groxx"],"id":[22829509],"kids":[22832083,22830580],"parent":[22803776],"text":["At 40:00: Time-based data, horizontally scalable, dumb storage, replicas don&#x27;t need to be synchronized, you can contact any replica.

It seems to have forgotten about the headline question after the first few paragraphs, and doesn&#x27;t make any other clear point in the end.<p>Here&#x27;s a very traditional economist answer.<p>Helicopter money is neither a way of of the current crisis, nor a fallacy. It is good to do it now, but it won&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; the crisis. It&#x27;s still much better to do it than not.<p>Macro-economic recessions&#x2F;crises, defined as a temporary drop in aggregate income&#x2F;production (= GDP = GDI), are caused by a drop of (some combination of) aggregate demand (how much people will buy at a given price level) or aggregate supply (how much people produce at a given price level) [1], in economic parlance, negative supply- or demand shocks. If we have a pure supply shock, demand side measures such as lowering interest rates, helicopter money, government stimulus, will mostly just increase prices. OTOH, with a pure demand shock, most of such measures will probably help[2]. With demand shocks, the productive capacity is still there (&quot;potential output&quot;), but the demand needs to increase to &quot;close the output gap&quot;.<p>Most post-WW2 recessions in advanced economies are negative demand-shock recessions (we haven&#x27;t been able to identify short-term economy-wide drops in production capacity), so demand side stimulus is by and large helpful (except when they really overdid it in the 1970, when it did cause high inflation).<p>The current crisis is a combination of both a big demand shock and a big supply shock. This means that demand side measures such as helicopter money will help (in the sense that things will be much worse if we did&#x27;t do it). But things will also become more expensive (either nominally in sticker prices if the demand stimulus is large enough, or just in real terms compared to people&#x27;s incomes) due to the supply shock. The supply side shock can only be remedied by really controlling the pandemic.<p>All of this is very moderate traditional undergraduate level economics, and will explain most of the upcoming economic upheavals perfectly fine. Keep this in mind when you read stories cherry picked to make some point about current&#x2F;upcoming economic or monetary policy.<p>[1] A drop in aggregate supply could be cause by e.g. a big natural disaster, war, pandemic. What might cause a drop in aggregate demand is still somewhat of a mystery.<p>[2] Most of the economic debate is which form of stimulus is more effective, and about more esoteric second order effects. But there might still a minority of hard core &quot;Real Business Cycle&quot; economists who doubt the existence of demand-side shortfalls."],"time":["2020-04-09 14:51:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajb"],"id":[22821452],"kids":{},"parent":[22821186],"text":["Related, Frances Coppola is an advocate of Helicopter money and UBI, but doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right medicine for these current circumstances: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coppolacomment.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;when-is-right-time-for-ubi-and.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coppolacomment.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;when-is-right-time-for...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-09 13:17:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Proven"],"id":[22821834],"kids":{},"parent":[22821186],"text":["Helicopter money is a new tax on taxpaying individuals and savers, or simply - theft.<p>Will they steal?
