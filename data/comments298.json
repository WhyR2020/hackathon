The great thing about bow tie diagrams is that they capture the information you need for a high-level safety analysis without getting bogged down in the details.<p>Bow tie diagrams are also excellent for stakeholder communication.

It is possible to have both conditions simultaneously, and likely very common. ADHD is a condition defined by a sustained period of symptoms, not underlying causes or biological tests. It is 100% consistent for someone to have ADHD in one environment and not in another. This is how it is viewed in psychiatry. If you spend many years as an accountant focusing on detailed work in your job, but you can’t focus to complete your work, you may be diagnosed with ADHD and treated with medicine. If you then change careers to be an artist in a creative field, but face no dysfunction or difficulty in completing your work, you would no longer be diagnosed. The same applies to having a sleep disorder and then getting it treated.

Yes, Tesla is still a luxury brand with majority of the models selling at close to $40k USD or above (the $35k USD Model 3 standard range version was removed from their website, even though you can still technically order them by talking to a sales rep.)<p>Until Tesla can make their cars at below $30k range, they are not going to be competing head to head with VW and Hyundai, or in other words, they won&#x27;t enjoy the sales number that VW or Hyundai has. There just aren&#x27;t many who can afford Tesla. This is basic economics.<p>PS: Nissan Leaf sales numbers low is probably outlier due to the charging port (Nissan uses ChadeMo instead of CCS for fast charging, but they reverse course at 2021 model year since ChadeMo is dead outside of Japan) and the charging infrastructure issues.<p>PPS: Tesla manufacturing quality is also another issue - comparing to mature automotive manufacturers like VW and Hyundai. VW has 80 years of history of making cars, Hyundai has 50. Tesla is FAR behind in terms of the operational and manufacturing quality control than traditional automotive competitors, especially the German ones and Toyota (too bad, Toyota is betting big on hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid technologies, not on EV)."],"time":["2020-08-13 17:22:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["manomanowicz"],"id":[24144651],"kids":{},"parent":[24143761],"text":["Tesla&#x27;s current vehicle portfolio doesn&#x27;t suit the current market trends in Europe. Only the Model 3, S, and X are currently available. Two are sedans which are losing market share to SUV type vehicles and the model X SUV is very expensive for most consumers.<p>Most vehicle sales in Europe are in the B or C car segment (relatively small vehicles by North American standards). Increasingly the sales of B and C cars are moving away from hatchback models to CUVs (crossover utility vehicle) models which offer a raised seating position and more interior space. Tesla offer nothing in these segments which the likes of Volkswagen, Hyundai and Renault do.<p>The Model Y should do well once it launches but I can imagine competitors who can offer a lower price albeit compromising the range doing better in this segment. Given that the distances driven in Europe are on average lower, the additional range Tesla can offer is not massively compelling unless they can undercut their rivals on price.<p>On a slight tangent, the other threat is the increasing hybridisation of powertrains in Europe. Due to EU rules on the EU fleet -wide average Co2 levels of 95 gCo2&#x2F;km coming into effect from 2021, vehicle manufacturers are now offering hybrid options on many name plates to reach this target. These PHEV and FHEV hybrid powertrains come at a significantly lower price compared with full electric vehicles with the benefit of short range electric driving only mode. Previously PHEV and FHEV were separate name plates which had unique (read: polarising) designs. Now PHEV and FHEV are pretty much available in all C car and above class vehicles in body styles not dissimilar from their combustion powertrain counterparts.

I want to present an alternative viewpoint. It&#x27;s not a monopoly issue, it is an anti-competitive issue.\nIn Canada, we have three major cell carriers. None of them has a monopoly, or anything close to it. None of them has even 50% market share.<p>You can have a 10 GB smartphone plan with Rogers for $75. If you don&#x27;t like that, you can switch to Bell&#x27;s 10 GB plan for $75. If you don&#x27;t like Bell, of course you can switch to Telus&#x27;s 10 GB plan for, wait for it, $75.<p>The Big 3 operate smaller brands with fewer bells and whistles and lower costs. You can get a 4 GB cell plan from Koodo (Telus subsidiary) for $50, or from Fido (Rogers subsidiary) for $50, or from Virgin Mobile (Bell subsidiary) for $50.<p>Sometimes one of them has promotional pricing, like $45 instead of $50 for 4GB. The other two offer the same pricing for the same duration. Sometimes one of them increases their prices by $5 a month citing reasons such as infrastructure investments, lower Canadian dollar value, or inflation. The other two increase their prices by the same amount a couple of days later.<p>And none of this is collusion in the legal sense. They don&#x27;t gather in smoke-filled rooms and decide how to screw over their customers. There is not back-channel communication whatsoever. And it is not because the competition is so perfect the prices have been commoditized. In fact, Canada has some of the highest cell plan prices in the world, even adjusting for factors such as population density and GDP.<p>It&#x27;s just that the big companies have decided to stop competing. If you live in, say Alberta or Ontario or BC, you have three options and they are all the same overpriced crap. Cell carriers in Canada are not a monopoly, but you don&#x27;t have to be a monopoly to harm customers with anti-competitive behaviour. Apple and Google, Android and iOS do not have a monopoly or a collusion agreement. But they are harming the customers all the same."],"time":["2020-08-13 23:58:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mwnivek"],"id":[24147509],"kids":{},"parent":[24147127],"text":["Main discussion:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24146902\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24146902<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-13 21:37:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["seebetter"],"id":[24148013],"kids":[24149618],"parent":[24147127],"text":["It’s amazing that one company could control the hardware and universal functions like texting in such a restrictive hyper-capitalistic way.<p>“You can write apps for our hardware but all your purchases we take 30%...” imagine Microsoft trying this tactic in the 1990s."],"time":["2020-08-13 22:06:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dchuk"],"id":[24143974],"kids":[24145384,24145301],"parent":[24142903],"text":["Sure seems like Twitter should lock verified accounts of individuals once the individual is deceased"],"time":["2020-08-13 16:58:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rchaud"],"id":[24144006],"kids":[24144367,24144028,24145197],"parent":[24142903],"text":["I believe they&#x27;ve since changed the name on the account to &quot;The Cain Gang&quot;, although the handle is still &quot;@THEhermaincain&quot;.

You can&#x27;t tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don&#x27;t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you&#x27;ve proven that&#x27;s where the bottleneck is.<p>True, but emphasis on the speed <i>hack<\/i>. It shouldn&#x27;t stop you from thinking about performance in your design. If it means doing less, do less now. If it means adding a speed hack (usually some sort of cache), don&#x27;t do it until you are sure that you need it.<p>Rule 2. Measure. Don&#x27;t tune for speed until you&#x27;ve measured, and even then don&#x27;t unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.<p>I agree completely. But you have to realize that measuring is as much of an art form as optimization is. Especially on today&#x27;s ridiculously complex systems, the bottleneck may not be obvious. For example a function may take a long time to run, but the real cause may be another function flushing the cache.<p>Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don&#x27;t get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)<p>Disagree, unless you can prove that n will stay small. You don&#x27;t know how your users will abuse your program. For example, you may have designed your program to handle shopping lists of a few dozens of items, and then someone decides to import the entire McMaster-Carr catalogue, which has more than half a million items. It may be a great use case you didn&#x27;t thought of, and that fancy algorithm permits it by scaling well. There are also vulnerabilities that exploit high algorithmic complexity and worst cases. Don&#x27;t overdo it, but N^2 is rarely a good idea if you can avoid it.<p>Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they&#x27;re much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.<p>True, but with the caveats of Rule 3<p>Rule 5. Data dominates. If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.<p>Agree, for me there is a hierarchy in code. From most important to least important: data (structures), code (algorithms), comments.<p>The order comes from the fact that if you change your data, you need to change your code too, and if you change your code, you also need to change your comments.

How low do you think the price would have to be to get 50-80% of your neighbors to buy it? Would $20&#x2F;mo be low enough?<p>I&#x27;ve spent my career building and maintaining small, regional Internet Service providers. One of the realities of the market is that no matter how good your service is you can&#x27;t get more than around 15-25% of people in an area to use your service. Most of the companies trying to do this on a large-ish scale (like Starry) are trying to break that barrier by selling wholesale contracts (like exclusive contracts to entire apartments buildings &#x2F; communities) and&#x2F;or by piling other services on top of the Internet service and reaching higher and higher speeds.<p>I have a hypothesis that a company that could go the other direction and provide a really cheap, basic Internet connection (&lt;20$&#x2F;mo, 30mbps) could gain more market share in an area specifically because it would be cheap enough to be used as a secondary Internet connection. I&#x27;m thinking of three types of customer here:<p>1) Very price sensitive customers who just want the cheapest thing they can get that&#x27;s still usable. Maybe they have Internet access at work and use satellite TV at home and are OK with very basic Internet service at home.<p>2) Customers who use the service as their primary connection and it saves them enough money to add tethering to their phone plan, so if the service is unreliable they can switch to tethering.<p>3) Customers who have cable TV and Internet and can switch over to this service when their cable Internet is slow or down.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of two types of plans, one for $20&#x2F;mo and one for 10$&#x2F;mo + 1$&#x2F;day that the service is used. These numbers mostly work out on paper <i>as long as<\/i> &gt;60% of the homes in a community sign up to use the service <i>and<\/i> it&#x27;s understood that support is going to be slow. Like, no phone support (email&#x2F;text only), response times in 1-2 business days, and it might take a week to send someone out if your service is down (but we won&#x27;t charge you for the time it was down.) Obviously this class of service only works if it&#x27;s redundant with something else. I&#x27;m kind of thinking about it as the &#x27;MagicJack&#x27; of Internet service - as home phone service started to become less essential (due to the redundancy of having a phone in your pocket) it became possible for a very low cost and not particularly reliable service to have a place in the market. They would not have had the strict geographic customer density constraint, though.<p>The cool thing is that once you get to that 60-80% market penetration you can start offering really great plans at really great prices. Like 1gbps symmetrical for $50-60&#x2F;mo, 10G symmetrical for ~$250&#x2F;mo.<p>If anyone is interested in chatting about this my email is in my profile. I&#x27;m not quite committed to pursuing it, but it&#x27;s something I think about a lot and would love to get some outside perspective."],"time":["2020-08-12 22:43:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["UncleOxidant"],"id":[24134735],"kids":{},"parent":[24133455],"text":["Only 70%?"],"time":["2020-08-12 19:50:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregors"],"id":[24135732],"kids":{},"parent":[24133455],"text":["obligatory EPB post here - Chattanooga, TN - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epb.com&#x2F;home-store&#x2F;internet\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epb.com&#x2F;home-store&#x2F;internet<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-12 21:23:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tiny_epoch"],"id":[24134258],"kids":{},"parent":[24133455],"text":["Forget simply &quot;doing your job&quot;. <i>LIFE<\/i> mostly requires an internet connection if you want to take part in society."],"time":["2020-08-12 19:13:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["savanpatel"],"id":[24136293],"kids":{},"parent":[24133455],"text":["Their sample size is 950 Americans.

As more jobs become redundant, how should &#x27;useless people&#x27; be compensated relative to &#x27;useful people&#x27; without whom the economy could not operate?<p>To complicate matters, many of the &#x27;useless people&#x27; could be highly skilled and could theoretically launch their own businesses and start competing against established businesses and take away some market share...\nBut if the market is already saturated and consumers are already satisfied beyond their perceptual capacity, launching a business in such a saturated industry could not be regarded as a &#x27;useful&#x27; activity in a broad sense (it&#x27;s a zero-sum game).\nThis means that being able to capture economic value (profits) from an industry would not necessarily imply that someone is useful; in fact, an increase in profits may not bear any correlation with an increase in consumer satisfaction in that industry; in a saturated market, the profits for a specific company or individual could entirely be the result of political lobbying, social scheming, or luck and have nothing to do with increased consumer satisfaction.<p>Given that useless people are still capable of capturing profits from an industry by starting their own business, it would be highly unethical for the incumbents (those who own the means of production in the saturated markets) to try to stop the &#x27;useless people&#x27; from trying to compete (since that would deny them access to the same fair playing field which the incumbents themselves had benefited from in the past).\nYet at the same time, it may be more efficient overall if, instead of trying to compete in a saturated market, &#x27;useless people&#x27; would accept the reality that they are in fact useless and instead of trying to compete, they would get paid to be idle.<p>But if useless people get paid to be idle, then how will useful people who still need to work feel about that?\nAlso, even for people who have useful skills, there may be more people who have those skills than there are positions to fill.\nHow then do we choose which people should have a job and which should not? Does it make sense to select them based on skill if the skill level of the employee does not affect consumer satisfaction?<p>It seems like this would create an incentive for useless idle people to pretend to be or have been useful; they can&#x27;t just accumulate enough money to go idle without having a backstory to go with it. Yet at the same time it is in the interest of incumbents (owners of the means of production) for these people to go idle instead of competing with them. To appease those who are still working, every member of the idle class needs an excuse (e.g. they sold their company to Google for a few million $). The economy then becomes centered around manufacturing backstories for new members of the idle class... Until the point where everything is automated and everyone can be idle.<p>I think the biggest problem with this story is that if we remove the market selection mechanism?

What I mean is your valuation is determined by the demand for your shares. VCs have a specific ownership % they need for their model to work.

Many successful entrepreneurs say its not the amount you raise that is dilutive, it’s the number of times you raise.<p>In addition, good seed VCs are happy to give you a higher valuation when you have investor demand, so you can take more capital.

Yes, there is risk of over-dilution if you raise boatloads too much out of the gate (including the very real and potentially fatal risk of being undisciplined on spending). But at the end of the day, if a founder figures out the business in that first 12 month window and is still sitting on another 12-24 months of cash, she has so much more power than if she is 4 months to cash out. She can take capital now but exactly on her terms. She can decide to keep pushing and raise in 12-18 months when the business will be in even better shape (and valuations higher, etc). Time becomes her friend, not her enemy. In my opinion, one would be crazy not to take more capital when it&#x27;s this insanely cheap (valuations for 2 people with a powerpoint have never been higher). As we&#x27;ve seen with so many great companies, p&#x2F;m often takes more than 8 months. Take more than you need and buy time. It will come out in the wash.
