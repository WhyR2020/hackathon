I think humans are not born to be monogamous, but they have been (poorly) programmed to accept that by religion and society."],"time":["2020-08-24 15:45:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["asciimike"],"id":[24266566],"kids":{},"parent":[24260004],"text":["I really like Wait Buy Why&#x27;s take on &quot;How to Pick a Life Partner&quot;:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;pick-life-partner.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;pick-life-partner.html<\/a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;pick-life-partner-part-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;pick-life-partner-part-2.html<\/a><p>And the follow-up of sorts, &quot;The Marriage Decision: Everything Forever or Nothing Ever Again&quot;<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;marriage-decision.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;marriage-decision.html<\/a><p>I think it takes a super pragmatic (maybe to the point of being un-romantic) approach to dating and finding a partner, including many &quot;litmus tests&quot; of sorts.

Markdown’s strict specified variation, Commonmark, seems like a pretty decent choice.<\/i><p>Markdown of any form would be a catastrophically bad choice for something like this. Remember this: <i>Markdown is all about HTML<\/i>. Markdown has serious limitations and is very poorly designed in places, but it works well enough despite being so bad specifically because underneath it’s all HTML, so you can fall down to that when necessary. If you go with Markdown, you’re not actually supporting “Markdown” as your language, but HTML. If the user writes HTML in their Markdown, what are you going to do about it? You’re supposed to be able to write the HTML equivalent of any given Markdown construct and have it work, and I find that perfectly normal documents <i>need<\/i> to write raw HTML <i>regularly<\/i>, because Markdown is so terribly limited—so your document web is either (a) not actually Markdown and uselessly crippled (seriously, plain Markdown without HTML is extremely limiting for documents), or (a) actually completely back to being a subset of HTML, which is exactly what you said you didn’t want it to be (rule #1).<p>If you want to get away from HTML, you want something like reStructuredText, where you <i>don’t<\/i> have access to HTML (unless the platform decides to set up a directive or role for raw HTML), but have a whole lot more semantic functionality, functionality that <i>had<\/i> to be included <i>because HTML wasn’t there to fall back on<\/i>. I think AsciiDoc is like this too.<p>But the whole premise that “HTML must be replaced because it’s a performance or accessibility bottleneck for documents” is just not in the slightest bit true. HTML is fine. Even CSS is well enough (though most pages have terribly done stylesheets that are far heavier than they should be, e.g. because they include four resets and duplicate everything as well as overriding font families five times). The problem lies almost entirely in what JavaScript makes <i>possible<\/i>—not that JavaScript is inherently a problem, but it makes problems <i>possible<\/i>. The proposed variety of document web would be unlikely to perform substantially better than the existing web with JavaScript disabled.<p>All up, Robert O’Callahan’s response is entirely correct. You can’t split the web like this; you will fail. Especially: if your new system is not compatible with the old (which your rule #2 precluded), it will fail, unless it is <i>extremely<\/i> more compelling for everyone (rule #3), but I don’t believe there’s anywhere near enough scope for improvement to succeed."],"time":["2020-08-24 08:05:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["slmjkdbtl"],"id":[24257655],"kids":[24257834,24258282],"parent":[24255541],"text":["So everyone is dreaming for their own version of the web &#x2F; browser.

Anyone doing practical assessment of the idea (as opposed to table talk) knows there won&#x27;t be any, at least until all the infrastructure and human-driven cars are reorganized to inter-operate with automatic ones. “If the mountain won&#x27;t come to Muhammad…” — unfortunately, it is possible that people will have to adapt to robots instead of the other way round if everyone decides that it really is the future. It might be that the author believes the general idea of “car sharing” to be correct, and struggles to find the reason why the company loses money. The problem is that the whole thing is a lie.<p>Their business model is not self-driving taxis. As with other “platforms”, it&#x27;s just blatant cutting down on “irrelevant” expenses wile keeping the good bits to themselves under the pretense that they are just “operating the computer” that allows someone else to do “everything”. Uber might have a lot of money to smokescreen it, and keep the image of a middle-class citizen “sharing” the car for a certain price, but in other places competition between taxi companies rapidly “optimizing” and “professionalizing” the market makes it clear that humanity has pompously reinvented the hackney coach. Even worse, the unregulated hackney coach, when poorest peasants ride their carriages to a big city and work endless shifts trying to catch some passenger first to be able to feed themselves for a day, or some rickshaws fight and badmouth each other only to get the tiniest number of coins. A typical driver for a “digital” taxicab is a sleep-deprived immigrant (private person or an employee of an official subcontractor, there&#x27;s little difference) wielding a number of burner phones running client apps from different companies (BTW, location spoofing solutions market is booming) who is useless without a navigation (hooray for modern bio-robots), but jumps every red light to shave minutes off. The real sharing happens between drivers — they share shifts, devices, accounts, and cars. However, the only important thing is that the big company gets the commission from each and every ride, so it&#x27;s all good. They seem to make enough money to spend some on remediation when accidents happen, all while keeping their stance on being just a system operator that gratuitously helps clients. None of this is specifically modern. Immigrants working as cab drivers predate computers, and tricks that allow stretching of taxi car shifts are just as old.<p>Well, you can argue that there are ratings. (John Doe rated this driver 1&#x2F;5: We both died in a car crash. Would not recommend.) Well, anyone in any kind of “digital marketplace” business can tell you that the whole point of stars, likes, and the like is to make users believe that there is a complex system that protects them in the background, and that their input matters. The fact is, the owner and only the owner of the system decides whether any of that is used, and to what extent. Say, how are upvotes and downvotes on Youtube videos used?

The speed-of-light in a medium depends on its relative dielectric constant K of the insulator material. For standard SiO2, it&#x27;s approximately 4, giving a speed of 0.5c, or only 15 centimeters per nanosecond (coincidentally, a typical circuit board has roughly the same dielectric constant, even coax, CAT-6, or fiber optics cables are not far off from it, 15 cm&#x2F;s is an useful number to remember).<p>In the history of process node improvements, various doping techniques have been developed for decreasing (or increasing) the K for better performance.

Take France for example, people used to pay around $10&#x2F;GB not so long ago. A new player came on the market and yes, didn&#x27;t have the same quality of service at first, but clearly cut the price and now a GB is 10x cheaper. Better, they now provide unlimited data for ~20$&#x2F;month (!!). As some have also mentioned, unlimited is something clearly missing as it can make the price&#x2F;GB completely meaningless in some cases. I currently live in Georgia and at the moment there are plans for ~1.5$&#x2F;week for truly unlimited data - speed is also great with ~50-100mbps and I live in a metropolitan, dense area.<p>A last point is roaming. This is where I believe most unfairness lies with big profits and ridiculous disparities. Some carries will charge $100+&#x2F;GB for roaming. Sometimes could even be $1000+(!!!) if you didn&#x27;t think of buying a plan.\nBut in the other hand, using my French simcard (the one with unlimited data for $20) I can get 25GB in most countries in the world (that include all Europe, USA, Canada, China, Australia, etc.) And that&#x27;s sometimes cheaper than local plans. Sometimes even better as it gives me the ability to switch between networks when coverage is low.<p>I know from friends who have been working in the industry that, prior the shake in France, carriers used to sit back and relax while making tremendous profits. There has been cases of illegal agreements between the 3 &quot;competitors&quot;&#x2F;actors.

Solo founders are most often devs, which means they focus 90% of their energy on dev and what little remains on marketing.

Making a product without any user feedback. You work 1 year on a product and realize people don&#x27;t get your idea. That&#x27;s why it is essential to get feedback every step of the way and your spouse doesn&#x27;t count :D<p>3. The good news is being a solo founder is no longer very unique thing.

After trying out hundred tools I&#x27;ve found that nothing beats trello. To each his own though but you really need a todo tool when working alone to keep on track.

Life is not easy, so you should treat yourself well :) I spent time building scripts to make dev &amp; ops easy. I rented a WeWork desk (first 6 months), then upgraded to a private office (2 years), then moved out wework (recent 6 months, due to covid-19). I bought SaaS products from other companies - I like spending money to save time.<p>2, Make it easy for others to contact myself. I put my contact on every page of my website [1]. The happiest moment of my day is always the time when I talk to inbound emails from some strangers. Yes, there will be trolls, but most people are nice &amp; with good intention. Nowadays, I spend at least 1&#x2F;3 of my time reply emails everyday.<p>3, Share progress on the Internet. I write a monthly email newsletter to report my progress [2] and some blogs to share my experience &amp; thoughts [3], which help me make some friends on the Internet :)<p>4, Meet people offline. Quite a few of my former coworkers are doing startups now. We hanged out a lot pre-COVID-19.<p>5, Unfollow some people on social media (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook…) and avoid seeing news from TechCrunch and other unhealthy VC-focused online media.

The hardest part of persisting is the emotional game. Improve your motivation by doing things in a way that even a failure of your primary business goal still leaves you in a better position career&#x2F;skill-wise than when you started. Also: figure out how to separate your identity from your business, otherwise every tiny failure or criticism will sap your energy.<p>2. For many — maybe most — products within reach of a solo founder, marketing will take up at least as much time as development. Unlike programming, marketing is shrouded in something not unlike the fog of war in RTS games. It is highly exploratory and experimental in nature. But dealing with this uncertainty carries its own intellectual appeal, one that you can learn to embrace — or even enjoy.<p>3. Outsource as much as can. If some work can be done for less than your hourly rate as a freelancer, then, overall you&#x27;re more efficient to code for $$$ then pay someone to handle that part of your business.<p>4. The technical skills that are most useful to a solo founder are more to do with system design than programming languages and frameworks. You should focus on things like data integrity, uptime, redundancy, error-tracking, rapid response to production issues, integration testing, etc. rather than which React.js state library is better.<p>5. Get to know other solo-founders.

Working solo has taken a heavy toll on me in many ways, both good and bad. I didn&#x27;t want to work alone but the people in my network only had excuses for why they wouldn&#x27;t work together.  During the time that I&#x27;ve worked alone, competitors have entered the market, thrived, and even successfully exited.  It has been crushing for me knowing that my vision and market were spot on accurate, and here I am watching others succeed at what I knew was real a long time ago.  Yet, they have taken a far more risk averse approach, leaving the holy grail for someone like me.  I didn&#x27;t want to work alone but I persist because working alone on this dream is worth more than not working on it at all.  Hope remains.  Things are finally changing this year, but it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve given up working alone without trying to raise funding.  My risk profile has changed during my solo career. I&#x27;m not going to fail to fundraise because I&#x27;m solo, anymore.  I&#x27;m bringing strong, modern tech assets, expertise, and validated business strategy to the table.  I&#x27;m going to crush any reservations that investors will have about me for being a solo founder.  The fact that I&#x27;m solo is nothing more than one person&#x27;s excuse for not getting involved.  Being solo was a legitimate concern years ago, but it&#x27;s not anymore.  I don&#x27;t need a founder.  I&#x27;m a hardened soldier who doesn&#x27;t need a shoulder to cry on but rather CBT, exercise, and sleep.  I have enough love in my life to carry on, and am very fortunate for that.  Moving forward is a frightening experience, but I will remain no matter the outcome.  I accept my fate and will fight like hell to arc towards the positive.<p>For the Dune fans:\nFear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

There’s so many people you will have to interact with that are <i>not<\/i> your co-founder. There’s so many people you can share your feelings with that are <i>not<\/i> your co-founder. And having a co-founder is no guarantee you won’t be lonely; a technical co-founder spends most his time heads down coding and a sales co-founder spends most his time out making deals. Occasionally you may have meetings about customer feedback and high level strategies but that’s about it; the intent of the relationship is not to spend weekends hiking or riding bikes together or other social activities. If you are feeling lonely the source of that must be coming from other aspects of your life.<p>Most of the time the loneliness a founder feels comes from the fact that almost no one that matters is enthusiastic about their idea, or at least not enough to pay for it. It creates a mentality that it’s you against a world that just doesn’t understand what you have to “offer”.<p>I hope he will realize this before too much time has been wasted.<p>Give this an upvote if you agree.<p>*edit: I wanted to elaborate on why this is a zombie startup in case people think I threw this out too casually. He calls his product a friendly privacy oriented photo organizer. First off, drop the word friendly, that’s a meaningless word when describing apps and usually just a way to say an application has some decent UX, which is expected by default anyway. Second, “privacy oriented” is a red flag unless your startup is deliberately targeting people who have something they feel they need to hide. This will do nothing to move the needle for most mass market consumers who already consume tons of products without any regard to privacy. A lot of your marketing will have to rely on first making people paranoid so they seek out a privacy focused product, which is kind of scummy. Third, what you’re left with is essentially a photo organizer, whose novelty is questionable in a world that has no lack of photo organization. There’s no way this will be a successful business at this rate.

This might be an interesting product &#x2F; demo for potential customers.<p>- Once you hook up your system to your customer&#x27;s back end, how do you learn from the behavioral data you get from them? That&#x27;s straightforward for cf&#x2F;mf, but can be tricky to integrate into what you already have.\n- You talk about Stripe pooling the data from their customers. I think the analogue for you would be pooling the behavioral data from your customers as opposed to the metadata. Have you thought about this?<p>- It sounds like you&#x27;re doing nearest neighbors on the vector representation. You may already know this, but LSH is a fast way to do this when you have many items.<p>- Do you embed all items from your different customers into the same vector space? That would be ideal from the POV of creating a pooled dataset that would be helpful for all future customers, but sounds tricky given that everyone likely has their own idiosyncratic system.<p>Best of luck!

The formation of carbon–nitrogen bonds from N2 typically has required reactive organic precursors that are incompatible with the reducing conditions that promote N2 reactivity1, which has prevented catalysis. Here we report a diketiminate-supported iron system that sequentially activates benzene and N2 to form aniline derivatives. The key to this coupling reaction is the partial silylation of a reduced iron–dinitrogen complex, followed by migration of a benzene-derived aryl group to the nitrogen. Further reduction releases N2-derived aniline, and the resulting iron species can re-enter the cyclic pathway. Specifically, we show that an easily prepared diketiminate iron bromide complex2 mediates the one-pot conversion of several petroleum-derived arenes into the corresponding silylated aniline derivatives, by using a mixture of sodium powder, crown ether, trimethylsilyl bromide and N2 as the nitrogen source. Numerous compounds along the cyclic pathway are isolated and crystallographically characterized, and their reactivity supports a mechanism for sequential hydrocarbon activation and N2 functionalization. This strategy couples nitrogen atoms from N2 with abundant hydrocarbons, and maps a route towards future catalytic systems."],"time":["2020-08-24 00:27:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wcoenen"],"id":[24256222],"kids":[24256525],"parent":[24255452],"text":["As far as I understand, the non-nitrogen atoms in the reaction are provided by benzene.<p>Fun fact: benzene is so important in chemistry that it has two unicode code points, <U+232C> and <U+23E3>."],"time":["2020-08-24 01:34:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidhyde"],"id":[24256239],"kids":{},"parent":[24255452],"text":["One of the uses of aniline is hypergolic rockets although its pretty toxic stuff and as not used for large rockets anymore.
