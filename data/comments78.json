Not a projection of fiction on a dead existence, but actually meaningful and intelligibly so (i.e., not some kind of mere passing feeling). Ideologies have attempted to create simulated meaning time and again, silly beliefs that drive people into madness, great and small. They have always failed because the &quot;meaning&quot; they provided was bogus, a deception that might animate people for some time, but is ultimately a fiction that ceases to maintain a lasting grip precisely because it is false. Only someone crippled by nihilism, stupidity, or opportunistic vice could latch onto something like that.<p>The trouble is that we have been sliding into nihilism for some time. Nietzsche observed this slide during his era. He did not believe in God himself, but he saw atheism as a dreadful, horrible thing. In his parable of the madman, the madman frantically asks the people in town where God is. They are amused at the spectacle, suggesting in jest that perhaps God is hiding beneath something over here, or other there. The townsfolk represent the people of his day, the atheists of the 19th century. The madman, of course, realizes the consequences of God&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; the horror of which the townsfolk have not yet come to understand. They are still dwelling in that twilight of the idols, fragmented and perverted pieces of the whole that was once held together by God before the earth was unchained from the sun and lost its orientation (Nietzsche gave the cult of Science some noteworthy attention as an example of one of these idols). The twilight does, sooner or later, come to an end, of course, and that&#x27;s when even the idols can no longer pacify our fears.<p>I think most people are like those townsfolk. True nihilism is unbearable. Anyone who claims otherwise is like the foolish teenager who is merely spiting his parents in an act of rebellion. Some of us sense the nihilism festering in our souls and begin to attach ourselves to various causes, fads, fashions, distractions. Anything to avert our gaze from the horrific void within us and before us. And America has always been a land of heretics (to borrow a characterization from Douthat), so perhaps the diversity of bizarre superstitions should be greater in the US than elsewhere. At the same time The &quot;mainstream&quot; pop culture is also vacuous, commercial, ideological, and stupid, itself dripping with hedonistic escapism from nihilism as much as any fringe movement (you should also expect a ascetic reaction for every hedonistic indulgence; each excess breeds its corresponding deficiency). Actually, we are in the throes of a kind of new gnosticism, a new Albigensian movement wherein the &quot;true meaning&quot; of the world, the &quot;true self&quot;, is beyond the world of facts and can in fact contradict the facts. The facts are an illusion, not the &quot;really real&quot;. They&#x27;re &quot;socially constructed&quot; much like the material world is the deceptive construction of the evil creator god of the Old Testament, at least according to the gnostics. It is a dangerous, noxious amalgamation of pride and delusion, a slide into self-destruction, something Man has always excelled at.

I was generally frustrated with some wider issues around building my website so I decided to blow some steam by tweeting about it. I actually thought &quot;that was too harsh&quot; considering I had nothing but praise for how user-friendly Ghost was (and how great Ghost support was - shoutout to Sarah, whoever you are, you shouldn&#x27;t be there).<p>The one thing you don&#x27;t expect is that a CEO of a company would take the annoyance of an account with circa.350 followers seriously and respond with what is apparently vitriolic rage, not only cussing me out, but then immediately going to shut my website down even though I was talking to a support rep at Ghost about upgrading and getting migration underway.<p>The main problems are this:<p>1. An automatic upgrade within 7 days that triples in price is sleazy, there&#x27;s no two ways to look at it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an American thing, but in Europe, a company would be crucified for doing this. You always have offer and acceptance before agreeing to something. It would be very easy for Ghost to simply put a popup stating &quot;you cannot add more staff users as you are on the basic plan - please upgrade here to do so&quot;. Again, no excuses here, it&#x27;s clear that some customers are being caught out by these automatic charges, judging by the dozen people that have expressed similar issues with Ghost since I published my post. So much for being a non-profit.<p>2. Something I forgot to add to the story - the main reason I went over the 2 staff users I was permitted to have on my account was because I had invited Ghost support in as a staff user to help with migration. This made me really annoyed as I had some friends on to help with setting up the website and I had to kick them to avoid being charged triple - for bringing Ghost in to help with some stuff.<p>3. The CEO going from cussing on twitter to deleting my website (all within 15mins, as I was working on it) is unacceptable, again, from any POV. The people here talking about this being an acceptable practice to deal with &quot;toxic customers&quot; have clearly never actually been in a customer-facing role. You wouldn&#x27;t last in such a position if you dealt with every disgruntled customer in such a manner. Stop LARPing.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my side.

We make choices based on whether it has social impact and whether our day to day work solves problems that we personally care about and for other privacy minded people like us. For example, we did not pursue outside investment (despite offers) and decided to retain 100% ownership of the company. We felt taking funding will make us focus on large enterprises and the product will take a different direction (k8s anyone?), quite far from any social impact. Investors, who we met, seemed to care more about 100x growth than our cause and some even laughed at the idea - &quot;who wants to selfhost email?&quot;.<p>Same for salaries, we took a heavy pay cut for the initial 2-3 years just to to get product going along (and so many pivots).

Classes rarely had more than 5 fields or 5 methods. Data was aggressively transformed and narrowed so that, within any given function, you had in your hands a bunch of objects that contained only the things you needed.<p>The experience was me slowly going insane from the sheer amount of jumping around files and the need to keep in my head 30 different strongly-typed aliases to std::string.<p>I find myself leaning towards a belief that there is such thing as excessive subdivision, excessive separation.

Perhaps in a perfect world I shouldn&#x27;t care, but most of the time I really do.

This ensures security - the characteristic where the grid is resilient to any single failure. Because load is not normally controlled (i.e. people can turn loads on and off without permission from the system operator), the system needs to be able to respond to that as well as contingencies like a line or generator trip.<p>Imagine, for instance, that you&#x27;re fully maxed out on generation with no reserve, and one generator trips offline. You will now need to trigger emergency load shedding very, very rapidly (within seconds) to arrest frequency decline and a cascading, wide-area outage.<p>So you carry a margin of operating or spinning reserve, essentially generation that is available to very quickly ramp its output up or down in response to system conditions. When that margin starts to get eaten away by lack of capacity, you can do controlled load shedding, where you remove loads that have been already marked as low-priority to get some of your margin back. By doing this, you can avoid uncontrolled load shedding, which would have worse consequences.<p>Official notice from CAISO:<p>----------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTICE: 202002424 POSTED: 2020-08-14 18:38:00\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCAISO Grid STAGE 3 System Emergency Notice [202002424]<p>The California ISO hereby issues a CAISO Grid Stage 3 System Emergency Notice\neffective 08&#x2F;14&#x2F;2020 at 18:36 through 08&#x2F;14&#x2F;2020 at 23:59.<p>Reason:\nCalifornia ISO is Reserve Deficient.<p>Refer to the ISO System Emergency Fact Sheet (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caiso.com&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;SystemAlertsWarningsandEmergenciesFactSheet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caiso.com&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;SystemAlertsWarningsandEmerge...<\/a>)\nfor additional detail.<p>The ISO requires load curtailments, use of Interruptible Loads* and\nrequests Out-of-Market (OOM) and Emergency Energy from all available sources.\nMaximum conservation efforts are requested.<p>Spinning Reserves have depleted or are forecast to deplete to levels below\nminimum requirements.

In the 2003 blackout in the northeast US &amp; Canada, load wasn&#x27;t dropped fast enough and the protection equipment at generating plants tripped them off before damage could occur. For base generation like nuclear plants, you generally need to wait up to 72 hours to restart the plant [1]. One key reason for that long time period is the need to wait for Xenon 135 levels to stabilize. [2]<p>The paper actually considers these systems, but dismisses them because &quot;Third, we disregard the possibility that power utilities react to the sudden increase in the demand either by increasing the available generation or through load shedding. As for the former reaction, it  would be ineffective since the primary cause of the blackout in our simulation is the violation of the line capacity limits rather than a generation deficit. The latter reaction may also be ineffective in protecting the residential loads considered in our study since power utilities typically prioritize commercial, industrial and critical loads during such contingencies.&quot;<p>So in other words, end consumers would lose power, but the grid would continue to function as designed for critical loads.
