I don&#x27;t know the actual number of people effected. I don&#x27;t know what is the ratio of contractors to employees.<p>What I have experienced, first hand, is working as a contractor for large corporations.<p>I think some people are having a hard time seeing any downside to this arrangement.<p>One distinction in contracting is if you receive a 1099 or W-2 at the end of the year. For the employer, the 1099-contractor is an attractive position. You don&#x27;t have to pay payroll taxes. They&#x27;re (sometimes) not included in your workmans comp and (in some circumstances) liability insurance. They&#x27;re not eligible for unemployment, and therefore your UI rate is lower.<p>Why would you hire someone as a 1099 contractor? Maybe your department has a new project and need someone who is an expert in, IDK, &#x27;spaghetti code&#x27;. No one knows it, so the contractor works self-directed, from home, on their own machine. I knew a guy who was a contractor for banks and setup ATMs--very specialized knowledge.<p>Here&#x27;s the first problem.\n&quot;Looks like a duck. Walks like a duck. It&#x27;s a duck.&quot; What happens when that contractor sits in your office right next to you. Does the same work. Is managed by the same manager. Working indefinitely. But, they&#x27;re paid by a third-party. They don&#x27;t get benefits. They&#x27;re guaranteed to be the first people to be laid-off.<p>Compare this person to any-other worker in the market, there may be very few differences. They&#x27;re still &#x27;hired&#x27; by the third-party (and get a W-2), so they&#x27;re eligible for unemployment. But compare them to the &#x27;employees&#x27; they work with, and there may be a lot differences--such as this $1k free money at Facebook.<p>When the market is saturated with these sub-contracting jobs, it&#x27;s a fraught choice. Work at &#x27;Facebook&#x27; as a contractor, and start earning money, versus, what? keep looking? take a job at an unknown corporation? If you&#x27;re young and inexperienced, and all of the points above sound new and unknown, you could ask yourself what&#x27;s the difference?<p>The difference is qualitative one for the employee (No $1k bonus, and you&#x27;re laid off), but a lot of small and marginal quantitative benefits for the employer.<p>There are a lot of other issues here. The rise of contracting and sub-contracting was a major change in the employment landscape when it started appearing 30 yrs ago.

The hardware _is_ there. I love using the original reMarkable tablet _when it works_. But damn there are some stupid software decisions, alongside some absolutely genius ones. (Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve had the original reMarkable tablet for 3 months now) Here&#x27;s a summary of my experience with it:<p>- It&#x27;s sometimes unstable, and crashes while I draw. Not super often but maybe 4 or 5 times a week. I don&#x27;t lose any data other than the last ~5-10 strokes.<p>- There is a notebook called Quick Sheets that is permanently there, even if I try to remove it&#x27;s metadata over SSH. It gets generated on boot. No idea why this is here.<p>- You can SSH in, and there&#x27;s a good hacker community around the tablet. A lot of cool open source software is written for it.<p>- Putting a file on the device for the first time, after doing the same on a kindle for years, is an adventure to say the least. There is no calibre plugin for it that I&#x27;ve found.<p>- I have never been able to use EPUBs properly on this tablet, a lot of my books just crash it. I have to convert them to PDF first on calibre. So highlighting is just markup on the PDF and not really selecting any text, but you can write directly on the book with notes.<p>- The first time I opened an EPUB, it took a while (10s) to load. When I tried to change the font of the EPUB on the reMarkable, it just stayed on the loading icon for hours, and I gave up on EPUBs then, and resorted to PDFs.<p>- There is no dictionary on the EPUB reader. I miss this feature a lot. And even if there were, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it because I have to convert my EPUBs to PDF.<p>- Metadata for EPUBs or PDFs isn&#x27;t visible, only the raw filenames. So no sorting by author, genre, etc.<p>- drawing and marking up is phenomenal, as is reading on such a huge screen. I absolutely love reading and journaling on this tablet.<p>- I have never succeeded in exporting my notebooks or marked up PDFs using the built in software after marking up or writing in 100+ pages, I have to use some community written software instead.<p>- It&#x27;s $500 total after pen and cover.<p>- There is no backlight.<p>- OCR is done in the cloud, and not on the device.<p>- The iOS companion app is goofy, a lot of the navigation within the app seems to be done in a hacky way, instead of using the usual iOS SDK components. (They segment screen portions for scrolling on pages and for navigating the app, and it leads to just the most bizarre behavior).<p>I want to love this tablet. And all we need is a software update. The hardware was almost perfect, and now with USB-C, a magnet on the pen, and an eraser, the hardware is even closer to being perfect (I think the only thing left is a backlight)."],"time":["2020-03-17 17:06:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tesseract2"],"id":[22608279],"kids":[22623866],"parent":[22604597],"text":["While at that price point, many other, more feature complete devices become available, the ePaper devices do have their own niche.<p>I tried to use iPad Pro as a full-time note-taking device and found that after writing on it for up 3-4 hours during the day, my eyes get very tired by the evening. I tried various things to mitigate it, such as using dark background, changing brightness etc, and nothing seems to help enough to make iPad a notebook replacement.<p>I absolutely love the functionality offered by iPad-like device such as reading Kindle, browse web, notes taking, PDF annotation, scanner apps etc. I absolutely want to be able to use it as single device to hold all my hand-notes and downloaded or scanned documents. But can&#x27;t avoid the eye strain.<p>Devices like reMarkable etc can be used at length if your ask is just to carry around all your notes. I have misplaced all my notes from grad school days. I would love an easy way to be able to write and archive for posterity all my notes.<p>I personally settled for Onyx Boox Max 3. It is at way higher price point, but is more functional - has Kindle, OReilly apps etc and quite functional note taking app.<p>I tried the earlier version of reMarkable ran into a limitation that limited its usability for me. It did not allow copying a section of text and pasting it into a new document. I might be mis-remembering, but I think it did not even allow pasting a copied section of a note into a new page in the same notebook. All this severely limited what I could use it for. It was just a paper replacement, and not much more.<p>Boox Max 3 did not have these limitations. Whats great about iPad-like devices is that you don&#x27;t even expect that you will run into these corner cases.<p>I hope this update to reMarkable add such small features that increase the usability. I absolutely hope that these kind of devices succeed.
