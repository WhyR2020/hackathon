So as an attacker, I can craft any request I want and just tell the server &quot;I&#x27;m not including any headers in the signature&quot;.<p>Similarly: you can include the date header in the signature to help prevent replay attacks, but nowhere does it say that you probably want to check that the date on the request is actually within some threshold of the current time.<p>And again: you can include the message digest in the signature, but nowhere does it say that you should actually verify that digest against the body. Worse, message digests are an entirely separate spec and no constraints are given about what digest algorithms should be used (many of them are not designed to be cryptographically secure).

Back then the popular validation tool was JSLint whose motto is: <i>JSLint will hurt your feelings.<\/i>  The idea is that under the sloppiness of the language there was a polished gem of rapid expression.  I didn&#x27;t really figure out the language, though, until I started writing personal tools during my second military deployment in 2009.<p>My recommendation for learning this language is to forget all the books and helpful guides.  Just build something.  Here is a good reference of the standard methods: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Global_Objects\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Refe...<\/a><p>Of that reference list the most immediately important areas are: Array and String.<p>My personal recommendation for really embracing this language are to learn and master scope in the language.  Don&#x27;t mess around with class, prototypes, inheritance, <i>new<\/i>, or <i>this<\/i> until after you have built at least one tool in the language.  Most people coming into this language jump in expecting to program in the style of some former language only to be disappointed that JavaScript is not in fact their former language.<p>My second personal recommendation is to gain confidence around the expressiveness of functions in this language.  Functions are first-class objects, which means they can be used anywhere a primitive type can be used. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Glossary&#x2F;First-class_Function\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Glossary&#x2F;First-clas...<\/a><p>Perhaps the most important thing to learn for any language is data structures.  If you have a solid understanding of data structures you can bend any algorithm to your will.<p>You mention not learning any APIs, but there are two exceptions you should make in order to better understand the language.<p>* DOM - If you are learning JavaScript in the browser I recommend learning the DOM.  I mean the standard imperative DOM methods from the DOM specification.  The DOM is a tree model of nodes where each node knows its place in the tree relative to its peers.  By appreciating the nature of those fluid relationships you can do incredible things with little effort that execute incredibly fast.  I built a complete GUI in the browser in just over 2 weeks that executes as fast as the OS&#x27;s GUI because I had an understanding of the DOM.  Here is the video demo: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailmarkup.org&#x2F;sharefile&#x2F;demo1.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailmarkup.org&#x2F;sharefile&#x2F;demo1.mp4<\/a> and code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems<\/a><p>* Nodes fs library - If you are learning JavaScript on the terminal with Node.js I recommend learning Node&#x27;s fs library methods.  The file system is also a tree model comprised of nodes that can be walked very quickly.<p>After you have built one or more tools in this language you will independently learn to appreciate the conventions in this language that best suit your personal programming styles."],"time":["2020-02-19 14:54:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["british_india"],"id":[22364736],"kids":{},"parent":[22364212],"text":["Read: &quot;JavaScript: the good parts&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-19 12:43:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["paranoidrobot"],"id":[22371505],"kids":{},"parent":[22370794],"text":["The German Public Broadcaster DW has a short video[1] covering this, including some of Kentaro Iwata&#x27;s video statement.<p>The mention that the Japanese government is allowing it&#x27;s citizens to leave and use public transit seems like a very risky and foolhardy move.<p>While I&#x27;m certainly no expert, and I&#x27;d definitely hate to be stuck on that ship - I think Japan could surely have set up some kind of field isolation area in the last few weeks and get passengers off and isolated using proper quarantine protocols. \nThe statement by Kentaro Iwata makes it clear that nobody with a background in infectious diseases was involved in setting up proper quarantine procedures onboard the ship.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iPpAsRJJ14E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iPpAsRJJ14E<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-20 01:01:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bencollier49"],"id":[22371216],"kids":{},"parent":[22370794],"text":["If the tests are as unreliable as has been reported (and a lot of rubbish gets reported) then those released passengers travelling around Japan seem like a bit of a risk."],"time":["2020-02-20 00:20:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["galacticaactual"],"id":[22371266],"kids":[22371279,22371417,22372747],"parent":[22370794],"text":["Effective crisis management of this nature requires rehearsal and drilling, even if just an administrative &#x2F; tabletop exercise.

If you don&#x27;t need it, you pass null, which is pretty much every case. Need to return a value? Call EndInvoke with the IAsyncResult object you received in the callback. But wait, where&#x27;s my delegate instance on which I need to call EndInvoke? Guess I need to hoist it to be a field in my class now. I suppose you could pass it as that AsyncState parameter, but now you&#x27;re having to do in your head the type-checking job that the compiler should be doing for you.<p>None of this is guessable from just reading the code. You have to read the documentation in multiple places to figure out what is going on. For added fun, now try composing multiple async operations in sequence.<p>Contrast to today, we do &quot;Task.Run(&lt;some lambda expression&gt;)&quot;. You tell me what is easier to learn?<p>You see &quot;fewer keywords, fewer features&quot; and see &quot;simplicity&quot;.

As it stands, DNS over UDP almost always gets some free privacy by mixing all devices on a network together – an outside snooper sees a stream of queries coming from a household, a coffeeshop or even an entire office building, with no way to tie a query to any specific device or user. Such mixing of queries provides an imperfect but useful modicum of privacy.<p>&gt; DNS over HTTPS however neatly separates out each device (and even each individual application on that device) to a separate query stream. This alone is worrying, as we now have individual users’ queries, but the TLS that underlies HTTPS also typically uses TLS Resumption which offers even further tracking capabilities.<p>&gt; In short, setting up an encrypted connection eats up precious CPU cycles both on client and server. It is therefore possible to reuse a previously established encrypted state for subsequent connections, which saves a lot of time and processor energy.<p>&gt; It does however make it possible to track an application from IP address to IP address because this TLS Resumption session ID is effectively a cookie that uniquely tracks users across network and IP address changes."],"time":["2020-02-19 05:53:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Santosh83"],"id":[22363239],"kids":{},"parent":[22362864],"text":["Technological solutions only lead to centralisation of snooping.

We have a small task with two levels, one to complete quite fast and the second level is if you really want to show off and spend more time on it. We use it as the main technical skills evaluation for the in person interview, because it opens up an actual discussion and we can talk about reasoning, see how candidates take feedback and how they can explain what they did. In the same time, there is another department with us that has a take at home task that I wanted just for laughter to try, it took me a whole weekend and it was insane. So I can see where some people are coming from. In the same time, we also had some cases where we paid the people (who requested it) for the time spent on the task, and we hired one, which was one of the most worst decisions that we made, because he turned out to be one of the most selfish and self absorbed people we hired.<p>In the same time I&#x27;ve been through some ridiculous situations where I was left alone in a room with no phone allowed, no pc, just write on a paper some SQL queries based on some printed tables from a spreadsheet, or, in another case to write on a flip-chart some code to print the first X prime numbers in front of 3 people.

Could theoretically be done via shell script; my submission was ~100 lines of python.<p>Second, submissions were graded mostly for correctness. Style&#x2F;structure and all the other stuff were nice but <i>usually<\/i> weren&#x27;t deal breakers, iirc.<p>Third, the on-site included a session where we reviewed the submission with the candidate, asked questions, etc... This was pretty instructive, because we could point out a missed edge case or whatnot and see how they&#x27;d modify the code to handle it.<p>Fourth, names &amp; personal identifiers were scrubbed from submissions, to avoid potential bias.<p>So, it was a better than average process, IMHO. That said, after reviewing a fair number of coding tests myself, I&#x27;d note that there are still a number of downsides to take home tests:<p>a) even if the instructions specify that one should take less than N hours, it&#x27;s obvious that some applicants spend considerable time on them. So we&#x27;d see solutions of wildly differing quality; some with detailed unit tests, documentation, Dockerfiles, vagrant files (!), build scripts, etc... etc... some with just a single file.<p>b) Even though the primary criteria was correctness, there was some room for assessment of code quality, and subjective bias of the reviewer was undoubtedly a factor. A solution that missed an edge case but which was well structured would generally be fine, but &quot;well structured&quot; is obviously subjective. Or, although applicants could use &quot;the language of their choice,&quot; those selecting, say, Java, were at a disadvantage. Most of us were Python&#x2F;PHP&#x2F;Ruby folks and the Java submissions looked generally bloated in comparison, and seemed to be graded more harshly.<p>Not sure what a perfect solution would look like.

I was curious about the game mentioned towards the bottom:<p>&gt; At M.I.T. next door to Draper, some of the undergraduates play a game called “Space War.” To play “Space War,” you need a television screen, a computer, and a working knowledge of Newtonian physics. The TV screen shows a planet surrounded by spaceships. Each player fires torpedos from his spaceship, aiming them according to the laws of orbital dynamics. The torpedos must destroy either another spaceship or the planet. The game is enhanced by programming the computer to include such factors as time warps, so that a spaceship can disappear “for years.”<p>Thanks to the magic of the internet, I found a few versions of the game (actually called &quot;Spacewar!&quot;[0]), both the original[1] without time-warp and the more advanced version described in the article which includes it[2]. However contrary to the article&#x27;s description it seems only the ships follow Newtonian physics, the projectiles always travel in a straight line, and I wasn&#x27;t able to blow up the star or planet you&#x27;re orbiting, though perhaps a version with these features exists and I simply wasn&#x27;t able to find it.

Somewhat obviously, I’ve seen some be successful with unions and others be successful without, which makes sense, as unions are neither inherently good nor bad.

When there is a sense of trust between employer and employee, communication flows between employees and managers, employee working conditions are safe and healthy, and compensation is reasonably fair. For companies that are shady and treat employees poorly, unions help enforce structured communication and transparency between managers and employees.<p>Usually I look for symptoms of bad management when hearing about employees who want to unionize. In tech, we can generally assume reasonable working conditions and pay, so Kickstarter unionizing screams “toxic management” for me, personally.

One of the great things about Google Cloud was that it was very easy to order.  None of this &quot;t2.large&quot; where you&#x27;d have to look up how much memory and CPU that it has and potentially how many credits you&#x27;re going to get per hour and such.  I think Google Cloud is still easier, but it&#x27;s getting harder to know what is the right direction.<p>For example, the N2D instances are basically the price of the N1 instances or even cheaper with committed-use discounts.  Given that they provide 39% more performance, should the N1 instances be considered obsolete once the N2D exits beta?  I know that there could be workloads that would be better on Intel than AMD, but it seems like there would be little reason to get an N1 instance once the N2D exits beta.<p>Likewise, the N2D has the basically same sustained-use price as the E2 instances (which only have the performance of N1 instances).  What&#x27;s the point of E2 instances if they&#x27;re the same price?  Shouldn&#x27;t I be getting a discount given that Google can more efficiently use the resources?<p>It&#x27;s great to see the improvements at Google Cloud.  I&#x27;m glad to see lower-cost, high-performance options available.  However, I guess I&#x27;m left wondering who is choosing what.  I look at the pricing and think, &quot;who would choose an N1 or N2 given the N2D?&quot;  Sure, there are people with specific requirements, but it seems like the N2D should be the default in my mind.<p>This might sound a bit like complaining, but I do love how I can just lookup memory and CPU pricing easily.  Rather than having to remember name-mappings, I just choose from one of the families (N1, N2, E2, N2D) and can look at the memory and CPU pricing.  It makes it really simple to understand what you&#x27;re paying.  It&#x27;s just that as more families get added and Google varies how it applies sustained-use and committed-use discounts between the families, it becomes more difficult to choose between them.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m going for a 1-year commitment, should I go with an E2 at $10.03&#x2F;vCPU or an N2D at $12.65&#x2F;vCPU.  The N2D should provide more performance than the 26% price increase, yes?  Why can&#x27;t I get an EPYC based E-series to really drive down costs?<p>Again, I want to reiterate that Google Cloud&#x27;s simpler pricing is great, but complications have crept in.  E2 machines don&#x27;t get sustained-use discounts which means they&#x27;re really only valuable if you&#x27;re doing a yearly commitment or non-sustained-use.  The only time N1 machines are cheaper is in sustained-use - they&#x27;re the same price as Intel N2 machines if you&#x27;re doing a yearly commitment or non-sustained-use.  Without more guidance on performance differences between the N2D and N2, why should I ever use N2?  I guess this is a bit of rambling to say, &quot;keep an eye on pricing complexity - I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time thinking about optimizing costs&quot;."],"time":["2020-02-18 19:02:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tpetry"],"id":[22357449],"kids":[22358902,22357832,22357500,22358054],"parent":[22357194],"text":["Now its getting really interesting: In the end you have to compare pricing for a vCore (which is a thread on a cpu) with per-thread performance on AMD vs. Intel.

A good way to fix is use a D3D11_QUERY_EVENT query to wait for completion of rendering.<p>If all GPU access happens through D3D11 this shouldn’t happen i.e. the API guarantees to wait for the completion of previously submitted draw calls. It may happen in practice when mixing multiple GPU APIs, e.g. when using DXGI surface sharing to pass textures between D3D11 and DX9. Also, it may happen when using D3D from multiple threads. Easy way to detect the latter, set D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_DEBUG flag when creating the device, and read warnings in debug output of the process.<p>Another possibility is just bugs in rendering code.

The biggest reason being that it&#x27;s not a &quot;fail safe&quot; way to plan a project. In this particular case, a full replacement was probably a 12 month affair, but due to poor execution and business needs, priorities shifted 6 months in. It was full of compromises. In some places, instead replacing an API completely, it would call into the old system, and the decorate the response with some extra info. Auth had to be duplicated in both layers. Debugging was awful.<p>While some of the issues could be chalked up to &quot;not doing it right,&quot; at the core of it, the process of strangulation described in the article leaves the overall architecture in a much more confusing state for the lifetime of the project, and if you have to shift, you&#x27;ve created vastly more tech debt then you had with the original service, as you now have a distributed systems problem. Unless you can execute on it quickly, I think it&#x27;s a very dangerous way to fix tech debt, avoiding fixing the core issues, and instead planning for a happy path where you can just replace everything.<p>If you absolutely think you need to quarantine the existing code, I&#x27;d recommend putting a dedicated proxy in place that routes either to the old service or the new service, and not mixing the proxy and the new code.

It has been modded down, and fairly so, as this comment is not helpful in its current form. Nevertheless I feel it has an important point, so allow me to talk about the Home Office, which, after all, is the reason this 101-year-old was filing paperwork to begin with.<p>The Home Office presently maintains a &quot;hostile environment&quot; policy. Wikipedia summarizes its goal: &quot;to make staying in the United Kingdom as difficult as possible for people without leave to remain&quot;. Here are some examples of how this works in practice.<p>Once upon a time the BBC did a little investigative journalism and discovered that some international students were faking their English proficiency exams (the TOEIC). The Home Office, quite reasonably, said that they&#x27;d do something about it. What they ended up doing specifically was make the environment as hostile as possible; they:<p>- looked at 58,458 test results<p>- declared that 34,000 of them were obviously definitely cheaters<p>- declared that 22,600 of them were probably cheaters<p>- declared only about 2000 as probably legit<p>- sent letters to the 34,000 students denouncing them as frauds and demanding they leave the country<p>Needless to say these numbers are completely bunk. Nevertheless thousands of the students were scared away, or detained, or deported.<p>Here is some coverage of the Toeic scandal: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;apr&#x2F;27&#x2F;home-office-investigated-over-english-test-cheating-claims\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;apr&#x2F;27&#x2F;home-office-...<\/a><p>An astute reader will note that the coverage I have specifically linked describes this as potentially &quot;bigger than Windrush&quot;, a separate scandal in which refugees were admitted to the UK, decades later various records of their admission destroyed, and then the government demanded they demonstrate evidence they were allowed to be present in the country.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Windrush_scandal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Windrush_scandal<\/a><p>Now, personal anecdote time: I got a job in London the same day they voted for Brexit. I later found out that as family of a European citizen, the form to get a proper residence card was 97+ pages. This is basically as a way to make the environment more hostile. (Rather than deal with that and the economic uncertainties of Brexit, including its impact on the tech sector and general political uncertainty from subsequent governments, I instead moved to New York and literally doubled my salary, thanks in no small part to the low pound).<p>In summary: This particular story is just the latest insult in a parade of injuries. Fear not, though! The behavior of the Home Office has not gone unnoticed.

So this article is kind of reassuring to me.<p>A few more comments:<p>Cloud infra\nFor a traditional web app you can quickly deploy it on a cheap AWS on Heroku VM for a few dollars&#x2F;mo and later scale as you get more traffic. With AI you now need expensive training VMs. There are free options such as Google Collab but it doesn&#x27;t scale for anything else than toy projects or prototyping. AWS entry point GPU instance (p2.xlarge) is at $0.900&#x2F;hour i.e. $648&#x2F;mo, and a more performant one (p3.2xlarge) at $2160&#x2F;mo. Yes, you should shut them down when you are done with training but still. You can also use spot instances to reduce cost but it&#x27;s not straightforward to set up.<p>For inference, you also need a VM with enough memory for your model to fit in, so again an expensive VM from day one.<p>Datasets\nif you rely on a publicly available dataset, chances are there are already 10 startups doing the same product. In order to have a somewhat unique and differentiated product, you need a way to acquire and label a private dataset.<p>Humans in the loop\nThe labeling part is very tedious and costly both in terms of time and money.

In that context, your accuracy for this kind of customer might actually be much worse. So again you need significant human resources to control inferences in production.

They use ChibiOS as an RTOS to basically schedule USB code alongside QMK, and then they get ChibiOS&#x27;s USB support for free.  (Note that on many of these ARM chips, the USB is actually handled in hardware; you just need to get the right bytes into the right memory addresses at the right time.  You don&#x27;t have to be awake at the exact instant to toggle a USB pin at exactly the instant the protocol demands.  So it works quite well; ChibiOS is not preempting your matrix scan at random times or anything.)<p>Having said that, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to write your own firmware.  QMK feels very very legacy right now.  It is hard to use modern dev tools to work on the code (like clangd), and the newer chips are supported in a very janky manner because of assumptions made for the original AVRs that it ran on.  I always thought it was weird that the boards that OLKB use are among the most jankily-supported, even though they fund the development of QMK.  They also don&#x27;t really maintain all of the in-tree examples, so you&#x27;ll copy someone else&#x27;s outdated keyboard code and be starting with code that barely works.

So you get latency by default, although it hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all so I haven&#x27;t fixed it.)<p>The model of flashing firmware to change the key layout also seems crazy to me, in an era where you can easily enumerate as a flash drive and just drag a JSON-encoded keymap onto it to adjust the layout.
