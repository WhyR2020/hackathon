Kong is a physical cryptocurrency that looks, feels and works like traditional cash. You can think of it as an ultra-secure, time locked cryptocurrency wallet with a fixed face value — no one can access the token except for the holder of the note after a period of several years. It consists of a secure element and NFC chips mounted on a flexible PCB with a full color print. There are several gold elements that also serve as direct i2c interfaces to challenge the secure element’s authenticity by signing information with its private key.<p>Kong is based on two primary observations; (1) it’s really difficult to use and secure cryptocurrency for most people and (2) cryptocurrency has been useful as a means of speculation, but poor for actually buying goods and services. It’s our hypothesis that by making cryptocurrency more like cash it may be possible that people ultimately use it as a means of exchange.<p>Our background is in secure embedded hardware (Lockitron, YC S09); over the past year we did a deep dive to really consider how cryptocurrency key material is handled today. We found that cryptocurrency has a unique challenge and corresponding opportunity; unlike IoT products where the cost of a breach might be difficult to quantify, breaking a hardware wallet can yield clear rewards to the hacker.<p>We developed Kong around the notion that security should be isolated to the smallest possible footprint — in the case of Kong, to an individual single purpose secure element chip. Doing so removes additional layers of firmware and software in order to limit the attack surface (it also broadly questions how good are our existing secure chips today).<p>To date we’ve handed out close to 2,500 Kong notes; we’re now exploring more ways to distribute physical crypto.

The diner takes the dollar because they can use it to pay their staff and buy more supplies. The supplier takes the dollar because they can pay their staff and and buy raw materials. And in between every layer, the banks store the excess operating capital and profits.<p>Decentralized currency can only work if it can occupy every layer at once, across the world. Anything less is just straight out worse than regular money from a usability standpoint, and that&#x27;s before you mention that now we&#x27;re all responsible for our own money security.<p>Yes, people out there have been wronged by the current system, but the average modern human&#x27;s relationship with money can be essentially summed up as follows:<p>1. Perform labor<p>2. Receive paycheck<p>3. Deposit in bank<p>4. Purchase food, shelter, and netflix<p>So what is this kind of pseudo-money-computer-chip-paper for? No matter the fancy technology thats woven into its fibers, if I pay the Kong people for 10 Kongs, how do I, Joe Schmoe, turn 10 Kongs into a pizza? How do I, Jane Pizza-Maker, find a supplier that will sell me tomatoes and flour for 10 Kongs? How do I, Rachel Dough-Maker, find a wheat farm that will accept Kongs?<p>All of this has to happen simultaneously, because business owners are busy and don&#x27;t have the time or the energy to incrementally work space money into their cash flow.<p>Yeah sure, centralized banking has issues. But a bottom-up approach is doomed to failure because we don&#x27;t live in barter-based villages anymore.

I was aware of formal grammars and was toying with using stochastic parametric grammars to make generative programs, unknowingly a form of L-system.<p>I did one thing that goes beyond the grammars mentioned in the article and in wikipedia. You can assign an address to each leaf symbols. If you have binary rules of the form Ax-&gt;AxAx, this is easy as you are generating a binary tree and a path to that tree is just a binary number. If you are generating a programming language and each leaf node is a program statement, the return value of that statement can be assigned to that address. Then it is not difficult for each parameters in a parametric grammar to have a reference or reference offset back to these address. These address offsets can be stocastic parameters in the grammar.<p>To me it&#x27;s more like generating a full programming language since each statement has a return value and later statements can reference these value by address, a bit like putting the value in a variable and accessing it later.<p>I then have a scheme to try to learn the stochastic parameters from output examples to try to produce programs that learn to generate specific output (I have had very limited success).

So hopefully you&#x27;ll find my feedback useful...<p>On the tab interface: \n- Seeing a blob of 6 numbers come isn&#x27;t intuitive enough.  The strings REALLY need to be colored.  You should be able to get away with using the same colors as Rocksmith, as there&#x27;s generic sets of strings using those (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guitarcenter.com&#x2F;DR-Strings&#x2F;Hi-Def-NEON-Multi-Color-Coated-Medium-Electric-Guitar-Strings.gc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guitarcenter.com&#x2F;DR-Strings&#x2F;Hi-Def-NEON-Multi-Co...<\/a>) - or at least make them configurable.   It&#x27;s hard for me to tell which string is which in fatpick.<p>- Bar lines for the beat&#x2F;measure changes would be helpful.<p>- Chords saying their name above them would be a huge help - &quot;G&quot; is much easier to parse quickly than &quot;355433&quot;!<p>Practice mode: \n- Just adjusting playback speed isn&#x27;t enough.  To be actually useful, fatpick needs something like Rocksmith&#x27;s Riff Repeater, where you can select a section, loop it at a selected speed, and have it increase 1% each time you get the notes right.  In fact, here&#x27;s where you can outshine Rocksmith, since Rocksmith only lets you select entire sections, whereas you could make it so you could really drill in on notes<p>Audio:\n- Being able to play the audio file instead of just guitar pro-style midi would be a huge bonus.  Don&#x27;t make it required, so you can still just import a quick GP file to play, but for curated tracks or imported Rocksmith psarcs (see my comment elsewhere about psarcjs), the real audio would be great.  \n  - Even better... multitrack audio! Just play the song .mp3 if that&#x27;s all there is, but there&#x27;s plenty of multitrack ogg&#x27;s sourced from rock band &#x2F; guitar hero floating out there.  For these songs you could play with your chosen instrument removed - IE, pick a song with a multitrack ogg, pick the bass part, the audio engine wouldn&#x27;t play the bass part but would play the rest.<p>- Some kind of effects on the guitar would be nice.  Using an AxefxIII and Loopback I can mix in real guitar sounds with the game, but most of your demographic won&#x27;t have that ability, so being able to pick an AC&#x2F;DC song and have basic distortion effects will be a must.<p>Anyways, after playing with fatpick for 20 minutes I&#x27;m going to go back to Rocksmith.

The need for a new modern and more liberally licensed cross-platform UI lib is bigger than ever.<p>Also, many devs are even switching out of Qt-based cross-platform development and back to separate codebases for OS-dependent native UI toolkits… which is kinda sad, though partly alleviated by some other factors (such as the similarities between Swift and Kotlin)"],"time":["2019-12-11 08:30:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toyg"],"id":[21757095],"kids":[21757919,21760119],"parent":[21755337],"text":["Trolltech were pretty awesome, in their days.

You would call your contact then around 4 or 5 rings will give you plenty of time to close the call, and after that a voice mail message would inform you the contact was not answering and inviting you to leave a message. Problem was that if you went that far, then you&#x27;d pay for those seconds when the automated voice mail be initiated just like if your contact would&#x27;ve answered. So far so good. But one CEO of a cell company decided he wanted money. So randomly, he would enable the automated voice mail message to enter just after one ring.

Apple’s breach of contract claim is based on Williams’ alleged creation of a competing business in violation of his Intellectual Property Agreement with Apple. Apple appears to concede that Nuvia is targeted to servers and Apple doesn’t make servers. So they have a hook in there that they’ve considered developing or customizing servers. (As a factual matter, I’m not sure anybody would consider customizing servers for internal use to be in competition with selling chips for commercial servers, but that seems to be Apple’s story.)<p>It’s not clear what Apple’s beef is. Nuvia’s founder clearly did some organizational work while he was at Apple. Maybe that’s enough to technically breach the agreement. (Or maybe not. Without purporting to know anything about California employment law,[1] Nuvia’s motion to dismiss seems pretty robust in its reliance on California law and public policy against non-competes and restraints on employment, as well as preemption of the contract action by trade secrets law.) But what I’m curious about is what Apple thinks the damages are from Nuvia starting a business in a sector (servers) Apple hasn’t competed in for more than a decade?<p>It’s also curious Apple didn’t bring a trade secrets claim. The architecture of Cyclone, etc., is famously under wraps compared to AMD and Intel’s designs.

And then it follows that if I am willing to pay €2 for a coffee and another person is only willing to pay €1 for that same coffee, then I value the coffee twice as much as the other person.<p>But to me that doesn&#x27;t make much sense. What if I am a billionaire and the other person is very poor? It could very well be that the other person values the coffee a lot more than I do, but because I have so much more disposable income than they do I am willing to pay more for it. To me, the assumption should be something like the amount of money <i>as a percentage of my total wealth<\/i> that I&#x27;m willing to pay is equal to the utility of the good.<p>And because this assumption is so fundamental to economics, it determines the conclusions that the field reaches. For example, the definition of an &quot;efficient market&quot; or the optimal level of production of some good both embed this assumption that willingness to pay equals utility. And then one can imagine that policy decisions and such are influenced by this assumption. (And in fact the article itself mentions this problem: &quot;Another challenge is that quadratic payments, being a payment-based mechanism, continues to favor people with more money.&quot;).<p>So I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has looked into an alternative formulation of economics with a different fundamental assumption (perhaps something closer to the one I proposed above). If so, do certain things that are determined to be &quot;optimal&quot; in classical economics turn out not to be optimal in this alternative formulation (and vice-versa)?

I&#x27;ve had the benefit of only really utilizing them in strong-identity systems (games) but I&#x27;ve considered some of the drawbacks of using them in weak-identity systems and come to a few ideas:<p>1) A participation barrier can be used to prevent identities from participating until they&#x27;ve overcome something. A simple example would be an age barrier (identity must exist for some period of time before participating) which prevents spinning up multiple identities on-demand to try to increase voting power. Ideally, in practice there would be multiple barriers that would be naturally-occurring for a real participating identity but too expensive to create&#x2F;maintain several identities.<p>2) Similar to (1), have an ongoing cost to maintaining identities. Something such as a &quot;subscription fee&quot; may serve as a deterrent as the value of one identity needs to be weighed against the cost of maintaining it. This can be made additionally effective if the issue being voted on recurs every period rather than one-time (i.e. revisiting regulation votes every cycle instead of just voting once and having the regulation remain until stricken). For the normal participant, the value of this subscription could be offset by access to a non-scaling benefit - i.e. access to private content&#x2F;events.<p>3) While the article focuses on the economics in terms of dollars there&#x27;s the very real question of allowing votes to be purchased with other forms of currency that either complement or replace traditional currency. This is common in MMOs where you can have multiple characters (weak identities) each with their own in-game currency that can be acquired from in-game activities and may or may not be exchanged with real-world currency depending on the stance the owners of the game take.<p>Suffice it to say there aren&#x27;t really silver bullets to &quot;general purpose quadratic payments with weak identities&quot; but you could create some limited-purpose constraints that are particular to the problem&#x2F;community and make some strides from there."],"time":["2019-12-10 21:21:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["creeble"],"id":[21754011],"kids":[21755742],"parent":[21737237],"text":["It seems like solving the Sybil problem (a prerequisite to this scheme having any use whatsoever) might be something better on which to focus attention first, as it has other useful applications, even in one-person, one-vote democracies."],"time":["2019-12-10 17:37:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["say_it_as_it_is"],"id":[21756074],"kids":[21756545],"parent":[21737237],"text":["Really great to see Vitalik working with Glen Weyl&#x27;s ideas.

If you have to make a trade-off between &quot;maximal efficiency&quot; or &quot;can be read by the rest of the team&quot;, you choose readability, unless &quot;maximal efficiency&quot; is required to meet a customer deliverable (&quot;acceptance criteria&quot;).<p>Note the word &quot;required&quot;. As in, &quot;we have promised our customers to service requests in under 2ms, and these rather unreadable performance optimizations are the only way we can do this&quot;, not &quot;the lead programmer likes &#x27;efficient&#x27; code&quot;. That&#x27;s not to say you should be stupid about performance -- see (4), above -- but that your goal is to deliver value to the customer, not to build a technical monument to Donald Knuth.<p>That prompts the next thing we need to talk about: what do we even mean by &quot;high velocity&quot;?<p>Clearly it isn&#x27;t just writing a lot of code. Were that the case, we could measure productivity in LOC&#x2F;day. And it isn&#x27;t in always using the minimum amount of memory or smallest number of CPU cycles.<p>From a business perspective, &quot;high velocity&quot; means &quot;delivering working features to our customers as fast as possible... forever&quot;.<p>That last bit is important. You aren&#x27;t going to get one feature request, scratch that off in a frantic 48-hour marathon of caffeine and hackery, and then be done with the rest of your career.<p>New feature requests, changes to existing features, unexpected behavior that needs to be changed... these are life as a programmer. Smart programmers recognize this, and build their code to be easily changed.<p>Now, you can&#x27;t do this by trying to anticipate every future need.  Building code to support an uncertain future is where the vast majority of technical debt comes from, because 90% of the time, you&#x27;ll just be flat-out wrong, either grossly, or in sufficient detail as to render your attempt to defend against change moot.<p>Instead, you follow a set of coding practices that help you design systems and build code that can respond to future change, without having to know anything about what those future requirements might be.<p>To that end, I highly recommend Sandi Metz&#x27;s POODR[1] and 99 Bottles of OOP[2].<p>Yes, the title of the first book ends in &quot;Ruby&quot;.

Code that is fully-tested can be changed with a high degree of confidence that you haven&#x27;t broken something unintentionally, and writing tests first forces a lot of highly beneficial design choices.<p>GOOSGT[4] is a good place to get started with TDD.<p>Last but not least, recognize that all of the above are skills -- you will need to devote time, and a lot of repetition to learning them.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poodr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poodr.com<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandimetz.com&#x2F;99bottles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandimetz.com&#x2F;99bottles<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.growing-object-oriented-software.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.growing-object-oriented-software.com<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-10 08:12:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lolsal"],"id":[21754747],"kids":{},"parent":[21730125],"text":["An alternative perspective (not a solution!) from my experience:<p>I currently work at a place in the valley as a senior lead and it is _impossible_ for me to submit a PR without comments&#x2F;nitpicks requiring fixes. My colleagues seem to always want to change something for some reason, whether or not it is a necessary change. The feedback comes in from all skill levels. Honestly most of the time these changes can be (and should be, IMHO) ignored because of YAGNI and Not Invented Here. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I have re-designed and implemented something to be more generic&#x2F;abstract only to have that abstraction whither for _years_ without being used. Oh - and implementing our own wrappers for third party libraries? We do it all the time.<p>The challenge that I face is every time I get frustrated enough to push back and escalate, ultimately when discussing code reviews and velocity with managers, my colleagues drop the &quot;Q&quot; word and it&#x27;s an argument-ending trump card: quality. If anyone can argue that any trivial change increases the quality of the code base, or can argue that my PR lowers the repository code quality, the argument is over. Regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s objectively true, if it&#x27;s subjectively true the argument is over and ultimately any feedback has to be implemented. Management doesn&#x27;t budge on quality.<p>Ultimately though, end users and customers don&#x27;t care about code quality (but the do care about product quality, there is a difference).<p>I have worked at this company for 6+ years. The product is uninteresting to me, but the people are actually a really good fit for me. We otherwise work really well together when doing actual problem solving, requirements gathering, manager managing, customer support, etc. It&#x27;s frustrating to not be able to write code in one pass, but I&#x27;ve learned to &#x27;accept&#x27; it - it&#x27;s the nature of the beast. It&#x27;s definitely not like this everywhere; I&#x27;ve worked at places that were much better about code reviews and merging code. Code that takes a day to design and get requirements for and a day to code and test will usually take a full week to get merged (not uncommon for it to stretch to two weeks). If management is fine with our velocity, then I guess I ultimately don&#x27;t care.<p>Anyway, I recounted all of this for you to give you another data point and perspective. Some places thrive on this sort of torturous review process. I&#x27;ve learned to live with it. It&#x27;s entirely possible that there is no way for you to &#x27;improve&#x27; your way out of review hell. Instead of focusing on reading books and improving your design skills (which you should do anyway!) you might need to learn how to navigate the code review landscape at this new place, either by accepting it or playing the game.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to tell you to play the game except get more involved in the review process as early as possible. Figure out what is important to people. I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of &quot;pre-screening&quot; my reviews with one or two of the most problematic reviewers. I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I will commit a pass of pseudo-code and have them give me feedback.

Separate complexity from complications! Be thorough.<p>2. Know the team! Know what is valuable for the team! Understand how your code impacts your team&#x27;s velocity! Understand the mood of the team and use it! Contemplate how existing processes help or hinder the team! Consider suggesting to add or remove them if necessary! Make interfaces for others! Learn from the team! Cooperate with your team so that you guys can reach higher! Be critical to your team, conflicts can make you stronger! Be humble.<p>3. All that glitters is not gold. Some very popular libraries and tools that might not be as good as you think. Learn harder. Make something better if necessary. Think of both the big picture and the details at every step you make.

Now it&#x27;s up to you to use your tools and team to improve.<p>First of all, there is probably a style guide for your programming language at your company. Read it front to back. Your IDE may be configurable to automatically bring code up to these standards. &quot;Look and feel&quot; and using consistent language features are very important for others to be able to easily digest your code and be comfortable with it.<p>Second, there are likely resources for learning your common libraries (like your RPC and presentation libraries for example). Go through those thoroughly. Make sure you understand the common patterns and how they are used in the product you are working on. Apply this learning to your design before you start writing code.<p>Now that you have context, look at the specific feedback you&#x27;ve received and look for resources internally and externally for how to improve the issues that have been raised. Have you been misusing language features? Writing incorrect unit tests? Improperly using abstractions? Scoping functions incorrectly? Make sure that the feedback you&#x27;ve received follows the style guide and tool use cases. Come up with a plan to address the legitimate issues. As others have mentioned, writing a checklist of pre-review items and doing your own code review is indispensable, as well as learning how to make use of any integration testing environments and debuggers that you have access to.<p>Finally, ask your team leadership for help. Have a chat with your manager. Do this after you have done the research so you have some specific examples of mistakes you&#x27;ve made in the context of coding practices at your company and your plans to address them, including asking for specific mentorship prior to implementation, like design review. Why to ask for management&#x27;s help and not go to the devs directly? your performance is their job - where a senior dev may not realize it&#x27;s their job to mentor you until the manager asks them to. Letting your team leadership know that you are being proactive to address this issue will go a long way and unlock more resources that you need. Design review could be whiteboard sessions but I personally prefer design documents describing what the feature will do, why it is needed, how it will work, and what the implementation milestones are. You bring this to the session for editing&#x2F;feedback, don&#x27;t go empty-handed and expect to design stuff on the fly.<p>Regarding your velocity concerns, this will&#x2F;should come up during your conversations with your manager about your skill development. One good way to improve perceived velocity is to break down features into smaller milestones and complete those at a quicker cadence. Having a design document&#x2F;review will help do this.<p>Asking how to improve is the first step. Good luck!"],"time":["2019-12-10 16:10:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rbongers"],"id":[21754661],"kids":{},"parent":[21730125],"text":["There&#x27;s a lot of feedback already in this thread, but if you&#x27;re still reading, I wanted to share my process in case there&#x27;s anything that was missed. This will help you, hopefully, fully complete issues the first time. Don&#x27;t let any of these points block you, but you can generally go in this order.<p>1. Make sure you understand the requirements for the issue at hand.<p>Make sure you correctly understand all of the work an issue is supposed to encompass and no more. Use all available documentation, issue descriptions, designs, notes, and any other resources. As a last resort, as in the project is not well documented, start putting together questions to ask someone. Craft your questions in advance and ask them strategically and it will save you time. This is not all on you, better documentation, grooming, and other processes can help you work faster, and it might be something worth bringing up at a retrospective or using any other avenue you have for feedback after some research into what exactly is going wrong and what other people have done to solve it.<p>2. If you haven&#x27;t already, start looking into completing the issue from a technical standpoint.<p>No issue exists in a vacuum, and there is probably already existing technical architecture surrounding the issue, or something similar that is already being done. Good code conforms to the standards around it, and a good team codebase looks like it was written by one person. Not copying code, but using it as a general blueprint can help you get past code review by following unwritten established standards of the team. Of course, if there are written standards, check those too. Make sure you understand all of the technologies used by the code you&#x27;re following, it probably has documentation. Try to understand any technical decisions that don&#x27;t seem clear. Follow the guidelines in the previous point for asking questions if you need to. If any technical decisions need to be overturned, consider making refactoring part of the issue if at all practical (this is a whole other can of worms, so you&#x27;ll forgive me if I don&#x27;t get too deep into it).<p>Keep in mind that version control tools can help you understand why a decision was made, particularly if you learn to use tools like `git blame` and `git log` (assuming your team uses git), or even more powerful integrated tools like [vim-fugitive](<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimcasts.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;the-fugitive-series&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimcasts.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;the-fugitive-series&#x2F;<\/a>) or [magit](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magit.vc&#x2F;manual&#x2F;magit&#x2F;index.html#Top\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magit.vc&#x2F;manual&#x2F;magit&#x2F;index.html#Top<\/a>) if you use something like VIM or Emacs.<p>If there are any new technologies and technical decisions that are part of your issue, try to gain a rough idea of what your implementation will look like and try to learn as much about the technologies as possible. If you are not in a decision-making position, it is best to run your ideas past someone who does once they are concrete if you can. Of course, sometimes, it is easier to just start writing code. How low level or high level your planning is up to you, but it should probably depend on the complexity of the issue at hand. Don&#x27;t be afraid to take a couple passes at it, better now than later.<p>3. Start implementing.<p>When you are actually writing code, a good process makes all the difference. Some people use [TDD](<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agiledata.org&#x2F;essays&#x2F;tdd.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agiledata.org&#x2F;essays&#x2F;tdd.html<\/a>) or write all of their inline documentation ([example](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsdoc.app&#x2F;)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsdoc.app&#x2F;)<\/a>) beforehand, which can help you quickly refine and complete your implementation details without actually writing any code yet. This, again, helps you rework your ideas early on in the process. I use a mix of documentation, testing, and any [REPL](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93prin...<\/a>) that&#x27;s available to me to test out code beforehand depending on the issue, which is not the most straightforward method. Try TDD at least once and see what works for you.<p>A good dev system can help a lot. If you can get the code into a working state and compile it often to test it, do so. Any other dev tools for testing, documentation, linting, debugging, etc. for the project, learn them and use them.<p>Once you&#x27;re done making some changes, look over your code. Clean up anything you can, and don&#x27;t be afraid to make another pass at it if you need to, especially early on.<p>Planning out how you&#x27;re going to get things into a working state and split up your changes (commits in git) early can sometimes help, but sometimes it&#x27;s easier just to clean up your commit history later as you&#x27;re reviewing your changes (getting familiar with `git rebase` can help with this).<p>4. Submit your merge requests&#x2F;pull requests.<p>If you can at all, get your code into a working, logically separated state often and submit small merge requests&#x2F;pull requests often for review. This can help you correct your tragectory early on if you still need to take a different direction. Familiarity with git or the VCS you&#x27;re using can help a lot with dealing with multiple branches of code. As with all things, give your pull request one final look-over before you submit it for review and clean up anything you need to.<p><i><\/i>tl;dr: understand everything you can, ask questions, plan ahead, take multiple passes early, and make small changes<i><\/i>"],"time":["2019-12-10 18:39:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kissgyorgy"],"id":[21750700],"kids":{},"parent":[21730125],"text":["Read Clean Code (they are in video form) or Code Complete 2 and Refactoring books and LEARN what makes a design better than another.

Those patterns have a uniform distribution with respect to the probability of them actually explaining the data.<p>I remember pretty clearly when I first started seeing &quot;the game&quot;, which is the politics that course through an organization like the wind through a mountain forest. It can be pretty heady at first, it is like wearing the special sunglasses in &quot;They Live&quot;, but for me I also &quot;saw&quot; some things that weren&#x27;t actually there at all. And acting on what I think I saw resulted in modest embarrassment and some awkwardness.<p>So with experience, I learned to take what I saw with a bit of skepticism and to figure out ways I could &quot;test&quot;, without revealing what I suspected to be true, whether or not something was what was actually going on.<p>That test for Gruber was apparently the belief that you &quot;cannot&quot; hire a new CEO from another large company in the short amount of time that Away did it, so the &quot;truth&quot; (or what is &quot;really&quot; going on) is that the Verge story was cover for the swap and distracting from the distasteful element that a woman in technology was being forced out and a man coming in to replace her.<p>I don&#x27;t think that would be enough for me. Over my career I have met with a number of executive search firms, both helping them to identify good candidates, and sometimes as the candidate they were vetting for a possible move. And that experience showed me that executives are just as trigger happy as employees are for the &#x27;right&#x27; move. That is especially true near the top because the only way you move into the &#x27;big&#x27; seat is for the person in it to be ejected, and that can be a slow process for an aggressive person. Watching Ed Zander give up on Scott ever stepping down so that he could take over Sun he bailed and went to Motorola. It&#x27;s a common story. So for me, I can see that if you talked to the right executive search firm, they might have a couple of candidates that were already &#x27;loose in the socket&#x27; as they say.

First off, in a pre `go mod` world, if you had dependencies to check before running the build, then a Makefile was the easiest way to manage that. But even in a post `go mod` world, there are good reasons to use one that the article totally overlooks:<p>* Makefiles introduce a topological sort to build steps. This is the reason you use it instead of build shell scripts: it allows build steps to run in parallel, it guarantees order by dependency which is the best way to read build steps, and it makes file freshness an easy element to check for a build step, which is still needed for Go projects with multiple subpackages.<p>* Go projects usually have more than go files that are required in making an executable. If you run a web server and you are bundling static pages into your executable, Makefiles are the best way to handle that.<p>* If you are building for multiple architectures, or want to encode the git tag&#x2F;branch into the executable, it is better to have that Makefile bake in the necessary options on the build step and keep it uniform across the build.<p>* If you write a Go file and bake that into a Docker image, I find it best to drop the image and container hashes into files so that I can get to them easily for docker exec&#x2F;attach&#x2F;rm&#x2F;rmi commmands.<p>But there is one bigger reason Makefiles work for our entire team. We standardize on using Makefiles as the entrypoint for our builds. We have a polyglot environment at work so sometimes it gets confusing to figure out how to build a project. By standardizing on running &#x27;make&#x27; we are all on the same page. Have a Javascript project to webpack? Run make and have make call yarn. Have a python wheel to construct? Run make and have make call python setup.py. You have a Java project that requires a sequence of maven commands to build? Run make and have the makefile call maven.<p>Is that inefficient? You bet it is. Does it make it easier to sort out what to do to build a project for the first time? Yes it does. Does it make it 100% easier for our CI&#x2F;CD framework to work with multiple languages and scan for the necessary compilers and dependencies?

Go projects that need make(1) to build will not work out of the box for Windows users, even though Go is fully supported on Windows. For me, this puts Makefiles into the &quot;nonstarter&quot; category, even though I do all of my own development work on Linux. There is just no reason to complicate things for people who don&#x27;t have make(1) installed.<p>For code generation and other ancillary tasks, Go includes the &#x27;go generate&#x27; facility.

Especially in the US, you can be out on the street in 15 minutes with little or no protection against that. It&#x27;s a very one sided deal where you shovel shit in exchange for a lower income. So, people treat their employers as customers and have less reservations about firing their customer. The average tenure at several of the big SFO monopolists (lets just call that out) has allegedly (I lack a good source) dropped below a year. That&#x27;s what happens in a scarce market.<p>When starting a startup, employment is also meaningless because if you are in grow fast&#x2F;fail fast mode, long term employment is not a thing. Your company could end up being acquired, killed, or simply be fizzling out.<p>A lot of companies are now relying on recruiters and agencies to supply them with what is non essential staff where the person disappearing is less of an issue. This kind of recruiting works great for no-tech startups (any kind of saas or marketplace type company). Lots of buzzwords, but mostly hiring full stack. That kind of company. All they need is generic skills. Hiring is still a problem for actual tech startups that need access to the best and brightest in their fields. You&#x27;re not going to find those people through some shitty recruiter or head hunter. They are not likely to be actively looking at all, ever.

And most who do work in said Industry, and they may even have a culinary schooling background, don&#x27;t love food but instead love the lifestyle it can offer--Bourdain sadly, but accurately, highlights this in Kitchen Confidential and several of his series&#x27; about the hard boozing, drug-addled &#x27;chef life.&#x27; I&#x27;m glad to say I got over that very early on in my first phase back as a University student.<p>Whereas in much of Europe (excluding places like Germany and UK), and from what I&#x27;ve seen in parts of Asia outside of China as well, food is the basis for which to take a break and unwind and enjoy the simpler pleasures of Life. Sitting at a table with friends and family is the reward for a day&#x27;s work, and justifies why you even get out of bed.

Most of the best stuff from both cuisines doesn&#x27;t travel well, and forces you to eat locally and seasonally to really appreciate it.

If your parents&#x27; income is low enough, then the government will give you a grant based on the cost of tuition.  Schools that have low tuition get a smaller check from the government for the same student than schools that have high tuition.  As a result, schools push tuition higher and higher, then give grants to students to cover the high costs that remain after the government grant.<p>For example, say school A charges $5000 per year.  A low-income student is accepted and maxes out their government grants, the school can get a check for up to $5000.<p>School B charges $50,000 per year.  For that same student, they can get $23k per year (or something like that), plus the student now qualifies for subsidized loans to pay for room and board.
