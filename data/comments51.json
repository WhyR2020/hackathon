Since I&#x27;m working in JS, I haven&#x27;t really tried to copy its internal architecture since it doesn&#x27;t quite make sense for a higher-level GC&#x27;d runtime, but I think the public API was a really handy reference for the kinds of things a practical ECS needs to have. It&#x27;s a really impressive and robust project, and the documentation is super thorough and worth a peek if you have any interest in game architecture.<p><i>(slightly off-topic, but I&#x27;m excited to have a venue to ramble a bit about this:)<\/i> ECS is really cool, and I&#x27;m excited about using it more for my games. The &quot;cheap&quot; (de)serialization by moving all state into pure, data-only components is really fascinating - I&#x27;ve been playing around with building networked multiplayer games for a while now, and I&#x27;m currently experimenting with rollback netcode.<p>A key part of rollback is saving your state every frame so you can load it if you need to roll back, and ECS makes saving&#x2F;loading easier to reason about, since you can &quot;just&quot; grab the components and their associated entity IDs and load if needed (EnTT, for the record, has an API for this[1], though they leave the actual (de)serialization up to you). Of course, JS&#x27;s lack of a memcpy equivalent makes this much harder than what you could do in C++, which has lead me to experiment with immer[2] in my ECS, which uses structural sharing to avoid mutation, so you can get a &quot;copy&quot; of your state by just keeping a reference to it, as future updates will make new objects. This, of course, theoretically could make a ton of garbage (e.g. updating your position every frame would create a new Position object every frame), which is not great for high performance games. I&#x27;m not sure how bad this will be in practice - JS GC is <i>relatively<\/i> smart and fast these days, but I haven&#x27;t tried doing much beyond little pong or platformer demos yet. I&#x27;d also imagine that, like, doing a deep clone of my state tree every frame (or doing the whole JSON.stringify&#x2F;parse dance if I stick to primitive values) probably generates just as much garbage. Maybe if I could integrate immer with some kind of object pool it&#x27;d avoid these issues, but I have no idea how useful object pooling is in practice in JS...<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skypjack&#x2F;entt&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crash-Course:-entity-component-system#snapshot-complete-vs-continuous\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skypjack&#x2F;entt&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crash-Course:-entity-c...<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;immerjs&#x2F;immer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;immerjs&#x2F;immer<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-10 01:31:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Lawrencemm"],"id":[23129004],"kids":[23136526],"parent":[23128702],"text":["You can achieve a lot of things with this library, a whole new world of architectural patterns opened up for me when I got into it."],"time":["2020-05-10 01:12:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["macgyverismo"],"id":[23130986],"kids":[23131038,23131722],"parent":[23128702],"text":["Having read through the README, I&#x27;m not quite sure what makes this perform better than other systems.\nI can see that it will perform excellent when iterating over a single type as all entries for this type are next to each other.

We want to be able to look at the mind the way we look at a malfunctioning car (&quot;ah, the timing belt&#x27;s out&quot;) or computer (&quot;one of the memory sticks died&quot;), repair&#x2F;replace that component and expect it to carry on as &quot;normal&quot;. This can never work. The mind is an organic, emergent phenomenon, not something that has been &quot;designed&quot; to work in any &quot;normal&quot; way; it has evolved to adapt to circumstances that can change and differ dramatically for all kinds of reasons. So, trying to categorise &quot;disorders&quot; into discrete definitions with distinct &quot;causes&quot; in order to restore the mind to some &quot;normal&quot; state cannot possibly work.<p>- I realised after a few years of researching this stuff that the notion that psychiatric &quot;disorders&quot; manifest due to &quot;bad genes&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense. The whole point of evolution is that only genes that promote survival and replication can make it through. Sure, you can get random mutations, but that doesn&#x27;t explain why so many people have the same kinds of &quot;disorders&quot;. So whatever are the genes that &quot;cause psychiatric disorders&quot; in big enough clusters that they can even be attempted to be named and described in the DSM, those genes must be there for a reason that has aided our survival - even if they have some negative aspects too (nature is all about tradeoffs after all). Realising this changed the way I view mental &quot;illness&quot;. I realised that my depression was my mind&#x27;s way of telling me that something was wrong in my life (relationships, career, physiological health) and I needed time out to examine it, understand it and correct it. Schizophrenia can be seen as an alteration of your perceptions to numb you from a stressful&#x2F;traumatic situation, a trigger of extreme creative thinking to help solve serious life problems, or a display of aberrant behaviour to signal to outsiders that you are in need of help (see studies of how often schizophrenia manifests after a period of severe stress or trauma). Bipolar can be seen as a pattern of swinging between a high energy&#x2F;creativity state in order to get important things achieved quickly, and a low-energy state for recovery.<p>- The discussion in this article seems astonishingly simplistic and naïve to anyone who has read&#x2F;heard any of the many researchers who have spent years examining mental &quot;illness&quot; from the perspective of trauma, and who have found success treating all kinds of conditions through trauma healing techniques. Such figures include Stan Grof, Ram Dass, Iain McGilchrist, Peter Levine and Gabor Maté.<p>- My own experience: I&#x27;m one of those who has fit the diagnosis for several conditions at times in my life; depression and anxiety most clearly, but also (at least mildly) bipolar, borderline PD, ADHD, some addiction. I tried all the conventional things (pharmaceuticals, mainstream psychiatric talk therapy) and didn&#x27;t get much relief. About 8 years ago I discovered unconventional approaches to subconscious trauma healing, and have undertaken these consistently ever since, and my &quot;disorders&quot; have steadily resolved. All that&#x27;s left is some latent anxiety, but that continues to improve too."],"time":["2020-05-10 07:45:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rl3"],"id":[23128814],"kids":[23129292,23131020,23129889],"parent":[23128265],"text":["Layperson here.<p>Having hit my head quite a few times over the past years, I&#x27;ve dug into cutting-edge mTBI (concussion) research pretty hard.<p>What I learned was that the long-term effects of concussion are now fundamentally thought of as neurometabolic in nature. That is, the loss of metabolic homeostasis within the brain due to an initial trauma. Unless this process arrests, what you&#x27;re left with is neurodegeneration. How much really depends on the circumstance and patient.<p>The most striking takeaway I had, was that much of the latest research is suggesting that different etiologies lead to the same pathology in many instances. For example, it may be that you can acquire Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease, or Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, or even ALS via way of: chronic poor sleep quality (poor glymhpatic performance), history of frequent subconcussive head trauma (CTE), history of concussive or severe head truama (mTBI&#x2F;TBI), neuroimmune factors, and of course genetic factors. Often times a combination thereof. That example isn&#x27;t even remotely comprehensive on either the etiology or pathology side.<p>Point being, your brain is like a washing machine. If it goes out of balance, sometimes it will only oscillate further out of balance unless the process is arrested.<p>Psychiatric disorders are much the same way. I suspect it is for this reason that comorbidity is so commonplace.<p>The interesting part about psychiatric disorders however, is to a degree they can self-reinforce in a unique way.

People who are doing okay don&#x27;t seek out diagnosis. One big example is Bill Gross, the &quot;Bond King&quot; who manages mutual funds - he happened to read the description of Asperger&#x27;s and realize he had it <i>in his seventies<\/i>. Psychologists do not see a representative sample of society. If diagnosis A and B are both mild enough to cause some people with it to not seek treatment, but everyone with <i>both<\/i> to do so, you&#x27;ll see a correlation between A and B.<p>2. All mental health diagnostic criteria share a clause that sounds like &quot;and these symptoms cause a significant amount of distress or ill-functioning to the patient.&quot; This is similar to the first factor, but happens after people seek treatment; if you tell a psychologist that you aren&#x27;t having <i>any<\/i> problems in your life, they do not diagnose you with depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc. It almost doesn&#x27;t matter what you have going on, if it doesn&#x27;t cause problems its not worth using medical care on, so it doesn&#x27;t get diagnosed. And again, if you only have one kind of thing causing you problems, it&#x27;s more likely to not be severe enough to warrant some kind of diagnosis.<p>3. Similar to the previous factor, mental health diagnoses are used to gatekeep medical care and social support. So, people who need more resources than they currently have are going to push more for additional mental health diagnoses, while people who are more okay are going to be fine with the first one proffered. Eg, a young woman who is extremely anxious and whose mom yells at her all the time goes in, gets diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed anxiolytics, things are still bad because her mom keeps yelling, so she goes back and gets a depression diagnosis and anti-depressants. Or a school can offer accommodations for ADHD and not autism, or vice versa, so someone with one goes back and asks the psychologist for the other.<p>In short, there&#x27;s a general willingness-to-seek-diagnosis that&#x27;s an <i>obvious<\/i> latent variable for mental health diagnoses. I&#x27;d be more surprised to <i>not<\/i> find a positive correlation between two arbitrarily picked mental health diagnoses. If there&#x27;s an outright negative correlation, that&#x27;s something that would be actually indicative of a biological link of some sort - either the biochemistry of one complex protects against the other, or they&#x27;re a pair of under&#x2F;over-activity of a system, or the like."],"time":["2020-05-10 05:16:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["danieltillett"],"id":[23129119],"kids":[23129197,23129156],"parent":[23128265],"text":["I wonder how much of this correlation between disorders is just an artefact of inconsistent classification of patients by psychiatrists?

Restricting research cultures to follow this linear progress model also imposes an artificial block that may be detrimental to productivity.

This may or may not work because “clean up” is a non-trivial task which the researcher may find limited time and utility for.<p>By no means I’m against writing clean code. In fact, I’ve had multiple discussions advocating it but it’s hard to keep everyone aligned. The primary objective of research in a fast-paced field like Machine Learning is to get the idea out the door.  Unfortunately, the exceptionally compounding benefits of writing clean thoughtful code from the beginning are realized much later in this timeline. By then, it’s too late and too hard to retro-fix code.<p>My understanding so far (having written code for multiple research projects) is that the only way to fix this culture is to deeply ingrain the compounding benefits of clean code in new researchers.

This is mainly due to people reading this paper without knowing much about consensus and drawing conclusions like &quot;Raft is better than Paxos&quot; or &quot;Raft is the best consensus algorithm&quot; though. Some thoughts (please elaborate if you think I&#x27;m simplifying it too much or if you disagree with me!):<p>First of all remember that Paxos is <i>a family of protocols<\/i> for solving consensus. When doing research it&#x27;s useful to reduce a problem into smaller and smaller parts. The &quot;standard&quot; Paxos algorithm is a very simple consensus algorithm which can only decide a single value once. It&#x27;s not practical at all, but provides a good framework for thinking about consensus.<p>When this article proposes &quot;Raft vs Paxos&quot; they are <i>actually<\/i> comparing Raft against a standard way of configuring Paxos with a leader (MultiPaxos). Note that MultiPaxos allows a lot of nuances in the implementations while still being called &quot;MultiPaxos&quot;. MultiPaxos is not a spec you implement; it&#x27;s a set of ideas.<p>Raft on the other hand is a concrete protocol with well-defined, specified behavior. In fact, Raft is essentially an implementation of MultiPaxos[1]. This is a very good thing! Paxos provides a framework for thinking about consensus, while Raft puts some of these ideas into a concrete specification which is easy to implement. And it is a good point that we should make the knowledge in the field of consensus available for a wider audience. Yay, Raft is good!<p>And here comes the problem: A lot of people have read the Raft paper and made the conclusion that &quot;Raft is the best way of solving consensus&quot;. Raft is (relatively) easy to implement and get started with and gives you a very simple model to program for (a log of commands), but it&#x27;s far from a panacea.<p>The most important thing to know about Raft is that it&#x27;s not performant (every command has to be sent to a single leader which becomes a bottleneck) nor scalable (every command needs to be processed by all nodes). Etcd supports &quot;1000s of writes&quot; and recommends up to &quot;7 nodes&quot;.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that Raft is <i>bad<\/i>; it&#x27;s just a trade-off you need to be aware of. Simplicity vs performance. If you&#x27;re integrating Raft into your stack and aim for scalability&#x2F;performance you must always be very weary of when you use it. You should minimize writes at all costs. Unfortunately many developers gets the impression that you can just plug Raft into an existing system and suddenly have a performant and scalable distributed system.<p>A good example is CockrouchDB: They&#x27;re using plain Raft for writes, but uses &quot;leader leases&quot; for scaling reads. Suddenly things become a lot more complicated (for instance see this issue about how leader leases are implemented in the Go library for Raft: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;raft&#x2F;issues&#x2F;108\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;raft&#x2F;issues&#x2F;108<\/a>). I&#x27;m sorry, but you&#x27;re going to have to get your hands dirty if you want something that&#x27;s both fast and correct.<p>The end result is that you have two choices: (1) You can use a library which provides a simple model (a log of commands), but doesn&#x27;t scale well or (2) you can use a more complicated consensus algorithm and then deal with all of the Hard Problems™ that comes with it. If you&#x27;re going for the second option, you might as well take advantage of all of the research discovered in the last few years (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vadosware.io&#x2F;post&#x2F;paxosmon-gotta-concensus-them-all&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vadosware.io&#x2F;post&#x2F;paxosmon-gotta-concensus-them-all&#x2F;<\/a>)<p>It should also be noted that even though the <i>consensus<\/i> algorithm doesn&#x27;t scale, it doesn&#x27;t mean your system can&#x27;t scale. Scalog (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;nsdi20-paper-ding.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;nsdi20-paper-ding.pdf<\/a>) is an example of a system which uses a consensus algorithm in a constant way (i.e. regardless of load of the system). Once again: Focus on how you can <i>avoiding<\/i> using a consensus algorithm due to the way <i>your<\/i> system works.<p>TL;DR: Hard problems are still hard. Don&#x27;t think that Raft is a magical piece of software which solves all of your problems.<p>[1]: There are some nuances between Raft and &quot;standard&quot; MultiPaxos as mentioned in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2004.05074\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2004.05074<\/a>.

The interesting problem for applications is &quot;atomic broadcast&quot; or &quot;total order broadcast&quot;, which is theoretically equivalent to consensus but much closer to the needs of applications. The result has been that many important atomic broadcast algorithms have been ignored while Paxos and Raft steal the spotlight in &quot;distsys&quot; pop culture. Some of these algorithms need only f+1 nodes to tolerate f faults (rather than 2f+1 as with Paxos or Raft), at the cost of requiring an external reconfiguration service (almost certainly Paxos- or Raft-based). Two examples: chain replication (relatively well-known and widely deployed in at least one major cloud provider), and LCR, a provably write-throughput-optimal, fully symmetric ring-overlay protocol that achieves total ordering with no sequencer. The latter can serve linearizable reads from any replica, with none of the complex consistency concerns of read replicas in Paxos&#x2F;Raft (or Zookeeper). Also, read throughput scales linearly with the size of the cluster (while write throughput stays roughly constant). Write latency and transient fault tolerance are strictly inferior to quorum-based protocols like Paxos&#x2F;Raft, but this is less of a concern in LAN environments, where write throughput tends to matter more. Both chain replication and LCR support much higher write throughput than Paxos&#x2F;Raft, and are thus more suitable for data plane applications in a LAN (specialized Paxos variants like SDPaxos are more appropriate for a WAN). If your system needs to be able to reconfigure itself, though, or you need to mask tail latency&#x2F;transient faults, then Paxos&#x2F;Raft are still the way to go."],"time":["2020-05-10 08:23:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Alex3917"],"id":[23120380],"kids":[23150217],"parent":[23119949],"text":["For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve been curating research on over-the-counter interventions for Covid-19 here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;covid19stack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;covid19stack<\/a><p>The research on vitamin D has been discussed extensively there over the last couple months.<p>This article (and the linked citations) misses a bunch of the most important theorized mechanisms of action, most notably that vitamin D plays a role in regulating blood clotting and having adequate levels may prevent the kind of sudden deaths from stoke we&#x27;ve been seeing in people who seemed to have gotten over the disease with otherwise mild symptoms."],"time":["2020-05-09 00:48:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fattire"],"id":[23120795],"kids":[23123562,23120875],"parent":[23119949],"text":["Dr. John Campbell, an educator in Northern England who&#x27;s been doing daily Youtube updates on Covid news since January I believe, has put out a few videos from time to time related to vitamin D:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W5yVGmfivAk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W5yVGmfivAk<\/a> - A month ago\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GCSXNGc7pfs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GCSXNGc7pfs<\/a> - 3 weeks ago\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K-mHCn74E5o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K-mHCn74E5o<\/a> - 3 days ago<p>He suggests vitamin D deficiency may play a partial role in explaining higher mortality rates among people with darker skin (other important social disparities notwithstanding)."],"time":["2020-05-09 01:51:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gremlinsinc"],"id":[23120339],"kids":[23120459,23120903,23120503,23120435],"parent":[23119949],"text":["Not by me.

In it, I learned there are many interesting connections between algebra and graph theory [6] and started writing a library called Kaliningraph to study some of those connections [7].<p>[0]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eulerarchive.maa.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;originals&#x2F;E053.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eulerarchive.maa.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;originals&#x2F;E053.pdf<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eulerian_path#Hierholzer&#x27;s_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eulerian_path#Hierholzer&#x27;s_alg...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hamiltonian_path\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hamiltonian_path<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Broom_Bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Broom_Bridge<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp&#x2F;EMIS&#x2F;classics&#x2F;Hamilton&#x2F;PRIAIcos.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp&#x2F;EMIS&#x2F;classics&#x2F;Hamilton&#x2F;PRIAI...<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.mcgill.ca&#x2F;~wlh&#x2F;comp766&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.mcgill.ca&#x2F;~wlh&#x2F;comp766&#x2F;<\/a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.yale.edu&#x2F;homes&#x2F;spielman&#x2F;sagt&#x2F;sagt.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.yale.edu&#x2F;homes&#x2F;spielman&#x2F;sagt&#x2F;sagt.pdf<\/a><p>[7]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breandan&#x2F;kaliningraph\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breandan&#x2F;kaliningraph<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-09 23:41:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["JorgeGT"],"id":[23124555],"kids":[23124867,23129310],"parent":[23123754],"text":["Soviet solution: bomb two of the bridges, therefore allowing an Eulerian path."],"time":["2020-05-09 15:33:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hprotagonist"],"id":[23124532],"kids":{},"parent":[23123754],"text":["i was extremely lucky and had a great math teacher who pulled this one on us in 10th grade.<p>Good times."],"time":["2020-05-09 15:29:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HugoDaniel"],"id":[23127804],"kids":{},"parent":[23123754],"text":["Who cares about bridges when you can swim ?"],"time":["2020-05-09 21:56:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stared"],"id":[23125067],"kids":[23125253,23128832],"parent":[23122787],"text":["I think we are on the first steps of a very interesting road related to using DL for image processing:<p>- Automatically cutting a person or an object <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remove.bg&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remove.bg&#x2F;<\/a><p>- Turning 2d photos in 3d perspective videos <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shihmengli.github.io&#x2F;3D-Photo-Inpainting&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shihmengli.github.io&#x2F;3D-Photo-Inpainting&#x2F;<\/a><p>- Artistic style transfer for videos <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Khuj4ASldmU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Khuj4ASldmU<\/a><p>- Super-resolution for old games <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.resetera.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;ai-neural-networks-being-used-to-generate-hq-textures-for-older-games-you-can-do-it-yourself.88272&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.resetera.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;ai-neural-networks-being-us...<\/a><p>Etc, etc."],"time":["2020-05-09 16:40:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ubercow13"],"id":[23125878],"kids":[23125949],"parent":[23122787],"text":["Highly compressed Youtube videos don&#x27;t really seem like a good medium by which to demonstrate an image scaling algorithm.."],"time":["2020-05-09 18:04:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tchaffee"],"id":[23127670],"kids":[23128063],"parent":[23122787],"text":["I think the plugins are very interesting.

Ninety-eight percent of American homes have a television set; more than half our homes have more than one. There are 40,000 new book titles published every year (300,000 worldwide), and every day in America 41 million photographs are taken. And if this is not enough, more than 60 billion pieces of junk mail (thanks to computer technology) find their way into our mail-boxes every year.<p>From millions of sources all over the globe, through every possible channel and medium — light waves, airwaves, ticker tapes, computer banks, telephone wires, television cables, satellites, printing presses — information pours in. Behind it, in every imaginable form of storage — on paper, on video and audio tape, on discs, film, and silicon chips — is an ever greater volume of information waiting to be retrieved. Like the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, we are awash in information. And all the sorcerer has left us is a broom.<p>Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems. To say it still another way: The milieu in which Technopoly flourishes is one in which the tie between information and human purpose has been severed, i.e., information appears indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, in enormous volume and at high speeds, and disconnected from theory, meaning, or purpose.<p>All of this has called into being a new world. I have referred to it elsewhere as a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accomodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy.<p>We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process.

On the last point, about delayed gratification when writing: one way, and perhaps <i>the<\/i> way to complete a long writing project is to enjoy what you are writing, which means you are writing the book that you would enjoy reading. I&#x27;ve tried multiple times to come up with a novel idea that would sell but I ended up never pursuing them. Once I started thinking really hard about a story that I wish someone else had already made, I got started and enjoyed the whole process.<p>A corollary to this is that you must know what kind of stories you like, which means you have to develop your taste. I don&#x27;t mean &quot;taste&quot; in the sense that you have the same opinions as New York Times critics. I mean that when you watch a movie or read a book that you enjoy, try to understand what parts of it you enjoyed, what parts of it you didn&#x27;t enjoy, and how you would change it to make it better. This doesn&#x27;t just apply to literature. In developing your artistic taste, you could try to understand exactly what part of an awesome painting evokes feeling in you.<p>After I started thinking this way, I came up with a story that might not appeal to most people but sure as hell felt moving to me. I realized that the story could be told better in a visual format instead of in prose, so I started practicing art again. I&#x27;m a perfectionist who hated drawing when I studied art in school, but now that I have this idea in my head I feel very little inhibition in practicing. Instead of wondering how to make my story sell better or second guessing every mark I make, I move forward because if I hesitate I feel like I&#x27;m letting down the characters in the story I want to be told."],"time":["2020-05-09 22:34:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Everlag"],"id":[23128241],"kids":[23128269],"parent":[23123057],"text":["Most good rules always have an exception, Malazan[0] is a fun set of exceptions to these.<p>If you&#x27;re not familiar, Malazan is a series of high fantasy novels and they&#x27;re quite good.

S2). They are concentrated in South Asia, the coastal Middle East, and coastal southwest North America, in close proximity to extraordinarily high SSTs and intense continental heat that together favor the occurrence of extreme humid heat (2, 14).<p>Future Indian geopolitics is certainly going to be interesting. Would like to see these hotspots mapped for the next 20-30 years to highlight the scope of the situation. Will certain areas become perennially uninhabitable? Is it a matter of having AC &#x2F; low humidity shelters that people flock to a couple hours a day during seasonal peaks? Estimates on climate refugees and migration patterns etc. I suspect it&#x27;s going to be onerous but workable. There&#x27;s low energy dehumidifying HVAC solutions that might be attainable even in poorer communities. Ultimately, petro rich countries like middle East and North America is going to be fine and AC through the solution if they have to, aggravating the problem for everyone else. Regardless, it&#x27;s a problem worth mitigating and acclimatizing to, 85% of the world is seeking to develop and will do so via the most cost-efficient (currently dirty) methods possible. IMO, accommodating for this is a greater moral imperative that&#x27;s ultimately incompatible with aggregate reduction in emissions - that was never workable. Developed countries should still strive to improve efficient and innovate to flatten the environmental cost curve per unit of quality of improvement, and modify their life styles so that rampant consumptive culture is not the aspired endpoint.

I am approaching 40, worked in a bunch of other companies before. My degree is is in the humanities, from a third world university you never heard of. I don&#x27;t have any open source contributions. I speak lousy accented English (but I am a man and &quot;white&quot; if we are counting privileges.)<p>I got contacted by a recruiter. I had a couple of phone interviews which felt like sanity checking that I knew what I claimed to know. I was asked to grade myself in a bunch of areas. I chose makes around 5-6 for the stuff I think I know well, and zero or one for the rest. I was given some recommended reading list that I ignored. I did browse Skiena&#x27;s book on algorithms to get in the zone. I didn&#x27;t study it or implement anything. I am very stressed during interviews and would forget anything that isn&#x27;t in long-term memory already so there was no point. (know yourself...)<p>I went to the onsite interview. Year, it&#x27;s ~5 hours of being interviewed by people who have done dozens of interviews before. Everybody was unfailingly nice. I was panicing, not because &quot;omg Google&quot; but &quot;omg humans I don&#x27;t know for years already&quot;. Some algorithms, some Python, more troubleshooting and Unix. I had to estimate some numbers, so I announced I would use my cell phone calculator to not get anything wrong. I multiplied even low numbers by two on the calculator. Most interviewers are poker-faced about whether they liked the interview or not (now that I am an interviewer I understand - they probably try to put some distance between the interview and their rating, as they should).  I could see that one was happy. I could see that one was not.<p>I was hired. Large team, three sites. I did a reasonable amount of C++ (not a language I ever claimed to know) fixing bugs and performance issues. Most of my work has to do with low-level synchronization in x86 - I picked a small &quot;specialty&quot; first and applied it to a number of problems. I like it. I feel that I actually write more code than my peers in the product teams, as they do too much design-docing, design-reviewing, meeting, etc. (they are SWEs, I am a SE). The design doc culture at Google is excessive and silly. I am exposed to that too.<p>I earn slightly more than my similarly-leveled peers on the SWE side &#x2F;before&#x2F; accounting for oncall. Oncall rarely pages on weekends. I feel very able to fix any problem while oncall, or to escalate if not in my area. It doesn&#x27;t stress me. I mostly consider it free money.<p>My peer SREs actually know far more about all the nice Google architectural stuff than our peers in SWE-land, who are mostly implementing features on top of huge abstraction layers and typically are only exposed to one particular facet of the infrastructure. Google&#x27;s infrastructure is impressive and something of a marvel. It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s perfect. SRE is the better point of view to observe it.<p>Google employees <i>are<\/i> better than in any other large company (a few boutique shops are better on average, of course, at a smaller scale). Some of them like to pretend that they are better than they are to the outside world. Internally, nobody goes far being arrogant, and showing vulnerability or gaps in knowledge is not a problem. There is also someone smarter and nicer than you anyway.<p>I interview people. The immense majority of people I interview are really good. It&#x27;s not possible to get to the point of onsite interviews unless you are good, you just know the person you are talking to is a potential peer. Interviewers are happy when their candidates do well. The committee ends up rejecting most, though, out of hyper-conservatism. I have no idea how I was hired.

Specifically, I targeted PUBG.<p>They&#x27;ve added obfuscation, that&#x27;s about it. Even one of the guys the author interviews admits it:<p>&gt; “Last year, we spent time working on various measures to block cheat programs,” explains Taeseok Jang, executive producer of PUBG PC. “Most of these actions focused on blocking cheat program developers to make it more difficult for them to create these highly lucrative cheats.”<p>That obfuscation was probably a huge problem when PUBG initially started adding it, but so long as some bored high school kid has a pirated copy of IDA and a desire to prove themselves, that info is going to end up online. Each new obfuscation feature or anticheat detection becomes a challenge, and the results of that challenge being inevitably solved are inevitably posted in a public and high-visibility place for others to learn from and use.<p>All of this public information meant that creating a cheat for the game probably added around a month or two of work to adapt to the cheat prevention efforts, on top of the month or so that I spent looking for the actual in-game structures necessary to implement the radar I was going for. I already expected every hindrance I encountered when reversing the game and writing the tooling to interact with the game&#x27;s process. It was still daunting, especially since I had never touched the windows kernel until this project, but ultimately when I ended up getting everything working it felt like I was just using the same techniques I used to use back in the day only with extra steps.<p>My takeaways for anyone interested in preventing videogames from being cheated in:<p><pre><code>  - Cheaters will eventually find a way, but you can always reduce the quantity and quality of them.\n  - All information on how to write a cheat for your game eventually ends up in public forums. Keep an eye on those and learn how most people are writing cheats and target those methods specifically.\n  - Obfuscation (new detentions, new anti-reversing measures, new countermeasures to cheating methods) buys you time in the immediate term and invalidates existing online information in the long term. They&#x27;re like antibiotics--they increases the barrier to entry and pain factor of cheating only if you continue adding&#x2F;changing it. \n  - Obfuscation will never be adequate to prevent cheating entirely. Human monitoring, ML, skill-based pairing, and full visibility &amp; control over hardware the game is executing on are probably the next generation in terms of cheat prevention.<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-05-09 15:33:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Jonnax"],"id":[23124011],"kids":[23124942,23124235],"parent":[23123627],"text":["Cheating in online gaming is prevalent.

I&#x27;d like to provide a bit of context and point out an important technical detail that is not touched upon in the phys.org story.<p>The thing is, the claims made here, taken at face value, are rather extraordinary!<p>Under usual conditions, in order to observe quantum phenomena with microwaves, sub-Kelvin temperatures are required to prevent the quantum signal from being swamped by blackbody radiation. Theoretically, there could be a few ways around this limitation (e.g. N00N states), but all prior experiments (to my knowledge) have been performed firmly within the confines of cryogenic refigerators.<p>In this experiment, too, the non-classical state begins at a brisk temperature of 7 mK. To get a strong enough signal that can be brought out to room temperature, bounced off a target, and finally digitized by room-temperature electronics, the experiment includes a &quot;classical&quot; transistor amplifier in the signal path.<p>Now, another elementary result of quantum theory forbids amplifiers of this type from boosting quantum signals without significant added noise.<p>How did the experimentalists get around this limitation? It appears that they have chosen to present some of their results as a function of the number of signal photons, leaving out the added noise by the amplifier.<p>The problematic part for the purpoted quantum advantage is that the classical noise at the amplifier output is much larger than the quantum component. Hence, a target illuminated by this kind of &quot;radar&quot; will simply pick up the amplifier noise, and no &quot;true&quot; quantum advantage was demonstrated.<p>Note that the above conclusions can be found in the research article itself, starting at the end of second-to-last paragraph on page 3. Also note that, carefully reading the abstract and introduction, no claims of demonstrated beyond-classical performance are made.<p>Take-home lesson?

Consider the 3D to 2D analogy. If the 2D person lived on a planet, that would be a circle. Then 2 planets orbiting each other would appear to the 2D person as two line segments oscilating up and down (because the 2D person cannot see the entire circle, just the edge view). Based on the velocity of oscillation and the separation of the line segments, a 2D newton could come up with an analogous law of gravition with an inverse square relation. But if two 3d planets were orbiting transversely through the 2D plane of our inhabitants, the 2D person would see two separate line segments growing and shrinking although the line segments could maintain a constant distance of separation. The velocity of growing and shrinking would be changing even though their separation was constant. Extending this analogy to our universe makes me wonder if our calculation that the universe is expanding is just an illusion. Rather, at astronomical distances, our universe could be traversing 4 dimensions. And what we perceive as an accelerating expansion of the universe is just motion into the 4th dimension. And if we could travel into that dimension, we might be able to get to places that appear far away but are actually not. Though it sounds far fetched, it also might explain the stuff that is postulated to happen at the quantum scale-where quantum fluctuations are postulated to occur. The only thing we would need to be able to do is to &#x27;coordinate&#x27; the fluctuations of lots of adjacent voxels of space.

For them it makes sense that websites like this feel and act like apps, both as an end-user (animations, transitions without full-page reloading, rich dynamic content, etc) and as a developer (client-side state management, frontend&#x2F;backend separation, with an API in between, modular application structure, etc).<p>Apps don&#x27;t load in 10ms, but they also can support some offline functionality given their independence from the server. Overriding browser behaviour and managing your own loading behaviour makes sense, because the default browser behaviour is not the experience you&#x27;re striving for; it&#x27;s not the app experience. These people are usually those who have worked on large web projects too— the developer experience that web developers have built for themselves in &quot;userland&quot; (JavaScript) is pretty good, and has evolved a lot to have features that makes developing the exact behaviour you want easier, and correctly iterating on a codebase, quicker.<p>A separate school of thought wish websites stayed true to their origins as enriched documents, and think trying to evolve them in the direction of applications is counter-productive to their true purpose as interactive surfaces to get and send information. If I am just going to scroll and see a few pictures, why do I need to download anything other than the structure of the page and the pictures themselves? If all the building blocks are already there, in the browser, why do people need to re-invent them and ship them as yet more JavaScript?<p>What should a website be though? The fact there isn&#x27;t consensus about this is indication that there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be a clear answer.<p>Per the document-like school of thought, facebook.com just keeps straying further and further away from the ideal, but as far as as the app-like school of thought goes, the new facebook.com is a pretty remarkable achievement."],"time":["2020-05-08 21:12:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["3PS"],"id":[23117275],"kids":[23118655,23119325,23117516,23118390,23117848,23117603,23117393,23119627,23120019,23121223],"parent":[23116300],"text":["I&#x27;m actually really surprised by the number of comments in this thread about how the new redesign is slower.

Especially the clients I worked with have millions of views per day. The total binary for Max Factor VMUA (2) is the same size which includes a large data set needed for a neural network for skin tone analysis and face feature detection.<p>Learning: Do not include all of OpenCV. You don&#x27;t need it all, but if you do cherry pick the parts you need. I do recommend writing the simplistic parts (this is for you who just use cv::mat!).<p>- Speed<p>If you want a 60 FPS AR effect &#x2F; AI algo on an Android device OpenCV isn&#x27;t always the fastest approach. Do not rely on a framework, you will need to get your hands dirty and optimise&#x2F;rewrite the slow areas. WebAssembly is fast, but not as fast as the desktops and native environments you normally create this code on.<p>- Market<p>Not everyone has an iPhone in London. Bandwidth means seconds, JS and WebAssembly execution adds to this. In a world where m-commerce is king this does matter. Think Poland, middle of nowhere in Ohio, Brazil, etc. If it takes 60 seconds for a web app to run on 3g and then another 20 for the executable to start, and then the experience is then sluggish it wont be commercially successful.<p>- UX<p>When you put this into a large site most traffic will come via instagram and facebook. On iOS this is typically within a WKWebView which does not support getUserMedia. Make sure you have some nice hints on how to open within iOS Safari (or Android Chrome if the parent app has not enabled permissions).<p>Nevertheless I wish this blog post existed when I started out. I regret in not writing something similar. In this post I especially love the simplicity of the Emcripten pipeline which is great. It is a fantastic demo post.
