Here&#x27;s the specific encoding I used for the sorted list: A &#x27;0&#x27; bit followed by 12 bits of payload generates a number which is those 12 bits added to a global state counter. A &#x27;1&#x27; bit increments the global state counter by 2^12. It&#x27;s easy to work out the memory requirements (it&#x27;s constant for all sorted lists of the same length): 2^20 bits for the &#x27;1&#x27; bits (to reach a maximum value of 2^32) plus 10^6 * 13 bits for the integers.

My guess is when using an app on Android, there are too many variables (from the actual GPS hardware, device ROM settings, app settings, etc.) which are not very easily accessible and likely optimized for different goals.<p>In my use case (as in the article) only care about GPS readouts when the car is in motion so I don&#x27;t really care about energy efficiency (within reason, the cigarette lighter thing should be able to safely power the device).<p>The GPS module manual says it takes about forty seconds for the GPS module to position.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;81+jY5X2YrL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;81+jY5X2YrL...<\/a><p>&gt; Once the GPS module is powered on, there is data output \n&gt; It usually takes about 40 seconds to be successfully positioned. \n&gt; After the positioning is successful, the correct time, latitude and longitude position data will be available.<p>But the article says:<p>&gt; GPS is usually acquired within 15-30 seconds of starting (much faster than the cheap electronic speedometers I tested first).<p>Maybe this does not include the time it takes for the raspberry pi to boot? Maybe the raspberry pi takes an additional thirty seconds to boot and the GPS unit powers on almost simultaneously with the raspberry pi but we don&#x27;t blame the GPS module for any delay until the raspberry pi boots, logs in, and the Navit application starts?<p>Or maybe the GPS positions way before forty seconds and the manual is written that way to not be overly optimistic (could never get decent GPS signal when walking in areas with tall skyscrapers on my Android phone a few years back).<p>This is also exciting because it is modular. When GPS III[1] (hopefully) becomes operational by the end of the decade (The tenth and final GPS Block III launch is projected in Q2 2023 so it should be fully operational&#x2F;adopted by 2030), you could simply use a new module (in theory at least).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GPS_Block_III\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GPS_Block_III<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-29 01:40:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["oh_sigh"],"id":[22716169],"kids":[22717358,22716225,22716465],"parent":[22715198],"text":["Problem is you can&#x27;t tell your speed in a tunnel.

Then we created an array with those extracted strings (many files). The original large HTML-like string was no longer needed.<p>The problem: The (V8) runtime never created a new (very small) string and copied the section. Instead, it kept the huge strings around. So while we needed only 64 bytes from many kBytes of a string, we ended up keeping the kBytes anyway. Since those were pretty big arrays we ended up with a <i>huge<\/i> amount of wasted memory.<p>We ended up with a hack-function to do a substring creation that forced V8 to create a new string, by using string addition, preventing V8 from &quot;optimizing&quot; and using a pointer into the existing string (code shown is only the core part of that function):<p><pre><code>    s.substr(start, length - 1) + s.charAt(start + length - 1);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis was a process size difference of hundreds of megabytes, since we read a lot of files and extracted a lot of values. Array(100000) of 64 byte strings vs. Array(100000) of many kBytes of strings, just to give an idea of the possible magnitude. The more long strings you extract small values from the more of a problem you get.<p>This also could be a response to @Ecco. This leak is caused by internal runtime behavior. There actually is an open issue for this, has been open for quite some time. I don&#x27;t understand it, this only isn&#x27;t a huge problem because not many people have code that extracts tiny parts from lots of strings and then keeps references to those tiny strings around. But that&#x27;s legit code, and anyone who does runs into this problem, and it is not a problem of the JS code. Maybe the optimization should force a copy if the large string could be GCed, but sure, that&#x27;s quite a bit of work. Still, the current state of simply keeping references to the original string for all substrings seems problematic to me.<p>The issue is this one I think (I only just googled quickly): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;v8&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=2869\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;v8&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=2869<\/a><p>Somebody&#x27;s blog post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rpbouman.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;a-tale-of-javascript-memory-leak.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rpbouman.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;a-tale-of-javascript-m...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-29 09:39:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["keitmo"],"id":[22715402],"kids":[22715602],"parent":[22714200],"text":["A few years ago we had a nightmarish resource leak in our server.

If you haven&#x27;t worked with LuaJIT, its C FFI is also incredible!<p>As we started scaling though, the wheels fell off the wagon. We&#x27;d add a new feature and suddenly the game wouldn&#x27;t run at interactive framerates. One time, it was the &#x27;unpack&#x27; function, which would trigger a JIT trace abort. We would drop from 12ms frames to 100ms frames. I wrote a length-specialized version that didn&#x27;t abort and moved on.<p>Another time, it was calling Lua&#x27;s &#x27;pairs&#x27; method (iterator over a map). Okay, so we can&#x27;t do that, or a few other things that made Lua productive before.<p>The other problem we hit was GC predictability being impossible. We tried to mitigate it by using native data structures through the C FFI, taking control over the GC cycle to run it once or twice per frame, etc. In the end, like the JIT problem, we weren&#x27;t writing Lua at the end, we were writing... something else. It wasn&#x27;t maintainable.<p>That summer ruined dynamic languages for me. I didn&#x27;t really want to be writing C or C++ at the time.

Employers don’t really care about any of that, apart from virtue signaling to weed out mass candidate pipelines. The actual knowledge itself is just table stakes and pretty worthless; companies will have to train you to do jobs that have effectively zero to do with acquired skills like programming. But general well-rounded cultural appreciation of a base foundation puts everyone into a level playing field to be fit for plugging in as an employee: basic understanding of how to work in groups on projects, managing interpersonal relationships even when you don’t like them, having a common standard of collegiality and “how things are done,” common understanding of academic&#x2F;liberal social norms.<p>While possible, there has not been created an online bachelor’s program that successfully replicates anything like this yet. They all focus on skill building and curriculum, as if that was any part of the purpose of college.<p>Master’s degrees are quite different. They are a pure credential kind of thing, a certificate of advanced training. It’s assumed you already have the social norm education and that’s not the goal. The hard skills of the training still don’t actually matter to anyone in master’s degrees (nor even PhDs), but they can be used for clout or authority or stack ranking in terms of how decision-making ranks are established. This is much more amenable to online courses because all that matters is the certificate at the end, nobody cares how you got it. With bachelor’s degrees they actually do care that you physically attended “intellectual workforce finishing school” at a physical campus, because the social norm &#x2F; behavioral training is the only part anyone cares about."],"time":["2020-03-29 18:43:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["atlasunshrugged"],"id":[22720024],"kids":[22720293,22720802],"parent":[22719797],"text":["That&#x27;s a great question that I&#x27;ve wondered myself - a part of it (in the U.S.) I think is the belief that a huge part of the value of a bachelors degree is growth you get living alone, in dorms, learning how to be an adult, etc. that aren&#x27;t really part of a curriculum and would be hard or impossible to do online.

I tend to think the containerization of apps is the lowest hanging fruit approach, but I also think that there is a larger underlying issue touched upon which is the monolithic style of the current linux kernel, which is why I have also hoped HURD would rise some day, and continue to find minix 3 very interesting.<p>All that said, I see one glaring omission: hids. One thing I like to emphasis with people is that especially in an age of APT, if someone sophisticated enough is targeting you, you will probably suffer a compromise. One of the most vital parts of a security model therefor is reducing the amount of time it takes to discover a compromise. This is highly undervalued in modern orgs imho.<p>There are a few different ways to do this, and none are perfect but I tend to prefer a good HIDS like ossec, sometimes custom scripts checking file hashes, etc. There is one large weakness here though, which is how often I see a hids deployed but 1) not configured well, and 2) the logs never get monitored&#x2F;ingested&#x2F;alerted on! If you can combine a good hids and actually monitor the log outputs, you can discover most compromises fairly quickly with telltale system actions.<p>Lastyly, this is also why versioned backup is so important. Because you need to be able to trust old data pre-compromise. The longer you go without knowing you are comped, the more likely you have data being restored that is comped also.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Obscurix&#x2F;Obscurix\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Obscurix&#x2F;Obscurix<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-29 11:54:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["polotics"],"id":[22716727],"kids":[22731163],"parent":[22712965],"text":["I am surprised no one has mentioned Qubes OS yet on this thread.

On the one side, I am terribly excited from a technology perspective. I grew up with homecomputers in the 80ies, and in the 90ies, all Unix-workstations had several different, non-x86 architectures. So any disruption of the x86-monoculture is interesting. Also, looking at the performance of the iPhone and iPad, I think Apple has the potential to create some great hardware. It would also give them more flexibility to roll out new features.<p>On the other side, such a transition always is painfull. A lot of software needs to be rebuilt, and even more legacy software gets killed, as it is not ported to the new platform. Though Catalina already did a lot of that, and that might not be a coincidence, if you think about it. Catalina might be intentionally restrictive to ease the transition to another architecture.<p>Also, a lot of Mac users are running VMs on their machines. Running Windows and Linux VMs on your Mac was one big benefit of the switch to Intel. I myself use a Linux VM for my professional work on a MB Pro. And that VM needs to be able to run x86 software. So it remains to be seen, how Apple deals with the MB Pro (and of course the Mac Pro)."],"time":["2020-03-29 20:08:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Traster"],"id":[22721235],"kids":[22721345,22740791],"parent":[22720126],"text":["To be honest, I am super unexcited by this.

Imagine if a different smell is released for every new branch of activity you perform on a computer or digital device (memorizing an anatomy text, playing a new keyboard concerto, learning to code Python, watching finance lectures). At night, you wear an EEG headband connected to a scent machine which releases scents connected with the activities of the day. The more important the task, the more you are exposed to the corresponding scent (kind of like spaced repetition but with smell).<p>Here are some questions I have in light of the study, assuming it can be replicated:<p>- Is this technique biased towards certain types of knowledge, such as tangible, locational knowledge as opposed to abstract skill acquisition?<p>- Can a certain smell be over-saturated with knowledge, such that it becomes less effective for knowledge reinforcement? If so, can the “saturation point” be predicted using measurable variables?<p>- Does this technique only work for many discrete pieces of knowledge, or does it also work for branches of knowledge? (in the example of the finance lecture, there might be 30 major discrete facts throughout the lecture, but they can be bucketed into three major concepts - it might only be practical to use three scents).<p>- Are more recent associations with a scent significantly more salient to the brain than older ones, or do we subconsciously cycle through the old associations with roughly equal weight?<p>- Can we synthesize related knowledge sets by broadcasting multiple scents simultaneously?<p>I am fascinated by the possibilities here. We are advanced primates after all. Our brains are “designed” for more basic things than most of what we do. Paradoxically, it seems possible to supercharge the abstract by engaging the primordial.

One, we do not sufficiently emphasize pandemics&#x2F;epidemics -- this is partly because these things have been fairly rare and rarely very bad, and we have a way of focusing on what we&#x27;re able to be aware of.  As a result we get very upset when rare, very noticeable events happen, but we don&#x27;t take notice of the risk of their happening when... they&#x27;re not happening.<p>Second, we do very much care about <i>intent<\/i>.  Nobody doubts that if Al-Qaeda had been able to steal and use nuclear weapons, they would have -- their intent was evil, and that meant they needed to be taken care of.  As long terrorists can only kill a few, we can ignore them, but given their intent is to kill many, we can&#x27;t ignore them entirely.  Regarding car crashes and other accidents, the rates of fatalities per-mile traveled and such have been going down, and can be expected to go down further as technology progresses -- and we do invest in improving technology to make our roads and cars safer.<p>Fatalities from terrorism and fatalities from traffic accidents are simply not comparable -- they&#x27;re apples and oranges.  Accident fatalities won&#x27;t spike, but terrorism fatalities are liable to spike intolerably at any moment.  The difference is intent: no one intends to make traffic accidents occur, but there are people who intend to kill many other people.  Perhaps in the long run both obey statistical distributions, just different ones, but for the human psyche, intent counts.<p>Perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t care about intent.  Or perhaps we should focus on limiting the capabilities of those with evil intent -- but this is not much different than saying we must continue to put effort into hunting terrorists.<p>Anyone making the traffic accident vs. terrorism comparison needs to acknowledge the intent distinction if they are to be taken seriously.  They almost never do though.<p>&gt; Also in 2011, some researchers figured out how to reengineer H5N1—avian influenza virus—to make it much scarier by causing five mutations at the same time that all together made the virus both easy to spread and quite lethal. These five mutations could all occur in nature, but it’d be unlikely in the same copy of the virus. I have no doubt that the media overstated the danger, but it’s still worth thinking about.<p>Is it possible to overstate the danger of engineered pathogens?  All that&#x27;s needed for that to lead to catastrophe, besides engineering, is <i>intent<\/i>, or accidental release.  Naturally occurring pathogens are acts of god.  Engineered pathogens are not -- their use against populations certainly isn&#x27;t, even if resulting from lab accidents.<p>If an engineered pathogen could kill millions, and all that&#x27;s missing is intent, then engineered pathogens are as problematic as nuclear weapons.  More problematic than nuclear weapons, in fact, because the technology needed to engineer pathogens is harder to control, easier to come by &#x2F; develop, etc.  The only mitigation is the -admittedly massive- risk to the user of having the pathogen hit them too.<p>Pathogen engineering comes with a number of advantages to developing and using them, and just one disadvantage:<p>- adv.: cheap, difficult to control against proliferation\n - adv.: plausible deniability, allowing anonymous use\n - disadv.: can boomerang on the user<p>The disadvantage is the strongest reason to believe that covid-19 wasn&#x27;t both, engineered <i>and<\/i> released with intent.  And if it was, it has boomeranged.<p>That one disadvantage can be negated with time by also developing vaccines and treatments ahead of use.  But that wouldn&#x27;t work for a state actor, as that would erase plausible deniability and thus invite counter-attacks if used.  Fortunately, developing vaccines and treatments gets costly enough to put it beyond a terrorist group&#x27;s means, but then, a suicidal terrorist might use it anyways.<p>But even if bioweapons are unlikely to be used with intent, doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t worth worrying about.  Lab accidents are a possibility, thus something to worry about.<p>Going back to the first point above, there really are many threats to worry about, and we can&#x27;t all worry equally about all of them.  This is why we have a national security apparatus: so we can focus sufficient resources on each threat.  Even if the national security apparatus here, in the U.S., had done everything right as to pandemics, they would have to have been doing it for many years.<p>One thing we can count on is the national security apparatus taking pandemics much more seriously going forwards, though that will be at the risk of preparing to fight yesterday&#x27;s war, ignoring the risk that tomorrow&#x27;s threat may look much different.  If that happens, it will be because humans have a hard time planning against the unknown or the unlikely.<p>Before 9&#x2F;11 there were people who thought that passenger airplane attacks were a threat, but those were not taken seriously.  We see this over and over.  I wouldn&#x27;t bet on anyone being particularly readier for the next big problem than we were in this case, in the case of Katrina, in the case of 9&#x2F;11, in 1918, in 1941, etc."],"time":["2020-03-29 23:05:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hmottestad"],"id":[22721327],"kids":[22721395,22721489,22722660],"parent":[22720852],"text":["Wouldn&#x27;t that make for a fun documentary in 30 years time. &quot;2020, the year when the CIA released a virus to ruin the Chinese economy and accidentally killed a third of Manhattan.&quot;"],"time":["2020-03-29 20:31:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["wiredfool"],"id":[22717672],"kids":[22717677],"parent":[22717426],"text":["Yes.
