I just did about seven weeks of interviewing in NYC for senior iOS roles, at both startups and big tech companies.<p>To be frank, it was a total shitshow. Especially on the startup side.<p>Here’s some of the bullshit I faced interviewing at early stage companies before accepting an offer literally 2.5x as high as the (multiple) offers that startups made.<p>1. Shitty equity: one startup wanted me to be engineer #7 and completely own the mobile app and strategy, which is the single point of interaction for their customers. They offered me 0.1% and spun some story about how much it would be worth when they were worth $800mm. Their last valuation was about $35mm. Even if their numbers were real, I’d still make more at a big tech company in equity alone. They also made it clear they wouldn’t budge.<p>2. Bad work&#x2F;life balance: the big tech company where I accepted apparently has no issue with people taking off whatever time they need (avg is about 25 days per year), working normal 40 hour weeks, and working from home if needed. By contrast, the startups felt way more restrictive here.<p>3. Terrible interview process: almost all these startups had pretty disorganized process. Worse: they did the standard whiteboard algorithms interviews, whereas multiple bigger tech companies had more iOS-specific interview loops. Even worse, the startups tended to have a <i>higher<\/i> bar for hiring than the bigger tech companies. This one is subjective and could be random or misperception on my part too.<p>4. Most infuriating of all, all of these startups (except coinbase) had a 60-90 day option exercise window for employees who left before a liquidity window. Let me be clear: fuck you if you think this is fair. IPO might be 7-10 years out and if I stay and add value for anything short of that, you’re going to ask me to take a huge risk to exercise my options (and pay the taxes) on your probably worthless stock, otherwise you’ll just keep it? Fuck you.<p>The entire thing left a bad taste in my mouth. It’s pretty clear that these founders and investors don’t give much of a fuck about their talent, and watching them get squeezed by big tech companies offering sky high comp fills me with glee.<p>Be a founder, investor, or big co employee. Fuck being an employee for a startup so they can bleed you dry."],"time":["2019-12-24 01:24:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["daveharig"],"id":[21888498],"kids":{},"parent":[21868022],"text":["Value is built, not bought.

So naturally if you consider lack of exercise as the natural state of humans, sure it will appear physical activity improve brain function."],"time":["2019-12-23 20:02:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vezycash"],"id":[21867073],"kids":[21869739],"parent":[21865579],"text":["If I understood the article properly, then:<p>PLAY - Playing a physical game like tag, catch, soccer, volley ball, hide and seek... provides both physical exercise and cognitive &#x2F; social stimulation because of group play&#x27;s dynamic nature.<p>This next bit might not be useful.

I like to think I&#x27;m fairly familiar with GPGPU, in that I have used OpenCL and CUDA for years, and even wrote my own optimising compiler that generates GPU code.  I even use ROCm every day on my home system.  Yet, I would be hard pressed to succinctly state what ROCm <i>is<\/i>.  The GitHub page states the following:<p>&gt; ROCm is designed to be a universal platform for gpu-accelerated computing. This modular design allows hardware vendors to build drivers that support the ROCm framework. ROCm is also designed to integrate multiple programming languages and makes it easy to add support for other languages.<p>Okay?  It then lists some other stuff:<p>&gt; • Drivers\n&gt; • Tools\n&gt; • Libraries\n&gt; • Source Code<p>The AMD GPU kernel driver, amdgpu, is upstreamed in Linux, so what exactly does ROCm contain?  The OpenCL ICD?  (I&#x27;m pretty sure it does.)  As far as I can see, I don&#x27;t have any ROCm-specific kernel drivers loaded, but OpenCL on my AMD GPU works fine.<p>The tools are also confusing.  There&#x27;s an &quot;HCC compiler&quot;, but are we even still supposed to use HCC?  As I recall, it was&#x2F;is some heterogeneous compute C++ dialect.  There&#x27;s also HIP, which converts CUDA to something that can run on AMD GPUs.  Trying to refresh my memory, I actually can&#x27;t figure out in two minutes what language the output is.  HCC?  OpenCL?<p>Among the other tools, there is inconsistency between ROCM and ROCm (pedantry, I know, I assume it&#x27;s the same), but there is also the &quot;ROC Profiler&quot; and &quot;ROCr Debug Agent&quot;.  Are &quot;ROC&quot; and &quot;ROCr&quot; significant terms?

Their hardware is good and their fully open source drivers are a wonderful accomplishment.  Seriously, I want to underline just how amazed I am that I have a fully free high-performance GPGPU stack running.  However, if you compare AMDs software efforts to NVIDIA, it is clear that NVIDIA deserves their success.

It’s all too easy to design a system where latency wasn’t a primary consideration from day 1 and to have a very hard time improving latency after the fact.)"],"time":["2019-12-23 12:37:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["acdha"],"id":[21863704],"kids":{},"parent":[21862087],"text":["If anyone else is curious about measuring things like this, try the <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isitsnappy.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isitsnappy.com&#x2F;<\/a> app on a modern phone.<p>It’s real nice to have some competition for macOS on this front — and especially when it moves out of terminals into related tools like editors (VSCode was close to Terminal.app the last time I measured while e.g. Atom was fully an order of magnitude worse).

There was no mistake, Dudley Bose was looking right at it when it happened. He blinked in surprise, drawing back from the eyepiece. “That’s not right,” he muttered.<p>He shivered slightly in reaction to the cold air around him, slapping gloved hands against his arms. His wife, Wendy, had insisted he wrap up well against the night, and he’d dutifully left the house in a thick woollen coat and sturdy hiking trousers. But as always when the sun fell below Gralmond’s horizon, any warmth contained in the planet’s thinner-than-average atmosphere evaporated away almost immediately. With the telescope housing open to the elements at two o’clock in the morning, the temperature had dropped enough to turn his every breath into a streamer of grey mist.<p>Dudley shook the fatigue from his head, and leaned back in to the eyepiece. The star field pattern was the same, there had been no slippage in the telescope’s alignment, but Dyson Alpha was still missing. “It couldn’t be that fast,” he said.<p>He’d been observing the Dyson Pair for fourteen months now, searching for the first clues of the envelopment which would so dramatically change the emission spectrum. So far there had been no change to the tiny yellow speck of light one thousand two hundred and forty light-years away from Gralmond which was Dyson Alpha.<p>He’d known there would be a change; it was the astronomy department at Oxford University back on Earth that had first noticed the anomaly during a routine sky scan back in 2170, two hundred and ten years ago. Since the previous scan twenty years earlier, two stars, a K-type and an M-type three light-years apart, had changed their emission spectrum completely to non-visible infra red. For a few brief months the discovery had caused some excited debate among the remnants of the astronomy fraternity about how they could decay into red giants so quickly, and the extraordinary coincidence of two stellar neighbours doing it simultaneously. Then a newly settled planet fifty light-years farther out from Earth reported that the pair were still visible in their original spectrum. Working back across the distance, checking the spectrum at various distances from Earth allowed astronomers to work out that the change to both stars had actually taken place over a period of approximately seven or eight years and was simultaneous. Given that speed, the nature of the change ceased to become a question of astronomy; stars of that nature took a great deal longer to transform themselves into red giants.&quot;<p>-- Peter F.

The primary benefit of such solutions is that if you have a Go service where you want to rely on the local caching of data, using a package like this can <i>significantly<\/i> reduce GC scan pressure removing the work that Go needs to do when analyzing pointer data sitting on the heap.<p>Why does this help? Instead of keeping millions upon millions of items alive on the heap (leading to Go having to scan all such data) you can instead serialize&#x2F;deserialize the data in a solution like this with usually minimal overhead. Storing your cached data in a solution like this suddenly gets rid of the need to have live pointers of data on the heap. This is because your data is now stored as []byte slice somewhere in the Cache data structure that this code uses. Finally, since packages like BigCache&#x2F;Freecache are built with only a very small handful of heap objects the Go runtime performance can now go back to what it does best which is spending most of its time in your application logic.<p>If anyone has any doubts of this approach try it out...we saw dramatic differences with using a package like this vs a naive map of pointer based data or vs something like Hashicorps LRU datastructure.<p>The last service we applied this model changed CPU profile from running at around 900% to 400%.

Unless you were a monarch or a very wealthy aristocrat, the amount of schooling that children across the world receive today is entirely unprecedented. Using US children as an example, look back 100 years ago from now. Only about 60% of US children were enrolled in school, the number of days in a median school year was about 120 (as opposed to 180), and the median 25 year old only completed 8.2 years of schooling (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nces.ed.gov&#x2F;pubs93&#x2F;93442.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nces.ed.gov&#x2F;pubs93&#x2F;93442.pdf<\/a>).<p>With that in mind, take a look at this list.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Education_Index\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Education_Index<\/a><p>In the US, the number of years spent in school on average is now 13.2. In 100 years, the number of school days has increased by (13.2 * 180) - (8.2 * 120) = 1392 days.<p>Now consider the life of a modern US child. It is already decided before they&#x27;re born that they will spend 9 hours a day (8 at school, 1 for HW), 5 days a week, for ~13 years of their youth in an office environment. In this office environment, children are expected to be quiet and stationary for the wide majority of that time. If a child disobeys, it will be recorded on several surveillance cameras, and the event will basically be remembered forever. Despite being able to surveil every pupil, bullying is still somehow a commonplace event. For the bullied, they have no recourse because they are forced to interact with their bullies on a near-daily basis. How anyone can convince themselves that this is a natural environment for children is beyond me.<p>To be completely clear, I&#x27;m not saying I have an easy solution for this. This is simply the reality of competing in a highly technological, global economy. The need for menial labor is dropping everyday, and the demands of specialization are becoming increasingly stringent. But like a man eating tree bark in a famine, the necessity of the action doesn&#x27;t magically improve the circumstances. Whether anybody likes it or not, it is a hard fact that governments around the world are forcing children to grow up in environments where they can not move, can not talk, can not play, and must complete copious amounts of paperwork.<p>Schooling has become the elephant in the room for several modern dilemmas. On this site in particular, there have been numerous articles circulating about the depression epidemic, the loneliness epidemic, record-breaking virginity, record-breaking obesity, etc. etc. While unlikely to be sole cause for any of those issues, it is a blindingly obvious contributor. If I force a child to stay at a desk every morning until night for several years, it should come as no surprise when the child&#x27;s health and mental state starts to fail. Yet if I do that in the name of education, this is a surprising result?<p>This is an untouchable subject for politicians, except when arguing to _increase_ its size and scope. It is too easy for political opponents to smear such candidates as &quot;anti-education&quot;, and a large group of teachers &#x2F; school administrators consider such proposals to be an attack on their job security. Unlike other job sectors, these teachers &#x2F; school administrators have a regular captive audience of children for 8 straight hours. Even unintentionally, their political attitudes are bound to be reflected in their students. So, the attitudes continue, and the cycle stays unbroken.<p>To hazard a guess, I don&#x27;t think the end of this cycle is going to be an intentional political action. I think it is much more likely to be a collapse, based on the carelessness that this issue has been given up to now. Eventually, the constraints placed on children are going to become unbearable, and the rewards at the end of the pipeline will become too meager. If this happens, there will a large number of people in a single generation going insane en masse. Unfortunately, that would probably collapse more than just the school system."],"time":["2019-12-23 21:31:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["42droids"],"id":[21861949],"kids":{},"parent":[21860951],"text":["Do we have resources on alternative school systems?

Basically the Chinese or the French (i.e. Airbus) come in and offer you a satellite that ranges between 180M-380M USD in price depending on what you want. The price includes a building with a ground station, the launch, and some basic training. If you negotiate correctly, the full telemetry is send only to you and you process it all locally. If you don’t, then they have a hook on you and hand hold you through the entire process - at an additional cost.<p>Additionally, after a country purchases one, they tend to have their own development path for the future ones.<p>For example, the Argentinians did their first four satellites with the help of the US (SAC-A, SAC-B, SAC-C, SAC-D), the next two were done by themselves (ARSAT-1, ARSAT-2), two more with the Italians (SAOCOM-A, SAOCOM-B) and one with the Brazilians (SABIA-MAR).<p>It is a process filled with a lot of politics, questionable monetary interests, and pseudo national pride.<p>It is the new shortcut process by which countries are entering the space era.

Here&#x27;s a relevant excerpt:<p>&quot;R.A. Montgomery’s CYOA book House of Danger can be used as a model for our analysis. Categorized at a 5th grade reading level by Chooseco, the book is placed into Sutton-Smith’s age of hero adventures but not all of the 20 different endings will result in a “happily ever after” (in fact, 10 are positive, 7 negative, and 3  inconclusive). As all CYOA books begin, it warns that “You and YOU ALONE are in charge of what happens in this story”. It goes on to say:<p>The adventures you take are a result of your choice. You are responsible because you choose! After you make your choice, follow the instructions to see what happens to you next. Think carefully before you make a move. One mistake could be your last...or it might lead you out of the House of Danger.<p>A “Danger Trivia Quiz” at the end of the book asks, “How many adventures did you take through the House of Danger? If you can’t solve this trivia quiz, perhaps you should take a few more” inferring that the reader has the agency to choose multiple versions of the story rather than settling for the original path.<p>In House of Danger “you” are an amateur detective who receives a peculiar phone call asking for help that leads you to a mysterious house next to a ruin of a prison destroyed by fire over 100 years before. Whether the caller is a ghost or a professor depends upon the path you choose. Multiple paths involve real or imagined attack chimpanzees, counterfeiters, and alien worlds. The reader is in charge.<p>Wolfgang Iser, in his book The Act of Reading, argues that the reader is integral in the creation of the world that the author lays out:<p>This ‘transfer’ of text to reader is often regarded as being brought about solely by the text. Any successful transfer however -- though initiated by the text -- depends on the extent to which this text can activate the individual reader’s faculties of perceiving and processing. Although the text may well incorporate the social norms and values of its possible readers, its function is not merely to present such data, but, in fact, to use them in order to secure its uptake. In other words it offers guidance as to what is to be produced, and therefore cannot itself be the product.<p>While Iser was not specifically speaking of the reader’s experience with a CYOA book, it seems clear that the ‘product’ of the world created in a CYOA book requires the reader’s participation even more so as there is not a single product for the reader to ‘take up’. She must choose the product in cooperation with the author. In the case of House of Danger, the reader may choose a path to an ending that involved just 3 choices and a total of 10 pages read (which ends inconclusively with the mystery unsolved thus likely enticing the reader to retrace her steps and begin again) or a path of 7 choices and 16 total pages read (that path ends in success with the counterfeiters caught. With half the endings being negative or inconclusive, it is likely that the reader will accept the invitation to keep trying other paths to get to the “happily ever after” that Sutton-Smith says this age group is seeking.<p>Kelly Angileri, in her article “Choose-Your-Own-Readers-Response-Adventure: Decoding Children’s Literature and Coloring Books”, analyzed CYOA books in light of three different reader response theorists, including Iser. “This type of book fits in perfectly with Iser’s idea in which the reader formulates the unformulated. It is like a do-it-yourself story-kit or ‘salad bar story’”. That is, a diner builds his salad by combining the ingredients offered, just as the reader builds the world of a CYOA book through the ingredients offered by the author. Montgomery, in House of Danger, offers a menu of worlds: dilapidated prison, modern house, laboratory, alien space ship, alien planet, dark basement, zoo, and quiet street. He also offers different “rulers” for those worlds including: professors, criminals, police, ghosts, aliens, detectives, wardens, guards, and intelligent chimpanzees. It is up to the reader to create the “world” salad from the ingredients Montgomery offers.<p>Although R. A. Montgomery passed away in 2014, his wife, Shannon Gilligan, has continued their business as both an author and publisher of Chooseco, the Choose Your Own Adventure publishing company they started in 2006 after purchasing the rights to the series which was published earlier by Bantam Books.<p>“Agency is central to it,” Gilligan says of the reader’s involvement in their CYOA books, “‘You’ are the person making the choices.” She notes that Montgomery did not want there to be a premium placed on some choices over others. “Ray did not want choices that were the ‘good’ choices to end up with good endings or ‘bad’ with bad endings. That is not the way the world works. He wanted to give kids the sense of the complexity of life.”<p>Gilligan says Montgomery began his stories by mapping out the pathways of all possible choices with page numbers, then he would write the story to fit that pattern. Each story had a unique set of patterns, although they had some parameters like fitting the whole book within 95-105 pages and not reaching an ending too soon (in shorter than three choices). “Ray would draw a map and he would stick to it,” Gilligan says. In recent years, they have added the story map to the back of their books to allow readers to visualize the possibilities. Their maps are modeled on the iconic 1970’s map of the New York City Subways...<p>However, Pfahl disagrees with Landow in this:<p>By limiting the number of choices the reader can make, the Choose Your Own Adventure authors would seem to better “empower” the reader, by Landow’s logic. However, it seems instead that the more that the author influences that choice, the more clear it is that the reader lacks agency. Furthermore, simply making a choice does not give a reader authorial control over a text… the simplified example of the Choose Your Own Adventure books shows that choices do not give the reader agency – since the author provides both the options and the results of them.<p>Although Pfahl sees the path options available through a CYOA book as a lack of reader agency, Espen J. Aarseth agrees with Landow and argues that the paths and options elevate the reader in a cybertext such as this {Aarseth defines cybertexts as “texts that involve calculation in their production of scriptons(the string paths)”}to the level of a “player” in the narrative. Aarseth says:<p>The cybertext reader, on the other hand {as opposed to the reader of a linear narrative}, is not safe, and therefore, \nit can be argued, she is not a reader. The cybertext puts \nthe would-be reader at risk: the risk of rejection. The \neffort and energy demanded by the cybertext of its reader\nraise the stakes of interpretation to those of intervention\n...a struggle not merely for interpretive insight but for Narrative control; “I want this text to tell my story; the\nStory that could not be without me.”<p>Since the reader is making the decisions AND taking the risks that arise from those choices (in House of Danger, some choices could lead to you being vaporized, eaten by aliens, killed by chimpanzees or stranded on an alien world), Aarseth allows that the role, while not at the level of the author, is greater than that of a reader just entering the author’s world. This active participation seems to call for an intermediary term between reader and author.&quot;<p>If anyone is interested in reading further, email me at StorysquadHQ[at]gmail.com and I&#x27;ll share the rest.

Everyone else was in full uniform. The class was taught by a Marine Officer.<p>As a business student, I realized how similar the military and business can be. Most of the theory of leadership and management aims to address a fundamental goal: how do you get people to do something they may not necessarily want to do. Whether that’s making widgets or killing someone, the underlying theories are quite similar.<p>The main difference I noticed between the two fields was the military’s emphasis on trust. You were to respect a chain of command because you could trust your commanding officer. You were expected to perform your best because you could trust your teammates to do the same. The reason soldiers could rely on this trust was because their superiors had gone through the bullshit and could manage from a seat of positional and experiential authority.<p>In the business world, they taught management as if having positional authority would automatically create trust and inspire subordinates. MBA students graduate and come into supervisory roles without any prior experience in the underlying work and get mixed results. Part of me wonders whether this is due to ineptitude or simply inexperience.<p>I remember finishing that course and thinking I really should study engineering because I knew that wanted to play a role in managing and leading technical teams working on innovative problems.<p>Fast forward a few years and I left my role in public accounting to go into industry, but instead of going into finance or internal accounting I chose to learn development and spend a few years experiencing what it’s like to be a developer, so that one day when I’m managing a technical team I can actually know when they’re giving me a legitimate justification for something, and when they’re just bullshitting me.<p>Having been a developer for a couple years now, I don’t know how I could have managed a technical team without this experience. I think back to my “career plan” before I took that class and remember thinking that I’d not only be able to find a managerial position upon graduation, but that I’d be able to lead effectively as a 22 year old. What a foolish 20 year old I was!<p>Anyway, this is really just a roundabout way of saying I loved my class and have tremendous respect for military leadership.

If you have ever experienced a migraine, you likely share my frustration. It is about as indescribable an affliction as anything can be. The overwhelming and crippling pain is something hard to convey to someone who hasn’t experienced it first hand. It also seems that everyone experiences them slightly differently.<p>I typically get an aura that starts at about the 4 o’clock direction just outside the center of my right eye. The aura eventually expands and sometimes will end up obscuring 85-90 percent of my field of vision. It will also sometimes end up obscuring vision in both eyes.<p>In addition to the aura, I typically start feeling a bit of an upset stomach. Not nausea but rather a gas-like -- almost butterfly-in-stomach type feeling most closely associated with anxiety. Hard to say if it’s related to the migraines in that it’s a precursor or adjacent issue or it’s due to the anxiety of an anticipated migraine.<p>The aura lasts for 10-20 minutes usually then quickly dissipates. Over the next half hour to hour, the pain will gradually start to creep in behind my right eye. The pain steadily increases over the next several hours eventually becoming incapacitating. I try to take 2 fioricet (the only medication outside of opiates that I’ve found to be effective) as soon as I confirm the aura is real and not just a bit of blurry vision (this is in itself quite an issue as it can be hard to tell sometimes and I wonder if I’ve triggered migraines by working myself into a tizzy out of fear of dealing with the pain). Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s always tricky with meds to tell if they are working because you don’t dare skip them to see lest you end up suffering for hours on end.<p>The pain feels like it starts at a point behind my right eye and travels straight back into my brain in a sort of football shape. I try to find a quiet dark room and use an ice pack on my forehead and eyes. I usually have the tv or something on to try and distract, otherwise I just sit there thinking about how much pain I’m in. The hope is the fioricet etc helps with sleep which is really the best way to get through.<p>I was accepted into our states medical marijuana program for migraines and it has definitely seemed to reduce frequency. Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t help me at all once a migraine hits.<p>The migraine will typically last 8-12 hours or hopefully will be gone by the time I wake up if I’m able to fall asleep. However, for the following 1.5-2 days I’m extremely groggy and feel almost hungover without the usual hangover sickness. If I cough or strain in any way, I will feel pain in the football shape where the migraine pain was.

A couple of things spring to mind when reading this:<p>1. It&#x27;s trivially easy to write a communication service that end-to-end encrypts using modern libraries (in my case, Go). The encryption part took about a day to build, without me needing to understand any of the maths I was using. I haven&#x27;t had any penetration tests on it, yet, but I understand that Go&#x27;s encryption libraries are all tested and the implementation (plumbing them together) is pretty simple and hard to get wrong. So even if FB gives the security services some way of reading messages, then the bad people can have their own tool within a few days.<p>1b. There are other services, not as popular, that provide solid end-to-end encryption already (hello Keybase), that the bad people can use immediately. This is not about stopping the bad people from encrypting their messages, this is about getting access to what everyone else is saying.<p>2. It&#x27;s already practically infeasible for a communications company to implement end-to-end encryption without breaking existing laws (mostly about copyright).

Turns out they couldn&#x27;t, Tesla&#x27;s head start is real and consequential.<p>If you go out and actually try to put down $40-50k on a car and judge all EVs on a collection of attributes (range, efficiency, safety, charging options, tech, etc) Tesla clearly stands out. It&#x27;s tough to convince yourself to put down a nearly-equivalent amount of hard-earned money for another brand, so it is no coincidence that they outsell other EVs by a very wide margin."],"time":["2019-12-23 19:08:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["slg"],"id":[21865642],"kids":[21865761,21865679,21865897,21865948,21865663,21866878],"parent":[21864826],"text":["Besides all the funding secured and pot jokes, can anyone explain what has happened to this stock recently?

As compared to the few who could afford the luxury of the concert hall or wait for the radio to play such music.<p>- Secondly, the idea of the lone, genius composer is obsolete. Conservatory-style composition classes focus on teaching classical harmony at first, later expanding into modern concepts and compositional devices. This may seem to lead to the image of a Beethoven-esque composer, writing notes and conducting ensembles and orchestras, but the reality is that the composer of the 21st century is more of a collaborative structural-architect who grapples with technology as much as with harmony, melody and timbre: designing instructions and working closely with performers who provide, in turn, virtuosity.<p>I grew up listening primarily &quot;composed&quot; period music for ensembles and orchestras, and still have a great and profound love for it, but I have an increasing admiration for modern composers and musicians who have embraced all the aesthetics of their surroundings and the influences of their peers.

Next, providers are paid fee-for-service, so they want to bill as many services as possible and charge the highest rate for each one.

Steam, itself occurring over at least three stages, Newcomen (1712), Watt (1776), and high-pressure steam (1800).  Arguably also the Parsons steam turbine (1884), still a power mainstay.<p>3. Metallurgy, most especially iron and steel, with puddling (Henry Cort, 1784) and Bessemer (1856), though there&#x27;ve been major 20th century improvements.  Also aluminium smelting (Hall–Héroult process, 1886), and other strategic metals.<p>4. Coal-tar chemistry, giving rise to the first synthetic dyes and chemicals, 1840s.  Closely related, film and photographic techniques.<p>5. Electricity and electrical apparatus:  motors, dynamos, lights, phonographs, telegraphy, telephony, radio, speakers, lifts, electrified transport, and more.  Generally 1870s - 1890s.<p>6. Petroleum and internal combustion.  1859 - 1880s.  Self-contained liquid-fueled powerplants and transport with high power-to-weight ratios and rapid throttle response.<p>7. Petroleum-based chemistry, artificial fibres, explosives, and fertilisers.  I&#x27;ll add in viscose rayon (1889), though most of the synthetic plastics were created ~1920-1940.  Nitrogen chemistry gave rise to explosives, with natural gas as a feedstock, but also fertilisers.  Artificial rubber and tarmacadam pavements.  Other general chemistry might be included, covering organic (carbon-based), carbon allotrope (buckyballs, nanotubes), semiconductor, alloys, battery tech, continuing to present.<p>8. Electronics:  radio, television, vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits, and lasers.  These all involve channel creation, signal encoding and decoding, amplification, transmission, receivers, and encoding &#x2F; decoding.  1896 - 1960s.<p>9. Radioactivity and nuclear chemistry and reactions.  Applications in both power and informational domains (latter, especially:  medical and industrial imaging).  1890s - 1960s.<p>10. Quantum effects:  semiconductors, photovoltaics, and other materials&#x2F;electronics applications for the most part.  1905 - 1960s.<p>11. Genetics.  Most especially the structure, nature, and manipulation of DNA, RNA, and proteins.  1953 - present.<p>12. Specific vehicle design and control, most particularly of air- and space-craft.<p>13.

This reflected a deeply held, largely unexamined belief that capitalism and democracy are interlinked.<p>&gt; The Chinese government favours the doctrine of ‘cyber-sovereignty’, in which countries have control over their own versions of the internet. Kai Strittmatter was for many years the Beijing correspondent for the Süddeutsche Zeitung, and his excellent &quot;We Have Been Harmonised&quot; is an eye-opening account of this issue. (‘Harmonised’ is a euphemism for ‘censored’.)<p>&gt; &gt; The days when the party eyed the internet with fear and anxiety are long gone. The regime has not only lost its fear; it has learned to love new technologies. The CCP believes it can use big data and artificial intelligence to create steering mechanisms that will catapult its economy into the future and make its apparatus crisis-proof. At the same time, it intends to create the most perfect surveillance state the world has ever seen.<p>&gt; In 2013, an amazing paper from the highest reaches of the CCP, catchily known as ‘Document Number Nine’, or ‘Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere’, came to light. (The journalist who leaked it, Gao Yu, was sentenced to seven years in prison and is currently under house arrest.) Document Number Nine warned of ‘the following false ideological trends, positions and activities’: ‘promoting Western constitutional democracy’; ‘promoting “universal values”’; ‘promoting civil society’; ‘promoting neoliberalism’; ‘promoting the West’s idea of journalism, challenging China’s principle that the media and publishing system should be subject to party discipline’; ‘promoting historical nihilism’ (which means contradicting the party’s view of history); ‘questioning Reform and Opening and the socialist nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics’. The paper, which is cogent and clear, takes direct aim at the core values of Western democracy, and explicitly identifies them as the enemies of the party.1 It sees the internet as a crucial forum for defeating these enemies. The conclusion speaks of the need to ‘conscientiously strengthen management of the ideological battlefield’, and especially to ‘strengthen guidance of public opinion on the internet’ and ‘purify the environment of public opinion on the internet’.<p>&gt; Document Number Nine is thought to have been either directly written by, or under the auspices of, President Xi Jinping. It marked a new turn in the history of China, and quite possibly the history of the world: the moment at which a powerful nation-state looked at the entire internet’s direction of travel – towards openness, interconnection, globalisation, the free flow of information – and decided to reverse it."],"time":["2019-12-23 22:01:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["1996"],"id":[21866529],"kids":[21866662],"parent":[21855136],"text":["TLDR: statistics only offer summaries, hiding things that may be very important.

There&#x27;s a vast difference between someone starting to use these devices now and someone who started 10 years ago who slowly adds to their repertoire of knowledge.<p>This, I think, is why I personally find Android devices so incredibly hard to use. I don&#x27;t have 5-10 years of built up knowledge on how to use them and they seem utterly unintuitive to me. I also think the multiple hardware buttons were a huge mistake.<p>I really do think though that Apple has really suffered without having Steve Jobs to say &quot;no&quot; to Johnny Ive as a lot of the bad ideas of the last 5-8 years I don&#x27;t think ever would&#x27;ve gotten passed Steve Jobs and seem to have the user less in mind and seem solely aimed at increasing ASP (average selling price) of various product lines. Examples:<p>- Force Touch. This added weight and cost to devices for a feature that had no discoverability and was used inconsistently by developers. This from a company that for decades eschewed a second mouse button for lack of discoverability. I honestly think this never would&#x27;ve gotten passed Steve.<p>- The 12&quot; Macbook with _one_ port. So began the dongle blues. This was a terrible design that was an ode to thinness that had Johnny Ive&#x27;s fingerprints all over it. Compare it to the 2011-2015 era Macbook Air, which was a fantastic device and a nice compromise between price, weight and power. The 12&quot; Macbook shows what happens when you solely optimize for one metric: thinness. And it wasn&#x27;t good.<p>- The 2015+ butterly keyboard. Absolutely terrible. A rare reversal by Apple to ditch it in the 16&quot; MBP.<p>- The Touch Bar. A great example of a solution looking for a problem. Again, the motivation seemed to be to drive up MBP ASPs.<p>- Face ID. This one actually works OKish on a phone but is awful on an iPad. It&#x27;s also an accessibility nightmare as anyone who is visually impaired has to move the phone further away to get the right field of view for Face ID to work. What I&#x27;d give for Touch ID back. Also the false negative rate on Face ID is really high.<p>This one is motivated by making the full front face of the phone a screen by getting rid of the home button. I&#x27;d really like a fingerprint sensor on the back (like a Galaxy S9 I tried to use for 5 months had). Apple claims the false positive rate was too high,. I call bollocks on that. And that should be my choice.<p>But getting rid of the (great) home button now creates a UX problem. How do you get to the home screen? Well, you swipe up of course. But wait, which direction you swipe from depends on the orientation of the app you&#x27;re using, which isn&#x27;t always clear. Some apps auto-rotate orientation and some don&#x27;t. You know what always worked? Pressing Home.<p>- USB-C. Not only was this a loss of MagSafe (&#x2F;cry) but we moved from a world of where if the plug fits, it works to a world where every plug fits and nothing works because it&#x27;s now based on what the cable is designed to do and there&#x27;s no visibility to that. Some carry power, some don&#x27;t. Some carry data, some don&#x27;t. The amount of power or data they can carry can vary. Do they carry a video signal? Maybe. No cable can do everything.<p>- I think the current version of copy&#x2F;paste on iOS is decidedly worse than the original version, probably because the unintended gestures that now exist.<p>- The other day I couldn&#x27;t move a tab on Safari on an iPad without iOS thinking I wanted to split screen. I still don&#x27;t understand split screen gestures and the fact that I get this as unintended behaviour is an indictment of the implementation."],"time":["2019-12-23 02:16:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LemonAndroid"],"id":[21861283],"kids":{},"parent":[21858567],"text":["What about their password reset?<p>Does it take several weeks?

I would like to see what happens if it suddenly encounters wet surfaces (or ice).<p>edit: typos"],"time":["2019-12-22 11:53:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["grecy"],"id":[21856058],"kids":[21856250,21856140,21856867,21856061],"parent":[21854973],"text":["I genuinely hope Tesla get a 2020 Roadster to lap the Nurburgring on autopiliot with nobody inside.
