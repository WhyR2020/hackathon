[{"by":["aarkay"],"id":[24214804],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["The reasons company do end up with experiences like this is because they optimize for what they can measure and unfortunately user discontent with such experiences is often delayed or hard to measure.<p>Large companies which have a diverse user base in the hundreds of millions make decisions based on how a particular change affects the entire user population. The larger their user population, the more diverse their user base is and the harder it gets to cater to the needs of each type of user. The folks commenting here are a vocal minority, an important one given many people here are probably early adopters and also have the skills needed to build a Reddit competitor, but it&#x27;s hard to see the reactions of this minority on a dashboard. A problem worth solving IMO but non trivial.<p>Typically initiatives like this come from a team within the company who&#x27;s objective is to improve a key metric, in this case let&#x27;s say user engagement. Some individual in the team probably spotted the trend that users on the app are more engaged than users on mobile web browsers. They then launched an experiment to test getting users over to the mobile app. Many users who end up on reddit via SEO probably don&#x27;t know that reddit has an app and on seeing this end up downloading the app which makes them more engaged with reddit. Overall on the dashboard this shows up as a win where user engagement in the enabled group is up compared to the control and given that they give users an option to continue using the web app there is not a significant user drop. At this point, a decision needs to be made on whether to ship this change or not to ship. Folks making this decision do understand that it might be annoying to some people but the data in this case overwhelmingly supports a ship decision. They talk about it, mention their reservations, but eventually make a decision given the data and don&#x27;t think about it anymore. They also don&#x27;t have to feel the pain as most employees have the reddit app installed and don&#x27;t see this again and again.<p>The key thing to know here is that there are lots of incentives in the company to make this decision a ship decision vs a no-ship decision - the data, the success of the team, the success of the individual who pioneered this change but there is not enough evidence or visible push from users to not make this change. Let&#x27;s say there are some customer reports for this but unless they reach a very high volume no one is going to notice it.<p>Posts and discussions like this are actually a great way to get your word known to companies. This will probably stir a conversation in the team that made this change and hopefully bring out some change in the experience. Don&#x27;t expect it to go away but maybe they will remember your preference of not wanting to use the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 21:11:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RocketSyntax"],"id":[24215829],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Especially when you can redirect to apps or open apps with links"],"time":["2020-08-19 22:21:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HeavyStorm"],"id":[24211882],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I do like the app, but the prompts are completely abnoxious."],"time":["2020-08-19 18:02:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["samstave"],"id":[24210848],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I only exclusively use old.reddit.com in browser on mobile."],"time":["2020-08-19 16:41:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SeanBean62"],"id":[24209788],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I’m done with Reddit- please somehow keep this thing going"],"time":["2020-08-19 14:42:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["satisfaction"],"id":[24210243],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I still use old.reddit.com. new reddit is sooooooooo slow"],"time":["2020-08-19 15:41:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ptman"],"id":[24210030],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Lemmy is an interesting federated alternative to reddit."],"time":["2020-08-19 15:17:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["frozenlettuce"],"id":[24209776],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["The app interface is optimized to serve ads, not content"],"time":["2020-08-19 14:41:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ykevinator"],"id":[24209482],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["I think it&#x27;s because they want push notifications"],"time":["2020-08-19 13:55:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arkanciscan"],"id":[24212851],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Because we live in the worst possible timeline"],"time":["2020-08-19 19:10:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["knob"],"id":[24209289],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Try this: old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;$foo<p>A little bit cleaner."],"time":["2020-08-19 13:30:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["honksillet"],"id":[24214325],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["If you must use Reddit, use Alien Blue."],"time":["2020-08-19 20:40:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["otabdeveloper4"],"id":[24209684],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["To collect your data and show you ads."],"time":["2020-08-19 14:27:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WMCRUN"],"id":[24216324],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["While we’re at it, have you met Yelp?"],"time":["2020-08-19 22:56:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mottiden"],"id":[24209465],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["To sell you more targeted ads, sadly"],"time":["2020-08-19 13:53:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["negina"],"id":[24216346],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["To get your data through the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:58:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["michelb"],"id":[24211362],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Harder to block ads in the app."],"time":["2020-08-19 17:26:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["1024core"],"id":[24212337],"kids":{},"parent":[24208958],"text":["Reddit is busy building a Trumpian wall around itself.

Driving activities underground however, has well understood unintended consequences of causing violence and disregard of health rules, as we know from prohibition in the 20&#x27;s and the drug war since the 70&#x27;s.<p>The uniquely American issue, is with bars and clubs being closed. In the land of big houses, everyone knows someone with a bar in their backyard or basement. Keeping bars closed now, when everyone is fed up with the social isolation (sorry, Zoom doesn&#x27;t cut it) just means actual underground speakeasies serving alcohol aka house parties. Where dedicated gym rats <i>aren&#x27;t<\/i> drinking alcohol at the same time they&#x27;re at the gym (it hurts gainz), and are <i>can<\/i> be more responsible for their actions, people on alcohol <i>can&#x27;t<\/i>.

By making it required at bars, you get around some of the privacy issues since those that don&#x27;t want to, can just not go to bars. Using bluetooth-based tracing gets around issues of using GPS-based tracking, and also helps amplify the effectiveness of an under-funded contact tracing corps by providing a technology based solution.<p>This is imperfect, but perfect is the enemy of the good, and even done imperfectly, contact tracing can very successfully drive Re (the local effective value calculated from a diseases&#x27; R0) down below 1, at which point the disease doesn&#x27;t continue to spread and the pandemic can be controlled.

But has anyone considered whether stay-at-home orders have actually saved lives overall?<p>The UN estimated [0][1] that between 83 million and 132 million people will go hungry around the world because of anti-COVID measures.  Some of these people will die from starvation or malnutrition.  Some of them will die from other preventable health problems later in life.<p>According to the Stop TB Partnership, a three-month lockdown followed by a gradual return to normal over 10 months could result in an additional 6.3 million cases of tuberculosis and 1.4 million deaths between 2020 and 2025. [2][3]<p>It&#x27;s also plausible that lockdowns could lead to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths from each of HIV&#x2F;AIDS [4], malaria [5], and several other diseases, though I&#x27;m not as confident about these numbers.<p>I am sure someone will be tempted to respond with some variant on &quot;we could have avoided these deaths by tuning the stay-at-home restrictions more competently.&quot;  Of course, that&#x27;s true; but the point is that <i>we didn&#x27;t<\/i>.  We never do.  Historically, every society that has tried to eliminate &quot;non-essential&quot; jobs through central planning has eventually found that even when the planners operate with the very best of intentions, they still make mistakes.  Dealing with one problem causes a cascade of other subtle changes with real, harmful consequences, which are harder to mitigate when people aren&#x27;t allowed to freely choose how to spend their own resources.  Meanwhile, problems that are judged to be less important are forgotten, because planners can only focus on a limited number of tasks at one time.  Human societies are incredibly complex.  Trying to manage them from the top is like developing software using the waterfall model: it would work perfectly with perfect planning, but we all know how that works out in real life.<p>On a personal level: a relative passed away from cancer recently.  Cancer isn&#x27;t a good way to die at the best of times; and I&#x27;ll be honest, she almost certainly would not have survived even with better medical treatment.  But if hospitals hadn&#x27;t shut down &quot;elective&quot; and &quot;non-essential&quot; care, she could have gone through a lot less pain and suffering.  I am not trying to use this as a bludgeon – I understand there are also a lot of people who have suffered greatly from COVID, and of course, we should make policy based on what&#x27;s best for everyone rather than a small number of anecdotes.

The managers are the customers in this arrangement, and customers often want silly things, like your physical presence in the office, because perhaps that just makes them feel better, and it’s fine if some silly thing makes your customer feel better.<p>The broader issue he’s talking about is simply the inefficiency of large organisations. There are many things that start to become much less efficient the more you scale up the size of an organisation, including risk management. This is because the feedback loops between decision and outcome starts to get much longer, the causal relationship between decision and outcome starts to become much more blurry, the distance between decision maker and impacted user gets bigger, and management starts to be comprised of less leaders and more bureaucrats.<p>Not only is this unavoidable, but it’s a good thing. Large businesses benefit from the economies of scale, but smaller organisations get to compete with them, because smaller organisations have the potential to be orders of magnitude more efficient than large ones. It also creates market opportunities for other B2B companies to come along and address some of their efficiency issues. I’ve done lots of consulting and contractor work, and one of the primary factors that drives demand for my services is enterprise inefficiency. Even if you put aside any consideration for how slow they are to adapt to new technology, a lot of demand for my contracts has been driven by strict corporate salary bands.

But the public sector also already has mechanisms in place to regularly change it - regular board and city council meetings, specifically. And most organizations have a specific cadence on which they review and update their policies.<p>But the corporate world varies - sometimes the board sets policy, sometimes the execs, sometimes a compliance officer.

They then set policy to be sure that well-meaning people who don&#x27;t have visibility into those high-level concerns don&#x27;t just make up their own rules. Yes, it puts some pain on us workers.

There appears to be no leg resistance and&#x2F;or emphasis on leg training. I would be careful in how you present this in your messaging.<p>3. I would position this as an intro to working out and partner with someone (if you can) like AthleanX.com which is are science based &#x2F; physical trainer designed full body workouts.

Outcome 1 - they&#x27;ll play it for a while, feel good about themselves and stop, or they&#x27;ll maybe finish the full game experience, and stop. Outcome 2 is someone that really gets into this, sees some  transformation of their upper body and wants to move on to a &#x27;real full body workout&#x27; (which sorry this is not). That kind of partnership would be a win-win for both parties because it&#x27;s a bit tough to jump right into a typical full body workout (esp. the AltheanX stuff which is really aimed at elite athletes), and having something like this as any easy onboarding process could be pretty cool.

It looks kind of fun, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d believe people will pay $200 up front and then $120&#x2F;year to play this game. My big concern is that you&#x27;re not clear on where this falls between an exercise service and a fun video game.<p>* Multiplayer boxing is fun, but it&#x27;s not going to be that much different than wii boxing or whatever VR equivalents are out there now. It&#x27;s definitely not a noteworthy exercise tool.<p>* peloton sells a lifestyle w&#x2F; live classes. You&#x27;re selling a video game. I think it&#x27;s misleading yourselves to think about this as a subscription product because I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to do much in the way of interesting content over time. You&#x27;re much closer to ring fit adventure. Your main competitors, if released right now would be Fitness Boxing on the Switch and BoxVR. I don&#x27;t know these games, but they turned up on a quick google. Reading through some of the other comments of people who are optimistic about this concept, they don&#x27;t seem to know about these titles either, which is probably cause for concern.<p>* Making it a fantasy story based game is fun... but now you&#x27;re locking in your target market to people who like those kinds of things and decisively not doing an &quot;exercise&quot; or &quot;hardcore&quot; aesthetic. I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s not a big overlap with people who want to pay for an exercise service. Ring Fit adventure is kind of close to this and it sold 4 million units, so its not a BAD decision, but its a stark contrast to all of the value props that something like peloton pushes<p>* you say gesture recognition. I think a lot of people are expecting hand tracking and will be disappointed. I&#x27;m concerned you added spells because there&#x27;s just not enough variety on the punches.<p>* doesn&#x27;t look like you have any people with game dev experience on the team.<p>* kickboxing is a fun stretch goal but realistically I see nothing but difficulty in implementing that.<p>* I think it will be difficult to make a boxing game that people want to play every day for a long time. You said hundreds of enemies in your video. I think that&#x27;s highly unlikely to happen. That&#x27;s a huge huge challenge for any game dev shop. Judging from the clips, I don&#x27;t think you really know how the game works. That is, how the player chooses what actions to take, and what creates the difficulty. Off the top of my head, the ways you can make a boxing game are puzzles &#x2F; patterns (punch out), rhythm, ring fit-just-do-reps-and-follow-prompts style, and then something dynamic like wii boxing. Which of those can you choose and make a game that is compelling enough to play every day? Wii boxing sounds enticing but its really quite difficult to make a substantial game out of this.

The existence of a meaningful minimum wage implies that there are people in the society who desire to negotiate for lower compensation (because they are more motivated to get the job for whatever reason), but they are disallowed from doing so.  It might be our opinion that it is undignified or exploitative to work for a certain wage, but we should not have the right to bar others from doing so if they wish.<p>As individuals, we should demand the freedom to negotiate the terms of our employment without government influence, including wages, benefits, and even working conditions.  Using the government to coerce employers into giving greater compensation is appealing in the short term, but ultimately it disenfranchises others by blocking them out of jobs and results in long term economic stagnation.<p>Mandatory minimum wage significantly above the &quot;natural&quot; level dictated by prevailing economic conditions unquestionably causes harm, mostly to workers who, if they choose to continue to work for less money, are now doing so illegally.  Mostly they just don&#x27;t get work.  This is why politicians tend to let minimum wages lapse behind the market rate - economies work better without this restriction.

You cannot make a man worth a given amount by making it illegal for anyone to offer him anything less. You merely deprive him of the right to earn the amount that his abilities and situation would permit him to earn, while you deprive the community even of the moderate services that he is capable of rendering. In brief, for a low wage you substitute unemployment. You do harm all around, with no comparable compensation.<p>The only exception to this occurs when a group of workers is receiving a wage actually below its market worth. This is likely to happen only in rare and special circumstances or localities where competitive forces do not operate freely or adequately; but nearly all these special cases could be remedied just as effectively, more flexibly and with far less potential harm, by unionization.<p>It may be thought that if the law forces the payment of a higher wage in a given industry, that industry can then charge higher prices for its product, so that the burden of paying the higher wage is merely shifted to consumers. Such shifts, however, are not easily made, nor are the consequences of artificial wage-raising so easily escaped. A higher price for the product may not be possible: it may merely drive consumers to the equivalent imported products or to some substitute. Or, if consumers continue to buy the product of the industry in which wages have been raised, the higher price will cause them to buy less of it. While some workers in the industry may be benefited from the higher wage, therefore, others will be thrown out of employment altogether. On the other hand, if the price of the product is not raised, marginal producers in the industry will be driven out of business; so that reduced production and consequent unemployment will merely be brought about in another way.<p>When such consequences are pointed out, there are those who reply: “Very well; if it is true that the X industry cannot exist except by paying starvation wages, then it will be just as well if the minimum wage puts it out of existence altogether.” But this brave pronouncement overlooks the realities. It overlooks, first of all, that consumers will suffer the loss of that product. It forgets, in the second place, that it is merely condemning the people who worked in that industry to unemployment. And it ignores, finally, that bad as were the wages paid in the X industry, they were the best among all the alternatives that seemed open to the workers in that industry; otherwise the workers would have gone into another. If, therefore, the X industry is driven out of existence by a minimum wage law, then the workers previously employed in that industry will be forced to turn to alternative courses that seemed less attractive to them in the first place. Their competition for jobs will drive down the pay offered even in these alternative occupations.

The best profits, from the standpoint not only of industry but of labor, are not the lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to become employers or to provide more employment than before.&quot;<p>Henry Hazlitt “Economics in One Lesson.”<p>To those who are downvoting: There are no illegal people, there is no illegal two-party consensual trade."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:40:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["huntermeyer"],"id":[24218110],"kids":{},"parent":[24213325],"text":["Non-paywall link:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200819180537&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;schools-brief&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-harm-do-minimum-wages-do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200819180537&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econo...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-20 01:34:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dalbasal"],"id":[24221619],"kids":{},"parent":[24213325],"text":["There was a debate between the pro &amp; con side of minimum wages a few years back. The debaters are all pretty intelligent, intellectually honest and deep people... all things considered.<p>The debate was a spectacular failure, hinging on marginal interpretations of marginal datasets measuring marginal impacts. Most of the theoretical downsides end up below the noise threshold, in data.<p>The pro side took this as a win, disproving the orthodox economic position. The con side demanded a counter theory. Obviously, a $1,000ph minimum wage <i>would<\/i> increase unemployment. That&#x27;s hard to argue against. Why is a $14 minimum wage different? Where&#x27;s <i>your<\/i> theory. It&#x27;s not fair if you can debunk <i>my<\/i> theory, but don&#x27;t have a theory for me to debunk.<p>&quot;<i>Interesting. It works in practice, but does it work in theory?<\/i>&quot; to paraphrase a cliche from the late 40s.<p>It&#x27;s all a good reminder that economics is not a science. The gap between theory and practice can be vast, often is. Keynes (and most of his generation) was famously wrong about the future of working hours. Even so, the theories (income effect &amp; substitution effect) used to make this failed prediction were not discarded. Even today, college economists teach the theories and Keyne&#x27;s prediction. They find a way where the theories are still right, but &quot;below the noise threshold.&quot; IE, other factors just happened to be more important in this case.<p>I would also point out the the intellectual founders of modern, liberal free market theories (Hayek, Coase, Popper kinda) emphasized this. Economics is not a science.<p>There is no universally true answer to the question &quot;<i>increases unemployment among young and low-skilled workers?<\/i>&quot; There are theoretically true answer, but this may or may not be operative in practice. It&#x27;s also true that food availability increases reproduction rates. This doesn&#x27;t mean that adding more burger joints will increase the human population of Manhattan.<p>In Portugal, youth unemployment rates often tend to be high. If I were deciding for portugal, I&#x27;d be careful with my minimum wage policy. They are low in the UK. I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned about gradual increases if I were deciding for the UK.<p>There is another possible conclusion to the &quot;economics is not a science&quot; point which many economists concede. One most economists are uncomfortable with. Economists shouldn&#x27;t be the only word.<p>For example: ask low wage earners.

I&#x27;m inclined to say that for most cases, having the orchestrator push tasks out over HTTP is a better default, since you can simply load-balance those requests and horizontally scale your worker pool, and it&#x27;s easier to test a pipeline manually (e.g. for development environments) if the workers respond to simple HTTP requests, instead of having to provide a stub&#x2F;test implementation of the orchestrator.

Here is my investment thesis:<p>In a nutshell my belief is that Apple will have a few quarters of declining revenue and that is going to torpedo their market cap.<p>* Apple is 100% reliant on selling new hardware, whatever push into subscriptions they are trying to do is going to fail or take ages to catch on. The reason for this is that Apple sells primarily to consumers, so the subscription needs to be a consumer subscription. What could that be? $30 a month for Apple Music + Apple TV + Apple Fitness + Apple Photo Storage? I suppose this is possible but I don&#x27;t see people switching away from Netflix, HBO, or Spotify so easily. Spotify is likely the most at risk. This strategy is possible but I think the timeframe is going to take longer than people expect.<p>* We are close to reaching the end of phone innovation. The things on the horizon that could possibly drive continued revenue are: smaller iPhones, folding iPhones, planned obsolescence, and from the software side a merge of iOS&#x2F;iPad OS such that you can use your iPhone 15sMAX-SE with a USB-c monitor as your computer. This is possible but say in 2021 apple releases a 4&quot; folding to 8&quot; iPhone with USB-C out to an external monitor that would fly off the shelves. However that is basically the logical end-point of smartphones and after that Apple is going to have a hard time selling anything new until AR glasses arrive.<p>In a nutshell Apple needs a subscription model to sustain this valuation, and without obsolescence essentially being a forced subscription (you rent your 1000 iphone for 4 years and then chuck it as worthless) I&#x27;m not sure they will find success.<p>The planned obsolescence thing is a real revenue driver for Apple though and without some antitrust lawsuit maybe they can maintain that for a long time.

Many new bankers were giving people advice, the flight from the krone governing all transactions. &#x27;Meanwhile,&#x27; Frau Eisenmenger wrote, the large numbers of unemployed, their passions fermented by the Communists, are seething with discontent … a mob has attempted to set the Parliament building on fire. Mounted policemen were torn from their horses, which were slaughtered in the Ringstrasse and the warm bleeding flesh dragged away by the crowd … the rioters clamoured for bread and work … Side by side with unprecedented want among the bulk of the population, there is a striking display of luxury among those who are benefitting from the inflation.

Although the price of the dollar was a matter for almost universal discussion, it still appeared to most Germans that the dollar was going up, not that the mark was falling; that the price of food and clothing was being forcibly increased daily, not that the value of money was permanently sinking as the flood of paper marks diluted the purchasing power of the number already in circulation.”<p>[...]<p>“Erna von Pustau recalled the same trend in Hamburg, where &#x27;stock exchange&#x27; and &#x27;Jews&#x27; were ideas very much connected in the minds of the people, and where the circumstances of a situation which no one really understood made those who had lost their savings or their fortunes ready prey for anti-Semitic propaganda.

I could have retired on a cool $4.5 million had I invested $10,000.<p>The problem is, I had no disposable income at that time, having just graduated with about $25,000 in student loans.

What was it?<p>And when we answer that, we get to the $64,000 question, which is:<p>A) Is there any way to structure our economy so that the whole population could have $1000 to invest early on?

Those techniques protect against <i>malicious<\/i> WebAssembly binaries, which is of course important in the Web.<p>Here, we look at a different side of WebAssembly&#x27;s security story: What if the WebAssembly binary is <i>vulnerable<\/i> and gets fed malicious input? In this attacker model, we can at most do what the host environment allows us to do. But especially for large WebAssembly programs with lots of imports, or WebAssembly binaries for standalone VMs (outside of the browser, without a tried-and-tested sandbox), this can still be a lot of attacker capability! And when we look into the protections <i>inside<\/i> WebAssembly&#x27;s linear memory (not between linear memory and host memory), we find that there are very little. All linear memory is always writable, no stack canaries, no guard pages, no ASLR, no safe unlinking in smaller allocators etc. This is worrying as more code gets linked together into a single WebAssembly binary.<p>If you have any further questions, I am more than happy to answer, here and also via email.

I&#x27;ve been thinking about mind-mapping for decades.<p>My breaking point: I have DropBox folders for 1770 math papers, that I periodically read on computers and tablets. The significance of most of these papers is lost to me. I want to be able to browse this collection in a &quot;supermarket shelf&quot; topology. Most of creatitivity is not planned; planning tends to stifle creativity. Rather, a frenetic mind is fortunate enough, after months of fruitless wanderings, to encounter the right set of ideas in close enough proximity to notice. For example, a PCB protoboard has the correct 0.1&quot; spacing to guide a router jig for making a pasta guitar. Who knew?!<p>Ideally one traverses a private web site with links to every asset. The associations need to be both manual and automated, logical and accidental. For example, time of creation or visits is critical data for determining proximity. Looking at each PDF in plain text to attempt to infer proximity would be a great application of deep learning tools, leveraging existing proximities as training data.<p>On a larger scale I have repeatedly urged the American Mathemetical Society to open up its MathSciNet cash cow to be a premier playground for machine learning. Unlike computer science, mathematics does have a detailed index of all published research, through the efforts of many volunteer reviewers. However, math is crippled by many archaic beliefs: That ideas are organized by fields such as number theory, and there is a single global worldview specifying this organization. That the value of MathSciNet is its hand-curated organization. I believe that we&#x27;re crippling a generation of mathematical progress by not allowing mathematics to be at the forefront of mind mapping efforts, with many competing voices&#x2F;tools describing its organization and facilitating idea browsing. Autocomplete is still at the &quot;pager&quot; stage of development, with &quot;smart phones&quot; yet to come. We could all benefit from the cloud autocompleting each of our mind-maps. Mathematics is a relatively small, constrained domain where shared mind-mapping and autocomplete could first flourish.<p>I&#x27;ve separately used a text file as scratch paper many days for the last fifteen years, saving every file. I can retrieve much useful information through full text search. I am reminded however of Don Knuth&#x27;s adage &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil,&quot; and the smaller optimization problem of how to best organize physical receipts. Excessive organization is wasted effort and a form of neurosis. I scan lots of documents but not every receipt; they all go in boxes dated by quarter, vacuum packed after a year. When I really need a receipt I can find it, but the effort to file has been properly balanced with the effort to retrieve. Same with text files; full text search works. It would be a mistake for me to put more effort into the structure of these files. Rather, through scripts and AI tools, I can evolve an indexing exoskeleton around these existing unstructured raw materials.<p>I need mind-mapping to manage assets, not to create a private web site of my thoughts. And there cannot be a user&#x2F;programmer dichotomy; we each need to script additional associations into our mind maps. That belongs in exoskeleton, not cluttering up primary text."],"time":["2020-08-19 19:22:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["senectus1"],"id":[24207327],"kids":[24207340,24207596],"parent":[24206727],"text":["HN hug o death.<p>anyone got a link to what this &quot;obsidian&quot; is?"],"time":["2020-08-19 07:09:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["missedthecue"],"id":[24213137],"kids":[24214232,24214554,24213825,24213443,24215797,24215932,24216312,24217258,24220582,24214762,24214532,24215530,24217934,24214007,24214018,24234766,24214311,24216200,24214037,24220191,24214576,24218326,24214212,24214130,24213888,24214182,24214401,24213677],"parent":[24212628],"text":["These studies don&#x27;t really prove anything.<p>Common arguments in favor of these studies -<p><i>&quot;They prove people don&#x27;t quit work on UBI!&quot;<\/i><p>- No, they prove that people who are in a program that is very clearly temporary will not end their careers for a short pilot program.

This lasted for precisely one hour, after which everything came back online.<p>Didn&#x27;t take long to figure out that the sites had actually been online the whole time for everyone else; they were only inaccessible from my local network. At that point, I contacted my host, and they explained that the WordPress component of the Shortcuts app was, for some reason, bombarding the server with a whole lot of requests for files that didn’t exist. The server thought it was under attack and blocked my whole network. Then it got interesting: the guy said that the server was throwing 418s.<p>I thought he might be mistaken at first. I actually recognized 418, since I&#x27;ve known about the teapot thing for a little while.

It also requires you to be able to visualize shapes well, and to develop a good aesthetic sense. These things are for the most part nonverbal, and require a long time to master. When I&#x27;m drawing, I&#x27;m not really thinking as explicitly about what I&#x27;m trying to do as when I&#x27;m programming.

Someone who sits down at the piano occasionally would likely say that they find the instrument difficult, or that they&#x27;re &quot;no good at piano&quot;. The difference from my perspective is that culturally we tend to accept that most people can become reasonably proficient at the piano with practice (even without innate musical ability). Playing the piano is a mechanical process. You hit the right notes at the right times, and it works. The same people that accept the piano as something learnable often think drawing is something you have to be innately good at, and I don&#x27;t think this is true at all. Almost everyone has the necessary muscle control (if you&#x27;re using the right parts of your hand&#x2F;arm). If that weren&#x27;t the case, people would not be good at tracing over images and rendering them true to the original. Once you accept that fact, the other primary requirement is building up objects from primitives. You can render a human standing in almost any posture just using ovals, rectangles, trapezoids, etc. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that drawing is a learned skill, and almost anyone can draw whatever they want if they practice properly and consistently (focus on drawing ONE thing well before you move on to the next). It&#x27;s not magical, and it doesn&#x27;t require some innate talent to reach an acceptable level of competency.

Then you compose with a goal in mind and observe very open, patiently and detailed while you make suggestive visual marks such that some details will work together to form a whole unity, and the whole supports the natural detailed variety. Playfully arranging paths for the eye of the viewer, such that while it travels over the drawing the perception meeting the viewers inner mental model of the world triggers an emotional response. Each of these things can be trained, and even non gifted can achieve reasonable results. You can use simplest tools and as long as human brains do no change too much they can relate to drawings which are 2000 years old.<p>For coding you must know how a program statement works, how hardware and virtual resources are working and ideally have a systematic analytical approach to construct and to define, identify and resolve misbehaviors. Have a mental goal how all peaces should work together, how they form a rigid stable architecture of unity, while also allowing a variety in further desirable transformations. Envision all possible desirable state and machine changes during runtime and later system extension and avoiding unwanted ones. At this point it leaves the right&#x2F;wrong world view. Cutting an architecture out of the solution space of all possibilities, growing from bare bones, little peaces to a complete system. Each of these things can be trained, and even non gifted can achieve reasonable results.<p>While we can learn from good drawings it is not so easy to learn from good programming examples.<p>The problem with code is that while we are often working with same principles like imperative functions and stack machines since 50 years, the technical application environment is still constantly scaling up and while it is conceptually never new it keeps working only during short periods, so no long term solution are envisioned. Further more the result is not open to an easy perception or naive judgement (besides app rating maybe) and the result is often unlinked to the creator. An envisioned whole system is no longer needed as we have monopolized systems, wich updates we all follow frightened to &#x27;reduce&#x27; risk. Resources like memory are scaled up without limits, the number of programmers rises and we are told to work in teams achieving very well paid very mediocre short living results. So the art of coding is on decline and while the &#x27;management&#x27; of churning out buttons on &#x27;app&#x27; screens, pasting stuff and fiddling in frameworks called consulting is on the rise. In absolute numbers maybe good programming examples where never as easy accessible as today, but is often buried below all the noise and not very rewarded. Probably the result of the economical success of the applied art of coding.<p>So for an coding artist fiddling with a pencil and paper to make something out of nothing can be again very rewarding... or maybe fiddling with vi and compilers etc. :-D"],"time":["2020-08-20 10:27:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xomodo"],"id":[24209211],"kids":[24209672,24209652],"parent":[24186410],"text":["For accessing aws ec2 instances behind nat&#x2F;fw add this lines ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config:<p><pre><code>  Host i-* mi-*\n   ProxyCommand sh -c &quot;aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters &#x27;portNumber=%p&#x27;&quot;\n   UserKnownHostsFile &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null\n   StrictHostKeyChecking no\n   User ubuntu\n   LogLevel ERROR\n   DynamicForward 5060\n<\/code><\/pre>\nUsage: `ssh -i key.pem i-0xxxxxxxxxx`.

If you think tx A appeared before B, that&#x27;s not necessarily the order a particular miner saw them. The whole point of the mining is to agree on order.<p>2. That said, a minute or two difference is pretty universally visible, so it&#x27;s reasonable to ask to prioritize the first-seen transaction. However, from the user&#x27;s perspective, transaction is going to be confirmed within tens of minutes, or even an hour or two, so a shorter difference in time between your transaction and mine is no more important than ordinary variance in block times.<p>3. When the mempool is full, the entirely &quot;capitalistic&quot; relay logic exhibits some &quot;socialistic&quot; properties: a newly coming transaction has to cover for the lowest-paying transaction that is going to be kicked out. This is a necessary anti-DoS measure to prevent flooding the network cheaply with transactions that kick each other out and most of them end up non-mined with disproportionally low cost of mining the rest. In other words &quot;if you kick out a tx, you have to pay for it, because it was previously relayed&quot;. This means that later coming, higher-paying transactions can&#x27;t just take a seat paying marginally higher fee. That margin is going to continuously escalate as the mempool is being overloaded, better protecting transactions that were already relayed.<p>4. Finally, mining is very competitive. If you don&#x27;t prioritize by feerate, another miner will and their extra profit would allow for capturing higher percentage of the hashrate while growing difficulty makes it even more expensive for everyone else. Any sort of agreement that undermines everyone&#x27;s profits in the name of fairness requires (1) establishing a consensus in the first place, and (2) keeping it relatively static so random outsiders don&#x27;t undercut it. But then such organization can use its leverage against outsiders in order to do many more things: censor transactions and change rules. That&#x27;s why Bitcoin works the way it is: so anyone can join and mine without permission, funded by leftover profits, so no single miner (or group of miners) has no long-term leverage against everyone else."],"time":["2020-08-19 11:52:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ximonn"],"id":[24208393],"kids":[24209654,24208439],"parent":[24196031],"text":["It makes sense to offer a service for transactions which might not get included to offer a paid accelerator:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushtx.btc.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushtx.btc.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-19 10:37:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["londons_explore"],"id":[24219103],"kids":{},"parent":[24196031],"text":["I feel this paper doesn&#x27;t consider the possibility that adding or removing a few random transactions to the end of the block is a good way to get many more possible blocks to sha hash and maybe find a winning block..."],"time":["2020-08-20 03:57:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["noxer"],"id":[24213041],"kids":{},"parent":[24196031],"text":["Not a single word about how literally all these problems only exist because miners try to suck out as much money as they can.

At the 18-month and 3.5-year visits, toddlers took part in a computer task in which they were trained to search for a red apple amongst a varying number of either blue apples (easy search), or blue apples and red apple slices (difficult search). An eye tracker monitored their gaze and visually rewarded the child when they found the red apple, allowing them to perform the task even though they were too young to verbally describe what they were doing.<p>First off, this is brilliant use of eye tracking.  I could see eye tracking being so useful for learning, such as tracking attention, knowing when to need a break, etc.  Eye tracking is super useful in user testing - for example I was watching some user testing at a major corporation and we used eye tracking.  We instructed the user to minimize the app and then open it again, and we noticed that when it was in the systray, people really got confused.  It was really easy to see because we could see where their eyes were scanning.  Using eye tracking for people who can&#x27;t speak (for any reason, maybe physical or mental injury or disability, and here age &#x2F; language barrier) could be huge.<p>The attention differences are certainly interesting, although I wonder how much of it might be training to use touchscreens, or the idea of a screen that it might change at any time, without related motion.  This is completely unnatural, as you would normally think something will change when something walks over to it, or moves slightly.  Fixed objects tend to fade more into the background of our mental landscape, which is the basis of a lot of sleight of hand.  Like removing something when you can&#x27;t see it.  It&#x27;d be interesting to compare against something that doesn&#x27;t change when you interact with it, like television screens.  (is it the touch part, or the screen part?)<p>I also wonder how touchscreens are sometimes differently interpreted by animals, kind of like mirrors are.  For example, some cats seem to think that the little toy apps are under them, or inside of them, or are just generally confused.

Pharmas separate drug R&amp;D from manufacturing and sales.<p>2. R&amp;D companies submit proposals to the FDA for new drugs they want to develop. The FDA can also send out RFPs for drugs they&#x27;d like to prioritize.<p>3. The FDA chooses drugs based on likely public benefit, rather than the profitability-driven selection we have today.<p>4. The FDA _funds the R&amp;D_ for the drugs it chooses. This allows the R&amp;D company to operate with positive cash flow, separately from the eventual (possible) future income from manufacturing and sales. This is also the incentive for developing drugs that aren&#x27;t patentable, or which will be required only in small quantities.<p>5. When a drug is approved for release, the FDA will license one or more manufacturers to produce it, based on their quality, cost, and scale. This is why the Pharmas break into separate companies. Some may focus only on R&amp;D, some may focus only on manufacturing. Some manufacturers can focus on large-scale high volume production, while others can focus on small-scale production. This prevents the excuse for charging huge prices for rarely-needed drugs &quot;because the equipment needed would otherwise be producing much higher volume drugs at lower cost&quot;.<p>This arm of the FDA would be funded partly by the public, and partly by licensing fees. The math for insurance costs and premiums would change because retails prices for most drugs would drop. That would make insurance cheaper, and some of those savings would probably need to go towards a tax for the FDA&#x27;s R&amp;D funding.
