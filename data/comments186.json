N26 isn&#x27;t making any political statements. They&#x27;re just saying they don&#x27;t want to apply for a UK banking licence now that they can&#x27;t use an EU one.<p>The response &quot;they&#x27;re only doing this because they can&#x27;t make enough money in the UK&quot; seems kind of vacuous. Of course that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re doing it. The cost of requiring a UK licence outweighs the benefit of being there.<p>There seems to be some sort of desire to say &quot;Brexit didn&#x27;t cause this&quot;. It&#x27;s pretty clear it did because they could previously operate without a UK licence and now they can&#x27;t and it doesn&#x27;t cost low enough to be worth it for them. I don&#x27;t think it matters in the big scale since there&#x27;s Monzo and Starling, but having the EU fracture will be annoying since markets will fracture.<p>As for the criticisms of starting in the UK post the Brexit vote, I don&#x27;t understand if you guys have run businesses before, but you have to take risks. Things can change, and for the right growth opportunity you go for it.<p>As an example, post-GDPR I set up the European arm of our data business, and even though Brexit was on the horizon, we set up in London. Why? Because the opportunity was big enough and we could work our way to a solution in time that would meet what we needed and because (being entirely Anglophone) establishing a bridgehead in the UK made sense. It&#x27;s a successful business now and we have teams in mainland Europe now. It&#x27;s like running towards one of those closing doors so that you can slide under it like a hero.

Everyone calls contactless payments Apple Pay, which is technology other countries have had for many years built into the cards themselves via an NFC chip. Visa calls it PayWave(TM), because you just wave your credit card over the terminal to pay. I have been taking advantage of the benefits of contactless pay since 2011 with PayWave. Phones later came out with NFC support and now we can emulate this &quot;contactless&quot; signal with the phone&#x27;s NFC chip rather than those in credit cards. Other than the added security of making up a new card number for your particular credit card when you add it to your digital wallet (read: Google Pay or Apple Pay or Samsung Pay, etc.), and separate accounting, there&#x27;s no difference from contactless payments that have been around for OVER a decade now.<p>We talk about Apple Pay as if that&#x27;s the standard.

I have been using Python with scipy and more extensively with it&#x27;s sci-kit library since 2014. Started with it by solving discrete traveling sales man problem for solution of sitting arrangements and was astonished with its ease of use of matrix algebra with these libraries and got hooked to it. It helped me to do scientific computing and create a user friendly user interface on web to help end-user to just focus on siting arrangement and conference Organization. Can solve it with Matlab or GNU octave, but couldn’t have developed easily the whole system with user interface in them.<p>If Swift wanted to be used in scientific computing it needs to follow the similar policy of managing its scientific stack.<p>Julia is good for scientific computing, but it’s UI and web development libraries are isn’t that powerful.

This is relevant to the story because this employer:<p>1. was very lenient when it came to office attendance. So we frequently worked remotely in odd hours; that was normal. But as a matter of professionalism, I always tried to be conscientous when it came to the hours I put in. Most weeks I probably did more than usual, merits of which is another discussion entirely.<p>2. periodically organized events to promote the business. But being short on funds, they didn&#x27;t have money to hire an actual photographer. So they&#x27;d ask me to shoot because I was interested enough in photography to, at the very least, have the gear for it.<p>The day I became _that_ guy they had this event I&#x27;m supposed to shoot but they really communicated the time badly to me. I expected to be able to do at least three, maybe four, hours of work before I&#x27;m needed with my camera. This is what I communicated to my TL.<p>Turns out they needed me _earlier_, such that I only had an hour of work done so far. Again, office culture was lenient about such things so my TL didn&#x27;t really mind if I left then. The event was some kind of a big deal besides.<p>I&#x27;d generally start my &quot;hours&quot; in the afternoon, way after lunch. So by the time this event was done, it was already pretty late in the evening. I had my dinner and received a message from my TL. Nonverbatim:<p>&quot;Hey can you update PostgreSQL (9-&gt;10) tonight? It shouldn&#x27;t take too long and here&#x27;s the steps...&quot;<p>It was still in to my &quot;usual&quot; working hours but a couple of things that night made this request result to disaster:<p>1. I was tired from the event. Honest to goodness tired. I should&#x27;ve called it off when I couldn&#x27;t even entertain myself enough to stay awake waiting for one of the given steps to finish. But I didn&#x27;t because...<p>2. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to beg off on this task when I&#x27;ve only done one hour of technical&#x2F;engineering work for the day. To be fair, my TL always abided by the rule &quot;Don&#x27;t touch prod when tired; you will make things worse&quot;. Pretty sure he would&#x27;ve understood if I explained the state I was in. We could&#x27;ve done it the next night. But when you&#x27;re tired and embarassed at having only done one hour of work for the day so far your decision making is exceptionally unsound, for lack of a stronger adjective.<p>Unfortunately the technical bits of this story gets fuzzy; it&#x27;s been two years ago. But two years ago we have just migrated to Kubernetes and a couple of months in the team was still adjusting their mental models from servers to containers&#x2F;deployments&#x2F;statefulsets&#x2F;pods. From just thinking between HDD vs SSD tradeoffs to Persistent Volume architecture issues. This is also why upgrading Postgres was such an ad hoc process for us then. We simply didn&#x27;t know better (if something not &quot;ad hoc&quot; even exists).<p>Part of the instructions was to &quot;delete the old data directory of Postgres&quot; (cue: I have read this in a postmortem before...). Because I was tired and lazy I wrote a script so the update could go without my (much needed!) supervision. The instructions were sound and deletion would&#x27;ve been safe--assuming all the steps prior to the deletion finished successfully. It did not and I did not use `set -e`. Which meant I just deleted all the prod data in master. I was efficient. The realization woke me up harder than sugar ever did.<p>To cut this already long story short, I at least had the sense to concede at that point and wake up my TL with the bad news. Much like the rest of this story, what saved me that night came in twos:<p>1. I at least had the sense to put the site into maintenance mode.<p>2. I used `rm -rf`, as opposed to issuing DROP statements to psql. Which meant that my fuck-up did not replicate. So we just promoted the replica to master and downgraded the master to replica and monitored replication.<p>These two together ensured no data loss. Apocalypse canceled. Everyone in the company went to work in the morning none the wiser.<p>This story actually had a less fortunate sequel but that story is not for me to tell. And besides, I&#x27;ve written long enough."],"time":["2020-02-11 13:28:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["downerending"],"id":[22301261],"kids":{},"parent":[22296439],"text":["I&#x27;ve only made one technical screwup in my career, and a minor and fixable one at that, but it left a deep impression.<p>These days, when running as root, I concentrate hard on every command, asking myself whether this is really exactly the right thing in every respect.<p>When my hands start shaking, I know my mind is in the right place."],"time":["2020-02-11 19:43:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cstuder"],"id":[22296966],"kids":[22297183,22296988,22297064,22297027,22297001,22296990,22297044],"parent":[22296439],"text":["What does SEV stand for?"],"time":["2020-02-11 09:27:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["JshWright"],"id":[22298263],"kids":{},"parent":[22296439],"text":["Either my memory is much worse, or my level of screwing up must be much more impressive.

Think desktop support, but super extra. Think multiple serial single points of failure, on a one minute metronome. Here are some things I&#x27;ve screwed up.<p>---<p>A simple, early one: We used VNC for remote desktop support of line-side production computers. One of my team leads was walking me through what was on the screen and what was going on. I was used to right clicking on these screens to see more of what was going on, but this one happened to be running a script that was interrupted by this. When I right clicked, my team lead freaked out, and the operator on the floor freaked out, and started moving the mouse themselves and clicking everywhere. After a while they started just doing their job again, but shortly after we got a call from a supervisor.<p>---<p>I got a call saying tracking was off on a production conveyor. This means that operators were getting incorrect instructions and work was being recorded on incorrect units. I adjusted tracking to match what I was being told. All good.<p>I shortly got a call from the same conveyor saying tracking was off. I told them &quot;Yes, I just fixed it&quot;. &quot;Well it is wrong now, it was fine a minute ago&quot;. So I adjusted it to match what I was being told now. Who knows what that other guy was smoking.<p>Right as I finished re-adjusting tracking I got another frantic, high energy, expletive filled call saying the tracking was off.<p>Dear reader you may have guessed what was wrong.<p>Since I got multiple sets of contradictory information, I decide to go out to the floor. This is what I see (simplified):<p>Footprint 1,2,3,4, etc<p>FP1 FP2 FP3 FP4 FP5 FP6 FP7 FP8<p>008 007 006 ___ 005 004 003 002<p>You see, the first person was on the first half of the conveyor, and the second person was on the other half. They were both correct, but neither had the full story. There was an empty carrier in the middle of the conveyor.<p>---<p>Last one. One of our weekly ops tasks was to verify that the 3 (three!!) scheduling services agreed with one another and also the production schedule. Unfortunately sometimes we got late breaking schedule changes, like running extra time or extending or moving lunch. On a Friday night&#x2F;Saturday Morning, I got one such change. We were going to run an hour extra to make up for earlier lost units.<p>I made the requested change and went back to &quot;compiling code&quot; etc. (Perks of night shift)<p>Some time later... I get a call on one of my radios (Nextel) saying the lights were off in the back of the shop. I say, &quot;hmm, that&#x27;s odd&quot; and go to the screen to turn the lights on in that area. I get a call on my other radio, saying the lights were off in the middle of the shop. Oh sh*t. For context, the lights were now off for over 200 pissed off people who just wanted to finish their overnight shift and go home. I continue to press buttons to turn lights on, hindered by the fact that the lighting controllers were on a very very slow daisy chained serial bus. My radios continue to go off with people urgently and excitedly informing me that the [expletive deleted] lights were off. I also got a visit from the Plant Shift Lead (2 or 3 steps down from the plant manager). I was pretty surprised to see her, as I was kind of wedged in a corner with a bookcase blocking half of the entryway to my cubicle.<p>Anyway, I eventually got the lights turned back on. Looking at the schedule changelog, I had successfully extended the shift, but for the wrong day. I had done it for Saturday, as the clock was past midnight when I edited the schedule.

Yet, let’s speculate about what a “more physical” implementation of such a system could look like. We can imagine it as a grid of tiny independent computers, simulating individual cells. Each of those computers would require approximately 10Kb of ROM to store the “cell genome”: neural network weights and the control code, and about 256 bytes of RAM for the cell state and intermediate activations. The cells must be able to communicate their 16-value state vectors to neighbors. Each cell would also require an RGB-diode to display the color of the pixel it represents. A single cell update would require about 10k multiply-add operations and does not have to be synchronised across the grid. We propose that cells might wait for random time intervals between updates. The system described above is uniform and decentralised. Yet, our method provides a way to program it to reach the predefined global state, and recover this state in case of multi-element failures and restarts. We therefore conjecture this kind of modeling may be used for designing reliable, self-organising agents. On the more theoretical machine learning front, we show an instance of a decentralized model able to accomplish remarkably complex tasks. We believe this direction to be opposite to the more traditional global modeling used in the majority of contemporary work in the deep learning field, and we hope this work to be an inspiration to explore more decentralized learning modeling.<\/i><p>I&#x27;ve been hoping that someone would build the above computer for over 20 years. I used to just get laughed at, or people would mock me for not knowing what I&#x27;m talking about (even though I have a computer engineering degree). That transitioned to at least speculating on what I was saying, and will soon transition to being old hat. Oh well.<p>But I look at computers today with a billion transistors, running at the same 3 GHz as they did 20 years ago, and it breaks my heart. I imagine what might have been, if we had arrays of hundreds&#x2F;thousands of z80 or x86 or 68000 or DEC Alpha or MIPS chips to do whatever we wanted with. Imagine the emergent behavior that might have happened. Instead we&#x27;re locked into this proprietary&#x2F;narrow way of working with shaders and specialized neural computers doing SIMD and I just find it all so uninspiring.

In fact, exceptions are meant to be exceptional. Hence the name.<p>Exceptions are meant to be fast if and only if you do not throw any. And even this is only truly true on Unix.<p>The original implementation of exceptions on Windows put extra unrolling info on the stack and then cleaned it up at the end of the function, adding a runtime cost even when no exceptions were thrown.<p>The Unix way of exception handling does not put anything extra on the stack, so exceptions are free if you don&#x27;t throw any. The compiler puts some metadata into your binary and generates cleanup code. If an exception is thrown, the run-time (libstdc++ for gcc on Linux) will grab the return address from the stack and then do a binary search through the metadata to find the right unwinding code generated by the compiler. This is obviously a comparatively enormous overhead. In particular because the metadata are separated from the code, so the OS never has to read it from disk unless you actually throw an exception.<p>The reason for that is that you are not supposed to use exceptions for signaling. They are for error handling. Exceptions are for occasions like &quot;you asked for memory but there was none left&quot; or &quot;you asked for the 15th element in this vector but it only has 10&quot;. They are not meant for non-exceptional errors like &quot;you asked for data from the network but there is no data yet&quot; or &quot;you wanted me to check if the file exists and it does not&quot;.<p>The thinking behind all this is that the error handling path is not time critical. If it happens, something exceptional has happened, and the OS will probably have to swap in the error handling code from disk to begin with, which is horrendously slow. In fact, this is not just a possibility. The feature was designed specifically so that the linker would move the exception handling code to a different page and the OS would only read that page from disk if an exception actually occurs. This is not an accident. It is deliberate planning and took engineering effort to achieve.<p>Running a benchmark of throw vs return is an attempt to answer the wrong question.<p>Important side note: operator[] on a vector does not do range checking. at() does.

These are standard issues in intelligence analysis.<p>1. Duplicate confirmations. If you have two reports which agree, are they from different sources, or from the same source via different paths? If the latter, it&#x27;s not a confirmation.<p>2. The difference between noise and deception. Some information is noisy, and statistical methods for filtering may help extract signal from noise. Some information is deliberately deceptive, and noise filtering will not help. The average will still be biased.<p>We&#x27;ve reached the point in politics where you need to know this just to read news.<p>The paper does mention the strong human tendency (all the higher mammals, really) to see patterns in noise.  This is a useful survival instinct, in that fleeing before you&#x27;re certain there&#x27;s a threat is a benefit. It&#x27;s a big problem in complex situations. It&#x27;s also the basis of religion. There are so many classic examples of that in intelligence history. The paper mentions over-analysis of V-1 bomb targets, although I&#x27;m not sure that was a real thing at the level of people who had access to maps of the hit points. The inaccuracy of the thing was clear; &quot;Greater London&quot; was about as good as it could do. Air bases were never attacked; too small a target. If the V-1 had been accurate enough to hit air bases, it would have been used against them in the Battle of Britain.<p>There is, however, a classic example of that mistake. During the 1960 Cuban Missile Crisis, US analysis of aerial photos of the missile sites showed a layout more suitable to the Russian tundra than a tropical island. So there was a theory that the USSR now wanted the US to recognize them as missile sites, following a long period of deception as the equipment was moved into place. That was considered an open threat.<p>In 1987, there was a sort of Cuban Missile Crisis reunion, with people from both sides present. That subject came up. The officer who&#x27;d been in charge on the Soviet side said, &quot;No, we just did it that way because that was what the field manual said to do&quot;. Everyone on both sides who&#x27;d ever worn a uniform nodded in understanding."],"time":["2020-02-11 22:39:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jonahbenton"],"id":[22298866],"kids":{},"parent":[22298197],"text":["I have not seen this one (AUS-based) but can strongly recommend a similar piece from a US intel analyst pairing- Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence, by Katherine Hibbs Pherson and Randolph Pherson.

And then, when dbus-started is triggered, NetworkManager is started, since it may now use D-Bus, and so on.<p>One could say that this way the actual logical dependency tree that exists and is understood by the admin or developer is translated and encoded into event and action rules: every logical &quot;a needs b&quot; rule that the administrator&#x2F;developer is aware of becomes a &quot;start a when b is started&quot; plus &quot;stop a when b is stopped&quot;. In some way this certainly is a simplification: especially for the code in Upstart itself. However I would argue that this simplification is actually detrimental. First of all, the logical dependency system does not go away, the person who is writing Upstart files must now translate the dependencies manually into these event&#x2F;action rules (actually, two rules for each dependency). So, instead of letting the computer figure out what to do based on the dependencies, the user has to manually translate the dependencies into simple event&#x2F;action rules. Also, because the dependency information has never been encoded it is not available at runtime, effectively meaning that an administrator who tries to figure our why something happened, i.e. why a is started when b is started, has no chance of finding that out.<p>Furthermore, the event logic turns around all dependencies, from the feet onto their head. Instead of <i>minimizing<\/i> the amount of work (which is something that a good init system should focus on, as pointed out in the beginning of this blog story), it actually <i>maximizes<\/i> the amount of work to do during operations. Or in other words, instead of having a clear goal and only doing the things it really needs to do to reach the goal, it does one step, and then after finishing it, it does <i>all<\/i> steps that possibly could follow it.<p>Or to put it simpler: the fact that the user just started D-Bus is in no way an indication that NetworkManager should be started too (but this is what Upstart would do). It&#x27;s right the other way round: when the user asks for NetworkManager, that is definitely an indication that D-Bus should be started too (which is certainly what most users would expect, right?).<p>A good init system should start only what is needed, and that on-demand. Either lazily or parallelized and in advance. However it should not start more than necessary, particularly not everything installed that could use that service.<p>Finally, I fail to see the actual usefulness of the event logic. It appears to me that most events that are exposed in Upstart actually are not punctual in nature, but have duration: a service starts, is running, and stops. A device is plugged in, is available, and is plugged out again. A mount point is in the process of being mounted, is fully mounted, or is being unmounted. A power plug is plugged in, the system runs on AC, and the power plug is pulled. Only a minority of the events an init system or process supervisor should handle are actually punctual, most of them are tuples of start, condition, and stop. This information is again not available in Upstart, because it focuses in singular events, and ignores durable dependencies.<p>[…]<p>— <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;0pointer.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;projects&#x2F;systemd\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;0pointer.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;projects&#x2F;systemd<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-11 23:09:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rubiquity"],"id":[22305789],"kids":{},"parent":[22288526],"text":["Web servers are event-driven architecture.

As a software developer, I find the ability to take a cryptographically consistent closure of a program&#x27;s environment and deploy it in a reproducible way across your dev, loadtest and prod machines _the only reasonable way_ to do things. Not to mention that Nix community is very knowledgeable and open to patches and suggestions.<p>However after a brief investigation period I abandoned this idea altogether, here&#x27;s why.<p>In my opinion, Nix is only worth climbing its steep learning curve when you really utilize its &quot;reproducible environment&quot; concept. As a counterexample, take your home PC environment, which is 1) unique 2) quickly changing. You don&#x27;t need to reproduce it very often (how often do you upgrade your laptop?). You don&#x27;t really want a hash-perfect reproducibility there, and a simple Ansible script will work just fine. So, the target of Nix should be &quot;serious enterprise&quot;, where you deploy hundreds of machines, right?\nWell, &quot;serious enterprise&quot; where I am at (banking) will _never_ adopt Nix. There are two main reasons why:<p>1) NixOS doesn&#x27;t follow standard Linux filesystem hierarchy. They get around this by patching everything, both manually and automatically. nixpkgs repo contains thousands of patches. To put it in the perspective, OS is one of your trust anchors. I don&#x27;t want to sound as &quot;no one got fired for choosing IBM&quot; guy, but legal people will scream bloody murder if they see extensive level of patching going on in the distro, for a variety of reasons, not necessarily tied to security. Some of their patching goes very deeply, BTW, and straight up changes behavior of the software.<p>2) Secrets management: it doesn&#x27;t exist in Nix. nix store itself is world-readable. There are fundamental problems with some cryptographic algorithms that require entropy, and therefore go against &quot;reproducible environment&quot; concept.<p>YMMV, but for me Nix didn&#x27;t do the job, although I studied it deeply, and contributed some patches to nixpkgs. It looks like a futuristic research project.

With this system, important files, for example tool executables, would automatically be found and invoked without the need for adding a path to them.<p>d) runtime program dependencies should be provided via text file with parameters and not by environment variables. This text file would have to be specified each time a program runs, and the user could create specific scripts that run the program with specific parameters. Programs should have attached, in the same folder, the default parameters file. How&#x27;s that different from environment variables? well, with this system there is no system-wide dependency of a program to a unique string, and therefore the requirement to override environment variables for specific programs wouldn&#x27;t exist. I.e. programs shouldn&#x27;t need environments to run, but list of dependencies.<p>With the above solution, making repeatable and sharable development and test environments would be extremely easy: just copy the application folders and the configuration files one needs. If something is missing, copying it from another source would be the solution.<p>Ultimately, having a set of programs at hand and wanting to combine them to produce some output is exactly the same as having a bunch of functions in a program and invoking them in a specific order to get some result. And while in programming we have recognized the problem of global state and we have taken measurements to minimize the problem, for example with functional programming, we haven&#x27;t done so for programs.<p>In other words, the problem is that we are trying to compute things using global state, once more, this time at the operating system level!<p>For me, that&#x27;s the fundamental issue. All these tools are welcomed, but unless the fundamental problem is solved, no real progress shall be made and there is always going to be tool fragmentation (i.e. do we use Nix? Docker? Some other solution? etc)."],"time":["2020-02-11 12:38:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hardwaresofton"],"id":[22295637],"kids":[22297821],"parent":[22295102],"text":["I still don&#x27;t see the light.

General business lessons, to which companies generally don&#x27;t summarise or track them.<p>2. DevOps outage post-mortems, which competent companies generally have some sort of process around.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a rigorous post-mortem culture in tech outside of DevOps&#x2F;SRE.<p>I guess there are a few reasons. One is probably that the DevOps&#x2F;SRE space is very amenable to encoding lessons learned in scripts of various kinds, so it&#x27;s actually useful to do a post-mortem exercise because the outcomes are very small, very concrete and will be somewhat actionable. Things like &quot;errors in parsing this file shouldn&#x27;t cause the server to blow up&quot; are easily corrected and a process (unit test) put in place to formally encode that institutional knowledge.<p>In regular software development there&#x27;s way less reflection. This is partly because the tooling is much less home grown and malleable. Lessons <i>are<\/i> learned and they <i>are<\/i> encoded, but it happens slowly and through the mechanism of library and language design. It&#x27;s generally not something you do within a single company but rather, it&#x27;s an emergent consensus across the whole industry. Additionally, this is harder because lessons learned are often ambiguous or subjective. For instance I learned the lesson, many years ago, that dynamic typing leads to more mistakes than static typing. But you see many programmers still who prefer dynamically typed languages and dispute this sort of conclusion.<p>In the business world there&#x27;s virtually never any kind of &quot;lessons learned&quot; repository or process. At most you get something like a formalised interview process, but even then, those are usually baked into a company from day one or never adopted at all. I&#x27;ve heard of very few large companies that adopted a more rigorous approach to hiring than the one they previously used. It does happen but it&#x27;s rare.<p>At the executive&#x2F;CEO level lessons learned get recorded in the form of strategy talks given at fancy conferences, if at all. Often abstracted or vague to the point of uselessness, any insight that is present gets forgotten immediately by the audience who are mostly there because it&#x27;s easier than doing real work. These lessons learned are things like &quot;innovation is key to the customer experience&quot;, which is a genuine learning in a sense (usually from observing the wreckage of firms that went up against a competent tech company).
