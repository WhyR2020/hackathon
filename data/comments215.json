I mean, I&#x27;m not a doctor, so feel free to take that with a grain of salt, but he quite clearly had issues, and limited means to go see one. Anyway, he regularly used cannabis. Although he probably would describe his use of cannabis as recreational, I think for him, and for a lot of people who use it with undiagnosed health problems, cannabis &quot;feels good&quot; because it&#x27;s actually therapeutic.<p>I think something similar can be said for pets and animals in general. Some people have disabilities that prevent them from living their lives to the fullest. Some people have pretty severe anxiety around travel. And some people in those categories don&#x27;t even have diagnoses. All they know is their animals provide comfort.<p>Sure, if you&#x27;re someone with autism, bad social anxiety, or PTSD, it&#x27;s known that there can be a lot of safety inherent to a relationship with a creature who won&#x27;t judge you cruelly for being who you are. But on the less extreme side, some people are dealing with anxiety or depression driven by grief, shitty jobs, financial insecurity, or other issues, and having a loved pet close to you -- especially when you&#x27;re traveling, which sucks for a lot of people -- can make an enormous difference.<p>One thing that I see missing from discussion here is that airlines and businesses in general have a financial stake in limiting what&#x27;s required of them with regard to accessibility, and historically they&#x27;ve fought and continue to fight tooth and nail to reduce such requirements, and even when they lose, their actual implementation is often minimal and piss-poor. So I don&#x27;t think their &quot;wins&quot; are to be celebrated<p>Further, I&#x27;d argue that the headline itself is sensationalized: turkeys and possums on planes are red herrings, as are the anecdotes in the comments around &quot;so-and-so said they got their dog registered just so he could fly with her&quot;. Why did she want him to fly with her then? Sure, a passenger with a turkey or a possum might cost the airlines more money -- but to what extent is the average consumer even impacted by someone bringing a possum on the plane?<p>Finally, to the folks who suddenly care about animal welfare when we&#x27;re talking about folks with mental health related disabilities, you don&#x27;t <i>always<\/i> have to fly with animals in cargo.

If ideology becomes one&#x27;s identity, having impure thoughts is not thinking, it is a blow to your sense of self and therefore dangerous. In the political realm, it means that compromise simply isn&#x27;t possible in ways that it may have been 100 years ago. There&#x27;s no &quot;if we get this, you can get that&quot;, ideology doesn&#x27;t see differing people with differing interests, it sees you — sacred, you could never compromise yourself — and when it thinks about the obverse, it can only see an enemy.<p>Many willingly fit themselves into ideological categories that are quite narrow, and by &quot;identifying&quot; with these labels, they are depriving themselves of the contemplation and reflection befitting the question of a person&#x27;s identity. I wish for no one&#x27;s life to be easily summarized by the contortions of such machines, but many seem to welcome the labels. When you express concern publicly that politics has taken over people&#x27;s lives, this is fed into the machines that have taken over, and they churn out their answer: &quot;Everything is political.&quot; You might ask them if they have the causality reversed, but at that point you must wonder who, or what, you&#x27;re having the conversation with.<p>I&#x27;ve written about this before and I think this has been a long time coming by the way, starting with the printing press which enabled massive one-way communication over what came before it as the default, two-way communication. (TConsider: Before the printing press, you talked to more people, perhaps in a day, than you would read in a lifetime. Now it&#x27;s the opposite, you will always read&#x2F;consume more media than talk to others, by a huge margin. This split is imo not well understood). I&#x27;m not exactly convinced it can be defeated merely with mechanistic changes to how voting and representation is done, though that&#x27;s sure to help, otherwise. The real problem is bigger, deeper, and much more subtle."],"time":["2020-01-23 18:25:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cortexio"],"id":[22136399],"kids":{},"parent":[22128603],"text":["vox.com.. still salty Trump won..

Most of the episode is about his brother who found that selective breeding practises in laboratory mice produced animals that due to long telomeres, were more likely to get cancer and were better at repairing tissue damage. The implication being that mice are not good animal models for medical research. One of the world&#x27;s leading researchers on telomeres, who won a novel prize for the work allegedly helped Bret Weinstein in the initial stages of this telomere study, then tried to block publication of Bret&#x27;s article through peer review suppression (which didn&#x27;t work, the article was published anyway), and also published on the same data, interpreting it differently but not acknowledging Bret at all.<p>I can tell you that the idea that mice are not great models of disease is hardly a groundbreaking realisation. Eric and to a lesser extent Bret try to inflate the significance of this discovery as much as possible, which gets quite cringeworthy at many points.<p>Eric berates scientific peer review as a highly flawed system, which obstructs science and stops people with good ideas that aren&#x27;t part of the establishment from making important contributions. This fits into his broader narrative that the boomer generation holds all the power and aren&#x27;t interested in letting anyone else thrive. This is hardly anything new. His personal example doesn&#x27;t actually involve peer review per se. He says he discovered something important in theoretical physics as a graduate student, but some senior physicist brushed him off, so he didn&#x27;t work on it or publish anything. Some time later Ed Whitten apparently came up with the same thing, which was lauded as a brilliant discovery. I mean, doesn&#x27;t everyone have a story like this? Science just isn&#x27;t a system which rewards people commensurate to their cleverness. Many clever people don&#x27;t do science for this reason I suspect, going off to be chess masters or quant traders (which is fine).<p>Of course you could say to Eric, well, you shouldn&#x27;t have been deterred and published your work anyway. He tries to see off this quite legitimate challenge by saying that because of peer review, there was no point in trying to do this. This is a fairly circular argument.

Candidate selection is incredibly biased.  I really get the impression that software is rife with Dunning-Kruger type people who absolutely cannot write simple code to solve tiny problems and that they selectively bias candidate selection to pick people for selfish reasons that compliment their own position on a team.<p>Here is how I would screen developers for a general developer position. I would issue a 1 hour limit and ensure the candidate knows the test is graded by a computer only.  The goal is can they read instructions and write simple code.  I don&#x27;t care how they write the code.  I only care that they can.<p>Any question could be as complex or challenging in requirements as necessary, but the answer would always be a small function of few parts.  The idea being to test reading comprehension, the ability to follow instructions, and write a simple function.  An example of output format and data type would be explicitly stated with each question.<p>An example question:<p><i>A customer is spending cash to purchase a drink.  Write a function that receives cash as the first argument and the cost of the drink as the second argument and outputs an object indicating the change in coins with preference to the largest denominations first.<\/i><p>1. Specify the grading criteria of the test.  10 points for each question correctly answered within the given time period.  There is no penalty for answering a question incorrectly.  The cumulative total execution time of all answered questions will be multiplied by 100 if in milliseconds or by 100,000 if in nanoseconds and be deducted from the final score.  The idea is to solve as many questions as possible, but in the event that there are a limited number of positions and tied scores slow code is the tie-breaker that disqualifies a candidate.<p>2. Stress that code style is irrelevant.  The test will be graded by a computer compiling the code and executing it again several scenarios in an answer bank.  A human will not review the answers submitted.<p>3. Tell candidates that once the 1 hour test period has exhausted they will have an optional 15 extra minutes to review all prior attempted questions.<p>4. Force the candidate to perform 3 practice questions before the test timer starts to familiarize the candidate the expectations of the test platform and the appropriateness of answers.<p>5. Randomly pull questions from a pool of 200+ questions 1 at a time to ensure a developer is focused on the question presented instead of selectively gaming the question list.<p>6. Ask the candidate to write a function in a designated space that addresses the problem question&#x2F;statement.<p>7. Allow the user to test their answer to review the output before submitting it for the next question.<p>8. Also allow the user to skip to the next random question with a 2 minute time penalty.<p>That is for a developer.  For an architect I would have them write an essay on a prompt provided by the business.  Architects review business needs, distill requirements, and communicate goals to provide a platform that executes the business needs while minimizing complexity as much as possible.  If they can do that in writing they can do it in software.  The most important skill is their ability to communicate clearly against competing factors.  Have 3 separate non-developers read and grade the essay."],"time":["2020-01-27 22:44:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pintxo"],"id":[22136301],"kids":{},"parent":[22121936],"text":["The shapes are basically hand-made:<p>&gt; And now a few words on methodology.

These footprints do not correspond to administrative boundaries. They are based purely on the divide between urban and rural land use. Which, at times, can be a very subjective task. I included low density suburban housing tracts within my urban footprints (hence the size of the US cities).

Each support case was documented and linked to either a KB article, an internal &quot;not yet KB article&quot; or you had to submit it as a unique issue. After the &quot;not yet KB articles&quot; were referenced X times, then it would go to consideration as a KB article. Collectively, all this formed their internal KB.<p>Worked there. Pay was terrible once Convergy&#x27;s took over. Then they moved everything to India and the support got terrible also. Too bad. They had quite the brain drain from that process. There were a lot of Windows gurus in that building.

It can be set anywhere from fully allodial (0 property tax) to fully social (tax on 100% of rental value). Homeownership wouldn’t a problem if homeowners had no privileges on the land rent. In California, we had an average property tax rate of about 2% before Proposition 13 cut it in half in 1978, encouraging homeowners to restrict supply and reap all the capital gains.

I think gradually banning mortgages, by increasing the minimum required percentage of house price required to start a mortgage all the way to 100% (when you can&#x27;t really take a mortage), will be a good thing.<p>The way house investors view mortgages is as a very cheap  leverage. So investing in housing will always be fundamentally skewed, because every single person can so easily get cheap leveraged investment in a house, so housing as an investment can perform much more poorly compared to other investment as still beat them by far because of the mortgage. This is so skewed up that a house now has an extra value: as a &#x27;token&#x27; to get a cheap  loan. This extra value is paid by everyone buying a house.<p>The way the average family looking to buy a house is completely different: they are looking to compete in the housing market with other families with similar financial abilities, to purchase a house. When you offer all sides of the competition the ability to enter a cheap loan, the side that doesn&#x27;t take the loan loses the house. But if all sides didn&#x27;t have the possibility to take a loan and pay more for the house, they would all pay less. Allowing buyers to take mortgages sets them off in a prisoner dilemma against every other buyers, and they all come out losing. If you outlaw mortgages, everyone interested in the house itself wins.<p>Moreover, once you have lured a family into strangulating themselves with a mortgage, they are now prone to financial stress that will cause them to take loans with much worse terms than a mortgage, therefore nullifying all the possible gains they had from taking the cheap loan. So while investors fully benefit from the cheap credit of the mortgage, families often follow up with mistakes and bad loans which, in total, make the mortgage costly loan.<p>The more you think about it, the more you should realize the winners from the concept of mortgages are real estate companies, investors and banks, and the biggest losers are the average family which are forced to take it from the Nash Equilibrium of a prisoners dilemma.<p>Moreover, if mortgages didn&#x27;t exist, overall spending across the economy would rise, which will be a good thing."],"time":["2020-01-22 21:58:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rland"],"id":[22125443],"kids":{},"parent":[22106192],"text":["The planning of housing stock is a seesaw.

In the 1960&#x27;s a local tannery was the main employer in the area, and commanded a great deal of local clout.  As a result, they obtained permits to dump industrial waste in various (30+) small dump sites around the area.  This waste contained a variety of industrial chemicals, not the least of which was the 3M product Scotchgard, which was used in large quantity to waterproof leather, contains PFAS, and was buried feet from the surface, generally in nondescript forest areas.<p>A few years ago, when our local water authority began testing for PFAS, they found unusually high numbers specifically around one well-head used to supply municipal water to the area.  Instead of disclosing the issue, the authority chose to use that well head only when the demand was high, which excluded times in which the water was tested. If they timed their testing to times of low demand, the numbers were under the EPA recommendation.<p>With significant grass-roots pressure in the area, many pending lawsuits, and lots of reporting and investigation, the municipality is taking the issue somewhat seriously.  GAC filters were installed on the municipal supply, the company considered largely at fault has agreed to pay for the extension of municipal water to some (not all) affected areas that are still served by well water, in which the danger is particularly high.  Some cleanups are occurring, while other sites exist under what are now housing developments.<p>There&#x27;s story after story here, of people (especially those located in areas served by well water) with a history of cancer after cancer after cancer affecting their entire families.  These are folks who after having their water tested, confirmed some of the highest levels ever measured in a water supply.<p>In all, the whole ordeal has been a wake up call for me, regarding the level of cover-up that happened and in some cases continues to happen surrounding waste disposal, especially for large companies that are considered the &quot;economic life blood&quot; of a given area.  Looking over records, people have found strong objections to the practice dating back to the time it happened (some of the warnings eerily prescient) multiple cleanups that were funded but never occurred in the decades that followed, and a continual failure to acknowledge any risk surrounding the practice and dump sites for decades.  There was a constant drum beat of &quot;very smart people say that everything is fine.&quot;<p>As for me, my (municipal) water is GAC and RO filtered.  I pay close attention to things I would not have considered before, like air quality.  It&#x27;s made me reconsider the source of the foods that I eat.

Ignoring the other advancement that took too long for go package management situation to resolve, currently I don&#x27;t see any advantage go has over other languages in that area. Node package managers have allowed you to install packages from &quot;decentralised&quot; sources such as github or gitlab for a long time. node_modules is similar to vendor and with nexe, you can package them all into a single executable.

Type conversions with equality operators, type conversions with +&#x2F;- operators, lots of Javascript doing unexpected conversions and trying to be helpful at the wrong times.<p>So sure, you <i>could<\/i> have a set of random rules based on prototype chains to figure out whether you were going to call `valueOf` or `toString` for any given object, and you could come up with a bunch of rules for whether or not primitive types like Symbols come before numbers.<p>Or, you could just say, &quot;we&#x27;re going to convert every value to its string representation and sort alphabetically.&quot; At which point, as long as you understand how string conversion works, it becomes very obvious and easy to understand how the array above will get sorted.<p>The second option is easier to learn and easier to reason about. There&#x27;s weird stuff in Javascript, but if you&#x27;re going to have a default (and there&#x27;s good reason to say that you shouldn&#x27;t, and that `sort` without a parameter should just throw an error), I think this is the <i>right<\/i> choice for them to have made about how the default should work.<p>Lots of intuitions about what the developer meant seem simple when you&#x27;re only looking at the simple case.

More of Javascript should work this way, if we&#x27;re going to have a default sorting algorithm, then it&#x27;s good that the default sorting algorithm mostly does the same stuff every time no matter what you pass it.<p>This is not the kind of thing that makes me dislike Javascript, it&#x27;s the other stuff -- the inconsistencies and magic behaviors -- that give me more pause about the language.

On one hand, the concept of &#x27;race&#x27; is what allows racism to exist and we need to remove this concept from our collective ideology in order to defeat racism -- people are just people. On the other hand, it is a fact that external biological characteristics (predominantly skin colour and facial structure) result in social clustering and discrimination, at the individual, collective and institutional levels -- racism is real.<p>I appreciate the principles behind race abolitionism, as I have often applied the same logic to gender, which is arguably even more socially constructed than race, since the appeal to biological characteristics is weaker for defining one&#x27;s gender than one&#x27;s race. However, if we remove these ideas from our collective understanding of the world, do we not make it harder to argue cases of legitimate discrimination? If the generally accepted notion is &quot;gender does not exist&quot; or &quot;race does not exist&quot;, how does one make the argument &quot;I was discriminated against because of &lt;attributes&gt;?&quot; Or is the idea that once people no longer make the distinction between different groups of attributes, then individual and institutional discrimination will no longer exist? It seems to me that in order for such an approach to be successful, we would need to train ourselves to not notice external characteristics of individuals, effectively becoming colour-blind, a task which not only seems impossible due to the nature of the human mind, but also a dangerous position to take while racism still exists -- since it also blinds us to an understanding of why a person was discriminated against and what factors affected their experience --, and risks destroying our concept of cultural heritage.

I haven&#x27;t been a Mozilla employee for more than a year and don&#x27;t have any internal information about recent developments)<p>Regarding Android: As many folks probably already know, the new Firefox for Android is a complete rewrite of the front-end to use an embedable version of gecko (GeckoView).  This entails re-implementing all the extension API support that existed in the old monolithic browser.  The timeline for switching from the Fennec (the original Firefox for Android) to Fenix (the GeckoView based version) was driven by a bunch of conflicting things.  In an ideal world it wouldn&#x27;t have happened until the extension support was broader, but we reached a point where Fennec can&#x27;t be maintained any longer yet full extension support in Fenix isn&#x27;t ready.  I don&#x27;t agree with the way Mozilla has handled this, but to be fair to them -- if they provide a way to easily enable extensions that they haven&#x27;t tested they will be flooded with reports about extensions that don&#x27;t work.  Sorting through all this would be a huge distraction to a team that&#x27;s already busy trying to complete the extension implementation.\nIt seems popular here to be skeptical about Mozilla&#x27;s goals and ascribe hidden motivations to them, but if you follow the work that&#x27;s happening on GeckoView extensions (go to bugzilla.mozilla.org search for product GeckoView, component Extensions), you can see that progress is happening slowly but steadily.<p>As for desktop and additional extension APIs: I think that this is another place Mozilla has dropped the ball on communication.  WebExtensions support a concept of &quot;experimental APIs&quot; with which developers can easily prototype new extension APIs.  The intention here was always that this would be an avenue for developers outside Mozilla to experiment with new ideas that could eventually become regular apis available to all extensions.  To be clear, the bar here is high: among other issues, many things that developers would like to be able to do from extensions are prone to abuse by malicious extensions.  Figuring out a way to create an API that allows for customization while also helping users understand how extensions are changing their browser and make an informed choice about whether to allow it is a difficult problem!  The developer community seemed to take Mozilla&#x27;s intention to expand extensions&#x27; capabilities as a promise to have Mozilla employees do all that work, rather than an invitation to work together with the community on the process of designing new APIs that can be used in a safe way."],"time":["2020-08-31 19:25:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loughnane"],"id":[24331339],"kids":[24333215],"parent":[24330983],"text":["I&#x27;m ok with Mozilla making it _harder_ to install add-ons.
