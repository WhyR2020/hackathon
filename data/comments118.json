In that sense, I&#x27;ve experienced quite a bit of pain in my life. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve learned to live with. And when I have to focus, I prefer to focus all the way, because whether I focus on 50% or 100%, the pain is roughly similar. This leaves me in a state of either being lazy(ish) and wanting to program in a simple and understandable way versus being willing to go as deep into a topic as I would need to and focus on all the details step by step.<p>When I&#x27;m intense, I also am still sympathetic towards simple code because I know that I understand that in both states. I only understand complicated code when I&#x27;m focused.<p>(2) There are enough CS grads that know better:<p>Also, on another note. Efficiency analysis is simply not taught at university. Parts of it are taught, but they&#x27;re never connected to real world cases.<p>For efficiency analysis (note I haven&#x27;t done any but I&#x27;ve read a thing or two and talk with a friend who is a performance engineer quite regurlarly about it) I think there need to be a few perspectives in check:<p>1. What is the user&#x27;s actual behavior.<p>2. What is the behavior for malicious attackers (if applicable, Intel should do this more, to my knowledge they are doing it more now).<p>3. How does the compiler translate it to assembly?<p>4. How does it theoretically look? Specifically: worst-case, best-case, average-case in both theoretical and empirical sense.<p>Concluding:<p>I only have one year of experience in software development, where no one cared about performance yet I know better than to look only at the theoretical speed.

The new grad is focused solely on the asymptotic complexity of the code. It doesn&#x27;t matter how slow or how complicated it is in practice, they are solely focused on using the fastest data structure asymptotically.<p>The senior developer optimizes a different set of criteria:<p><pre><code>  1) How hard is it to understand the code and make sure it&#x27;s correct.\n  2) How fast the algorithm in practice.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThere are several different reasons why the performance of the algorithm in practice is different than the performance in theory. The most obvious reason is big-O notation does not capture lots of details that matter in practice. An L1 cache read and a disk IOP are both treated the same in theory.<p>A second reason is the implementation of a complex algorithm is more likely to be incorrect. In some cases this leads to bugs which you can find with good testing. In other cases, it leads to a performance degradation that you&#x27;ll only find if you run a profiler.<p>I one time saw a case where a function for finding the right shard for a given id was too slow. The code needed to find from a list of id ranges, which one a given id fell into. The implementation would sort the id ranges once ahead of time and then run a binary search of the ranges to find the right shard for the id. One engineer took a look at this, realized that we were doing the shard lookups sequentially, and decided to perform the shard lookups in parallel. This made the code faster, but we still would have needed to double the size of our servers in order to provide enough additional CPU to make the code fast enough.<p>Another engineer hooked the code up into a profiler and made a surprising discovery. It turns out the implementation of the function was subtlety incorrect and it was sorting the id ranges <i>on every call<\/i>. This happened because the code sorted the id ranges inside of a Scala mapValues function. It turns out that mapValues does not actually map a function over the values of a hash table. It instead returns an object that when you look up a key, it will look up the value in the original hash table, then apply the function[0]. This results in the function being called on every read.<p>The solution was to replace mapValues with map. This dramatically improved the performance of the system and basically brought the CPU usage of the system down to zero. Notably, it would have been impossible to discover this issue without either knowing the difference between map and mapValues, or by using a profiler.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bruchez.name&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;mapmap-vs-mapmapvalues.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bruchez.name&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;mapmap-vs-mapmapvalues.htm...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-28 18:45:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foxyv"],"id":[22728831],"kids":{},"parent":[22708094],"text":["This Dilbert went around the office a lot when I was a new employee.

No dynamic programming this time.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the same is true of TeX&#x27;s line-breaking algorithm too: “best” is a property of the entire paragraph being formatted; a line break can change the indentation of the remainder of the paragraph (in many ways, but most obviously: discretionary hyphens with nontrivial pre- and post- texts), which in turn affects which other line breaks are needed.

It gives you a job that you think about 24hrs a day, while maybe only actively working 6hrs a day, but realistically much more. That said I LOVE my job and super grateful I get to work on it everyday!<p>There are much better ways as a software engineer to take a lower risk approach to getting to financial freedom.<p>(These suggestions are not inclusive of coronavirus)<p>1. Save cash. Change jobs and increase your baseline income. If possible get to a FAANG and then also freelance on the side. It&#x27;s very possible in the Bay Area after 5 years to save enough to retire without necessarily subscribing to the FIRE goals.<p>2. Work for enterprise companies or build them a micro-saas. There are plenty of high-value services that companies will pay $XXk monthly for. If your goal is to make money and maybe not love your job, this is a great place to be. Orchestrate Segment and a data warehouse, build out a robust Salesforce pipeline, take a spreadsheet and implement in Retool or Rails. Each of these examples can easily cost $300k for the right type of company.\nA micro-saas example is Sidekiq ([<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-charging-money-for-pro-features-allowed-me-quit-my-job-6e71309457](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-charging-money-for-pro-features-allowed-me-quit-my-job-6e71309457)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-charging-money-fo...<\/a>). I would have probably 4x the enterprise rate to get to $4M&#x2F;yr.<p>3. Explain something difficult, really well. Related to selling services to enterprise, you can also consult with companies by owning a very specific niche that is very high value. Explain security compliance (like SOC 2), orchestrate edge servers and CDNs, up-level sales teams with technical knowledge or off-the-shelf tools. A single dev can shepard folks through a process that costs $XM of dollars or enable a teams that also costs $XM of dollars.<p>4. Rebuild existing tools, much better. This is my personal expertise, but I believe all existing tools could use major improvements. You can make tools better in UX, better documentation and tutorials, faster code, easier onboarding, etc. The major benefit is that you know there are existing customers paying money and you can then develop much better tools along the way. In this model I believe free or enterprise is way to go as a single dev. With free tools, you need strong traffic to monetize with ads or sponsorship. At the enterprise you sell featured postings or (3) services &#x2F; consultation."],"time":["2020-03-29 06:14:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rg2004"],"id":[22714182],"kids":[22715297],"parent":[22712138],"text":["Here are the things that lead to my startup&#x27;s success:<p>Get a mentor who&#x27;s already been there<p>Read Traction by Gino Wickman<p>Read Traction by Gabriel Weinberg<p>Identify and engage a big enough channel that will sell your product for you.<p>Build the product that they want.

Based on the comments I&#x27;m seeing, it might be helpful if I clarified why I think this news is of extreme significance.<p>The key facts are:<p>1. This is a test that directly detects SARS-Cov-2 virus. It can, if sensitive enough, tell you if you&#x27;re infected even if you don&#x27;t have any symptoms.<p>2. The detection time is <i>very<\/i> fast: 5 minutes for a positive result; 13 minutes for a negative.<p>3. The testing device is pretty compact. (Fits on a tabletop.)<p>If, in addition to the above, the following are <i>also<\/i> true:<p>4. The sensitivity of the test is high enough.<p>5. We can quickly scale manufacture of the testing platform and its reagents.<p>Then this development means the beginning of the end of the pandemic.* If all of the above are true, we can deploy fast testing to the entries&#x2F;exits of factories, offices, etc. Folks who test positive get sent home to self-quarantine; folks who test negative can go back to work. Everyone gets ~13 minutes added to their daily commute, but they can work safely without spreading the virus.<p>The specificity of this test almost doesn&#x27;t matter. Even if flu cases trigger a positive, those folks can still be sent to secondary testing or home quarantine. The government could pay them 100% of their salary for two weeks and it would still be a fantastic deal for the rest of us.<p>We can also ignore regulatory obstacles such as &quot;this is only allowed in hospitals right now&quot;. The wider this testing regime is deployed, the higher a level of economic activity we can sustain while keeping R0 &lt; 1. And given the scale of the stimulus efforts already underway, it&#x27;s clear the government will do anything it can to revive the economy. Administrative barriers will be abolished as needed.<p>Obviously this scenario is conditional on all the above actually being true. But this is the most hopeful development I&#x27;ve heard of since mid-February.<p>* To be absolutely pedantic, it probably means more like a 95-98% mitigation of the pandemic within a few months."],"time":["2020-03-28 16:05:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neuro"],"id":[22708893],"kids":[22709104,22709804,22709051],"parent":[22708535],"text":["The technology below can do it in 15 seconds.

I have tried Jupyter Lab&#x2F;Notebook on and off over the last 10 years, and I believe I have now firmly settled on my conclusion:<p>Everyone should aim to minimize the amount of work they do in Jupyter Lab &#x2F; Notebook.<p>It shocks me a bit to find myself saying that, as it is such a beautiful piece of work. Furthermore the people who wrote it are better software engineers than I&#x27;ll ever be: the frontend, the zeromq-mediated communication with the kernel, the fact that the architecture has generalized so successfully to other language kernels, its huge popularity and reach. Nevertheless, I believe I&#x27;m serious. It really comes down to just two related issues, but they&#x27;re extremely important: debugging and version control.<p>If you&#x27;re a software engineer, and not a data scientist, here&#x27;s how you probably debug already, or if not then how you should debug:<p>- You identify (a) commit(s) on which the behavior is correct, and (a) commit(s) where it is not correct.<p>- You experiment with fixes. Perhaps you stash them, perhaps you create experimental commits.<p>The critical point is that you use your version control system (probably Git) to navigate between alternative versions of the code. With a single command, you can switch the version of your code base, and the subsequent process you invoke to test your code is a fresh process, unpolluted by any state from the version of your code that you were on 30 seconds ago.<p>In contrast, Jupyter notebook does not encourage this style of work at all. In practice, what you will do when trying to debug some code in Jupyter is comment out lines, temporarily delete code, add experimental lines, add experimental new cells, etc. All creating a working tree, and a collection of in-memory python objects, that is a baffling mixture of changes related to the original feature development, and changes related to experimental debugging. Debugging will wear you out, as the state of your notebook gradually approaches complete incomprehensibility.<p>If you&#x27;re a software engineer, you&#x27;ll already know the benefits of being able to make precise adjustments to the state of your code with git commands. You want to learn statistics and data analysis skills from data scientists, but in doing so you should not regress to a worse style of development by starting to write much of your code in Jupyter notebooks.<p>And if you&#x27;re a data scientist, you will want to acquire the debugging skills of software engineers. If you are not using git, you want to start learning it now.<p>Crudely, we can imagine a 2-dimensional diagram with one axis for engineering skills and another for data science skills. Everyone wants to be in the top-right quadrant. In that quadrant, version control is used, and the version control system is used for debugging. Debugging is rather important in developing all software, whether scientific&#x2F;numerical or not.<p>So both groups should be minimizing the amount of code written in the Jupyter notebook UI: instead, write code in a standard Python package, in a virtualenv, installed in editable mode with `pip install -e`. If you need to use a notebook for graphical display, or HTML display of Pandas dataframes, or display of an audio playing widget, or any of the other amazing things it does so well then fine: use importlib.reload in your notebook to load and reload the bulk of your code from your Python package. The notebook should just feature calls to plotting routines etc that you have implemented in standard code files using your text editor&#x2F;IDE. You could even aim for your notebook to contain so few lines of code that in some projects you might not even bother committing it."],"time":["2020-03-28 15:07:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alfla"],"id":[22710101],"kids":{},"parent":[22691207],"text":["NICE!"],"time":["2020-03-28 10:20:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwqwerty"],"id":[22710682],"kids":[22711094,22710766],"parent":[22691207],"text":["I&#x27;ll take this opportunity to get jupyter advice: one thing I don&#x27;t understand about jupyter vs jupyterlab is why notebooks in jupyter classic have functioning vim bindings (ie in cells) through the codemirror extension but jupyterlab notebooks do not. in jupyterlab you can have vim bindings in the text editing view but not in the notebook view. for the life of me I cannot understand this design decision. how hard can it be to just leave whatever thing that makes it work in jupyter classic alone so that it continues to work in jupyterlab."],"time":["2020-03-28 13:19:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scoot_718"],"id":[22710984],"kids":[22711386,22710988],"parent":[22691207],"text":["Who cares?

The quest started after a holiday party, when he started singing a tune from memory to his wife. He swore it was a hit from the ’90s, some aesthetic mix of U2 and Barenaked Ladies. His wife had never heard of it before. Later, after hours falling down Google rabbit holes, he realizes the song can’t be found on the internet, the infinite repository of information where almost everything that’s ever existed can be found. It feels uncanny, like he’s found a hole in the universe. But the song continues to settle into his brain, an earworm that can’t be cured. Desperately seeking a solution, he reaches out to the Reply All team.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gimletmedia.com&#x2F;shows&#x2F;reply-all&#x2F;o2h8bx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gimletmedia.com&#x2F;shows&#x2F;reply-all&#x2F;o2h8bx<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-29 00:32:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["js2"],"id":[22711948],"kids":[22712182],"parent":[22700482],"text":["&gt;Q: Do you have a theory on what’s going on?<p>&gt; A: Not really....<p>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Reply All and only listened to this episode after it was mentioned in a comment here on HN about two weeks ago.<p>P.J.

But at the same time, I think most physicists share his view that string theory  is not likely to be fruitful anytime soon. Historically, quantum mechanics, which unites the physics of light and matter, was discovered only after many mathematical developments in both fields that led to the two analogous theories of the principle of least time and the principle of least action.  By contrast, the exegesis of quantum mechanics and general relativity has only just begun.

Undid the Ottoman Empire. If the Ottomans had limped around for 20 more years, they would have found themselves in a century drunk on oil, while in charge of the majority of the world&#x27;s oil reserves. The Ottomans would have been the global superpower of the latter half of the 20th century.<p>2. Rise of Communism. Lenin was an outcast living in Switzerland when the Tsar was overthrown. He arrived in Russia -- delivered there by Germany and with significant German funding -- two months after the interim government had taken over. It was a liberal democracy, not unlike the government of the US or France, that had the most power when Lenin arrived. Even if the Russian Empire had still fallen, the century probably wouldn&#x27;t have fallen under the shadow of communism.<p>3. The center of world banking moved from London to New York City. After the end of 1916 or so, Britain was pretty much broke, and the war effort was to a significant extent funded by NYC bankers. London indebted themselves greatly to the US, and wherever you were in the world, if you wanted something to do with money, you went to New York City to get it, because England didn&#x27;t have any. Of course, for these loans to mean anything, Britain would have to win the war (and reparations) which leads us to...<p>4. USA as world police. The US wanted nothing to do with European, Asian, or African politics. Even Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;imperialist&quot; attitudes were limited to North and South America. If Wilson wanted all the NYC banks to not go bankrupt, he&#x27;d have to enter the war- which he did. And thus began America&#x27;s role as world police rather than a regional power.<p>5. The Belfast declaration and the catastrophic carving of the Arab world on arbitrary lines. Israel&#x27;s foundation was laid down in 1917 by England declarating their intention to create a Jewish state in Palestine. And the borders drawn up on meaningless lines in the desert rather than along ethnic boundaries plunged the Arab world into a century of sectarian violence and chaos.<p>6. The Ottoman Empire would have gladly sold oil to Japan during their wars with China. (which likely still would have happened) Japan never would have had the quarrel with the United States that lead to the attack on Pearl Harbor.<p>While I&#x27;m not trying to minimize the human life cost of WWI, I actually don&#x27;t think the death toll of the war was really all that significant. China&#x27;s had a dozen or so civil wars with higher death tolls. More people died of the flu in 1918 and 1919 than all combat deaths from 1914 to 1918 combined. But WWI had an outsized effect on world history. I think it&#x27;s probably the most transformational event in human history since... I dunno, Columbus introducing the Americas to Europe.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the world would look like if WWI didn&#x27;t play out the way it did.

In this case the Robustness Principle must include a corollary: implementations should silently ignore and pass on anything that they don&#x27;t understand. In other words, there are two definitions of &quot;conservative&quot; that are in direct conflict.<\/i>&quot;<p>Clearing the field is not &#x27;the most &quot;conservative&quot; thing to do&#x27;. &quot;Conservative&quot; in the context of network protocols means not fooling with things you don&#x27;t understand and don&#x27;t need to fool with. Yet, this is a very common misunderstanding, by both the specifier and the implementer. Likewise,<p>&quot;<i>Now let&#x27;s suppose that our mythical standard has another field Y that is intended for future use—that is, in a protocol extension. There are many ways to describe such fields, but common examples are to label them &quot;reserved&quot; or &quot;must be zero.&quot; The former doesn&#x27;t say what value a compliant implementation should use to initialize reserved fields, whereas the latter does, but it is usually assumed that zero is a good initializer. Applying the Robustness Principle makes it easy to see that when version 3 of the protocol is released using field Y there will be no problem, since all older implementations will be sending zero in that field.<\/i>&quot;<p>&quot;Must be zero&quot; should probably be stricken from the protocol lexicon. If a field is unused, an implementation should not be looking at it at all. Instead, add wording such that all fields are zeroed before individual values are assigned.<p>&quot;<i>The problem occurs in how far to go. It&#x27;s probably reasonable not to verify that the &quot;must be zero&quot; fields that you don&#x27;t have to interpret are actually zero—that is, you can treat them as undefined. As a real-world example, the SMTP specification says that implementations must allow lines of up to 998 characters, but many implementations allow arbitrary lengths; accepting longer lines is probably OK (and in fact longer lines often occur because a lot of software transmits paragraphs as single lines).<\/i>&quot;<p>But this is exactly the issue that causes attacks on the robustness principle to fall down. A server passing along a message with lines longer than 998 characters to an implementation that doesn&#x27;t handle them is a buffer overflow waiting to happen.

It&#x27;s kind of like asking &quot;which programming books are good?&quot; - Well, it depends on what you want to build. Some people will recommend Assembly books, some  LISP books, some Python, and others Javascript, depending on what they fancy. Building a web application is different from building a compiler. There is some overlap, but what you need to know to be successful is different.<p>Trading is kind of like that. Long-term value investing, portfolio management, day trading, options trading, quantitative strategies, high-frequency trading, etc, are vastly different approaches, ranging from &quot;assembly&quot; to using a drag and drop website builder. All these can be used to make money, but what you need to know, and how you approach the problem, is different. Books will be useful for one, and totally useless for other approaches. Just like an assembly book won&#x27;t teach you how to make a website.<p>You may want to think about what &quot;kind&quot; of trading you&#x27;re interested in, and then ask for specific recommendations related to that. Otherwise you will just get people recommending random stuff they have some personal relationship with, like recommending SICP to learn programming. Looking at the answers in this thread, this is what&#x27;s happening. They are all over the places at different levels of abstraction.<p>EDIT: Also, few people explicitly make these distinctions. Most traders I&#x27;ve talked to are &quot;locked into&quot; their approach and will talk about it as if there were no others. That&#x27;s becuase of the bias they have. E.g. someone trading on fundamentals may talk to you about earnings reports but will likely not even be aware of techniques using ML models to optimize order execution or fancy order types.

With time you will learn what sections to skip and it gets faster, easier. But you have to get your information from the reports themselves. To this day not even one of those people has followed my advice and read the book. I guess the thought of putting in effort scared them away as they were also asking me if they can find the reports summarized on some website and use that as their source if information, or if they can pay for some service to calculate discounted free cash flow for them. To me, having the summary and calculation alone is pointless, and it&#x27;s also the fastest part of the process.

I have built and run trading strategies at hedge funds for the US and emerging markets.<p>True story: A senior trader on the trading desk asked me - &quot;Why did the market go up yesterday?&quot;. I tried to pontificate away at some explanation and after a while just shrugged and said - &quot;I really don&#x27;t know&quot;, fully expecting to be commended for my honesty. The trader laughed and said: &quot;The market went up because there were more buyers than sellers&quot;. Next question, &quot;Why is the market going down today&quot;, he continued &quot;Because they are more sellers than buyers&quot;. The whole machinery of finance exists to give you a <i>better<\/i> story around this but nobody really knows.<p>There are two perspectives to understand finance. We will call the two perspectives the Alien Scientist and the Blob ;)<p>The Alien Scientist perspective is that you have arrived at a new planet with a thriving civilization unlike your own and they act in inexplicable ways. After a period of observation, you can predict the <i>outcome<\/i> of the behavior in the long term. You cannot predict why the outcomes happen. You also cannot predict behavior in the short or medium term.<p>The Blob is one of the many beings who populate the planet under observation. The Blob is actively trying to understand their environment and how their fellow blobs behave so they can predict the outcomes and thrive from it. The Blob is equally vested in understanding the why of the behavior of their fellow Blobs and also the interaction of the environment, the blobs and so forth (i.e. second, third, fourth-order effects).<p>You can take the approach of the Alien Scientist (long term investor) or you can take the approach of the Blob (trader&#x2F;economist). If you take the investor (Alien Scientist) approach you are more concerned with the long term outcomes in financial markets and not with the why (aside: most financial market information is pure noise). The Alien Scientist approach should start by reading &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; and books by John Bogle and Warren Buffet&#x27;s musings on investments. You would also do well to understand the various tax structures and treatments available to you - 401k, housing, .... since these can significantly impact your end outcomes.<p>You can invest all the time freed up not having to study finance by reading gossip rags and watching reality shows - you will be entertained and there are pretty people to look at ;) Or invest it in your wellbeing and your long term earning power (i.e. career).<p>There is plenty of advice in this thread on the Blob approach if you want to go that route.<p>Good luck!"],"time":["2020-03-28 17:53:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bvd"],"id":[22709927],"kids":{},"parent":[22709843],"text":["I would recommend Investing Demystified by Lars Kroijer."],"time":["2020-03-28 09:24:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_ink_"],"id":[22709953],"kids":[22710533],"parent":[22709843],"text":["I do not have a recommodation, but I would be specifically interested in books about trading with options.
