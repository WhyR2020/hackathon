The risks of working with private companies (large and small) in China are are also great with CCP &quot;party cells&quot; officially embedded into at least half of private companies. Less discussed is the China&#x27;s highly-successful &quot;patriotic education&quot; campaign implemented in response to the 1989 pro-democracy protests (the Tiananmen Square massacre). All school children since the mid-1990s have been indoctrinated from birth with a Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s highly-exaggerated historical narrative called the &quot;century of humiliation&quot;. This world view says the US and the European colonial powers held China down between 1839 to 1949, and that only the CCP&#x27;s leadership China will regain its rightful place as global leader. Its false and highly-exaggerated for a number of reasons (China at its historical peak was never more than a regional power, never a global leader, and the CCP has done more to hold China&#x27;s development back than western colonialism and the war with Imperial Japan).<p>Since the patriotic education system came into force in the 1990s, generations of schoolchildren indoctrinated. These students, now adults, have entered the workforce with the ideology continuing to be reinforced by state-propaganda and censorship.<p>This &quot;century of humiliation&quot; mindset is part of what helps justify the China&#x27;s strategy of large scale technology theft (theft is a core component of the Made In China 2025 industrial strategy).<p>Interestingly enough, the CCP promotes its ethno-nationalist ideology far beyond its borders via the United Front Work Department to  try and influence everyone, but especially overseas Chinese diaspora communities. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether someone was born in China, or live as part of an overseas diaspora community, or have Chinese ancestral heritage but have lived for generations in another country, the Chinese Communist Party sees every single ethnically Chinese people in the world as owing allegiance to it, and wants to leverage these people to achieve its goals.<p>Defeating the CCP&#x27;s ethno-nationalist agenda and highly-exaggerated historical narratives will be difficult, but understanding it is the key to fighting back against the widespread theft of advanced technology from developed countries to China.<p>EDIT: Why the downvotes? The &quot;patriotic education&quot; campaign, &quot;century of humiliation&quot; narrative, United Front Work Department and state-led technological theft are all core methods in the CCP&#x27;s strategy (leading situations like the one in the featured article).

I consider myself successful professionally and personally... I’m the CTO at a startup where I work on problems I find interesting, with a team I love, at a company I really believe in. At home I have a wonderful wife and two beautiful kids (3 year and 1 year old).<p>I’ve been working in tech professionally for 14 years. I worked very hard during all of those years and before. I’ve never thought of work and life as something that should be balanced. To me balance means the pursuit of those things being even. Instead I think of it as “work life integration”, where both things need to coexist at the same time. Sometimes the push or pull Needs to be greater on one side than the other.<p>My typical routine is waking up at 7am (unlesd the kids get up earlier). Every morning I make breakfast for my boys, walk the dog, and get myself ready for the day. I drop my oldest son at school and walk 35 min to the office. I’m usually in the office around 9:30&#x2F;45am. When I’m at work I’m 98% focused and dedicated to work. 2% of the time is a mental break or personal thing. I try to leave the office around 6:30&#x2F;7pm and make it home just in time to read to the boys and tuck them in to bed. I don’t make it in time every night (I FaceTime for 5 min if I won’t be home). When I do make it back after we put the kids down I spend the next 1-2 hours min with my wife eating dinner and hanging out. Then I’m usually back on the computer for 90-120 min doing some more work.<p>The weekends are family time, Sat and Sun from 7am-7pm is dedicated family time. I don’t do any real work with the exception of checking email when there’s down time, like during naps or if my wife and the kids run out for a few without me. Fri and Sat evening I try to spend the evening with my wife (we don’t go out a ton right now because of the young kids). From time to time work takes up one or both of those nights. If I’m giving up Fri&#x2F;Sat with my wife it’s because something important needs to be done and I don’t take that choice lightly. Sunday evening is usually work &#x2F; prep for the week after the kids go to bed.<p>I’ve found a good routine where I can work hard and spend time with family. My job is flexible enough where I can go to a morning or mid day appointment for the kids, or go on the occasion field trip, or leave the office at 5 to pick up my son from school from time to time.<p>A typical work work day usually averages 9-11 hours with the occasional flex up or down. My routine doesn’t leave a lot of time for anything but family and work. I watch between 0–2 hours of tv a week and if I do watch it’s usually during spouse time. I’ve integrated work and life together and try to modulate depending on what’s going on in either world and either time. I have no interest in a perfect consistent balance."],"time":["2020-01-02 03:28:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kevan"],"id":[21931837],"kids":{},"parent":[21927041],"text":["I guess it depends on what your definition of success is.

What works for one person, does not work for another.  Even the phrase &quot;work life balance&quot; implies a particular solution, which I think is often damaging to people.  It implies that there is work, which when I&#x27;m doing it suspends my life.  It implies that work is inherently bad for your life goals.<p>Interestingly, I taught English as a foreign language in Japan for 5 years.  I had a colleague who was giving a class on different professions and she asked the students (first year high school&#x2F;grade 10) what profession they wanted.  Many girls in the class said, &quot;I want to be a mother&quot;.  This infuriated my colleague who chastised the students and told them not to &quot;waste their life&quot;.<p>Of course, being a full time parent is actually a risky proposition in your career.  You have to depend on your spouse for making money.  If things don&#x27;t work out, you don&#x27;t have a lot of security.  From that perspective, I completely understand my colleague&#x27;s reaction.  What I find interesting is the feeling that the choice of &quot;full time parent&quot; is considered an unfit career, regardless of risk.  Had the students said they wanted to be musicians, a career with considerably more risk, my colleague would not have reacted in such a hostile way.<p>When put in that light, what <i>is<\/i> your career to your life?  If you spend your time lounging on the beach drinking pina coladas all day, have you &quot;made it&quot;?  What if you sit on the street corner drinking cheap whiskey?  Are you wasting your life if you achieve nothing in your career?  How much of your time on earth should you devote to that work?  If you spend your time simply amassing money, have you failed since you did not spend that time curing cancer?  Do you need to make up for your complete waste of time making money by donating it at the end of your life?<p>Of course, I&#x27;m being facetious.  Your choice of what your want to accomplish and how much of your time your want to spend on it is up to you.  Some jobs require considerably more effort than others.  Look at the life of the average rock star.  Many of them do 300 or more concerts a year.  That&#x27;s a work load that would bury the average software developer, but it&#x27;s generally necessary at the top end of that profession.<p>My advice, for what it&#x27;s worth, is to try to find a job that is satisfying to you and for which the time spent does not seem to be wasted.  Don&#x27;t partition your life between &quot;things I want to do&quot; and &quot;things I have to do&quot;.  Yes, there will always be things that you have to do that you may not want to.  But instead of trying to avoid the things you have to do, try to find things that you want to do and make them things you have to do."],"time":["2020-01-02 03:09:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aprdm"],"id":[21935404],"kids":{},"parent":[21927041],"text":["I&#x27;ve worked in the UK, Canada and Brazil in over 10 different companies big and small.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked more than 40h&#x2F;week, I&#x27;ve worked with people who did but it seemed more like they wanted than that it was enforced.<p>I feel I&#x27;ve never had problems putting boundaries and being reasonable, I currently make what I consider a very good salary for Canada and am working in a place that really values employer happiness."],"time":["2020-01-02 15:06:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trez"],"id":[21954026],"kids":{},"parent":[21927041],"text":["None.

Pick a problem to solve, start googling for common models that are used to solve the problem, then go on github, find code that solves that problem or a similar one. Download the code and start working with it, change it, experiment. All of the theory and such is mostly worthless, its too much to learn from scratch and you will probably use very little of it. There is so much ml code on github to learn from, its really the best way. When you encounter a concept you need to understand, google the concept and learn the background info. This will give you a highly applied and intuitive understanding of solving ml problems, but you will have large gaps. Which is fine, unless you are going in for job interviews.<p>Also bear in mind that courses like fast.ai (as you see plastered on here), aggresively market themselves by answering questions all over the internet. Its a form of SEO.<p>EDIT (Adding this here to explain my point better):<p>My opinion is that the theory starts to make sense after you know how to use the models and have seen different models produce different results.<p>Very few people can read about bias variance trade off and in the course of using a model, understand how to take that concept and directly apply it to the problem they are solving. In retrospect, they can look back and understand the outcomes. Also, most theory is useless in the application of ML, and only useful in the active research of new machine learning methods and paradigms. Courses make the mistake of mixing in that useless information.<p>The same thing is true of the million different optimizers for neural networks. Why different ones work better in different cases is something you would learn when trying to squeeze out performance on a neural network.

The fastest way to learn something is to fit it into a framework that you already understand. If you have a PhD in theoretical physics&#x2F;abstract mathematics (like a lot of ML researchers), then the more mathematical (theoretical) frameworks will be a good way to build deep intuitions.

I went a more traditional route by getting a degree in statistics and doing as much machine learning as my professors could stand (they went from groaning about machine learning to downright giddy over those two years). I worked as a data scientist for an oil-and-gas firm, and now work as a machine learning engineer (same thing, basically) for a defense contractor.<p>I’ve seen some really bad machine learning work in my short career. Don’t listen to the people saying “ignore the theory,” because the worst machine learning people say that and they know enough deep learning to build a model but can’t get good results. I’m also unimpressed with Fast AI for the reasons some other people mentioned, they just wrapped PyTorch. But also don’t read a theory book cover-to-cover before you write some code, that won’t help either. You won’t remember the bias-variance trade-off or Gini impurity or batch-norm or skip connections by the time you go to use them. Learn the software and the theory in tandem. I like to read about a new technique, get as much understanding as I think I can from reading, then try it out.<p>If I would do it all-over again I would:<p>1. Get a solid foundation in linear algebra. A lot of machine learning can be formulated in terms of a series of matrix operations, and sometimes it makes more sense to. I thought Coding the Matrix was pretty good, especially the first few chapters.<p>2. Read up on some basic optimization. Most of the time it makes the most sense to formulate the algorithm in terms of optimization. Usually, you want to minimize some loss function and thats simple, but regularization terms make things tricky. It’s also helpful to learn why you would regularize.<p>3. Learn a little bit of probability. The further you go the more helpful it will be when you want to run simulations or something like that. Jaynes has a good book but I wouldn’t say it’s elementary.<p>4. Learn statistical distributions: Gaussian, Poisson, Exponential, and beta are the big ones that I see a lot. You don’t have to memorize the formulas (I also look them up) but know when to use them.<p>While you’re learning this, play with linear regression and it’s variants: polynomial, lasso, logistic, etc. For tabular data, I always reach for the appropriate regression before I do anything more complicated. It’s straightforward, fast, you get to see what’s happening with the data (like what transformations you should perform or where you’re missing data), and it’s interpretable. It’s nice having some preliminary results to show and discuss while everyone else is struggling to get not-awful results from their neural networks.<p>Then you can really get into the meat with machine learning. I’d start with tree-based models first. They’re more straightforward and forgiving than neural networks. You can explore how the complexity of your models effects the predictions and start to get a feel for hyper-parameter optimization. Start with basic trees and then get into random forests in scikit-learn. Then explore gradient boosted trees with XGBoost. And you can get some really good results with trees. In my group, we rarely see neural networks outperform models built in XGBoost on tabular data.<p>Most blog posts suck. Most papers are useless. I recommend Geron’s Hands-On Machine Learning.<p>Then I’d explore the wide world of neural networks. Start with Keras, which really emphasizes the model building in a friendly way, and then get going with PyTorch as you get comfortable debugging Keras. Attack some object classification problems with-and-without pretrained backends, then get into detection and NLP. Play with weight regularization, batch norm and group norm, different learning rates, etc. If you really want to get deep into things, learn some CUDA programming too.<p>I really like Chollet’s Deep Learning with Python.<p>After that, do what you want to do.

It’s on Amazon, you can find it!<p>Sidenotes:<p>* Don’t worry about the habit scale down, it will naturally grow over time into its fuller form. I spent a month of the year just flossing 1 tooth each night (ridiculous, I know!), then 5 months just flossing 1 row (better!)<p>* Part of the trick is finding a good habit to put your new habit after.

Then the Pascal, then to C and then myriads of other languages. I covered 6502, Z80, 68k (all of them, to 68040), PowerPC (all of them from 601 prototypes to G5s), ARMs (more than I can count) and x86s (same).<p>True to be told, the assembly language I started with &#x2F;helped a LOT&#x2F; with be becoming an efficient developer; a developer who understand what &#x27;code&#x27; is being generated when he writes an expression, a statement, a loop, and one who understands what the runtime implication are for most of the &#x27;sugar coating&#x27; HLL gives.<p>However, starting (a bit) with the 68k, then even more so with the PowerPC, it became pretty much impossible to write &#x2F;from scratch&#x2F; an assembly equivalent that was QUICKER than the compiler generated code. That was 20+ years ago. DRAM latency happened, pipelining happened and SIMD happened.<p>Today, hand writing assembly is pretty much stupid on modern CPUs.

Swimming and tennis have very little in common and you can spend years trying every sport and never becoming good at any of them (what traditional cs education does)<p>If your goal is to get a job, your best bet is web development or mobile dev.<p>The big picture is we have CPUs that have instructions. Instructions boil down to moving data to&#x2F;from someplace and manipulation of data.<p>Moving is how monitors display stuff, data gets stored on disk etc. Moving is how a program gets loaded and executed.<p>Manipulation is how you get math operations. Programming boils down to math operations and conditionals (if this, then that, else something else)<p>Math operations have a few basic types for performance reasons - floats, ints, etc.<p>Because math operations on the CPU have types, programming languages have types. Because CPUs have conditional operations, programming languages have operations. See the pattern? Programming languages are just conveniences on top of the language the CPU provides (called assembly).<p>The most popular &#x27;low level&#x27; language is C. C gives you functions and the smallest set of data types you can get away with. The big deal here is organizing code into functions. Functions allow re-use and programming is all about doing the least amount of work possible by the programmer to achieve a task, in the shortest amount of time and memory use possible.<p>The study of shortest amount of code to achieve the fastest result with the least amount of memory use is algorithms.<p>To achieve fast results with least memory used, you want a language that gives you access to memory manipulation directly. This is why C is still king for anything performance critical.<p>If you don&#x27;t care for performance much, Java the language is king of corporate software and all Android software too. It handles memory for you and your types are clever - you don&#x27;t need to say how big an array you want when creating it, you just create one and it gets magically re-sized behind the scenes for you as you add elements in. All modern languages have clever types and ways of helping manage memory for you. This is to make programming more newbie-friendly and theoretically to lower the number of bugs, at the cost of performance and memory use.<p>Phew, so we have CPUs, C and Java. Now where do we typically store data and how do we display it?<p>Data is stored in databases. Databases mere mortals use are all SQL databases - the most popular and robust being Postgres. Learn what an index is and why it helps stuff run faster. Learn joins and one-to-many and many-to-many. Build a photo-sharing site with user registration - this&#x27;ll cover needing to know all the basics.<p>Oh, to build the site, you&#x27;ll need to display it. You have 3 options - web, ios or android. I&#x27;d recommend web because it&#x27;s the easiest of the 3 and there are tons of excellent resources to learn from.<p>It is extremely easy to get bogged down in libraries such as &#x27;react&#x27; and all the rest. It is extremely easy to get bogged down in new Javascript features. Stick with the basics! Stick with simple html&#x2F;css and flexbox for layout. Use node with the most popular and simple web framework as a web server. Use the simplest library to talk to the database and write SQL, don&#x27;t use ORM because you need to learn SQL and&#x27;ll be around for the next 50 years - your ORM won&#x27;t.<p>Phew, you&#x27;ve spent about 6 months and have built a photo sharing site. You know html&#x2F;css, some javascript, a web server framework, how to store stuff in a database.<p>You&#x27;re another 3-6 months away from getting a job as a web developer. You&#x27;ll need to learn react or whatever other junk framework of the year is most popular these days. You&#x27;ll then be plunged into a world of mediocre software and writing code for projects that make no sense, with deadlines that make even less sense. There&#x27;ll be a lot of meetings, incompetence and your posture will suffer.<p>The pay is good however, and it <i>should<\/i> double within the first 2-5 years if not triple. Switch jobs every year and try to do contract work as soon as possible - it pays way better.<p>This is the outline for going from 0 to hero, if getting a job is your goal. If you don&#x27;t want to end up working on projects of questionable importance for the rest of your career and you want to build software that will drive the next car, operate the next robot, help us go to Mars etc - you should simply attend a good University. There is no shortcut and you&#x27;ll avoid wasting hundreds if not thousands of hours chasing your own tail reading tutorials written by people who learned programming 2 years ago themselves.<p>You&#x27;ll meet other smart people and you may even want to get a Masters and a PhD. Oh, you may get hired by a top company if you&#x27;re good and the pay there is great, and that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll get to do great work. They care about degrees and which University you went to, don&#x27;t believe anyone who says otherwise.<p>Self-learning CS is only for the crazy ones, or those who want a high paying job quickly, are smart and don&#x27;t care what they work on.<p>My 2 cents of course, having gone the self-learning route myself many years ago :)<p>Oh, one last thing - if you go the self-learning route, you <i>need<\/i> a friend who&#x27;s a good established programmer to answer your questions for 5-10 min everyday.

Falling completely off my year-long diet, I decided I wanted a pizza at all costs. So I went to a pizza store. As it turns out, this was a store I had managed 30 years ago, and I haven&#x27;t been inside one of these stores since, so it made for a nice moment of comparison. People are the same, the business is the same. What have computers brought?<p>It used to be, when you talked about computers, you talked about data, although at the time we confused behavior and data. Here&#x27;s my computer. It has my pictures. I write programs on it. There is a thing. I posses this thing. It holds other things I posses that I can do neat stuff with.<p>But a weird thing happened. The arcade had sex with the IBM PC. That is, computers stopped being about &quot;things I own that I can do things with&quot; and became almost exclusively about the experience, the game. Having a good time.<p>If you&#x27;d asked me in 89 what the store would evolve into in 30 years, I&#x27;d probably say something about robots. Paper free, human free. Maybe humans out front to talk to people with robots working behind the scenes.<p>Instead, the computers controlled the workers. They took orders, they printed tickets to be stuck on boxes, they provided instructions, they tracked how much time the worker took for various things, they provided a cool interface for people to both order and see how their order was being processed. Who owned what that did what? Nobody cared.<p>If you have an enjoyable, perhaps addictive experience doing X, and it&#x27;s free, who cares about ownership or data? We never thought behavior&#x2F;experience and ownership would be separate, so we reason poorly about it.<p>On the old net, I would visit sites lovingly-crafted by their owners, with everything their owners enjoyed. We shared the experience of their creation, both creator and consumer. If there was a problem, I&#x27;d email. Your site doesn&#x27;t work. You own it. Fix it.<p>The new net is full of companies providing unique and fun experiences that people like, collecting data on their fellow humans like their lab rats with the exit strategy of being bought out by even larger companies with even more data. We create things we do not own. Instead we&#x27;re like prostitutes in a red light district that are forced to dance in glass windows. We are displayed. Our existence and the things we create is owned by others. They choose to show the parts of us as they will. Your data isn&#x27;t important. My experience online using some app is important. Everything else is subservient to that.<p>The old web is gone because it either died or was eaten by companies who understand the new selection criteria. Anonymity is gone. Privacy is gone. Ownership is gone.

AbVitro may to this day hold a special place in the annals of startups from the Church lab. After starting from only a little over $3 million in startup funding from a single VC firm, Sante Ventures, in 2012, the company was snapped up by Juno for $125 million four years later. That was followed by Celgene’s purchase of Juno, and more importantly led to several cell therapies now in the investigational new drug (IND) phase, according to Vigneault. “[Church] never had a really big success until we decided to do AbVitro and that one ended up knocking it out of the ball park. That triggered a lot of people to start companies because it looks easy from the outside,” he says. “It’s not,” he adds. [...] Whether or not AbVitro was the bellwether, the pace began picking up around 2015, and reached a fevered pitch in 2018.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>[...] biggest change from the past is that lab members are stepping up to take the role of CEO, rather than chief scientific officer (CSO) or chief technology officer (CTO). He sees an upswing in entrepreneurial verve across the university, but especially coming out of the Church lab. “They really have a desire to take on that business challenge of managing the company and growing the opportunity, seeking out the financing, seeking out the collaborations, and really focusing on the business aspect [...]<\/i><p>&gt; <i>[...] the current startup environment is different from that of the past in several significant ways. There is a very rich ecosystem of infrastructure for startups to launch into. “Places like LabCentral or Alexandria LaunchLabs are where you have a full BSL2 [biosafety level 2] lab ready to go and you can rent a bench on and have access to equipment for relatively small amounts of money,” he says. Access to capital is high for these kinds of ventures, he says, adding that a new breed of scientific founder is also emerging. “They have grown up in the era of startups, and have technology, multidisciplinary backgrounds across biology, computer science and engineering,”  [...]<\/i><p>&gt; <i>In addition, the technology may now be catching up with some of the Church “crazy” ideas of years past. Cain McCleary, of KdT Ventures, which has invested in two from this cohort and one a few years back, says, “I feel like he’s consistently been ahead of his time in creating tool sets, but all of a sudden, our analysis and manufacturing has caught up to it, so it’s a particularly special time for folks in his lab,” he says.<\/i>"],"time":["2019-12-31 22:59:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amelius"],"id":[21925921],"kids":{},"parent":[21918025],"text":["How many patents did this produce, and how many of them were essentially funded by public money?"],"time":["2020-01-01 02:05:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["buboard"],"id":[21926184],"kids":{},"parent":[21918025],"text":["how many of them were running away from academia?

In my estimation, they’re two different things.<p>Technical Writing is a profession with a massive set of practices, relatively well-prescribed goals, and a long history. It’s a discipline that has almost nothing to do with Stephen King and Strunk and White—though of course these sources might be applied. Chances are, if you were to ask an professional technical writer about resources for technical writing, they’d point you to a few text books on technical communication or papers or blog posts from people in the industry. Technical writing also has serious consequences. If a manual for a missile has mistakes, it could cost thousands of dollars or thousands of lives. Stephen King’s advice isn’t quite as helpful in such perilous situations.<p><i>Writing about technology<\/i>, I think, is closer to what the author is actually pursuing here—and most tech blogs better fit this classification than technical writing. Writing about technology is more free form, more whimsical, full of opinion, intimations of possible approaches or solutions but not hardened proceedural documentation.<p>It might seem a bit pedantic to make such a distinction, but I would really love it if more people honored it. For instance, this article was a bit of false advertising, since I thought it’d be about technical writing in the professional sense (i.e. writing documentation) and not about writing about technology in a more casual, opinionated way. It’s similar to the distinction between programming and software engineering—they’re quite distinct pusuits, even though the tools and techniques considered overlap."],"time":["2019-12-31 17:35:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baby"],"id":[21920140],"kids":[21920158,21921202,21921363,21920203],"parent":[21912898],"text":["This article is actually quite empty, it starts like it is going to be about how to write good technical content, then becomes an auto-biography, then becomes an article on how one can get started blogging, then just end abruptly with some statistics that probably nobody cares.<p>So if you came here to know how to write, Stephen King wrote a book &quot;On Writing&quot; that is quite interesting and mostly reads like a novel.

Focus on content, not on form. After a while, you can think about a domain name, about a custom theme, or about hosting this yourself on github with hugo. But don&#x27;t start with the technical parts of managing a blog, just write.<p>If you came here to understand how you can become a good technical writer: keep writing. Consistence over years of writing is what makes you a good writer. The ultimate technique for me is to give an interactive talk to people about your ideas, and see where your audience get stuck, where they ask questions, how different ways of explaining something get the point across.<p>Malcolm Gladwell does more than this: he explains an idea multiple times in different ways.

In most cases, it&#x27;s actually better to optimize afterwards (ie. prototyping and iterating), unless one has a specific algorithm or solution in mind beforehand.<p>The business lesson is similar, with the added twist of being a criteria wether you make it or break it.

There is so much software on windows that a centralized update system isn&#x27;t really tractable.<p>&gt;In certain cases it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find or update drivers for your hardware devices (anyone who&#x27;s tried to install a fresh Windows onto their laptop will testify).<p>Problem with the oem, not with windows. It&#x27;s up to the hw manufacturer to publish drivers in easy to find places.<p>&gt;Windows is extremely difficult to debug (e.g. try finding out why your system is slow to boot).<p>While not as easy as debugging with source Microsoft provides debug symbols for all major kernel components. This makes getting a kernel stack trace and examining structures very easy.<p>&gt;Windows boot problems are too often fatal and unsolvable unless you reinstall from scratch.<p>Only if you don&#x27;t know the correct utilities to use. Most boot issues can be fixed with a combination of bcdboot, bcdedit, and repairing the dism image. On the rare occasion that those don&#x27;t work you can go even deeper with a kernel debugger.<p>&gt;The Windows OS installer doesn&#x27;t give a damn about other OSes installed on your PC and it always overwrites the MBR. In case of already existing Windows installations, it sets the newly installed Windows as the default OS - no questions asked. In case of UEFI, booting of other non-Windows OSes is unsupported and Windows actively prevents this.<p>This was true back when MBR was used. It is now extremely difficult to use MBR with windows, and almost all other OSs support UEFI by this point. Saying booting of other non-Windows OSs is just wrong. This person&#x27;s source is a technet post, which you can consider the microsoft equivelant to stack overflow. The accepted answer is from a community moderator. In my experience if it&#x27;s not a Microsoft employee replying, then there&#x27;s a 90% chance that the answer is wrong. Windows does not wipe out any other UEFI boot application binaries or the boot nvar entires. It just adds its own binaries, adds a nvar boot entry, then set&#x27;s that entry as the default. Hitting your boot menu key when you boot will allow you to select any of the other entries, and your firmware setup utility will allow you to change the order in which they boot.<p>&gt;Windows anti-virus products oftentimes make your PC less safe - so if you want perfect security and privacy, stop using Windows and migrate to Linux right away. OEM updaters make your PC wide open for attacks.<p>For most power users, it&#x27;s true. AV products do increase your attack surface for only a small benefit. However, in a corporate enviornment with less tech savy users, they are extemely needed. People will just click whatever links and download and run anything.<p>&gt;Microsoft has recently decided that you will no longer be able to download certain Windows updates manually. You&#x27;ll only be able to get them via Windows Update.<p>That is 100% not what they&#x27;re saying. They&#x27;re just saying they used to publish the update files to two places, and now they&#x27;re going to reduce redundancy and only publish them to one, the update catalog. You can visit the update catalog in a browser and still download all of the updates.<p>&gt;&quot;sfc &#x2F;scannow&quot; is offered as a solution to most Windows Update Service and Microsoft Installer Service errors, yet in absolute most cases it&#x27;s totally ineffective.<p>This is commonly offered as a solution on community forums, but I rarely see it offered as a solution on official Microsoft documentation.<p>&gt;Windows does not automatically clean temporary files ever, however it must do that for every reboot&#x2F;power cycle - partially solved in Windows 10 1809.<p>This seems like personal preference to me. I&#x27;d rather keep %TEMP% around and only clean it out with cleanmgr when needed. Several browsers store their cache in %TEMP% and I&#x27;d rather not have that wiped out across reboots.<p>&gt;Windows keeps a large number of databases of the applications which the user runs: Windows Activity History, bam.sys, Prefetcher, Program Compatibility Assistant and others.<p>The only one you should be upset about is Windows Activity History. BAM is used to help determine when the machine is idle and background maintenance tasks can be performed without impacting the user. The prefetcher is used to speed up the initial start of applications. The compatibility assistant is used to help increase backwards compatibility with older software.<p>&gt;Safe Mode has become impossible to access unless you&#x27;ve booted into ... the running OS, which totally defeats its purpose. Also Safe Mode is hidden behind almost a dozen of steps vs. a single F8 key press on boot in every Windows version from 95 to 7.<p>True that they&#x27;ve made it much harder to access by default which I think is the wrong move. If you reset the computer while windows is in the middle of booting several times you&#x27;ll be brought to a recovery menu which will let you boot into safe mode."],"time":["2019-12-31 21:06:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Hackbraten"],"id":[21924033],"kids":{},"parent":[21923385],"text":["&gt; updates mean nothing for security because over 90% of infections happen due to the user&#x27;s actions<p>That’s mixing up cause and effect.\nIt’s a bit like saying vaccines are useless because 90% of people die from cancer and heart conditions."],"time":["2019-12-31 20:44:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21927050],"kids":{},"parent":[21923385],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-01 08:15:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["collsni"],"id":[21925746],"kids":{},"parent":[21923385],"text":["This is outdated.

Brown has much more to say about his own treatment than that of Gottesfeld.<p>Gottesfeld, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is serving 10 years for launching a botnet DDOS attack against Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital.<p>Sometime around 2013, (mostly) right-wing media took up the cause of Justina Pelletier, a teenager who had been referred by her physician to BCH and, after being admitted, had been taken into BCH&#x27;s custody after a court determined that her parents had been harming her and impeding her care. Her parents didn&#x27;t regain custody for over a year. The case is complicated, and nobody in it looks good.<p>Gottesfeld, a self-declared &quot;anon&quot;, decided to declare &quot;OpJustina&quot;, appealing for people to attack the facilities that had been involved in Pelletier&#x27;s care. He recruited a 40,000 node router botnet which managed to take BCH off the Internet for several days. In the process, he shut down their central prescription service, their physician scheduling system, and all email between doctors, as well as the fundraising page that had been his declared target. He also managed to disrupt systems at several other facilities, including Dana Farber and Harvard Medical, which were hosted on a related network.<p>The FBI very quickly tracked Gottesfeld down because one of the accounts he had used to cheerlead the attack was registered under his name. They obtained a search warrant and found computers with incriminating evidence. Gottesfeld retained Tor Ekelund, the well known CFAA lawyer, and met with the DOJ to discuss a plea, during which he admitted to the attacks.<p>He then fled to Cuba in an unmarked 23 foot open-cabin motorboat, with his wife, passports, cash, and computers. His boat lost propulsion off the Cuban coast and, unfortunately for him, he was rescued not by the Cuban Coast Guard but by a Disney Cruise Ship, which returned him to Florida, where he was promptly arrested.<p>At his detention hearing, the US Attorney stated for the record that the guideline range they had been contemplating at the time of Gottesfeld&#x27;s meeting was 3-4 years, and that there was some substantial possibility that, had he plead out before an indictment, he might avoid prison time altogether (at that stage of the investigation it may have been unclear how much damage Gottesfeld had actually caused). Instead, Gottesfeld fired and repudiated Tor Ekelund, and another lawyer, took his case to court, lost, refused to take responsibility after his conviction, offered a post-conviction memorandum stating that he was morally required to DDOS BCH and that he&#x27;d likely do it again, and managed to secure for himself a 10 year sentence.<p>I guess my point is just, don&#x27;t be this clown."],"time":["2019-12-31 17:15:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fsloth"],"id":[21921590],"kids":{},"parent":[21920454],"text":["Anonymously DOS:sing a hospital because a few families disagreed with their policies is not a heroic work of hactivism.
