Both internally, and in the API used by games on top.<p>We used Emacs-Lisp to generate a collection of C++ classes with all of the arithmetic operaters that were allowed, and only those.  &quot;friend&quot; is your friend for this in C++.<p>We mostly used floating point to represent values, but could also use integers with scale factors (automatically applied in the operators), which is nearly equivalent to fixed point.<p>For things where vectors made sense, 1d, 2d and 3d vector types were available.  So Position2d and Position3d.<p>Absolute and relative values were distinguished: You could substract two absolutes to get a relative, but you couldn&#x27;t add two absolutes.  You could add a relative to an absolute to get an absolute.<p>And for time intervals we used wraparound arithmetic and comparisons, like the Linux kernel has the time_before() macro, so absolute times could continue &quot;growing&quot; without overflow in a running game.<p>Using the classes looked like a bit like this:<p><pre><code>    Position3d p1, p2;\n    Direction3d d = p2 - p1;\n\n    Absolute_Time t1, t2;\n    Time_Interval t = t2 - t1;\n\n    Velocity3d v;\n    object.set_position(p1 + t * v);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThese types were used pervasively throughout all the game engine, gameplay logic, &quot;AI&quot; and so on.<p>The constraints provided great type-checking and effectively documented a lot of code as well.<p>This being a game engine, they had to be fast.  So they were all inline methods, in classes containing just a number, or up to 3 numbers for vectors.<p>Using GNU C++ this compiled down to the same machine code as if we hand-coded the arithmetic in the traditional way; we checked.  So there was no runtime cost.<p>It was very satisfying to use."],"time":["2020-01-26 22:43:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stellalo"],"id":[22151009],"kids":[22152542,22151522],"parent":[22135981],"text":["Julia has the Unitful.jl package for handling units: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PainterQubits&#x2F;Unitful.jl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PainterQubits&#x2F;Unitful.jl<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-26 08:53:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jakeogh"],"id":[22151073],"kids":{},"parent":[22135981],"text":["pint wrapper that does fuzzy matching: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jakeogh&#x2F;unitcalc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jakeogh&#x2F;unitcalc<\/a><p><pre><code>   unitcalc 50stones kg\n   unitcalc 1lightyear nm\n   unitcalc 7fortnights decades\n   unitcalc 99mi&#x2F;sec fathom&#x2F;month\n   unitcalc 3.14radians&#x2F;fortnight degrees&#x2F;ms\n   unitcalc 0.2W eV&#x2F;century\n   unitcalc 0.2J&#x2F;ns ton_TNT&#x2F;month\n<\/code><\/pre>\nPint is excellent.

You can make your compiler fail in cases when you implicitly fallthrough. So, not as elegant, but you can ensure you don&#x27;t mess up and get the wrong behavior.<p>* (Type syntax: Nope, C++ has the contrived syntax of C.)<p>* Weak typing: With a library, you can have strong aliases which are not interchangeable with the aliased type. See this blog post: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foonathan.net&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;strong-typedefs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foonathan.net&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;strong-typedefs&#x2F;<\/a>\nand the library it links to. Things would be better, though, if the C++ standard committee allowed for an operator.<p>* Bytestrings: This is a library issue really. And both C and C++ have libraries which deal with wider characters, with UTF-8 and what-not.<p>* ++ and -- : You don&#x27;t _have_ to use them... and it&#x27;s possible to have static tools which forbid them in source files.<p>* !

Monadic-style programming is not yet supported and will likely not be in C++20, but there are discussions about this.<p>* Nulls: With `std::optional` and `gsl::non_null`, and especially with no return types necessary, you can comfortably avoid using `nullptr` in C++ code.<p>So - with some choices and a little discipline (really not much!), you can have all of this &quot;Odinish&quot; behavior you like.<p>Of course - the price of C backwards compatibility and supporting multiple programming paradigms is complexity of the formal language definition, grammatic ambiguity, and a syntax that is not always pleasant."],"time":["2020-01-26 01:23:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["discreteevent"],"id":[22149181],"kids":[22149692,22149657,22149854,22149386,22149769,22150257,22150371,22149996,22150202,22149648],"parent":[22148274],"text":["They are right about null.

I use Blue Iris, which has the downside of requiring Windows, but the upside of generating MQTT messages or HTTP requests on alerts which makes for a lot of easy integration. Xeoma is cross-platform but relatively immature (although I&#x27;ve found the vendor to be extremely responsive to emails) and has a bizarro-land UI that&#x27;s very tricky to learn to use.<p>On the other hand, consumers don&#x27;t necessarily need to deal with any of this, because lots of vendors sell NVR appliances that are hardware and software in one product, and they&#x27;re pretty cheap. Costco even regularly carries them from a couple of major manufacturers. I prefer to do things myself, but I&#x27;ve used appliance NVRs from Swann in a couple of cases and they work fine with extremely easy setup. More recently Ubiquiti has gotten into this space, and I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try their system yet but their products tend to be pretty good quality and ease of use for the rock-bottom prices - and as I understand it their premises-based NVR also runs the UniFi manager, so it makes it really easy to build out a large-campus WiFi-based solution but might also be a neat trick for home use if you want to use the great-for-the-price Ubiquiti APs and&#x2F;or USG.<p>At the end of the day, I&#x27;m not convinced that cloud-based surveillance solutions really offer much to consumers beyond being backed by vendors with very aggressive marketing. Most people know about Ring cameras but don&#x27;t know that they can buy a completely non-cloud, on-prem solution-in-a-box at the big box store or even, well, from Amazon.

Eukaryotic mRNA almost always contains poly(A) tails, which are added post-transcriptionally in a process known as polyadenylation. It should not therefore be surprising that positive-strand RNA viruses would have poly(A) tails as well. In eukaryotic mRNA, the central sequence motif for identifying a polyadenylation region is AAUAAA, identified way back in the 1970s, with more recent research confirming its ubiquity. Proudfoot 2011 is a nice review article on poly(A) signals in eukaryotic mRNA.&quot;<p>Edit: A more recent (2017) study than Proudfoot 2011 offers the perspective that the process may be more tissue specific. From Tian B., Manley J.L. Alternative polyadenylation of mRNA precursors. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 18:18–30:<p>Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an RNA-processing mechanism that generates distinct 3' termini on mRNAs and other RNA polymerase II transcripts. It is widespread across all eukaryotic species and is recognized as a major mechanism of gene regulation. APA exhibits tissue specificity and is important for cell proliferation and differentiation. In this Review, we discuss the roles of APA in diverse cellular processes, including mRNA metabolism, protein diversification and protein localization, and more generally in gene regulation. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying APA, such as variation in the concentration of core processing factors and RNA-binding proteins, as well as transcription-based regulation."],"time":["2020-01-26 02:23:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TrueDuality"],"id":[22149865],"kids":[22149962],"parent":[22149652],"text":["It blows my mind that we&#x27;re at a stage of scientific exchange where this kind of discourse and genetic information is so readily available at people&#x27;s fingertips."],"time":["2020-01-26 02:48:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["voldacar"],"id":[22150110],"kids":[22150319,22150151],"parent":[22149652],"text":["The very first nCoV genome sequencied earlier this month[0] ends with 33 As, while the genome of the virus found in the first U.S. patient[1] ends with only 12 As.<p>Is it normal for there to be variation here?

If they crossed the gulf of space, they likely used fusion or some other power source. A ground side civilization could sift helium3 from the oceans for thousands of years without a noticeable depreciation. If they used power satellites, those would likely have fallen from orbit or been knocked out of the Earth-Moon system within hundreds to thousands of years.<p>Within human history, many of the same geographical areas of the world have been good places to live for thousands of years. But when you extend that to hundreds of thousands to millions of years, those places generally change drastically and disappear. One could assume, for the sake of argument, that aliens colonizing Earth might have similar biological needs as we do and would live in similar areas of the distant past. We might not easily find those places now given environmental changes over geological ages.<p>We also are still very early in exploring the solar system. It’s plausible there could be remnants of mining and manufacturing in places we haven’t looked. It’s important to remember that if your civilization is colonizing a new system, you’re already a space based society. It’s then reasonable to expect little on the ground industrialization since most of your infrastructure will be in space.<p>There’s a new study talking about solar electrostatic effects on the Moon and how it causes lunar dust to rise and drift around despite no atmosphere. Given long enough spans of time this might even conceal evidence of prior space-based industrialization.<p>One big red flag to me that this hasn’t happened in Earth’s history is the biological record. We have a fairly good overall map of biology over large areas of the world. Everything alive here seems to come from here. There’s nothing alive that doesn’t appear to use the same general base chemistry and biology as everything else.<p>If some aliens showed up a hundred million years ago, we might expect to see some distantly evolved branches of life that are somewhat different in at least DNA or other chemistry. We might find something like this but it’s unlikely.<p>The follow-on to that might be an argument that all current life is descended from some ancient aliens. That could be true but it would be nearly impossible to tell at this point. All life seems to have a common descent with no aberration, so following up on this line of thought is extremely difficult to test for.

The army removed all traffic signs in case of an invasion [0] and stores did not sell road maps anymore. Swiss German is (as most dialects) notoriously difficult to learn in later life for speakers of other dialects.<p>(Slightly related story: some years ago, I traveled back to Germany by train. A few minutes past the border, German border control went through the train and asked me for my ID card. I then realized that I had left my German ID card in the scanner at home a few days earlier because I needed a copy of it. The border control then naturally went through my backpack, which (what I then realized with horror) contained ca. 30 packs of matches. A few weeks earlier, we had a BBQ at a local lake and realized on the way that we had no matches to lit the fire, so we went to the next supermarket and just bought the cheapest offer, which happened to be a pack of 30. So there I was, crossing the border with no identification and nothing on me but a backpack full of matches. When they asked why I had so many matches on me, my 20-year old brain went into full self-destruction mode and I stuttered the following: &quot;He-he-he, its not enough to build a bomb, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;.<p>Luckily, I have an accent which makes it absolutely clear that I grew up around a major city in my home state. After asking me some questions about my birth town, other personal facts and making some calls, they didn&#x27;t even fine me.

There is no commitment to support, nor willingness to open source or find other remedies (or even pay them for continued support, which I offered in my letter).<p>Of last note: we have decided to dump Sonos permanently and will actively avoid doing business with the company again. It’s a fairly tone-deaf response unfortunately.<p>Curious if others are as unhappy as we are? We are just disappointed.<p>Anyways, the response:<p>Thank you for contacting Sonos Customer Care. I understand your frustration with the end of software updates announcement.  Please know that we in no way mean to render your system inoperable or brick the devices. The trade-up program you mentioned bricking units is entirely voluntary and a multi-step process to ensure it is not mistakenly activated on the system.<p>Your devices are not being end-of-lifed by any means; they are simply not receiving new update information beyond a certain version. This is due to the available memory and processing power available in our legacy line of devices. This is specifically what separates them from modern and legacy. The Legacy devices have hit a point where in order to keep allowing new features; we would have to remove old features because there is simply no room left to store the new data for newer technologies or changes in outdated technologies no longer used by our partners. It is similar to having all seats on a plane full and telling someone already boarded that they need to get off. To keep your system functioning as it stands; we need to halt the progression of the software.<p>Once the change is made, your Sonos system will no longer receive regular updates, so your experience will initially remain the same. However, the functionality of features and services will be impacted as technology evolves over time. The thing to worry about once this takes place is the third party services and partners offered through our platform. Using Spotify as an example; if they change something in the way Sonos accesses their service then your System not receiving new updates will not be able to accommodate this.<p>However, since this won&#x27;t be in effect until May of 2020; we are still working on figuring out workarounds and things of that nature for all of our customers who will possibly be affected by this change. Just keep an eye out on alerts from us. Once we do have that information, we will gladly share that with you.<p>More information here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.sonos.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;article&#x2F;4786\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.sonos.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;article&#x2F;4786<\/a> \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.sonos.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;article&#x2F;4798\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.sonos.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;article&#x2F;4798<\/a><p>Our commitment is to support products with software updates for a minimum of five years after we stop selling them, and we have a track record of supporting for longer.<p>The Trade-Up eligible devices all have newer counterparts that allow the old connection types while also integrating new features.

They have just about the best update support in tech. Some of these devices have been around since 2005. They have been providing longer-term support than Apple has for their iPhones, for instance, which in turn is much better than you get from Android.<p>Updates cost money, and Niley Patel speculates that Sonos is losing money on older devices with all of the updates they have been providing. But the devices still work, which is a testament to their build quality. Sonos needs to figure out a solution.<p>There are some solutions:<p>1) I don&#x27;t know how separated and abstracted their development process is, but, ideally, they would be able to continue to provide security updates, even if older devices don&#x27;t get anything beyond that. But how many years should they do? 10? 20?<p>2) Sonos could sell extended support for devices that people have owned after X amount of years. Even charging $19.99 a year for a household would probably put this back in the black. If people are going to use Sonos products for 10-20 years and often have expensive and complicated setups, they should figure out some long-term support.<p>3) Sonos could start to become a SaaS company and largely lease their speakers. Microsoft is starting to do this with the Xbox, and it is a way around this issue. As hardware gets too old, Sonos would replace it with newer hardware. There is a reason that more and more software is subscription-based.<p>3) Sonos could come up with a premium subscription offering that bundles in long-term support. Eero has Eero+, which I find to be a good product, and it&#x27;s how they get into the black on hardware sales.<p>I&#x27;m working on a longer write up about this for Medium, but this isn&#x27;t as easy of an issue to solve as many make it out to be. Providing infinite support for networked-based devices will eventually put you out of business. Sonos is the one dealing with this because they have been selling these speakers the longest, and they have people who are able to use their devices for a long time.<p>One issue I think they are running into is that they used to update products pretty infrequently. They didn&#x27;t even do small step updates to keep the CPU and networking equipment updated. This is particularly an issue with the 1st gen Play 5 that they sold for about a decade.<p>People who bought a Play 5 15 years ago should not continue to expect support. People who bought one five years ago should. They have the same exact internals.<p>That was a mistake, and they should make sure they are upgrading the internals in every device every three years or so. Had Sonos been doing this, they would be talking about far fewer products.<p>Sonos has devices that range from 32 GBs of ram to 1024 GBs. The delta in their older stuff and their newer stuff in terms of tech is huge. This strategy is on their old CEO, and their new CEO believes Sonos has to update their stuff more often. It&#x27;s probably going to take a few years for the update cadence to sort itself out, but in the meantime, they are kind of in a quagmire."],"time":["2020-01-27 02:51:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zwp"],"id":[22153229],"kids":{},"parent":[22151212],"text":["I have another that I sometimes use: overriding getenv(3).

The point of the paper seems to be to argue that we can reduce transmission by reducing contact (obvious), and concludes that we should do this pre-emptively at large scale worldwide (never going to happen, only good for alarmist headlines).

But instead of citing a virology paper, he cites an interesting but not very relevant evolutionary dynamics paper that draws on a particular mathematical model. In fact, the real world is complicated, and if anything virology tells us the opposite: zoonotic viruses tend to become less virulent over time, as the tradeoff between transmission and lethality is optimised.

I do find the monitor much more usable in Linux with i3 managing windows and workspaces than the occasions I need to develop on Windows (on Windows, I hate how windows just pop up pretty much where-ever). When working I tend to keep two windows side-by-side, one for my editor and the other for whatever I&#x27;m working on (terminal instance, android emulator, website, etc). I then use hotkeys to switch instantly between workspaces so it&#x27;s quite fluid, but the monitor plays less into that. When I first bought mine I had visions of using 3 windows side-by-side, but I just never do that in practice for some reason. I also run everything at 1x scale, so the added vertical screen real estate (1440 vs 1080) is quite useful.<p>I use LG monitors almost exclusively, but that&#x27;s simply because of cost—they&#x27;re almost always cheaper than other brands and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with them.

Back in 2016, EPA released a report [1] that was years in the making, which covered the history, science, and effects of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. The executive summary [2] says that produced water can contain &quot;naturally-occurring organic compounds, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX); and oil and grease; radioactive materials, including radium; and hydraulic fracturing chemicals and their chemical transformation products.&quot; It also discusses spills from evaporation ponds (e.g., a 2.9 million gallon spill in North Dakota in 2015 that flowed into Blacktail Creek), as well as exacerbation of local droughts due to groundwater withdrawal for fracking.<p>Unfortunately, as happens these days, when the draft report was released in 2015, conservative news outlets [3][4][5][6][7] grabbed hold of a single statement in the executive summary reflecting the usual statements of uncertainty in any scientific report, and they used that to imply there was no evidence of any consequences of hydrofracking on the environment or human health. The draft report&#x27;s statement that they took hold of was: &quot;We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States&quot;. However, the very next paragraph explains &quot;This finding could reflect a rarity of effects on drinking water resources, but may also be due to other limiting factors. These factors include: insufficient pre- and post-fracturing data on the quality of drinking water resources; the paucity of long-term systematic studies; the presence of other sources of contamination precluding a definitive link between hydraulic fracturing activities and an impact; and the inaccessibility of some information on hydraulic fracturing activities and potential impacts.&quot;<p>Even in 2016, when the final report was released, a WSJ article [8] insisted EPA had &quot;political scientists&quot; who rewrote the report to cast doubt on the safety of hydraulic fracturing.

And the MERS virus in the Middle East may have come from an infected camel.<p>This appears to be a logical and scientific deduction.<p>So for this Coronavirus, it appears to follow the same pattern. Infected animal feces mutated into some virus, that made the transmission to humans.<p>My theory, is that perhaps an infected animal’s feces, may have mixed with other fluids, like blood, from freshly slaughtered animals, and mutated into something that infected a human with a weakened immune system (easy target), who then transmitted it to other healthy humans by contact.<p>On one hand, it does seem that the best way to guarantee that you’re sourcing your meat from a fresh and healthy animal, is to pick the animal that you want, and to slaughter it on the spot. This means that the meat vendor does not have to maintain a refrigeration system, and you don’t introduce other chemicals or salts to preserve your meat.<p>But the problem is that you have to keep the animals in captivity, and the meat vendor must handle, and clean all their urine and feces. And when animals get sick, their feces and urine gets infected, thus you increase the probability of an outbreak like this.<p>What’s the solution? Maybe China must begin eliminating wet markets, and eliminate the practice of keeping live animals in captivity, in order to minimize the incubation, mutation, and the transmission of such viruses.

In a July article in the journal Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Mr. Shoham said the Wuhan institute was one of four Chinese laboratories engaged in some aspects of the biological weapons development. He identified the secure Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory at the institute as engaged in research on the Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. The Wuhan virology institute is under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But certain laboratories within it “have linkage with the PLA or BW-related elements within the Chinese defense establishment,” he said.

As a journalist, you&#x27;re like everyone else : you&#x27;re an employee. You can have ethics, you can have thoughts or a list of rules. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a job and if your boss asks you to do something completly stupid, you can either say no, loose that job and possibly die of hunger. Or you roll with it and hope very very hard it will not stay on the internet. (Spoiler alert : it will and you&#x27;ll be ashamed of it all your life.) You do have rights in some countries; but first, like many rights, not everyone know them; and second, those rights don&#x27;t necessarily protect you. Maybe the media can&#x27;t fire you right away or because you refused working, but a few months later, when they&#x27;re considering reconducting your contract, you&#x27;ll just get cut.

The Windows room was always full and the unix room always empty. So I sat in the Unix room behind these machines that never crashed and had access to not only all the others in the room for doing interesting distributed things, but also to the 2 E450&#x27;s in the basement of the college. While the Windows machines were on another network and were just basically crashing all day long (got a lot better with win NT obviously but still wasn&#x27;t great). I later learned that the school head sys admin seriously hated Windows and loved Unix. So he basically ignored everything happening in the Windows world and just switched off the entire room at night while the Unix machines had uptimes that felt impossible if you compare them.<p>Ofcourse, as the PC won, the room with the Sun machines was replaced with Windows machines; I got 10 SparcStation 5&#x27;s (with the gigantic CRTs), a few SparcStation 1&#x27;s, few UltraSparcs (5+10) and an E450 after they removed all.

I noticed that sometimes the real page would flash up and then go to the block page. After a while, I found out it was simply serving a &quot;redirect&quot; if the page contained banned keywords.<p>My 14 year old brain figured that I could make use of iframes so that the top section of 1 pixel height got given all of the &quot;redirects&quot; whilst the bottom half opened up google.com, where we could merrily search for games and proxies. This worked until I got VNC&#x27;d one day, logged off, account banned and the blocking system updated to filter prior to connection.<p>---<p>Still wanting to play games, I went to a friend&#x27;s home (I didn&#x27;t have internet back then), downloaded the entirety of a games website using a crawler and then brought the flash games in on a memory stick. As some of the teaching software also used flash player, this method of playing games was good until the every end.<p>---<p>My friend was watching all of these little tricks and thought they were cool. I wanted to try some things that would require two people to pull off. One lunch time we go to the library (the only machines in the school I can actually use now) and start experimenting with emails. It turns out that we could set custom rules.<p>A few minutes later, he has a rule that emails &quot;Hi&quot; every time I send him an email, and mine in return says &quot;Hey&quot;. We trigger this snowball off... 500 emails... Haha. 5000 emails... Still funny. 50,000 emails - erm. 500,000 emails, the computers are grinding too a halt. Disk space on everybody&#x27;s accounts is evaporating.<p>Email system starts sending out &quot;Unable to send message, not enough space&quot;. Few, we thought. But each one of these messages was a few kilobytes, and each one triggered a new one (as there wasn&#x27;t any space for that either). Suddenly the number of emails starts growing again as each of our accounts gets an automated space message.<p>We undid the rules and held the delete key for 30 minutes, there was still 500k emails when we left for class, but it wasn&#x27;t growing any more. I assume an IT guy saw what we did, because the next time I logged on, the rules were disabled and the emails were gone.<p>---<p>Some of the kids in the school had started to give me a &quot;hacker&quot; status and then one kid started to claim he was much better than me. Challenge accepted. I wrote a simple javascript webpage that would keep opening itself up,m saying something like &quot;you think you&#x27;re a hacker?&quot; in every page. Crashed my machine - perfect I thought.<p>I email him this web page, he opens it, crashes his machine. He thinks this is as brilliant as I did. He emails it to all of his friends. Their machines also crash. They email it to their friends, etc, etc.<p>The next day I get pulled into the deputy-head&#x27;s office, complete with angry IT staff. Apparently all of the kids using computers that day decided that it was a perfect way to get out of working, claiming their work had been lost (Word even back then had recovery options). Two weeks ban from using any computer. I got asked where I got it from - at the time I said &quot;I downloaded it from some website&quot;, but I wish I had told them that I had learned javascript and created it from scratch.<p>---<p>&quot;Trolling&quot; had become a thing, where you would try to cause somebody an inconvenience and leave a troll face there to let them know it was on purpose. Some of our exploits included taping a troll face to the underside of a laser mouse, unplugging mice&#x2F;keyboards and taping troll faces over the USB ports, swapping people&#x27;s mice over so that they controlled each other&#x27;s computers, turning everything upside down in the settings when somebody left their computer unlocked and left the room, holding down sticky keys to crash the computer out whilst making an awful noise, etc. We got quite creative with this.<p>---<p>Printing was done by room, with printers automatically added to your account depending on where you log in. In one of our classes there was an &quot;expensive&quot; glossy colour A3 printer, where the teacher would monitor what it was used for. We figured it did no authentication and that we could copy the printer settings and print remotely. We could also pretend to be another user as it didn&#x27;t connect at all to the user database. In a class with a few friends in, we remotely printed large cartoon pictures. Apparently the teacher was frantically trying to find the person who was printing and they all had a good laugh. They then took that printer off the network.<p>---<p>File explorer back then was patched so that we couldn&#x27;t see network drives and even if we could, we couldn&#x27;t get onto them. A few teachers sharing their screens would leak the fact that they had a private staff share. Child mind: Challenge accepted.<p>After several failed attempts using browsers and explorer, we discovered that Microsoft Office wasn&#x27;t patched. Suddenly we could access other student&#x27;s work spaces and save files in there. We could access staff&#x27;s work spaces and save files in there. We could access IT work spaces and save files in there. We occasionally left a &quot;I&#x27;m watching you&quot; file (created at home so it didn&#x27;t have our user account metadata) in random staff accounts.<p>At this point I think we were on their radar, but they needed proof. One afternoon we access the headmasters work space, who apparently left files on his desktop with his various login details. A bunch of students could now pretend to be the headmaster (we didn&#x27;t as we knew this was suicide). (Turns out later that this headmaster was stealing school funds, so in retrospect I don&#x27;t feel bad.)<p>We then found the &quot;program&quot; drive. It was a literal jack pot. Installation binaries with site-wide licenses. Back then there was no IP checking, one of these licenses was golden. We could install thousands of dollars worth of software at home for free, including Adobe everything, Maya and other 3D packages, office and every other custom piece of software.<p>Stupidly I had shown other people how to do this and they were running through the network like a bull in a China shop, triggering lots of errors, and as it turned out - getting lots of attention. In bursts a network administrator and he shouts my username into the room. This was the &quot;oh shit&quot; moment. I was dragged into the headmasters office whilst my teach protested that I was a good pupil.<p>I sit there whilst being berated, the network admin wants to call the police - whilst he wafts a large document full of screenshots in his hand (50+ pages). (Apparently they kept screenshots for evidence as I caught them off guard and they didn&#x27;t have video capture.) They come to an agreement that I am indefinitely banned from using a school computer with no police involvement, as long as I give them all of my exploits. As a child I don&#x27;t see any way out and agree. They handed me single piece of A4 paper and said &quot;write everything you know on here&quot;. Before I put even a single word to paper, I replied: &quot;Can I have some more paper please?&quot;."],"time":["2020-01-26 01:24:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jstewartmobile"],"id":[22148764],"kids":{},"parent":[22137250],"text":["Undertaking nerd-duel with low pay disrespected computer lab janny is shameful.

However, this is likely to be a overestimate since there may be a far larger pool of people who have been infected by the virus but who have not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital and so have not been counted in the data. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Another key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves.

I believe the javascript is easily portable to other scriptable window managers.)<p>My rationale for developing lrtile is the following:<p>I like having window corners on a grid because it helps locating information.<p>However, in many tiled WMs, resizing one window causes resizing of nearby ones (very distracting) _and_ windows generally do not overlap (a severe limitation especially on small screen). Finally, shortcuts to place windows on half or a quarter of the screen are often built-in (in chrome, windows, spectacle default...) but very few WMs have larger, configurable grids suitable for large monitors (I use a 40&quot; 4K screen).<p>lrtile addresses the above problems as follows:<p>- the grid is configurable;\n- movement&#x2F;resize only affect the current window, allowing overlap if user wants;\n- commands are arrows + 1&#x2F;2 modifiers, and try to be intuitive\n- screen borders act as hard stops, also making behavior more intuitive.<p>In detail, I typically use a 6x6 grid on small screens (so I can have halves or thirds) and 12x10 or even bigger on large screens. Each window side must be at least two units, and resize extends or reduces one dimension at a time and by one unit.<p>My typical workflow is to make windows visible with a comfortable size and no overlap, and occasionally expand the window I care about (e.g. make the browser wider when a page does not render well; or expand the editor window vertically when I want to see a larger chunk of code), reverting back when done. The fact that move and resize commands are very similar to other cursor movements makes the operation very quick."],"time":["2020-01-25 19:33:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xrd"],"id":[22144310],"kids":[22144360,22144430,22144366],"parent":[22143415],"text":["Is there something similar for Linux?

It&#x27;s fascinating reading.<p>To summarise, the facility in Nesvizh was a common type of irradiation faciity\nwhere product, such as food or medical equipment, is sterilised by circulating\nit around a radiation source by a system of conveyors.<p>In Nesvizh, the conveyors would often jam and the operators of the facility\nwould have to shut down the irradiation process by storing the source in its\nsafe position inside a dry pit, then enter the irradiation chamber to un-jam\nthe conveyors [2].<p>The day of the accident, the operator circumvented all the safety procedures\nand entered the irradiation chamber when the source was in the unsafe position\n(he thought it was secured). What is really striking is that he would have had\nto work really hard to circumvent the physical safety mechanisms in place to\nstop this from happening. The irradiation chamber was built as a spiral maze\nwith thick concrete walls. The entrance to the maze was protected by a\nretracting section of floor that exposed a &quot;chasm&quot; considered too deep and\nlong for a person to jump over it. The way to the center of the chamber, were\nthe source was, was lined with pressure plates and motion sensors that, if\ntripped would trigger an alarm that would cause the source to be automatically\ndropped in its safe position. It was basically like a room with traps in a D&amp;D\ndungeon.<p>And yet the operator of the facility managed to circumvent all those safety\nmechanisms and accidentally kill himself as a result. He died before he could\nexplain how he did it- so for example noone has any idea how he managed to\ncross the &quot;chasm&quot; in the entrance. But what seems reasonable to assume is that\nhe had done this many times before.<p>The reason he did it of course was that sticking to the safety procedures\nmeant that the operation of the facility would have to be stopped temporarily\n- which slowed down production at the facility.<p>____________________<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iaea.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;4712&#x2F;the-radiological-accident-at-the-irradiation-facility-in-nesvizh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iaea.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;4712&#x2F;the-radiological-acci...<\/a><p>[2] It seems this is a common occurrence in this kind of facility: there are\ntwo other IAEA reports on radiological accidents that started with a conveyor\njam inside an irradiation chamber that caused operators to override safety\nprocedures.

But magnetic North moves by dozens of miles each year, and has shifted from Russia to Canada and back, moving by hundreds of miles.<p>The closer you are to the poles the more inaccurate compass readings will become. Based on the alignment of old stone walls[0], they think over the last few hundred years magnetic north has drifted by around 7 degrees in the northeast US, should be worse in England.

Plate boundaries are geological faults (dislocations where the crust on one side of the fault slides past the other side), but there are also faults within the plate interiors, especially near the boundaries, that accommodate strain within the tectonic plates in &#x27;deforming zones&#x27;. The rigid interiors of plates generally have strain rates at the nanostrain&#x2F;year level, i.e. a few parts per billion or less per year.  This means that the relative <i>deformation<\/i> (not plate motion) between say Florida and Denver is on the order of 1 mm&#x2F;yr.<p>Plate motions are pretty constant through time, such that the velocities measured over 10 year scales with GPS and other geodetic techniques are quite comparable to velocities estimated over the past ~5 million years by looking at longer-term proxies such as the bar-code-like pattern of magnetic anomalies on the seafloor produced at divergent plate boundaries[1].  Within about 20 km of an active fault, or 200 km from a subduction zone, the instantaneous velocities have a lot of variation related to earthquakes, though.<p>The horizontal velocity of any point on the Earth&#x27;s surface can be described as a rotation around another point on the Earth&#x27;s surface, with some angular velocity; this is sort of a corollary or application of Euler&#x27;s fixed point &#x2F; rotation theorem[2]: the point is where the rotation axis intersects the Earth&#x27;s surface (so there are two antipodal points, actually).<p>Because tectonic plates are mostly pretty rigid, the motion of plates on the Earth&#x27;s surface can be modeled as a rotation around a single point, even when the plate is huge like the Pacific plate, i.e. almost a hemisphere. However as stated in the OP, there is no &#x27;true&#x27; reference frame, so plate velocities are usually described relative to another plate as a reference frame, or just considering a pair of plates.  We&#x27;d say that relative to the Pacific, the North American plate rotates around a point near Hudson&#x27;s Bay, or equivalently, that the Pacific-North America rotation pole is near Hudson&#x27;s Bay. To go from N. Am. relative to Pacific, to Pacific relative to N. Am, flip the sign on the angular velocity.<p>Therefore there is a bit of shared heritage between some aspects of graphics programming and tectonic geodesy, with respect to the mathematics of rotations, etc. However in practice the math is probably different (I&#x27;m not sure because I don&#x27;t do graphics or game programming). For a good intro to the math used in this aspect of plate tectonics, see here[3].<p>In terms of the rates of the velocities, relative plate motion rates between adjacent plates are typically 1-10s of cm&#x2F;yr.  The fastest on earth is near Tonga and Vanuatu in the southwestern Pacific (north of NZ), at about 25 cm&#x2F;yr.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divediscover.whoi.edu&#x2F;mid-ocean-ridges&#x2F;magnetics-polarity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divediscover.whoi.edu&#x2F;mid-ocean-ridges&#x2F;magnetics-pol...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euler%27s_rotation_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euler%27s_rotation_theorem<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websites.pmc.ucsc.edu&#x2F;~thorne&#x2F;EART118&#x2F;Lecture_PDF&#x2F;lecture20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websites.pmc.ucsc.edu&#x2F;~thorne&#x2F;EART118&#x2F;Lecture_PDF&#x2F;le...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-25 20:52:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["The_mboga_real"],"id":[22145630],"kids":{},"parent":[22145303],"text":["2020.
