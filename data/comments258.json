Well, because in the morning the calls started again and the cart was breaking. Let me write here once, so I don&#x27;t have to get up six times.<p>1. These were no &quot;exercises.&quot; The circus that Sokolov arranged in the Ministry of Socks [Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation ~Editor] is at most an &quot;interagency meeting.&quot; Any military man will tell you that &quot;Exercises are combat training activities, where the troops solve tasks on the ground in conditions that are closest to combat, large-scale comprehensive training operations.&quot;<p>And in the ministry they held a MEETING. That&#x27;s all.<p>2. Hysterical squirrels rush about the Internet with stories that &quot;everything broke !!! aaaa !!!&quot;. Say hello to them.\nIn fact, of course, the two dozen morons sitting in the office could not break anything. First of all, who would let them, the morons, onto real networks?<p>3. The proof that all those who gathered for the “exercises” are first-class morons was that when they were talking nonsense about the “18 attack scenarios”, nobody laughed. Everyone sat with serious faces and nodded their heads.<p>I&#x27;ll explain: &quot;attacks through the SS-7 protocol&quot; is about telephony. Not about the Internet. SS-7 (aka OKS-7) is, roughly speaking, the protocol by which signaling data for dialing is transmitted. The fact that we have not heard for a hundred thousand years that someone “broke the phone number” tells us that the telephone operators are working and the holes (yes, there were holes) were closed. Well, the figure of 62.5% of successful attacks, firstly, tells us that in two-thirds of the calls we could not get through, and secondly - how, tell me, from 12 attacks the figure could be 62.5%? ? Is this a successful attack in 7.5 cases out of 12?<p>Further, Diameter protocol is likewise not related to the Internet. Google what Diameter is already. Hint: This is a service authorization-authentication-accounting protocol that is used in IMS networks. This applies to mobile communications and IP telephony. To IP-telephony, in short. But not to the internet. Well, half of the successful attacks tell us that these numbers were obtained &quot;at a training ground&quot;, which was set up by bungling dumbasses, or simply thought up.<p>4. I want to remind you that there is no &quot;sovereign runet&quot;. It was not built. And the forecast for the &quot;construction&quot; of this crap is 5 years, minimum. Look: for the first year they will only work on a sub-law and write a technical assignment. Then for two more years they will work out the engineering solution. Which will become obsolete exactly at the beginning of implementation. And then they will implement it for another three years - Rostelecom only has seven macro-regions and 79 branches. Just to bring equipment to everyone is already an impossible task for assholes from the offices. And it, equipment, also needs to be installed, commissioning, acceptance, testing, signing of acts ... Well, trust me - RTK can delay projects for decades ... I can say exactly the same thing about other &quot;very large operators&quot; . And it didn’t get into a fucking little thing - imagine a box designed by the morons from the offices.<p>Therefore, I repeat, any failures on the networks can be justified by anything, but not by “sovereign runet”.<p>Enough hysteria!&quot;"],"time":["2019-12-24 19:46:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["woodandsteel"],"id":[21888389],"kids":{},"parent":[21872308],"text":["For years Putin&#x27;s defenders here at HN would talk about the great benefits he was bringing the country.

Disclaimer I’ve not yet touched v13.<p>The good; The OCA (community association), the people (both community and Odoo), the basic framework gets you up and running fast. You can tell it’s grown over time, and it’s got sharp edges, but you can get what you need done. Not necessarily in the prettiest way. The backwards compatibility and desire to not break the core APIs is generally good from what I’ve seen so far. Individual modules depends how much Odoo themselves lean on it afaict. GitHub access for partners and direct source access to both enterprise and community editions has been extremely helpful.<p>The bad; imho testing is a pain. The ORM uses Polish notation to build filters, which if you’re used to SQL is frankly irritating to work with. The ORM itself is quite clever, but it’s also not like any ORM I’ve worked with. The dev docs aren’t great, beyond the basics. The quality of modules in the “App Store” is extremely hit or miss. Odoo official “support” as a partner is questionable. I feel like they’re under pressure to get you to pay up to be a partner and then some period of time you might get help later. Anecdotally I’m led to believe our partner account manager has been pushing us hard to host a local event at our own cost (I’m not that involved with that side). The last few versions have seen more accounting features drop out of community edition. Some of the official apps are basic.<p>Is it better than SAP, Dynamics, etc.? Probably not.

This time is 0(n), where n is the total size of your app, including transitive dependencies. It takes time to load, parse, and validate non-native code.

Shared library loading is more expensive, but not much, and way less than loading source code or byte code.<p>The tldr is if you want a fast starting non-native app, you have to shrink the transitive dependency closure your app loads to do it&#x27;s job. This is easy for toy benchmark apps but can be harder for real apps. It also goes against the philosophy of most devs to rely on third party libraries for everything.

That test was supposed to be a secret experiment, but because it was so large it became an instantly known international incident.  Wikipedia says the planned detonation was 6 megatons, though video documentary puts the planned detonation at closer to 4.5 megatons.  Even still it would have been the largest man-made explosion to that point.<p>The actual explosion was somewhere between 14.5-15.5 megatons.  The failure was a misunderstanding of basic chemistry under nuclear conditions.  Scientists knew at the time that explosive force could be multiplied by an order of magnitude by wrapping a nuclear bomb device in fissile material thereby creating a multi-stage detonation.  The first stage is the nuclear bomb itself and the second stage is the reaction of the fissile material to the intense heat and pressure thereby becoming fuel for an additional layer of explosion not used by the initial nuclear detonation.<p>The reason for a multi-stage devise is that a nuclear core has a specific job and the fuel of the second stage would not help achieve that job.  The second stage only becomes valid once the first stage is complete.  But that second stage fuel isn&#x27;t stable.  It is a rapidly decaying material, which in this case was radio isotope lithium 6.  To increase stability the second stage material was wrapped in a blanket of lithium 7.  lithium 7 is a heavier radio isotope, but it does not decay in a way that makes it a fissile material.  Specifically, Lithium 6 decays into tritium when bombarded with neutrons and tritium is a very unstable radio isotope of hydrogen with 3 neutrons that is the core of the infamous H-bomb.<p>What scientists didn&#x27;t know at the time is that under the heat and pressure of a nuclear detonation lithium 7 sheds a neutron and rapidly becomes lithium 6.  That effectively means Castle Bravo was the first 3 stage nuclear bomb where all material supplied decayed in a specific order to become fuel in separate stages and each stage magnifying the explosive capability.<p>Local islanders were impacted by that detonation, but so were many American observers and scientists 30 miles away.  The local islanders, and a Japanese fishing vessel, were further away than the Americans in that area, but were in the path of high altitude wind flow.  The largest environmental failure from this was the inability to contain the resulting toxins.  Trace amounts of fallout would eventually reason Japan, India, and the US.  The entire local region was contaminated in a way that would only be understood or measurable over decades due to the increased presence of heavy metals in the ground and water resulting in toxic food supplies and heavy metal poisoning.<p>* Castle Bravo - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castle_Bravo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castle_Bravo<\/a><p>* Radio Isotopes of Lithium - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Isotopes_of_lithium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Isotopes_of_lithium<\/a><p>* Bikini Atoll - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bikini_Atoll\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bikini_Atoll<\/a><p>* A good video documentary - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qM4ZYQmFGlw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qM4ZYQmFGlw<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-24 15:49:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["monster_group"],"id":[21875251],"kids":{},"parent":[21870906],"text":["FTA - “While it is true that these people do not live the way that Westerners do, civilized people, it is nonetheless also \ntrue that they are more like us than the mice.”<p>I find this statement callous and shocking.

The core proposition is that you get to calculate the sum of n floating point numbers with O(eps) precision instead of O(n × eps). Sounds appealing.<p>But it seems to me that that&#x27;s rarely what you want. In practice, those n floating-point numbers are probably themselves approximations of some other real numbers, and what you actually want is the sum of the latter. But if each approximation is about O(eps) off—and it has to be, given the limitations of floating point representation—the total sum will end up O(n × eps) off even before you factor in errors in the summation algorithm.<p>So from that point of view, Kahan summation gets you from O(n × eps) + O(n × eps) = O(n × eps) to O(eps) + O(n × eps) = O(n × eps). I guess you could win a bit or two from constant factor improvements, but this like a really modest gain for such a major investment (linked page claims Kahan summation is four times slower than the naive one).<p>But it seems fairly popular nevertheless, so there must be something that I&#x27;m missing.

Along with a reasonably good choice of where the line would run, and where the stops would be, the city embarked on a rezoning project that would allow the space near the line to become medium (or in one case) high density. I am not saying it is a perfect system, but all it took to change peoples commuting behaviour was the availability of a good alternative to cars.<p>There is more than just initial design, however: there are many design elements that add to its drawing power. These include accessibility, good &quot;way finding&quot; signs, frequency of trains (every 3 minutes in busy times), safety on platforms, and (for me anyway), signs that accurately show arrival times of the next three trains.<p>Of course, there is still the problem of making the system useful for people who are not close enough to walk to a stop, the answer being good feeder bus service and car parks. In this respect, Vancouver has been less successful. For example, only a few bus stops have electronic signs showing the arrival times of the next bus, and bus frequency on all but the major routes is too low.<p>My point is that good overall design is the almost certainly the most effective way to change people&#x27;s commuting behaviour."],"time":["2019-12-24 17:00:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nradov"],"id":[21872662],"kids":[21875205,21873953,21873211,21872938,21872941,21875279],"parent":[21872401],"text":["The authors missed some important causes about why commuters prefer to drive personal vehicles.

I didn&#x27;t invent Protocol Buffers, but I did write version 2 and was responsible for open sourcing it. I believe I am the author of the &quot;manifesto&quot; entitled &quot;required considered harmful&quot; mentioned in the footnote. Note that I mostly haven&#x27;t touched Protobufs since I left Google in early 2013, but I have created Cap&#x27;n Proto since then, which I imagine this guy would criticize in similar ways.<p>This article appears to be written by a programming language design theorist who, unfortunately, does not understand (or, perhaps, does not value) practical software engineering. Type theory is a lot of fun to think about, but being simple and elegant from a type theory perspective does not necessarily translate to real value in real systems. Protobuf has undoubtedly, empirically proven its real value in real systems, despite its admittedly large number of warts.<p>The main thing that the author of this article does not seem to understand -- and, indeed, many PL theorists seem to miss -- is that the main challenge in real-world software engineering is not writing code but changing code once it is written and deployed. In general, type systems can be both helpful and harmful when it comes to changing code -- type systems are invaluable for detecting problems introduced by a change, but an overly-rigid type system can be a hindrance if it means common types of changes are difficult to make.<p>This is especially true when it comes to protocols, because in a distributed system, you cannot update both sides of a protocol simultaneously. I have found that type theorists tend to promote &quot;version negotiation&quot; schemes where the two sides agree on one rigid protocol to follow, but this is extremely painful in practice: you end up needing to maintain parallel code paths, leading to ugly and hard-to-test code. Inevitably, developers are pushed towards hacks in order to avoid protocol changes, which makes things worse.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to address all the author&#x27;s points, so let me choose a few that I think are representative of the misunderstanding.<p>&gt; <i>Make all fields in a message required. This makes messages product types.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>Promote oneof fields to instead be standalone data types. These are coproduct types.<\/i><p>This seems to miss the point of optional fields. Optional fields are not primarily about nullability but about compatibility. Protobuf&#x27;s single most important feature is the ability to add new fields over time while maintaining compatibility. This has proven -- in real practice, not in theory -- to be an extremely powerful way to allow protocol evolution. It allows developers to build new features with minimal work.<p>Real-world practice has also shown that quite often, fields that originally seemed to be &quot;required&quot; turn out to be optional over time, hence the &quot;required considered harmful&quot; manifesto. In practice, you want to declare all fields optional to give yourself maximum flexibility for change.<p>The author dismisses this later on:<p>&gt; <i>What protobuffers are is permissive. They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up and serve you something that typechecks, regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s meaningful.<\/i><p>In real world practice, the permissiveness of Protocol Buffers has proven to be a powerful way to allow for protocols to change over time.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s an amazing type system idea out there that would be even better, but I don&#x27;t know what it is. Certainly the usual proposals I see seem like steps backwards. I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong, but not on the basis of perceived elegance and simplicity, but rather in real-world use.<p>&gt; <i>oneof fields can&#x27;t be repeated.<\/i><p>(background: A &quot;oneof&quot; is essentially a tagged union -- a &quot;sum type&quot; for type theorists. A &quot;repeated field&quot; is an array.)<p>Two things:<p>1. It&#x27;s that way because the &quot;oneof&quot; pattern long-predates the &quot;oneof&quot; language construct. A &quot;oneof&quot; is actually syntax sugar for a bunch of &quot;optional&quot; fields where exactly one is expected to be filled in. Lots of protocols used this pattern before I added &quot;oneof&quot; to the language, and I wanted those protocols to be able to upgrade to the new construct without breaking compatibility.<p>You might argue that this is a side-effect of a system evolving over time rather than being designed, and you&#x27;d be right. However, there is no such thing as a successful system which was designed perfectly upfront. All successful systems become successful by evolving, and thus you will always see this kind of wart in anything that works well. You should want a system that thinks about its existing users when creating new features, because once you adopt it, you&#x27;ll be an existing user.<p>2. You actually <i>do not want<\/i> a oneof field to be repeated!<p>Here&#x27;s the problem: Say you have your repeated &quot;oneof&quot; representing an array of values where each value can be one of 10 different types. For a concrete example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re writing a parser and they represent tokens (number, identifier, string, operator, etc.).<p>Now, at some point later on, you realize there&#x27;s some additional piece of data you want to attach to every element. In our example, it could be that you now want to record the original source location (line and column number) where the token appeared.<p>How do you make this change without breaking compatibility? Now you wish that you had defined your array as an array of messages, each containing a oneof, so that you could add a new field to that message. But because you didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re probably stuck creating a parallel array to store your new field. That sucks.<p>In every single case where you might want a repeated oneof, you always want to wrap it in a message (product type), and then repeat that. That&#x27;s exactly what you can do with the existing design.<p>The author&#x27;s complaints about several other features have similar stories.<p>&gt; <i>One possible argument here is that protobuffers will hold onto any information present in a message that they don&#x27;t understand. In principle this means that it&#x27;s nondestructive to route a message through an intermediary that doesn&#x27;t understand this version of its schema. Surely that&#x27;s a win, isn&#x27;t it?<\/i><p>&gt; <i>Granted, on paper it&#x27;s a cool feature.

This has 137 points right now and I don’t even think it makes much sense; it sounds as though they stopped short of understanding the reasoning behind many of the limitations and just assume they are mistakes, when I’d argue it makes a ton of sense from a PoV of how protos work.<p>Like why can’t you repeat a oneof? Imo because it stops acting like a oneof. A oneof is treated like a union in the generated code, and you can expect that only one of the oneof message tags will appear in binary for that message. If you want a repeated oneof, it’s actually no different than if you had all of the fields be repeated and outside of a oneof. It gives a different interface in generated code but it’s the exact same thing you’d want in the underlying proto binaries: multiple of whichever message tag. The distinction of oneof is not useful here.<p>I think the proto design is quite smart, OTOH. Like the format is designed to allow backwards and forwards compatibility provided you follow some rules that you can easily enforce via linting.<p>Yes, there are some slightly odd side effects. Many things in proto are special cased. Like Map can’t be repeated because Map is already repeated; maps are sugar for repeated pairs, and you can’t have a repeated repeated field. You can of course just make a quick submessage with a map and repeat that. It doesn’t seem like that big of a deal.<p>OTOH, for how simple protobufs wire format is, the sugar features like Map help make it feel a bit richer from the PoV of the generated code, whereas the simple wire format makes it more predictable, easier to understand under the hood, and helps to future proof for new features.<p>Seriously, binary protobuf is so simple <i>anyone<\/i> can parse it trivially. It’s just a flat sequence of pairs, of a message tag and the corresponding data, with 5 different wire types that do not specify any typing but instead only how to interpret the wire data (IIRC: variable length w length prefix, 4 byte intrger, variable integer, group start and group end, where ‘group’ refers to nested messages.) The wire type is encoded in the lowest 3 bits of the message tag. The message tag is written as a base128 variable length quantity, which is just an integer where each byte has a high bit specifying if there are more bytes, and low bits specifying binary data in least significant first order. The remainder of the bits are just the tag of the field from the proto file. The length prefix variant uses a second base128 vlq to specify length.<p>Protos are clever: the protobuf compiler itself compiles protobuf definitions into protobuf messages called descriptors that can be passed to a languages own protobuf compiler through standard in. These descriptors also get encoded into the resulting output because they can then be used to perform reflection.<p>Speaking of reflection, you can also have a bunch of metadata in the form of extensions and message&#x2F;field&#x2F;enum&#x2F;etc. extension options. You can use these at runtime, or you can write custom protobuf plugins. I am doing both of these things simultaneously for different purposes in some projects; it helps me organize schema information and couple it with metadata.<p>I don’t think protos are perfect, but I do think they are clever and useful for what they are used for at Google. I actually personally suspect they are a bit underrated because outside of Google it’s not always completely obvious how to use protobufs to their fullest. That said, nothing’s perfect and protos are certainly full of weird quirks. But if you embrace them, I think there’s a lot of elegance to be found lurking beneath.<p>That is all.

The difference between healthy team growth and politically-motivated empire building always feels obvious in retrospect, but it&#x27;s much harder to identify as it&#x27;s unfolding within your own company.<p>It&#x27;s easy to blame middle managers for playing politics when they focus on empire building above all else, but usually they&#x27;re just responding to what upper management rewards.<p>At one of my first Big Company management jobs, I naively thought I would focus on building a small, nimble team of top-10% engineers. We would work cohesively in small but highly efficient teams to deliver results. And it worked! We delivered great things to high praise from our customers faster than expected. Sales were up, customer feedback was up, but politically, we were suffering within the company. A few reasons:<p>- HR and upper management didn&#x27;t like engineers being paid significantly above average. Hiring 2-4 top-10% engineers and paying them accordingly attracted a lot scrutiny and criticism from management. Teams who hired 10+ average engineers at average compensation didn&#x27;t have any problems. Politically, the best move was to ignore the best candidates and focus on hiring as many average candidates as possible.<p>- Upper management used headcount as a proxy for estimating each team&#x27;s contributions to a project. If I had 2 principle-level software engineers leading an initiative but my peer allocated 5 junior engineers to his portion of the project, he might collect more credit when those personnel reports go out. Politically, you wanted more names to put in slide decks and more lines on the personnel report spreadsheets wherever management wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the details.<p>- The empire builders always had idle hands among their growing headcount, so they were always available to &quot;save the day&quot; by allocating some spare engineers to other department&#x27;s problems. Ironically, this made it more difficult for other departments to hire more people because management remembered the &quot;save the day&quot; move more than the core work delivered. Politically, if putting out fires is rewarded above all else, you want as many idle hands as possible to assign at a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>- Empire builders always had poor performers available to take blame and get fired. Small teams of high performers couldn&#x27;t spare anyone. When we had budget cuts and headcount reductions, the empire builders always had a few people they could fire with zero consequence to the team. The smaller teams suffered when they lost one of their key performers. Likewise, when empire builders had a project fall behind or fail, they always had an underperforming employee around who could take the blame and get fired, and they also had someone else who could step up and take credit for rescuing the project.<p>Through all of this, management had no idea they were encouraging empire-building over productivity and cooperation. They were just rewarding what they saw through their slide decks, spreadsheets, and other narrow snapshots of the company that didn&#x27;t really reflect who was delivering the most value.<p>Fixing these problems always starts with management. Be very careful about what you reward. And be very careful about how you measure success, because your employees will notice.

TLDR: I like overnight trains because they sometimes fit my schedule perfectly and the experience can be awesome.<p>This really made me want to take a trip to see my dad. My father lives ~600km away from me; whenever I go visit, I tend to stay for a weekend so I don&#x27;t miss work and I have the choice between driving, train or plane. I take the train most of the time, my friends and family give me a hard time for it all the time because it&#x27;s more expensive and takes a longer time.<p># Driving &#x2F; bus ($)<p>We have horrible roads, terrible drivers and it would take me around 7.5 - 8 hours to do this. The bus needs to stop for toilet breaks, in multiple cities so it&#x27;s probably a cramped 9.5-hour road. Also driving myself, leaving Friday after work would render me useless the next day and then Sunday I&#x27;d have to come back.<p># Train ($$$)<p>Leaves Friday at ~20:30 (8:30PM) and arrives Saturday morning at ~07:00. That&#x27;s 10 hours of journey BUT, I go to the train station at around 20:00, I eat something, usually get a bottle of wine and hop on the train.<p>There, I usually get a single cabin ( also went with 2 people in the cabin, with 4 people and even with 6! just for the adventure ) with a private shower and toilet inside. I take a quick shower because I usually go straight from work, I then kinda chill and enjoy the landscape, open up the wine, start reading a good book and really by midnight, the gentle rocking of the train and the moonlit mountains knock me out. Maybe the wine also.<p>In the morning, a knock on my door usually 30 min before arriving at the station, it&#x27;s the steward bringing me a sandwich, coffee&#x2F;tea, and water and letting me know we&#x27;re about to arrive. From there, I walk to my dad&#x27;s house (it&#x27;s around a 15-minute walk) and there I am ready to hang out Saturday the whole day and Sunday up until ~20:30 again when I leave for home.<p>In the morning, I take a shower, eat breakfast at the train station and head off to work.<p># Plane ($$)<p>If I don&#x27;t go to work Friday and Monday, I choose this option, alas I don&#x27;t like wasting two days of vacation for a two-day weekend stay so I rarely do this. If I go I either go for a full week or just the weekend.<p>So, the plane leaves Saturday at 06:45... that means I need to be at the airport at 5:30, which means I need to leave my house at 04:00. This means that Friday, I get home, pack and of course try to sleep until around 03:00 and can&#x27;t and when I finally sleep the alarm goes off.<p>I usually get an overpriced bottle of water and because the distance is so small, I can&#x27;t really get any good sleep so it&#x27;s around an hour cramped up trying to somehow sleep. After this wonderful time, I arrive but wait, my father lives in another city with no airport, so the closest airport is 90 minutes driving. He needs to also wake up on a Saturday at 06:00 to come to pick me up.<p>Once I get there, it&#x27;s all fine and nice, we talk and laugh but when I get home I can&#x27;t help crashing. That means I wake up somewhere afternoon, groggy and go eat something with my dad and catch up. Then I usually get tired in the evening and I kinda need to go catch some shut-eye because Sunday morning at 06:45 the plane flies back home. This time I sleep no problem, but we still need to wake up early as hell, and then I get worried for my dad when he drives back.<p>Note that in this case, the plane is cheaper than the train, it&#x27;s because I usually go in a single cabin luxury 1st class (lol, it&#x27;s really not as fancy as it sounds, here are three pictures from the last time I went[0]).<p>Paying a grand total of ~110€ vs the cheaper ~30€ flight to get there and back and spending more time on the road might seem dumb, but I think, in this case, it&#x27;s really worth it. The cheapest way to get there and back by train, in a sleeping cart is also around 30€.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;dquwwJF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;dquwwJF<\/a> - note the two beds, that&#x27;s the double cabin.

However, in my opinion there would likely be some costly mistakes made before humans can reap its full benefits. We have been seeing a lot of AI developments but in reality it hasn&#x27;t really brought us many meaningful changes as we had expected. In general our daily lives still remain pretty much the same as before. Our civilization has never experienced significant AI impacts at a large scale so mistakes may be hard to avoid, and it will serve as lessons for later generations not to repeat those same errors.<p>I have noticed human emotions and intelligence seem to be at odds with each other. Sometimes they are even a trade-off. The increase of one may lead to the decrease of the other. If we look around, humans today have the most advanced technologies in history, but are our lives really better compared to people&#x27;s in the past? Materialistic wise, certainly yes because they are products directly produced by technologies, but mentally and emotionally it could arguably be worse.<p>AI and techs keep getting better and better everyday, but then human have to work more with longer hours and higher stress. We all thought the machines are supposed to help us human but it&#x27;s actually the other way around. We work tirelessly days and nights in order to keep making those machines better and more advanced, but in return our lives have not seen many meaningful improvements, and even arguably worse than before in some areas. Individually our personal ability has limits and naturally it evolves very slowly, but the power of AI machines is potentially unlimited and growing at an even faster rate than Moore&#x27;s law. We seem to be collectively working to make machine much better than us while we are remaining relatively the same individually. Are technlogies actually enslaving us?<p>We keep buying things that don&#x27;t really serve us much. We have a lot of stuff now but they don&#x27;t mean much. If something broke, meh we will just get another one. It&#x27;s just another item and it will get shipped here tomorrow. We didn&#x27;t have as much in the past but every little thing carried much greater value. Even the most simplest thing could fascinate and brought us joy.<p>We humans today already operate based on rules and algorithms dictated by the machines. We still don&#x27;t know how our brains function organically (memory, consciousness, etc...), but in the quest of trying to make AI becoming human-like, we have created AI neural networks to simulate our brain. The danger is that even though we still don&#x27;t know how our real brain functions, but we have now turned around and claimed that the human brain works in a similar way under the same principles of an AI neural network. We are enforcing AI rules onto ourselves.<p>This is a dangerous assumption to make simply because AI does not have emotions. Once we begin to operate strictly under these rules and principles that are dictated by AI, we would soon lose the attributes and characteristics of what made us human. Our emotional spectrum may get increasingly shorten.<p>TV shows and movies are an example as they are a form of story telling that have biggest influences on us at the emotional level. It&#x27;s no coincidence that &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; are still the two best tv shows today. Many movies that are considered as best were also made from a while ago. Despite the most advanced technologies, why is it that today we can&#x27;t seem to tell stories that bring out the same level of emotional reponse and intensity as before? They all seem to lack the genuity and inspiration that the previous generation once had.<p>Is it because AI do not understand human emotions so its algorithms cannot accurately factor that into consideration? One can say that today humans are the ones who write those algorithms so maybe we can add in compenents to account for that? But just like the example above, if we don&#x27;t even understand how our brain works, how can we simulate the machine to accurately reflect us? In the future, machines are supposed to learn and write all the codes by itself without human intervention, what would likely happen then? Would we still retain the ability to even understand those codes? Would it possible that human may slowly evolve into machines? In trying to make those machines becoming like us, we may instead become like machines."],"time":["2019-12-25 01:21:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["codingslave"],"id":[21874866],"kids":{},"parent":[21872293],"text":["Dark ages of AI is a meme like dunning krueger effect"],"time":["2019-12-24 21:57:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["account73466"],"id":[21874690],"kids":[21874928,21875095,21874739],"parent":[21872293],"text":["This time it is different.^{tm}<p>More seriously, we are almost about to<p>i) Generate a good book using a short intro.<p>ii) Generate a meaningful video using a few photos and a basic text scenario.<p>Which makes us closer to generate movies on demand (say in 2025) and then good luck to people claiming that the current progress in AI is a bubble."],"time":["2019-12-24 21:30:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stickfigure"],"id":[21872832],"kids":[21874453,21873011,21875561,21882688,21884986,21894451],"parent":[21870889],"text":["I boil it down to two things:<p>#1 Rapidly Climb Learning Curves<p>The ability to quickly learn enough about new subjects to be useful.

Despite my inflated self image and overly optimistic assessment of my own intelligence, and despite the fact that I am convinced I would have little trouble convincing an f500 company to give me the title of senior engineer, I know that I can never attain the &#x27;seniority&#x27; my brother and friend already possess.<p>Having scanned through the responses, I didn&#x27;t immediately see the specific behaviors I have found in top engineers. First of all, I disagree with the humility trait. I would not call top engineers humble. I would not call them arrogant either. Top engineers have strong opinions, yet are flexible. They have their ideas about best practices, yet are 100% comfortable adopting something else.<p>Using a stupid example in software development, tabs or spaces. Number of spaces. Top engineers will have their preference, whichever it is. And they have thought about it, deeply. Not just from their perspective, but from the perspective of all engineers, future, present, and past. You may probe as deeply as you want, they will have looked at it from every possible angle and will be able to explain to you in every detail why they prefer the one over the other. And! This is so, so important... And! They will put their preferences immediately to the side if that&#x27;s just not how things are done on this particular project, in this particular team. I wish I had better words to convey this thought...<p>Top engineers will work with what they have to get to where they want to go. And, that&#x27;s not just the technology, it&#x27;s also the team. Senior engineers in your team will automatically make everything better. Sometimes their value is educating the entire team on best practices, sometimes it is just driving towards success despite the all of the feces.<p>Sometimes they might come over as arrogant, because they can speak with confidence on certain topics. That&#x27;s another thing that sets top engineers apart from junior and regular engineers, whenever they speak with confidence, it is because they are in fact confident. And they are only confident when they have analyzed an issue sufficiently deeply and from everyone&#x27;s perspective that they are comfortable being probed deeply.<p>When they do not speak with overzealous confidence, it is because they are still learning about the subject. And they will learn and analyze it deeply if that is necessary.<p>A single inconsistency, or a single counter example, or even a single ambiguity is sufficient for them to reconsider their position completely.<p>Also, senior engineers will never assume they know anything. They tend to listen attentively whenever anyone is talking. When someone says something &#x27;stupid&#x27; they won&#x27;t assume that the person is stupid, or said something stupid, they will assume they did not understand something and ask for clarification. They tend to not jump to conclusions... If something is ambiguous, they will identify it and ask for clarification. As a result, they will often ask for follow-ups in the future... such as: &quot;Thanks for the information, can I get back to you if I have more questions?&quot; Now that I think of it, I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen someone whom I consider to be a top engineer not keep that door open....<p>I hope this helps."],"time":["2019-12-29 15:40:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ilaksh"],"id":[21877246],"kids":{},"parent":[21870889],"text":["Maybe some don&#x27;t subscribe to narcissistic worldviews."],"time":["2019-12-25 07:38:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hadiz"],"id":[21872500],"kids":[21872984],"parent":[21870889],"text":["Play video games.

That&#x27;s because we programmers have gradually have replaced everything we use with open source - compilers, editors, web servers, libraries for just about everything.  Even stuff we use play with rather than get paid for is replaced - like photo and video editors, 3D printers, model plane piloting software.<p>It&#x27;s easy for us, and cheaper in the long run, and given enough time the end result is better quality than the proprietary stuff because we all pitch in to knock off the paper cuts.<p>But it really is a case of &quot;scratching itches&quot;, so if a programmer doesn&#x27;t get itchy about something then it usually won&#x27;t have an open source version.  It&#x27;s not hard to find examples.  There are some usable PCB design tools out there - but 3D mechanic drafting tools weren&#x27;t a thing until 3D printers tickled our interest in that area.

I couldn&#x27;t write something like this comment. Much like Twitter, it&#x27;s good for casual conversation with lots of people reading and participating in realtime, but it&#x27;s bad for in-depth discussions, and you get the phenomenon where either complicated ideas are needlessly split into multiple messages, or they&#x27;re just not said at all because simple ideas (which aren&#x27;t necessarily correlated with <i>better<\/i> ideas) drown them out.<p>- As a result, it&#x27;s hard to use it as a platform to design software. You can talk about things, but you really want to switch to a place where you can write multiple paragraphs for design. Even git commit messages accommodate multiple paragraphs. Mailing lists are well-suited to this.<p>- Also, you can&#x27;t post things like crash logs, screenshots, diagrams, etc. without using a third-party service.<p>- There&#x27;s no central public log. Yes, third-party IRC loggers exist, but <i>Freenode<\/i> as a platform doesn&#x27;t offer one. If you want to exchange ideas, it&#x27;s important that they be recorded for at least some amount of posterity.<p>- Relatedly, there&#x27;s no way to read the history of a conversation if you&#x27;re not online at the moment. Again, yes, third-party IRC loggers exist, as do bouncers, screen sessions, etc., but there&#x27;s nothing built into the platform.<p>- There&#x27;s no threading or topic separation of <i>any<\/i> sort. Even bulletin boards of the early &#x27;00s let you subscribe to an entire bulletin board and have multiple simultaneous discussion topics. The only way to do that on IRC is to have multiple channels, and there&#x27;s no way to keep subscribers in sync across channels, so people tend not to create channels very often. Other topic separation tools: separate threads on a mailing list, separate bugs on a bug tracker, separate posts to Reddit or HN or Discourse, even Slack threads as mediocre as they are, even <i>separate areas of the page<\/i> on an unstructured wiki (think <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?ThreadMode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?ThreadMode<\/a>, or talk pages on Wikipedia).<p>- As a result, it scales poorly to large numbers of users. I was in #rust on Mozilla IRC for a while when the language was young, helping people out; as the room got busier, it became harder to have a conversation more than a few messages long because something else would come up (and again, each message had to be short, so it was hard to discuss anything of complexity).<p>I can&#x27;t imagine any way to have <i>every<\/i> programmer on it (the way that every programmer could, theoretically, be on StackOverflow - and much less theoretically, I&#x27;d expect almost every programmer <i>reads<\/i> StackOverflow) and have it possible to get any value out of it.<p>Also, this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of the Freenode subreddit.

I’ve read anecdotes on entrepreneurship being on the decline, but it pains me to read so many negative takes on startups. We’re actively training our young people to avoid taking risks, and it’s going to fuck us — especially if some of those young people have the ambition be early employees at, say, a startup that takes on climate change in a big way.<p>Look — the fact that Garry knew Peter Thiel when he was 23 is nuts. When I was 23 I was broke and living with my parents in the suburbs outside Toronto. I didn’t even personally know any other software engineers. I think many people here would relate more similarly to that position.<p>Just because he won the social lottery early, doesn’t mean his lessons are wrong. I got a junior engineering job in Toronto when I was 23, at a startup, making less than Garry. $57.5k CAD. I worked on  my open source portfolio and next took a job in another startup in SF for $120k USD the next year.<p>That startup failed. I took a brief job at a biotech startup after being turned down by Google and Facebook (twice). After three months I quit that startup to run the company I’m still running today, four years later. Today, we’re very fortunate to work with some of the largest companies in SV.<p>Reflecting on this: I think a better story Garry could’ve told is not that he missed out on $200M, but that startups basically built his network so that — years later — he’d be a prominent VC working with Alexis Ohanian, funding the next round of exciting companies. $200M is an eye-catching clickbait headline, but not the real substance. The real substance is — how the fuck did he meet Peter Thiel at 23, and how can somebody recreate that?<p>In the story I just told about myself, I got really lucky as a function of working at startups. I didn’t really make any money doing it. But a whole bunch of interesting things happened:<p>- The first job in SF I worked at introduced me to a product manager who went to school with Aston Motes, employee #1 at Dropbox who would eventually be an investor in the company I run today.<p>- The founder of that first failed company introduced me to AngelPad, the accelerator that gave me my first $50k in financing. The fact I stuck it out as an engineering lead at a failing startup helped: I gave it my all. (Aside: YC turned me down. Twice.)<p>- The biotech company I worked at was founded by two early SpaceX employees, one who would also become an investor later on.<p>Don’t work at startups to make $200M. Work at startups because you’ll work with people who have risk profiles that are much more likely to generate outsized returns as a group. You’ll have the opportunity to join or create a community of high-performing folks that, in aggregate, outperform anything you can do on your own. Maybe you’ll be the CEO one day, maybe not, but no matter what you are very likely to come out ahead if you apply yourself.<p>And don’t let the comments here dissuade you. Startups are hard, but they kick ass. I’ve cried myself to sleep some nights — as both an employee and CEO — and still wouldn’t change the experience for anything. I’m a better person because of what I’ve been through."],"time":["2019-12-23 19:35:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jarjoura"],"id":[21867200],"kids":[21867788,21867591,21869193,21867315,21867557,21868506,21869179,21868250,21869056],"parent":[21865065],"text":["For all the startup founders and VCs in this conversation, you are cheap motherf*ckers.

Buying engineering talent at early stages should be no different in 2019 in my opinion.<p>We don&#x27;t have to rob Peter(Founders) to pay Paul(non-founding employees) and pitch one against the other.

From personal experience I&#x27;d guess that most non-sales employees at the big tech companies are actually creating negative value for the business (not contributing enough to profit to pay their comp and benefits). This mainly seems to happen for two reasons:<p>1. Career incentives for decision-makers (Eng. and PM management and directors) are almost totally disconnected from the profitability of the business. You can definitely become a superstar by building something wildly profitable, but that&#x27;s the hard approach. The easier and more common approach is simple empire-building: Gather a larger and larger team, and have more projects and launches under you. The projects don&#x27;t necessarily even need to <i>intend<\/i> to make or save money - you get to pick the metrics you target, and you can probably find some that indicate you&#x27;re successful! The overall impact is mis-allocation of talent on a pretty grand scale.<p>2. On a more micro-scale (within teams), engineers are <i>terrible<\/i> at focusing on things that are good for the business. If you leave an engineering team alone, they will spend 90% of the time rewriting systems that already exist to make them simpler, easier to modify, etc. They will normally accomplish this! But the rewritten systems will do almost nothing to increase how much money the company makes, and it&#x27;s rare that it will save enough resources to be worth it (engineers are expensive).<p>Both big tech companies I&#x27;ve worked at had what seemed like a relatively small set of teams focused on the core of the business, who were laser-focused on improving revenue or reducing the cost of core infrastructure used around the business.

If anything, that outsized return proves just how rare this kind of outcome is. If you look at the YC startups graduating every year, <i>maybe<\/i> 1 will ever generate $20mm for an early employee, let alone $200mm. Joining a new startup for that kind of outcome is stupid, even (especially?) if the founder is a big personality.<p>2. What is the bizarre pie chart in the middle of this post supposed to show?

Apple and Microsoft both earn more than Google, don&#x27;t they?<p>Bottom line, if you care about comp, you should know that no early stage startup of any kind offers an expected outcome remotely close to the big tech companies. Yeah, you might make a few million after working your ass off for many years. But realistically, you won&#x27;t. But you <i>would<\/i> make close to that (or more) if you worked for the big tech companies for those same number of years, at a much lower risk.<p>If you want to do the startup thing, do it as a founder, not an employee. Start with 30-100% of the equity, not 1% or 2%.<p>Again, I&#x27;m a fan of Garry&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m very skeptical of these posts by VCs trying to convince you it&#x27;s a good idea to work at an early stage startup. Startups are great for them since they have a whole portfolio of companies to spread their risk across, but it&#x27;s a shit deal for employees if you care much about comp.

Some kinds of startups are effectively impossible to build given current structural constraints on financing them, creating an adverse selection for startups that fit the classic model rather than startups with the highest expected ROI.<p>Broadly speaking, engineers will work at a discount to market-clearing wages of maybe 20% if they really like the startup. This is not necessarily an issue if you are well-funded and require ordinary levels of skill from your engineering team, which is most startups. Some types of software startups can&#x27;t be built without a team of engineers where the market-clearing wages are typically more like $500k-1M. Even at a 20% discount to market, the amount of capital involved just for headcount is far too large for early stage investors, and startups that try to fit within the capital they can raise by getting by with less qualified engineers always fail at technical execution. Consequently, startups that have this property are effectively un-investable because there is not enough capital available in the early stages to achieve technical viability even though they may be great investments in the abstract. This wasn&#x27;t a serious issue a decade ago, but it is spreading to a larger set of startups as wages rapidly escalate.<p>Given a long-term glut of capital, this could be addressed in principle by designing a model that modifies the distribution of capital&#x2F;equity over time to accommodate startups that have difficulty financing the initial wage gap. As the startups grow, one would expect the average wages to start reverting toward the mean, but these startups won&#x27;t get out of the gate without that initial investment in capable and very expensive engineers.<p>I&#x27;ve had interesting and productive discussions around this, it is seen as a way to bring fresh blood into an early stage pipeline that is drying up. It is obvious to almost everyone that the classic model of how you finance and build a startup team is breaking down in the current market environment, with an adverse impact on expected returns."],"time":["2019-12-24 02:48:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lpolovets"],"id":[21868715],"kids":[21869361,21868987,21869274,21870786,21869205,21869938],"parent":[21868022],"text":["My experience: engineering at Startup #1 for 2 years, then Google for 3 years, then Startup #2 for 4 years, and now I&#x27;ve been working with seed stage companies as a VC for the last 7 years.

Startup #2 is still chugging along, which could eventually make it on par with or a little superior to working at Google.<p>But money isn&#x27;t everything. Startup #2 was the place where I learned the most. I was senior enough to be single-handedly responsible for large projects like a distributed search engine and a logging and analytics service.

The current structure of equity compensation for early-stage startup companies is simply not enticing enough to get people to choose that over the salary and predictable path of BigTechCos. I love working in startups and even I, when presented with the choice, pad the salary knowing that throughout the funding rounds, if the startup is lucky, any fractional percent that I have will be so diluted that I&#x27;m likely to walk away with nothing to show for the work I put in beside the cash I opted for, hopefully, some new connections and some learnings. While some of the more successful startups can compete with those companies on base salary it is just not enough necessarily to convince the top talent that you are the right move for their career. That said there are ways to improve this such as the increased transparency OP wrote about in their post. We should also give more equity to early employees and have favorable terms around vesting for these employees and better timing around the loss of options after leaving a company. Of course this negatively impacts founder equity and potentially investors as well. But to me, worrying about that negative impact to founders and investors comes off as short sighted on part of the investors and founders. Ensuring your early employees will be taken care of means they&#x27;ll work harder for your company and this will increase the chance you&#x27;ll survive long enough to see an event that makes <i>anyone<\/i> a return on their investment. The numbers are so overwhelmingly stacked against startups that worrying about the couple million less you&#x27;ll have because you gave out 1-1.5% equity to your early employees is really silly, very much chicken before the egg. Instead we currently have the weird known but unspoken fact that your early employees will likely get nothing in a liquidity event while still asking them to put their all into your company which is unethical at best and downright manipulative and harmful at worst.

Why are we comparing an employee situation at a FAANG company with what should be a co-founder situation? If someone is an engineer that can make something happen at a startup, they should probably be a co-founder rather than an employee.<p>B. Why are tech center startups trying to hire coders of a certain skill level that will be incredibly expensive due to local competition? If a startup is looking for skilled coders to implement the vision of the co-founding engineers that can make things happen, then there are plenty of remote coders in non-tech-center areas that will do a bang up job for a reasonable price. Note that many of these remote coders don’t want to or cannot come to a tech center. I assume that this is an issue because many&#x2F;most startups are not good at hiring, on-boarding, managing people, managing remote workers, etc.<p>C. Related to issue B, why play the micro-equity game with coders at all when they should either be co-founders or they (as remote workers) can be paid a satisfactory wage without equity bait?<p>D. Why is this conversation comparing a job with (relatively speaking) a lot of hierarchy and politics at a FAANG with a job that should have a flat structure and a great deal of autonomy? These jobs cater to two different groups of people — the ones who like the former probably won’t like the latter, and the opposite is true as well. There are subtle sides to this (e.g., do your time at a FAANG to develop a network), but many people who succeed at startups are not folks you want working at a large company — they will go nuts, and they will drive the people around them crazy.<p>This whole conversation is bizarre to me. I think there are three relatively simple choices:<p>1. Take a company job if you’re a company person — that is, someone who likes structure and hierarchy. It might not be trendy to admit it, but many&#x2F;most elite school grads fall into this category.<p>2. If you prefer things like autonomy, being close to the customer, and being a generalist, then go to a startup. Plan on leaving once it hits a certain size.<p>3. If you have a plan for an alternate path that includes both, then go for it — specialist work at FAANG, FAANG then startup founder, startup employee then startup founder, etc. Just know what you’re getting into, because it can be awfully tough to walk away from $300k annual comp as a 25 yo.<p>Most people I’ve known clearly fall into one of these categories barring some sort of life-changing event."],"time":["2019-12-24 01:04:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["groby_b"],"id":[21868744],"kids":{},"parent":[21868022],"text":["I have a very straightforward suggestion for startups: Focus on the engineers who&#x27;ve put in a decade or more at the big companies.<p>They are, given the exorbitant salaries, financially set enough to afford the startup risk, and there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;d like to see some more agility again.<p>But 1) you&#x27;ll need to stop lowballing equity for hires, and 2) you need to get used to the idea that it&#x27;s not going to be an extension of university life - these people have all better things in their spare time than playing beer pong.<p>Bonus points: Offer an office instead of cubicle mania.\nBonus bonus points: Make sure you hire a diverse workforce from the get-go."],"time":["2019-12-24 01:16:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["afinlayson"],"id":[21871577],"kids":{},"parent":[21868022],"text":["I&#x27;ve worked at 3 big tech companies and 3 startups. 2 got bought out, the other is going strong.

A lot of startups these days though really ask for ALOT of money from investors without having even an MVP or viable product yet.
