Yet, even in the best times, smart companies consistently focus on goals that are predictably bad (e.g. 1x levers instead of 100x levers). Why do companies pursue predictably bad goals? The root causes are that companies are complex, the world is uncertain, and current tools don’t do a great job helping leaders understand how the pieces fit together to generate growth. As a result, teams operate via a combination of heuristics and siloed local optimizations, all of which are subject to error and obfuscate what’s really important.

Control systems are all about reacting quickly enough and accurately enough. Delay and poor incoming&#x2F;outgoing signal quality are the enemies of the control system:<p>1. The delay from sensor to controller (e.g. SPI bus incurred delay between your gyro sensor and your processor)<p>2. The bandwidth of each component. If your gyro sensor is only 10hz bandwidth, it&#x27;d be difficult to control anything reasonably fast. Note that bandwidth is often given in frequency to 3dB attenuation (half the amplitude) - that&#x27;s not enough, you need to understand the phase distortion: in other words, as you approach the bandwidth limit, does your signal get distorted in time? because that&#x27;s very bad for a control system.<p>3. The resolution of your actuator - if you end up using an on-off actuator, it&#x27;d be impossible to do any precision control. Do you want to position a motor accurately? Make sure you use more than 8-bit PWM.<p>4. Static&#x2F;dynamic response: things are usually not nicely linear. Things at standstill take a different amount of effort to move than once they are in motion.<p>My experience has shown time and time again that if you get the system fundamentals correct, implementing and tuning the control loop is reasonably trivial. The secret is having a system that&#x27;s an order of magnitude faster (higher bandwidth) than what you&#x27;re trying to control.<p>You really need to think about control systems in the frequency domain: &quot;what I&#x27;m controlling requires the bandwidth of X, I need to sample with with n * X, my processor is this fast, my output signal is that accurate, this is the end to end delay&quot;.<p>Someone once said &quot;any non-linear system becomes linear when you sample it quickly enough&quot;.

Others often rely on me to debug their must frustrating bugs, which I enjoy. I have experience building CRM, CMS, and other business application software both from scratch and in popular frameworks. I follow industry best practices and ensure that the systems I write are secure and maintainable. I have planned and developed new systems, maintained legacy systems, and led teams which have done so. Software development is not only my profession, but also has been my hobby since childhood. I enjoy work and always arrive with a happy attitude."],"time":["2020-04-01 18:15:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22766376],"kids":{},"parent":[22749306],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-03 06:51:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["smosin"],"id":[22763129],"kids":{},"parent":[22749306],"text":["Location           : Moscow, Russia<p>Remote             : Yes<p>Willing to relocate: Yes, to Switzerland, Germany, UK, Sweden, Canada, US<p>Technologies       : Python, Databases (SQL, Postgres, MySQL, Mongo), Machine Learning (scikit, pandas&#x2F;numpy, Tensorflow), Web dev (Django, Flask, Tornado), Git, AWS, Docker<p>Résumé&#x2F;CV          : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;serge_mosin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;serge_mosin<\/a><p>Email              : serge@databrawl.com<p>Video introduction : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;mlvkNYo_chM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;mlvkNYo_chM<\/a><p>Linkedin           : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;smosin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;smosin<\/a><p>Github             : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Greyvend\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Greyvend<\/a> , <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Databrawl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Databrawl<\/a><p>I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics&#x2F;Computer Science.
