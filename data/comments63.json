Wells Fargo is leaving lots of money on the table by NOT offering these. But their analysts have decided that it is too risky. That to me, means that there is a lot of concern over future home value.

Two major banks are now worried about consumer solvency (and&#x2F;or real estate prices) to the degree that they&#x27;re forgoing HELOC origination profits across the board. An alternative response could have been to simply raise interest rates on these loans. The fact that the loans were suspended suggests a lot more afoot than meets the eye. Those suggesting to &quot;cash-out refi instead&quot; may be surprised to find in the coming weeks that these loans have also been terminated, or saddled with terms that make them unattractive.<p>2. Consumers who were planning to tap home equity to pay for monthly expenses will not be able to do so.<p>This could spell a lot of trouble moving forward. US consumers view their homes as a kind of ATM, dispensing dollars on demand through HELOCs. That money can be used for literally anything.<p>Without an easy source of credit to tap, where will the American consumer turn? In increasing order of existential risk:<p>1.

Makes me think about software upgrade scenarios. A typical upgrade process for long-running services I’ve seen is usually some variant of “flush everything out to disk; shutdown process; run some hand-crafted upgrade code for the on-disk datastructures; start the new process.”<p>On the other hand, the development for this stuff usually consists of a sequence of small patches. You could generate a lot of that on-disk upgrade code by applying something like this against all those patches. Maybe you could take it a step further and never actually tear down the process (by doing that memory mapping stuff the article touches on).<p>I wonder how far you can take that concept. People develop software today with an edit -&gt; build -&gt; deploy cycle. With sufficient tools, could one do development solely by describing how to patch the running process? Your repository consists of a sequence of such patches: CI applies the patches against a running process (and then runs all your tests). If that passes, you can deploy the patch everywhere using an <i>identical<\/i> procedure.<p>Fixes the issue of customers running outdated software because they can’t handle the one minute of downtime associated with an upgrade to a critical service. You don’t need to keep years-old upgrade code in the codebase (and keeping it well-tested) because one of those customers might want to upgrade someday. On the other hand, pulling bad patches caught late in the cycle becomes more difficult. And also the problem of downtime already has workarounds today, usually by making use of redundancy (which remains valuable even outside of upgrades).<p>I dunno, it’s fun to think about where and how you could apply this.

WASM is a thing, so even a fat\nslow WASM app that let me test things out would be a good way for me to see what this stuff is really like.<p>(2) I feel like this and a lot of other similar projects are too monolithic.

That said, the SAFEnetwork project has impressed me a great deal with their technical progress towards making an autonomous self healing network that is centered around security, privacy, data ownership&#x2F;control and usability. Obviously something we can all agree is (possibly over) ambitious and mouth watering fodder to those of us understanding in which ways the large tech monopolies silo and steal user data, track us, off our backs for their gain. The projects proposal almost seems like a bait and switch no? Maybe too good to be true? Maidsafe has been at it for over a decade, it has to be a scam. Just riding off the back of Bitcoin! No. The idea has been around since 2006 before bitcoin and though even up until mid 2019 the way in which this vision would be achieved had been R&amp;D’d for the umteenth time, that stage is over and the engineering has been nothing short of brilliant.<p>There are at home tests that can be run through the command line of the first iterations of a working network that prove this technology. Check out the [baby Fleming release](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safenetforum.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;safe-network-dev-update-march-26-2020&#x2F;31360?\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safenetforum.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;safe-network-dev-update-march-26-...<\/a>)<p>Or for the less technical crowd you can get your hands dirty with either a network gateway tool called the SAFEnetwork App, the desktop or mobile SAFE Browsers, using Maidsafe’s shared section of the third iteration of baby Fleming.

No one can fully answer that and that includes Maidsafe but the R&amp;D is done. The fundamental technology and different working parts are proven and working together but now the focus is on optimizing performance, concurrency and guarantees, and some additional features (such as multi-sig, and later RDF&#x2F;Linked Data). All the while a professional and intuitive user interface is being designed to converge with the end product that will allow for full access and control of your personal data and web publishing, data sharing abilities. This is one area that is under served in the “crypto” space and one area that Maidsafe is underestimated and will surprise many. The lead designer at Maidsafe has a few things up his sleeve and how the network is uniquely built enables a lot of functionality.<p>Don’t over look or underestimate this project.

When SARS-CoV-2 is first identified in Wuhan, the drug is immediately given a large phase II efficacy trial....<p>&gt; It’s easy to blame bats for unwittingly giving humanity SARS-CoV-2. But I also blame both big Pharma and the US government for failing to come up with a pan-CoV antiviral or vaccine.<p>Why single out the <i>US<\/i> government in particular with the responsibility to come up with a &quot;pan-CoV antiviral or vaccine&quot; that should have been on hand to treat an outbreak in <i>Wuhan<\/i>? I&#x27;m not saying the NIH shouldn&#x27;t have worked on it, but there were other countries with the ability and incentive to do so. There was nothing stopping China, Taiwan, or Canada from doing something after SARS, or South Korea from doing something after MERS, so why aren&#x27;t any of those countries equally to blame?<p>There&#x27;s the further speculation that SARS-CoV-2 was originally released due to some lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that&#x27;s true, it only further undermines this Monday morning quarterbacking, because it would mean that one of the countries with the most vested interest in preventing this pandemic, and one of the best equipped to do something about it, was <i>actually trying to do that<\/i> only to be undone by some procedural blunder.<p>There&#x27;s also a huge degree of hindsight here. Pandemics tend to occur from time to time, and we&#x27;re barely on the verge of having the tech level necessary to prevent them. Up to and including 2019, we had a couple of near-misses with coronaviruses, but we also had near-misses with influenza and Ebola among others. If the US or anyone else somehow managed to come up with some &quot;pan-CoV antiviral or vaccine&quot; only to fall victim to an influenza or Ebola pandemic, I&#x27;m sure some wise guy would be going around telling us how stupid they were for not being better prepared. In reality, the world has collectively gone to heroic measures to try and snuff out these outbreaks when and where they initially occur before they turn into pandemics.<p>Speaking of which, there&#x27;s an elephant in the room. Maybe the US government didn&#x27;t sufficiently invest in speculative countermeasures against a potential epidemic. But, starting in 2003, they <i>did<\/i> invest in countermeasures against the <i>actual<\/i> epidemic of HIV&#x2F;AIDS, and managed to save over 17 million lives. In fact, Drs. Fauci and Birx have both been personally involved with that program for many years.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the US did everything right, but in some sense the world got a really bad break with COVID-19 if you look at where virology efforts were focused.

Etsy replaced their CEO and laid off a large portion of their employees, and cancelled our internships along the way. The message to us was along the lines of, &quot;It&#x27;s not about the money; it&#x27;s going to be chaotic around here for a little while, and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good or useful experience as an intern.&quot; And they backed it up by paying out a stipend of a significant fraction of what the entire summer&#x27;s pay would have been, which they really didn&#x27;t have to do. At that time there was a bit of a scramble, but within a couple weeks all of us would-be interns got picked up by other companies, and looking back, this unlucky turn of events completely changed the course of my career, as I ended up interning with the SRE team at Squarespace and discovering a new world.<p>I really respect Etsy in making the tough call at the time to cancel outright (and pay a stipend) instead of dragging things on.

You will make sure that all changes are properly documented. You will also be responsible for making sure that there are robust tests put in place to ensure data correctness. You will often communicate with engineers on our dev team and you will be able to request resources from this team.<p>You will have plenty of flexibility and you will be encouraged to try new things and think outside of the box.
