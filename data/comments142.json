Before we even get to the operating and purchase cost of the air craft. All these taxi ideas seem always over look one the largest costs.<p>The biggest problem short taxi like air travel tend forget about is the infrastructure. Your going to need a lot of landing and take off locations for it to be any use. You just can&#x27;t land anywhere unless you have pilot that can see areas clear of cars, power lines, and people or other hazards. So any autonomous system is going to need lots landing and take off areas. Even with a pilot they probably would still be needed.<p>The next largest costs of an air-craft is generally initial purchase. Then the required on going maintenance to ensure the air-frame remains safe. While an all aircraft electric may reduce the mechanical complexity. It does nothing to reduce the labour cost per hour required to inspect an air-frame, and repair. Also unlikely traditional aircraft a battery pack is more complex than a fuel tank, any problems with it can be dangerous for any aircraft that do not use a fixed wing design.<p>Also with a completely electric air craft energy density is even more important than a car. This effectively limits them to short distances. While energy costs may be lower than fuel. Fuel for small aircraft is cheaper than a lot people realize.<p>Lastly, while getting rid of a pilot for routine flight is already in our technological grasp. Unsurprisingly any failures or sudden problem are going to be hard to handle. For instance how would an autonomous air-craft choose a safe landing location if it detects problem that requires landing right away. A busy street would be less than ideal where as a human could easily see less occupied areas. It also would need to make sure that there are not tree branches or power lines are crossing any part of it&#x27;s chosen landing zone.

I have access and do sysadmin tasks without knowing very well how it is configured (it uses systemd for instance, while I setup things differently usually in my machines). The instance was configured without even a proper configuration file, just a few parameters on the command line. The thing is: we handle this as a &quot;community&quot; thing. And after all considering the near zero-efforts, and the 5$ instance for many many years, it kinda works well.<p>Anyway all the content is public and open source... (see redis-io and redis-doc repositories), and all our releases are tagged on Github.

I suppose people needed to back in 2013.<p>&gt; With the rem unit we have a problem though. Since all font-sizes are relative to the root element, the font-size: 90%; rule is completely ignored. We now have to recalculate and override every font-declaration in the aside to get the same result. Spaghetti is wonderful as lunch or dinner, but not as code.<p>At this point, I question whether it&#x27;s even necessary to use percentages for font sizes deeper in the DOM than the root element.  Unless the font is going to change at any given viewport width, it&#x27;s easier to just write the font sizes for every screen breakpoint you have.  I don&#x27;t know why developers&#x2F;designers make things unnecessarily difficult.  Most web designs don&#x27;t necessitate this kind of complexity.<p>&gt; The rem unit is buggy<p>This was fixed years ago.  Try it yourself in today&#x27;s Chrome.<p>&gt; Another reason why some people prefer rem over em is because inheritance is hard. I always tell these people they’re doing it wrong.<p>No they&#x27;re not.  They&#x27;re using rem to properly support the user&#x27;s right to set the font size in their browser preferences and have it actually work on a webpage.  They&#x27;re not using em because they probably don&#x27;t need it.  If they didn&#x27;t care about the user&#x27;s font preferences, they&#x27;d probably use px because it&#x27;s easier for everyone to understand.<p>&gt; The inheritance problem occurs when we nest a p in a li. The p will now be 1.2 × 1.2 = 14.4 pixels. This is too big. To make sure that a p in a li is 12 pixels too we now have to write extra, increasingly complex code:<p>So don&#x27;t do that.  Write your font sizes explicitly for each element, whether it&#x27;s px or rem.<p>Even better if you use a preprocessor like SCSS that supports variables and mixins, which makes it even simpler to implement &quot;flexible&quot; font sizes without the insanity of making font sizes in elements relative to other parent elements.  Even CSS variables that are now becoming ubiquitous help solve these problems.<p>Despite those things, I still insist it&#x27;s possible to avoid these headaches by just not going the em route.

This will change as more people become infected. Assuming even the most BASIC of measures are taken, (people washing their hands, not going to crowded areas often, not travelling etc.) this will probably stop exponential growth.<p>In China, 5 people have been infected for every 100,000 citizens, and the virus isn&#x27;t exponentially growing anymore. But fine, maybe they took good measures.<p>In Italy, it&#x27;s closer to 20 people per 100,000. Fine, four times as high, but still a TINY portion of the population. If you assume that their graph will ever look anything like China&#x27;s, there is no way in hell more than 1% of the population will be infected. It probably won&#x27;t come within two orders of magnitude.<p>In what god forsaken situation could even 1% of the US get the Coronavirus?<p>Even without government intervention, as cases increase people will start taking this more seriously and the exponential growth will stop.

As long as you at most infect 1 other person, the exponential growth stops.

It may actually be the case that cultivating some belief in a higher reason &#x2F; order to the universe is beneficial in recovery.  There are dedicated circuits in the brain for religious &#x2F; spiritual thinking and feeling, and when activated may play a role.<p>As a counter-point, its possible to imagine a scientific discovery that while true, would cause mass suicide and depression upon discovery (e.g. an asteroid will hit the planet in 10 days).  While implausible, suppose that we &quot;found scientific proof&quot; the god exists and is the christian god, and eternal life &#x2F; punishment awaits us after death.

I would drink multiple liters of vodka weekly. It was not uncommon for me to drink an entire 375 ml bottle of vodka in an evening.<p>I never really considered myself to be an &quot;alcoholic&quot; in the traditional sense though, because I didn&#x27;t let it affect my day-to-day life as a programmer. I was young and healthy, and I didn&#x27;t usually have much of a hangover because I only drank high end vodka, and I always drank a lot of fluids. Whenever I got a hangover, I would just pop an ibuprofen and the hangover would disappear after about an hour. I would literally set my alarm an hour before I wanted to wake up, and when that alarm went off I would wake up, pop an ibuprofen, drink half a glass of water, then go back to sleep. By the time my second alarm went off an hour later, I was as good as new.<p>I literally did this for years, while often working 12 hour days as a programmer. Nobody could tell, and it didn&#x27;t seem to affect me too negatively, so I didn&#x27;t see a reason not to. It helped me relax at the end of a long day, and it made movies and television more fun and enjoyable to watch. It was also fun to go out to bars and hang out with friends.<p>Eventually, though, it caught up to me, and I started to get reports from doctors about abnormal liver test results. They were still just borderline, but it was enough to scare some sense into me. I had just recently had a son, and I realized I wanted to be alive for when he grew up.<p>So I tried to stop drinking. I didn&#x27;t want to go to alcoholics anonymous (I didn&#x27;t consider myself to be an alcoholic after all, and I&#x27;m an atheist and didn&#x27;t want to deal with all of their religion&#x2F;higher power 12-step stuff).<p>Quitting cold turkey worked for about 3 months, but as I&#x27;m sure you know, the alcohol drinking culture in the programming startup world is extremely prevalent.<p>It was only a matter of time until I ended up in a social scene where I felt pressured to drink, and I had a beer along with everyone else. It was all right, I told myself. It was just a beer! No big deal! I had quit drinking before and I have it under control now, so it&#x27;s ok! Nope. Once I got a taste and a reminder of the stress relief offered by alcohol, I started right back into it. Next thing I knew, I was drinking vodka every night again.<p>After a couple of more false attempts to stop (with each one being thwarted by my having a beer and getting sucked back in), I finally came to terms with the fact that I simply can&#x27;t drink. I can&#x27;t touch the stuff or I will get sucked back in. I realized I was an actual alcoholic.<p>So I stopped. I carefully tapered off my heavy alcohol consumption over the course of a week, and that was it. I&#x27;ve now been sober for a year and a half. Whenever I&#x27;m in social situations where other people are drinking beer, I simply order a diet coke or something and I sit and enjoy their company. I might even shoot the breeze and chat about all my favorite types of scotch or whatever. But I absolutely do not allow myself to have even one sip of alcohol, because I&#x27;ve learned the hard way what it leads to.<p>As a side note, during that year and a half, I also managed to get completely out of $50,000 worth of debt, pay off my car, and diet my way from 245 lbs all the way to 180 lbs (still have another 20 lbs to go before I reach my goal of 160).<p>And I did it all without alcoholics anonymous or medication or therapy or anything. I simply accepted ownership of the problem, made a decision, and stuck with it.<p>With that said, however, there <i>was<\/i> a catalyst and a &quot;higher power&quot; that lead to the change and kept me on track:<p>I had a kid, and I realized that I wanted to stay alive long enough to see him grow up and have kids of his own.<p>I realize this might not be a magic bullet for anyone (and I hope you get help if you need it), but my point is simply that sometimes it is in fact possible to do on your own (given the right circumstances and motivation), although this fact is something that is not very popular to mention."],"time":["2020-03-11 23:27:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chad_strategic"],"id":[22551445],"kids":{},"parent":[22545557],"text":["FYI: the best meetings are the speaker meetings.

In the past alcohol and then switched to opiates (sadly all to common story of getting pills from MD unnecessarily). I haven&#x27;t faced many consequences and have been still successful in tech. still not &#x27;out&#x27; about opiates to work or friends, just my peers in recovery.<p>I have found the underlying hypothesis of this - group support - has been a really big help for me. I found a group for those in recovery that participate in sports (the Phoenix) which has a double punch of great community and also physical activity which is super beneficial.<p>For me, I think this has been the second biggest contributor to success.<p>But my #1 - with opiates in particular - is medicine replacement therapy. I tried so many times to get off myself. I finally got on buprenorphine which has been a lifesaver and successful to date on first try [one year!]. There are also some drugs now for alcoholism but unfortunately stimulants seem to not have great options.<p>It seems a shockingly low amount of rehabs use replacement therapy [1] [2] or even know about it (or even as a short term withdrawal taper tool). There are also a scary amount of overdoses from relapse post rehab.<p>I think the science is pretty convincing - there are studies showing even if relapse after maintenance therapy the period of abstinence before relapse is longer [3] - and also just seems like MUCH higher success rate [4].<p>BUT this is still an opiate! My doctor has patients who have been on for years. A lot struggle to get off. I personally don&#x27;t have a problem with very long term use - personally I see parallels with SSRIs&#x2F;SNRIs where many users report problems getting off and withdrawal, but obviously who would say you should get off something like prozac - a mind altering drug that has clear benefit?<p>The most FU part of this for me - it still takes a special license to dispense buprenorphine replacement therapy, patient numbers are capped per MD, and there is a ton of stigma all around even at pharmacies who dont blink twice doling out opiates. Pisses me off when looking at how most MDs can dole out opiates with far less training&#x2F;license requirements. also pharma definitely profits - though there are now generics. i&#x27;ve found at least for the strips it&#x27;s basically the same price. The pills without naloxone are cheaper - but for addicts struggling that gets rid of the back stop and overdose preventer.<p>Plus having only a few Drs in many states (or none) that charge cash or medicare only makes it in-accesible for many of the downest and out addicts. It should be free (or covered by the worst pharma co s) and FAR more MDs should be able to write script.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samhsa.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;N-SSATS%20Rprt%20Trnds%20Use%20Methadone%20&amp;%20Buprenorphine%20at%20SA%20Trmt%20Facs%20%2003-11&#x2F;N-SSATS%20Rprt%20Trnds%20Use%20Methadone%20&amp;%20Buprenorphine%20at%20SA%20Trmt%20Facs%20%2003-11&#x2F;sr107-NSSATS-Buprenorph.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samhsa.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;N-SSATS%20Rp...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rehabs.com&#x2F;pro-talk&#x2F;opioid-addiction-treatment-why-dont-more-rehabs-use-suboxone&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rehabs.com&#x2F;pro-talk&#x2F;opioid-addiction-treatment-w...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;30094695\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;30094695<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2874458&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2874458&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-11 19:44:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pcvarmint"],"id":[22563065],"kids":{},"parent":[22545557],"text":["RIP Herbert Fingarette<p>Love Stanton Peele<p>Jeffrey Schaler is a Choice"],"time":["2020-03-13 00:17:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["erokar"],"id":[22552193],"kids":{},"parent":[22545557],"text":["Belief in a higher power a serious side effect of this treatment regime, though."],"time":["2020-03-12 01:12:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shrimpx"],"id":[22555048],"kids":{},"parent":[22545557],"text":["Finally, scientific evidence of the vast healing power of God. &#x2F;s"],"time":["2020-03-12 10:16:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aaron695"],"id":[22551628],"kids":[22563430],"parent":[22545557],"text":["What&#x27;s more interesting is since &quot;The Irrationality of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; (2015)[1] HN thinks they are experts in how AA doesn&#x27;t work.<p>These meme bugs that infect people are the on ongoing issue you see a lot here.<p>They make no sense, but that&#x27;s why the meme works.

I&#x27;m pretty sure this quote is about me! Or if it&#x27;s not, it would be equally true about me. This is why we rolled out the &quot;buddy&quot; system described in this post. That way 90% of the iteration can be between the engineer writing the post and someone else who will be a lot more available than I am. This matters a lot if a post requires three or four round trips to really get it right. Plus, in a lot of cases, that other person is better at technical storytelling than I am to begin with.<p>I&#x27;d also note that this post and HN discussion focus a lot on reducing friction, as if having a really good blog is the state of nature. In my experience, this has not been true. A good blog won&#x27;t just happen if you get out of the way.<p>Someone senior at the company needs to actively prioritize the engineering blog. You also need eng leadership that respects that writing posts is real work and is willing to have engineers spend time on-the-job working on them. At Heap, we do this down to the level of taking this into account in sprint planning. Also, a lot of the good ideas for posts come from working with engineers to find the kernel of a story in something they&#x27;re working on. This is an active process, not something spontaneous that you just have to permit to happen.<p>We also benefit from having a lot of legitimately interesting technical work to talk about. This is more true at some companies than others, and is a big multiplier on how compelling you can make your blog. The success of a blog post is pretty non-linear – either it gets wide readership or not much at all.

The vast majority of posts (and blogs) that I&#x27;ve seen were awful not because of a tortuous approval process or lack of high-level support. They were awful because communicating substantial, serious engineering information was not the main point. Or <i>one of<\/i> the main points. Or a point at all, really. It was usually just an excuse to push out some marketing and &quot;establish a presence&quot;, and management felt that involving technical people writing on technical subject would lend that effort the kind of credibility that ads don&#x27;t have.<p>This had repercussions over the whole publishing chain, and these efforts were doomed from the beginning. Topic selection was inadequate (topics were selected primarily so that they&#x27;d have the right &quot;ring&quot; to product&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;business development managers, rather than so that they&#x27;d be interesting for a technical audience). Editing was done with the wrong objectives and targeted the wrong metrics, and was often based solely on input from non-technical people who didn&#x27;t understand what a technical audience wanted. Then this article -- on a topic that wasn&#x27;t really interesting for a technical audience, and not really written for a technical audience -- was promoted mostly for a technical audience. Since the people who were doing the promotion were, inherently, in non-technical position, and they mostly consisted of a boring tech article with a mini sales pitch attached at the end, everyone ended up seeing them as marketing fluff.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that our industry is still stuck in this world where &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;non-technical&quot; is a very strict dichotomy, where technical people are basically like a 2020 Mr. Spock and non-technical people can barely type on a computer. That hasn&#x27;t been then case in more than ten years. A lot of people who are seen as &quot;non-technical&quot; -- people in sales, marketing, or in management positions -- have grown up with computers. Lots of people in decision-making positions used to hold a technical position at one point.

We mostly work with Bay Area startups. Some key observations and learnings:<p>- Many companies have tried to create engineering blogs, but you&#x27;d never know because the first post was so unpleasant to create that the whole effort got called off.<p>- If a company does manage to publish a first post, the experience is often so personally traumatic to the engineer that they never try again and&#x2F;or tell their team members to avoid the process. This is especially true when PR&#x2F;Comms insists on reviewing posts. (Legal review typically goes more smoothly.)<p>- Coming up with ideas for posts is WAY easier said than done. Nobody, engineers included, likes staring at a blank page. A significant part of our work is refining ideas and creating outlines.<p>- Lest you thought otherwise, company engineering blogs are almost always justified as candidate lead gen. Posts are frequently used by recruiters in outreach emails. When a post and email are well written, response rates can easily double—effectively doubling the candidate pool for a growing team. (This assumes that engineers aren&#x27;t applying to jobs unprompted, which is true for about 80% of startups in the Bay Area.)<p>- In our research with job seekers, we found that when senior engineers research a company, they seek the company&#x27;s engineering blog before they seek the careers page, let alone a job description. This is probably obvious to folks here, but in the recruiting world this blows everyone&#x27;s mind.<p>- Technical blog posts are expensive whether you DIY or work with someone like us. A detailed post, let&#x27;s say 1500 words, can easily consume 25 hours of time from everyone involved. 50 hours isn&#x27;t rare. And this is when the process works well. (Our value prop: we shift time from engineers to our writers.) Here&#x27;s the process we&#x27;ve found works best. Everything here happens in Google Docs.<p>1. One of our writers, all former journalists, sits down with an engineer who has an idea for a post. In a 1 hour conversation, they work together to refine the idea and create a bare-bones outline. Assuming you&#x27;re doing this yourself, my point is that pairing is helpful. This conversation gets recorded and transcribed by a transcription service. (4 hours total time)<p>2. The writer reviews the transcript and fleshes out an outline. They note locations for graphics and code snippets. The engineer then reviews the outline and leaves comments. (4–6 hours total time)<p>3. The writer creates a complete first draft, with assistance from 1–2 editors on our team. They leave space for graphics&#x2F;code for the engineer to add on their own. (8–10 hours)<p>4. The engineer brings in 1–3 other engineers to review the post. The team adds illustrations and&#x2F;or code. More comments&#x2F;feedback. (6+ hours)<p>5.

But the use case in the video and screenshots make me immediately think it wouldn&#x27;t be viable in any of the organizations I&#x27;ve written SQL for in the past 10 years.<p>At least 95% of the challenge in querying data doesn&#x27;t come from the difficulty of writing SQL statements IMO, but from the complexity&#x2F;brokenness of the data itself.  Especially with the move to unstructured data streams, most data warehouses seem to have become pretty bad when it comes to extracting truth out of the information within.  Many business users know some SQL but blanch at creating coherent reports from what&#x27;s available to them.  What BI people are paid for seems to be having knowledge about the problems particular to a domain.<p>If your data is relatively clean and follows a good model, this would be a great way to help someone join, group, and aggregate their data without knowing SQL.  I think a lot of people would use Tableau for this if it didn&#x27;t also have a steep learning curve &#x2F; high expense.  However as soon as you get into data where you&#x27;re writing case statements, coalescing null fields, matching on different data types, decoding, partitioning over streaming data etc., it doesn&#x27;t help someone without knowledge of the caveats within the data sources themselves.

Consider application code waiting for a transaction to complete. The calling thread is in a blocking recv() system call, waiting for the DB to return some bytes over TCP. My claim is that it should be easy to error out from here after a given amount of time if the database (for whichever reason) does not respond in a timely fashion, or never at all (a scenario we sometimes ran into with early versions of CockroachDB). Certainly, ideally the database always responds timely or has its internal timeout mechanisms working well. But for building robust systems, I believe it would be quite advantageous for the database client API to expose TCP recv() timeout control. I think when we looked at the details back then we found that it&#x27;s libpq itself which didn&#x27;t quite expose the socket configuration aspects we needed, but it&#x27;s been a while.<p>On the topic of doing &quot;async I&#x2F;O&quot; against a database, I would love to share Mike Bayer&#x27;s article &quot;Asynchronous Python and Databases&quot; from 2015: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techspot.zzzeek.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;asynchronous-python-and-databases&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techspot.zzzeek.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;asynchronous-python-a...<\/a> -- I think it&#x27;s still highly relevant (not just to the Python ecosystem) and I think it&#x27;s pure gold.

However, it also highlights the gap between academic literature and the state-of-the-art in database engine design. For example, adaptive succinct indexing structures have been used for at least a decade in closed source databases. Structures similar to the ideas presented in the paper have been reduced to practice in real systems for a long time.<p>Last month I delivered yet another database engine, benchmarked against the best open source comparables, which provides a rough but concrete example of the gap:<p>The designed memory:storage ratio was 1:1000, an order of magnitude higher than even the 1:100 ratio mentioned as aggressive in the paper. In fairness, my prior systems were designed much closer to 1:100 ratio and it used new CS research to significantly extend the ratio without materially sacrificing performance. For data models with fairly complex indexing requirements, insertion performance was &gt;100x(!) the best open source comparables.<p>A large part of this performance is due to dramatic improvements in cache efficiency that are not even particularly novel -- the gains attributable to improved cache efficiency in the paper are eminently believable. The data-to-index ratio in the above is around a million-to-one, small enough to fit in CPU cache for many TB scale data models. The high data-to-index ratio is largely attributable to using search structures that forego total order and balancing, which enables dramatic improvements in succinctness with minimal reductions in selectivity.<p>The other major contributor to performance is scheduler design, which wasn&#x27;t really touched on in the paper and is largely ignored entirely in open source databases.<p>tl;dr: current open source database engine designs leave a massive amount of performance on the table due to very poor cache efficiency, and this paper correctly touches on some of the ways this is materially improved in closed source database engines."],"time":["2020-03-11 09:13:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alecco"],"id":[22543814],"kids":[22545027],"parent":[22543125],"text":["Note by compression they mean keeping internal blocks closer to full.

But once we get through this crisis, it will be worth keeping in mind the story of Twitter and the heroic Seattle Flu Study team: what stopped them from doing critical research was too much centralization of authority and bureaucratic decision-making; what ultimately made their research materially accelerate the response of individuals and companies all over the country was first their bravery and sense of duty, and secondly the fact that on the Internet anyone can publish anything.<p>This is not true. A push&#x2F;pull of many factors plays into how modern science gets done. Some of those factors include centralization, bureaucracy, piracy, and individual judgment.<p>It is neither useful nor accurate to claim that &quot;centralization of authority and bureaucratic decision-making&quot; prevented a group of researchers from exploring research predicated on genome sequences whose coordination, publication, and syndication all rely heavily on centralized infrastructure projects and public health institutions.<p>Scientific and public health bureaucracies are complicated.
