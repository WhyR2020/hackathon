They pointed to the rule\n(2.26) created just a couple of years ago about what kind of apps can recommend apps other than\nits own (by the way I still believe my apps fit the description). We of course have been aware of\nthis rule since it came out, as we already had a healthy business and significant payroll doing app\njournalism. When we saw some apps get removed, it made us more steadfast in our mission.\nBecause we believed the fact that we were not bothered is because we were doing it the &quot;right 11\nway. We were really serving the user and the App Store. Not selling fake &quot;recommendations&quot; as\ndeceptive ads. We literally turned down millions of dollars in revenues, as developers repeatedly\nasked to pay per install to be featured in our app (outside of tradition advertising). It was hard to\nturn down the money even though we knew it was not right to users. One thing that made it\neasier is our belief that playing it straight would keep us in the App Store and in Apple&#x27;s good\ngraces.<p>The rule exists for precisely the reason this email notes: to prevent the selling of deceptive in-app ads. How are App Review personnel supposed to know if the in-app links to other apps are there to really &quot;serve the user&quot; or as paid advertising? They can&#x27;t, hence the rule.

Side loading apps:\nNot good! malicious apps can run amok, eg. $BIG_CORP$ will say - you will get 20$ credits if you sideload our app, and then surveil everything that is possible on the device. Here, we expect an average user to give all the permission that the app requests for.<p>2. allow secondary app stores:\n-not good as it depends on the quality of enforcement in secondary app store. For Apple, it is in their interest to maintain app quality in their appstore to maintain overall good user experience in their device, but motivations are not same for secondary app store. May allow malicious apps which deteriorate the user experience&#x2F;privacy similar to 1. And there will be a state where you will have to install 10s of app store just to install specific programs which is also not ideal.<p>3. Allow secondary payment methods:\n-Average user will have to give up their payment info to everyone who asks for it. Most of them will not be trustworthy nor we can expect all of them to maintain good security standards for saving payment info.<p>The biggest culprit of all this drama is Apple does not allow secondary payment inside apps AND also, if you have secondary payment outside of app, they do not allow that price to be lower. There is no competition, thus Apple can get away with whatever it chooses to. Thus the monopoly.<p>4. SOLUTION:<p>a) charge a flat fee for reviewing&#x2F;serving apps. If necessary, linearly increase it based on daily active users if they need more resource to support that app.<p>b) allow secondary payment providers (whitelisted only).<p>c) allow secondary payment price to be lower than Apple.<p>With this solution, there will be competition between payment providers which will drive the price down.

Proving a violation in one of these markets may be a lot more challenging than the other.<p>A. Monopoly Power<p>The first step in proving a monopolization offense under the Sherman Act is proving the company possesses &quot;monopoly power in the relevant market&quot;. In determining monopoly power, the courts start by examining market share, but &quot;but typically do not find monopoly power if the firm (or a group of firms acting in concert) has less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service within a certain geographic area.&quot; [1]<p>Obviously, with Apple&#x27;s current market share of 46% [2] in the United States, they are unlikely to be considered possessing monopoly power in the smartphone market.<p>B. The &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot; Market and Aftermarkets<p>Since proving Apple&#x27;s monopoly power in the smartphone market seems unlikely, Epic instead alleges Apple has monopoly power over a different market: &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot;. Since Apple has complete control over iOS App Distribution, problem solved, right? Not so fast.<p>Much like razor blades and razors or printers and ink, &quot;app distribution&quot; would be considered an aftermarket of the smartphone market. Aftermarkets are very common in antitrust cases, and in general, the US legal system does not allow you to define an aftermarket in the context of a single brand&#x27;s product unless very specific rules are met:<p>&gt; <i>Because it would be inappropriate to punish a firm for its natural monopoly in its own products, courts embraced a sweeping prohibition against analyzing alleged anticompetitive activity by focusing on single-brand relevant markets: &quot;[A]bsent exceptional market conditions, one brand in a market of competing brands cannot constitute a relevant product market.&quot;<\/i> [3]<p>A good summary on antitrust issues in aftermarkets can be found here. [4] Of particular relevance is that an aftermarket monopoly based on a customer&#x27;s voluntary agreement to a contract is not considered a &quot;relevant market&quot; for antitrust purposes.<p>In <i>Blizzard Entertainment Inc. v. Ceiling Fan Software LLC<\/i> [5], Ceiling Fan Software attempted to argue that Blizzard held monopoly power in the market of &quot;add-on software for WoW&quot;, and preventing them from releasing their own WoW add-on was a violation of antitrust law. Blizzard argued (successfully) that the &quot;WoW add-on&quot; market was not the relevant market because WoW users voluntarily agreed to a EULA stipulating they would only used Blizzard authorized add-ons when they initially purchased the game, and if they wanted to use third-party add-ons they could have purchased another game instead.<p>In <i>Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i> [6], Psystar Corp attempted to argue that Apple held monopoly power in the &quot;Mac OS&quot; market and used it to unfairly block competition in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket. The court ruled that Apple&#x27;s monopoly power in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket was based on the EULA that customers of Mac OS agreed when they purchased Mac OS, and was again not a relevant market for antitrust purposes, because <i>&quot;customers knowingly agree to the challenged restraint&quot;<\/i>. In other words, if they didn&#x27;t like the restriction of not being able to install Mac OS on non-Apple hardware, they could have purchased an alternative operating system instead.<p>Circling back to the iPhone and its app distribution aftermarket, it seems the same reasoning would apply here. If the iPhone EULA specifically states that customers can only install apps via the App Store, and the customer knowingly purchases the product knowing such limitations are in place, it seems very unlikely that a court would agree that &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot; is actually a relevant market for antitrust purposes.<p>C. The &quot;iOS In-App Payment Processing Market&quot;<p>On the other hand, the antitrust claims Epic makes regarding this market are much more compelling because unlike the app distribution market, customers have no information about the restrictions in the relationship between the developer and Apple, and they certainly did not agree to any such restrictions when they purchased their phones. Without a contractual restriction in place, the determination of whether the &quot;iOS In-App Payment Processing Market&quot; is a relevant market depends on multiple factors which I won&#x27;t go into too much detail here or this post will be even longer than it already is, but suffice to say they have a much higher chance of successfully making this argument.<p>Epic also has a strong argument here that Apple requiring in-app payments to go through the App Store and taking a 30% cut of each payment directly harms consumers by increasing prices, and lacks any justification other than to hurt competition. And the rebuttal that you can buy a different product without this restriction falls flat because the other major product on the market also charges the same cut.<p>The upshot of all of this is it seems unlikely that Epic will be able to compel Apple to permit third-party app installation on the iPhone, but they may be able to successfully argue against the restriction that all in-app purchasing must go through the App Store.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;tips-advice&#x2F;competition-guidance&#x2F;guide-antitrust-laws&#x2F;single-firm-conduct&#x2F;monopolization-defined\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;tips-advice&#x2F;competition-guidance&#x2F;guide-a...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpointresearch.com&#x2F;us-market-smartphone-share&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpointresearch.com&#x2F;us-market-smartphone-sh...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;metzler-v-bear-automotive-service-equipment-co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;metzler-v-bear-automotive-service-...<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;us-submissions-oecd-2010-present-other-international-competition-fora&#x2F;aftermarkets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;us-submissions-...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;blizzard-entmt-inc-v-ceiling-fan-software-llc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;blizzard-entmt-inc-v-ceiling-fan-s...<\/a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;apple-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;apple-2<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-18 01:59:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["williesleg"],"id":[24190177],"kids":{},"parent":[24189153],"text":["Epic = China\nLet the flame wars begin.\nAlso, please post first if you&#x27;re a CCP member first, so we all know."],"time":["2020-08-17 20:26:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sunkenvicar"],"id":[24195184],"kids":{},"parent":[24189153],"text":["I hope the federal government takes care of these rogue Chinese Companies."],"time":["2020-08-18 06:12:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["pier25"],"id":[24189721],"kids":[24190069],"parent":[24189153],"text":["Essentially, it&#x27;s a win-win for Epic.<p>If they win the lawsuit they will (probably) be able to have more control over how they want to distribute their iOS apps.<p>If they lose, they won&#x27;t have to deal with iOS anymore.

I hate that he ok&#x27;d this. Epic has 3 seats on the board and Tencent has 2, with 2 &quot;observers&quot; which are probably Tencent loyal. So at some point along the line Sweeney had to ok this... Looks like the Tencent money leverage got to him. He knew this would cause problems for devs that chose HIS engine. Why Tim Why.

The ZIP file format (which is used for JAR files as well), which puts the header at the end, is truly the sin that keeps on giving.<p>A consequence of this choice is that ANY file concatenated with a ZIP file is a ZIP file (and the same therefore goes for JAR files as well.) So if you concatenate an MSI file with a ZIP&#x2F;JAR file, your MSI file detector will look at the file and go &quot;yeah, looks good!&quot;, and your ZIP&#x2F;JAR file detector will also say yes. (This also shows off the hazards of automatic filetype sniffing.)<p>This is related to one of the very oldest Android rooting vulnerabilities. The update.zip files use the signed JAR file format, where the file contains a signature on its own contents. Naturally the signature can&#x27;t cover the entire file; it only covers the contents referenced by the header.<p>But the sin-that-keeps-on-giving strikes even harder here: The end-of-file ZIP header also has an end-of-header comment field, of arbitrary size! This means that a single file can actually have MULTIPLE valid ZIP headers. Which means two different tools can interpret the file as two different ZIP files (much as the bug here can interpret the same file as either a ZIP or an MSI.)<p>Don&#x27;t do drugs, kids.

As long as the weapon&#x2F;tool is on the table, and there are enough people, someone who is a bit more sociopathic, greedy, or has more emotional turmoil will pick it up and wield it against other people for their own gain.<p>For examples see: all of history whenever a person &#x2F; civilization had any advantage over another person &#x2F; civilization and sufficient time elapsed.<p>Its kinda crazy but everyone always thinks that some new power &#x2F; invention that creates a one-sided situation like this will &quot;only be used for good&quot;, imagining that the people using these tools will be benevolent (for all people who could use the tool, and all the time the tool exists)."],"time":["2020-08-17 16:26:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vermilingua"],"id":[24184113],"kids":{},"parent":[24182494],"text":["Discussion on the law itself here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24006150\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24006150<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-17 06:52:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24185038],"kids":{},"parent":[24182494],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-17 10:00:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["paulcarroty"],"id":[24185609],"kids":{},"parent":[24182494],"text":["I just remember for non-Australians and Australians too: if you still use Bitbucket, Jira, or another Atlassian products - think about the privacy right now."],"time":["2020-08-17 11:44:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rapind"],"id":[24186383],"kids":{},"parent":[24182494],"text":["If the problem is that Google will be forced to share data with news media... maybe just stop collecting data then, so there&#x27;s nothing to hand over?"],"time":["2020-08-17 14:00:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dutch3000"],"id":[24186128],"kids":{},"parent":[24182494],"text":["google search is already going down the tubes. for example, i search every variation of “when is grass fungus active” and am served up with results on how to cure grass fungus. just one example of many in how there search engine cannot deal with different angles to a search and has huge delivery buckets that aren’t useful, if you need a more granular search ability"],"time":["2020-08-17 13:18:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DecoPerson"],"id":[24184720],"kids":{},"parent":[24182494],"text":["The legislation [0] gives all news businesses (including smaller ones) a pathway to force Google to enter into an agreement with them. It opens up Google and Facebook to world of costly business dealings.<p>With little effort, I could start “Deco’s Local Newspaper” and publish a few issues online. This will give me a pathway to force Google to “deal with me.” This negotiation, mediation and arbitration could incur Google thousands of dollars in employee time, arbitration fees, and paying for half of the legal costs. Google cannot say “no” from the start. They can’t even ignore me without being in violation of the new legislation.<p>Relevant snippets:<p>“...  news media businesses can participate in the code if:<p>- They predominantly produce ‘core news’, and publish this online: [...]<p>- They adhere to appropriate professional editorial standards: [...]<p>- They maintain editorial independence from the subjects of their news coverage: [...]<p>- They operate primarily in Australia for the purpose of serving Australian audiences: [...]”<p>“If the parties have not reached an agreement for the inclusion of news on digital platform services within three months of negotiation, and the parties have attended at least one day of mediation, news media businesses can elect to commence arbitration.”<p>“Arbitration under the code would be performed through ‘final offer arbitration’. The digital platform and news media business (or a collective of news media businesses) must each submit a final offer on the remuneration to be paid by the digital platform within 10 days of the commencement of arbitration. Parties would then have a further 5 business days to provide comments on each other’s offer.”<p>“After receiving submissions and comments from the parties and the ACCC, the arbitrator would have 30 business days to choose one or the other of the parties’ ‘final offers’, which would form a binding agreement between the parties.”<p>Therefore: I can force Google to enter into an agreement with me (even as a small business) and incur thousands of dollars of overhead costs in the process.<p>I’m not one to use hyperbole, but this is insane. I would not be surprised if Google turns off Google Search entirely for Australia when this code passes.<p>Also, this legislation is specifically for Google and Facebook:\n“Digital platforms must participate in the code if the Treasurer makes a determination specifying that the code would apply to them. The Government has announced that the code would initially apply only to Facebook and Google. Other digital platforms may be added to the code if they hold a significant bargaining power imbalance with Australian news media businesses in the future.”<p>This also seems strange, though I’m not against legislation specifically for mega-corps.

We could no longer guarantee that under this law. The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses - news media businesses - over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. News media businesses alone would be given information that would help them artificially inflate their ranking over everyone else, even when someone else provides a better result. We’ve always treated all website owners fairly when it comes to information we share about ranking. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google Search results and YouTube will be worse for you.<p># Your Search data may be at risk<p>You trust us with your data and our job is to keep it safe. Under this law, Google has to tell news media businesses “how they can gain access” to data about your use of our products.

We partner closely with Australian news media businesses — we already pay them millions of dollars and send them billions of free clicks every year. We’ve offered to pay more to license content.

It really refers to prolonged concentration on something. We do this all the time. Yogis or occultists refine the term further into 3 stages: a brief concentration, a prolonged concentration (i.e. meditation) on something real and tangible like a symbol, and meditation on the idea behind that something real and tangible. Knowledge workers are very familiar with meditation, although they don&#x27;t recognize it as a special activity. However that 3rd stage is unattainable for most people today: ideas are qualitatevily different. Mastering meditation on ideas switches mind into a special state. From that point directing mind at things like sun, moon, light or more abstract ideas like the relationship between space and sound produces significant effects or just summons ideas and thoughts about them. This is how great scientists make discoveries: they direct their mind at some topic and summon ideas about it (they don&#x27;t produce ideas with induction or deduction) and then they materialise ideas into more tangible math."],"time":["2020-08-17 23:16:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rvn1045"],"id":[24186951],"kids":{},"parent":[24185710],"text":["Meditation will make you more sensitive to whatever you are feeling.

The idea behind this is that depression manifests as distorted thoughts (e.g. &quot;Everyone hates me, I should die.&quot;), and the goal is to notice these thoughts and learn to substitute them (eventually automatically) with thoughts that are more productive&#x2F;positive.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, most meditation practices are very helpful for the &quot;notice the thoughts&quot; part, but, especially in non-religious settings, tend to neglect the &quot;substitute the thoughts&quot; part. Usually what I hear is something like &quot;notice the thought and let it go.&quot;<p>So if the thought &quot;Everyone hates me, I should die&quot; comes up during meditation, you just notice it and let it go. That often provides some relief in the short term (you&#x27;re no longer actively thinking about dying), but you&#x27;ve done nothing to prevent it from arising again later, and you haven&#x27;t learned any coping techniques for when similar thoughts <i>won&#x27;t<\/i> go away (which can be a symptom during severe episodes). If you have depression or anxiety and want to get into meditation, I would strongly suggest at the very very least researching the principals of CBT in case you find yourself in this situation. I would recommend an app called Woebot. Even better would be to try some actual CBT if you are able.<p>All that said, I think that for me joining a meditation group was beneficial for me because of the social aspect more so than the actual meditation. This group emphasizes community (sangha) and service pretty heavily. A lot of people get social benefits from other religious communities, but as someone who didn&#x27;t grow up in a religious household, I find Buddhists super easy to get along with. They tend to be very accepting, especially to newcomers, since they are taught not to make judgements of others.

The absolute worst period of depression I went through was when I was single, living alone, working a job I hated, in a city that was far too encouraging of drinking as the only viable past time (Philadelphia). I was very fearful of medication at that time. I had heard a lot of bad stories, not just about side effects, but about <i>effects<\/i>, like the medication removing both the lows <i>and<\/i> the highs of their emotional state. There were also stories of negative consequences for people&#x27;s jobs: losing security clearances and the like (which are very old stories by now, but such rumors don&#x27;t have a lot of respect for changing times).<p>I was able to get out of that state through career coaching. I was feeling bad because I hated where I was in life. Fixing that, I got a lot happier. It felt really good to put form to my woes, to put a target on them, and eliminate it, one by one.<p>I got married. I had kids. And then I hit another, big, depressive period. Work had been a mess going on 5 years by that point. My wife gently pressured me into going to see a doctor and get medication.<p>I did the medication for a while, and it helped at first, but I think it mostly just confused my own, internal understanding of my emotions. I started it about 2.5 years ago, in the middle of a hellscape of an office. After a year, it just stopped working. The doctor increased my dosage levels, but things never went back to square. I think what happened was that I just recalibrated my understanding of my emotions. I had physical cues before the medication: heart racing, running thoughts, a physical feeling of the floor dropping out from under me. Now, I lacked those feelings, but I actually recognized situations in which I should have felt them, and in some ways the lack of the feelings felt like stumbling, like taking a step for a stair that isn&#x27;t there. I spent another year on the medication, under the belief that things would be a lot worse without it. There were some negative side effects that were also having a bad impact on my mood.<p>But I think the biggest positive impact on my mood was getting a good job where I&#x27;m respected and nobody brow-beats me over made up deadlines. Halfway through that last year of medication, I changed jobs. I noticed things getting better. I got so sick of not feeling like I was in control of my body, listening to doctors who had no clue what was going on just make guesses at what to do, that I told my doctor I was going to make my own guesses and quit the medication.<p>I&#x27;ve now been off of it for 6 months and everything is... as good as the best days when I first started the medication, minus the negative side effects, so better in every aspect."],"time":["2020-08-17 17:54:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["milin"],"id":[24186260],"kids":{},"parent":[24185710],"text":["Nice try.

Usually, code review and auditing of what goes into a commit prevents this kind of attack from leaping to VCS. But Apple makes the pbxproj so inscrutable, and does such a good job at hiding all its complexity behind (usually well-designed) wizards and dropdown menus, that people take it for granted.

Which is, as far as I am concerned, a government run scam (sorry if this offends anyone).  By &quot;we&quot; I mean, most of our neighborhood and town.<p>What makes this a mess is that SCE can&#x27;t talk about CPA rates and CPA can&#x27;t talk about SCE billing.  One, in theory, provides the electricity and the other charges you for the transport and some fees.  If you have ever tried to make sense out of one of these bills you know exactly what I am talking about.  I have spent hours on the phone will SCE billing people and they can&#x27;t tell me how some of it is actually calculated, even managers don&#x27;t know.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleanpoweralliance.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleanpoweralliance.org&#x2F;<\/a><p>What makes it even worse is that the rate comparison tools and calculators available before the transition to CPA+SCE evaporated after the transition.  The SCE website has been a mess for about two years and not having access to rate comparison tools makes it even worse.  Billing and data clarity is obfuscated, to say the least.<p>Some of us are now in the process of opting out of CPA just to that we can talk to a single point of contact and actually discuss the bill.  With CPA in the loop it is impossible because CPA and SCE point fingers at each other and consumers are left in the middle wondering what the heck happened.<p>Even beyond that, SCE told everyone that they had &quot;grandfathered rates&quot;.  This are the TOU-D-A and TOU-D-B rates from a few years ago.  One of the things that changed radically with respect to that time is that some of the costs per kWh have more than tripled.  When inquiring about how this could happen with &quot;grandfathered rates&quot; we were told that the <i>rate schedule<\/i> was grandfathered not the cost per kWh.  In other words, the demarcation times between &quot;On peak&quot;, &quot;Off peak&quot; and &quot;Super off peak&quot; remain fixed but your cost per kWh changes.<p>This is the most dishonest use of the term &quot;grandfathered&quot; I have seen in my life.  This might not make sense to readers outside of the US.  Here, the term refers to a condition being protected from future changes.  Anyone who heard that term pretty much assumed their <i>costs<\/i> were locked in, not just the times for each rate.  From my perspective this was a swindle.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grandfather_clause\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grandfather_clause<\/a><p>Frankly, this is about as anti-consumer as one can get.  The average person isn&#x27;t equipped to run through even the simplest electrical power calculations, they just don&#x27;t understand.  Add to this the complexities of tiered and time-of-day systems, varying rates and costs of transport, energy vs. power calculations, area under the power curve (which is what you pay for), difficulty in understanding energy utilization, etc. and you have the makings for a public that is powerless against this complexity.<p>I am quite comfortable with mathematics and complex financial modelling and still had to devote hours to getting enough answers from SCE to attempt to create a model in Excel in order to understand what happened during the last few months, not just for us but also our neighbors.  Even with that, the decision had to be made to opt-out of CPA because the math is simply too complex and nebulous.  Not to mention that I have better things to do with my life.<p>The decisions people like myself made a few years back --in my case the 13 kW system-- were based on promises made --a contract-- with SCE.  Never in my life I would have thought that a system of this size would result in us having to pay for electricity.  And so here we are.  If this continues the ROI will be negative forever and the size of the system would either have to increase by 50% or more or batteries will have to be added in order to manage consumption at lower rate-per-kWh times of the day (which can change at the will of SCE).<p>I am literally working on this as we speak, so the pain and aggravation is fresh and real.  At some point legal action might become the only recourse, I don&#x27;t know.  My neighbors are absolutely livid, unlike me (I engineered, bought and installed my own system), they ended-up with a range of leasing and other arrangements from a number of different vendors.  The typical systems these vendors install are based on the rate structure at the time of system installation and only seek to achieve a baseline cost structure between lease payments and electricity purchase beyond generation.  As rates and billing complexity changed, some of these folks are finding out that their 3.5 kW system is now almost useless and their electricity costs are going off the rails.  The trouble is, they will have to pay on these leases for years and years.<p>This is a mess."],"time":["2020-08-17 19:23:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vmception"],"id":[24193282],"kids":{},"parent":[24188135],"text":["Jeffrey Skilling is out of prison and working on a blockchain energy venture with Lou Pai<p>Just check to make sure they arent holding California’s power for ransom pending payment to a random Bitcoin address"],"time":["2020-08-18 00:59:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tln"],"id":[24191804],"kids":[24192547,24195793,24191923],"parent":[24188135],"text":["The article ends with:<p>“If there’s really a problem and not just the ISO jumping the gun, it’s going to manifest tomorrow,” Mr. Marcus said. “Tomorrow evening, the wolf arrives.”<p>What is that referencing?"],"time":["2020-08-17 22:43:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scrumbledober"],"id":[24193376],"kids":[24194277],"parent":[24188135],"text":["If the state could magically have enough battery capacity in every county to smooth out this curve, what scale of battery installation would that take?"],"time":["2020-08-18 01:09:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevespang"],"id":[24194582],"kids":{},"parent":[24188135],"text":["&quot;As California ISO began taking its emergency actions on Saturday, electricity wholesale costs jumped on its energy market.

I have previously even hired digital artists&#x2F;CAD developers to help me illustrate my ideas.<p>To me there are lots of obvious structural things that are outdated about cities.  And it is fun to think of out-there concepts to radically change or maybe improve things.<p>Recently I was in Gravity Sketch making a 3D model in VR of part of my idea.  That 3d model looks terrible now and has only about 40% of the concepts included.  Right now it is a series of connected enclosures, sort of like domes but sort of not like domes.<p>Basically there will be like a grid of these enclosures that are connected by two or more levels of roadways for small autonomous cars (pods) -- most of which will be for single passengers.<p>Each megastructure is a little bit like a tree inside of an egg.  Spiraling along the internal edges will be roads for traversing the levels.  There will be something like 7 or 8 vertical levels, each of which is maybe 4 or more stories tall.  The branches of the tree are steel holding up platforms.<p>Each main level has two sub-levels: one for infrastructure, and one for people and buildings.  The infrastructure level contains the roadways for the autonomous pods, as well as things like water, electricity, sewer, networking, and basement&#x2F;cargo reception.<p>The main level contains multistory buildings, walking roads, and a significant amount of space set aside for a type of permacultural-landscaping.  So there will be zoning requiring that space to be developed as for example food forest with aquaponics built in.  This will be on all levels and platforms.  So in the city charter or whatever is this requirement to dedicate a certain amount of space to this type of agriculture which is also landscape.  The idea is not to realistically produce all of the food or even a great proportion of it, but to enable some fresh produce to be at hand and to ensure that people are connected with food sources.  The idea is that by making agriculture a more integral part of the city, there may be more attention placed on agriculture by ordinary people and there may be more attention placed on making it more sustainable or something.  Also it seems wasteful to just use landscaping for decoration.<p>Another aspect is that I would like alternating bands of facade on the egg.  So there will be strips of something like glass but which will permit UV B (required for Vitamin D production) in a double layer.  And then strips of a thick insulated layer with an energy-harvesting sheathing that incorporates solar panels and ducted wind turbines sort of embedded in tunnels in the solar-cell-covered undulating surface.<p>It seems that you would need strategies for passive and active heating and cooling.  Such as automated shading, opening and closing ventilation, and heat recovery ventilators.  Etc.<p>It would be nice if some type of glass could be used largely for central walkways in order to increase the penetration of light.<p>Anyway I have a bit more that I wrote up before.<p>Multi-Level City Concept<p>In a high-density urban core, many skyscrapers exist in a relatively small area.  This makes it possible to house many people and support many businesses in that small footprint.<p>However, in these areas, while most buildings may have 50 or more floors, there is only a single level containing public infrastructure: the ground level, which contains all of the vehicle transportation, water, sewer, electricity, and communication.<p>In this scenario, there is actually more private infrastructure in the buildings themselves than infrastructure in the public level.  This is because each structure is a self-contained, privately designed and privately maintained entity.  So transportation (elevators), electricity, communication, water, sewer must all be facilitated by each private structure.  In addition, each of these is connected to the public infrastructure on only one level.<p>This presents multiple problems.<p>Problems with Single-Level Infrastructure in Many-Level dense Urban Cores<p>Since vehicle traffic can only move on one level, congestion can be extreme.<p>Multi-Level Public Inter-Building Public Infrastructure for Dense Urban Cores<p>Supporting Autonomous Passenger and Cargo Delivery<p>Suppose that there was a way to build a type of multi-level skeleton for a city.  So instead of a single roadway at only ground level, there were several different roadways at different floors of a superstructure.  This superstructure would be designed to support the installation of modular construction.<p>With this system, delivery of goods by small autonomous vehicles could, for example, proceed directly from the back cargo door of a restaurant on level 8, to your front door on level 2 a few blocks away, strictly over the public roadways which connect not only different buildings but also at different levels.  Vehicles could traverse levels over graded roadways or perhaps some type of small vehicle elevator system.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>Another _totally different_ idea that I had quite awhile ago was <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runvnc.github.io&#x2F;tinyvillage&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runvnc.github.io&#x2F;tinyvillage&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-18 01:57:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Proven"],"id":[24194443],"kids":{},"parent":[24184470],"text":["Since when does $10B gets any attention?<p>$3,000B was given away this year, with nothing to show for.<p>Talk about doomed republic."],"time":["2020-08-18 03:39:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["lorenzfx"],"id":[24188289],"kids":[24194463,24194804],"parent":[24175728],"text":["There is hardly anything in this article on the influence of the Black Sea on the Mediterranean world.

Marking as deletion has a cost of maintaining them throughout the session.<p>#2 CRDTs were perfect for plain strings and arbitrary key&#x2F;value pairs. But when it comes to schematic JSON that has semantic value CRDT was an added overhead. For example, try making a collaborative HTML editor with support for table operations. It is very likely you will end up with a table structure that is invalid to render. In OT analysing, modifying or cancelling ops were much easier.<p>#3 Since the software is primarily a cloud document editor, a central server is necessary even otherwise. So why not use the server for efficient version management and operation sequencing as well? Why prefer CRDTs whose bulk of complexity comes from eliminating the need of a central system?<p>Such practical reasons have kept us from venturing into CRDTs. As of now, common editing platforms like Google Docs, Zoho Writer, CKeditor, ProseMirror, Quill, CodeMirror - all of these work with OTs instead of CRDT for collaborative editing."],"time":["2020-08-17 15:13:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["raphlinus"],"id":[24187395],"kids":[24188007,24190759,24187646],"parent":[24176455],"text":["In xi, there are two issues. One is the cost of the CRDT representation, the other is whether it accurately represents what you&#x27;re trying to do. Classical implementations of CRDT use a heavyweight node per character in the text, each with its own unique and permanent id. In my research in xi, it became clear to me that more compressed representations are possible, and the xi CRDT is one such: it is an &quot;op&quot; object per edit, but the string itself is just a string.<p>Lately there has been other work pursuing those compressed representations: Chronofold, I think Martin Kleppmann&#x27;s automerge has some memory-efficiency work, and there are others.<p>But at least in the context of xi, this is not where things went wrong. As I&#x27;ve written about (and the author was kind enough to link), it&#x27;s because CRDT merges aren&#x27;t a good fit for the problems a code editor is trying to solve, particularly when the &quot;collaborators&quot; are automated processes such as language servers.<p>In human collaborative editing, it&#x27;s important to preserve text that&#x27;s being entered, even in the face of conflict. But when a peer is an automated service, it&#x27;s much better to drop the edit on the floor and recompute. I&#x27;m simplifying here, as it depends on the service - some are history-insensitive, some are sensitive to a small window of history (in the case of automatically inserting indentation, etc), and (speculative) other services may be sensitive to more history.<p>In addition, the CRDT constrains the data model considerably. In other words, it&#x27;s unfortunately <i>not<\/i> a clean abstraction where you can easily add higher level layers on top of the CRDT, but you always have to design those with the CRDT in mind (ie, everything still has to be a monotonic semi-lattice).<p>So, as with everything else, it&#x27;s a tradeoff, and it&#x27;s a question of weighing the pros and cons. I&#x27;m glad to see work being done to improve CRDT, but even with a very efficient representation and solid algorithms, the problems with CRDT would be enough for me not to use them in a code editor."],"time":["2020-08-17 16:13:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["spankalee"],"id":[24188567],"kids":{},"parent":[24176455],"text":["I&#x27;ve implemented operational transform based systems several times, and every time I check out CRDTs I end up staying with OT.<p>I find the complexity arguments against OTs to be far, far overblown and mostly academic, and that OT is, for me, much easier to understand.<p>The two big critiques against OT are transform explosion: you could have N^2 transforms. Except that not every operation pair interacts. I usually see just a couple of categories of operations: text, key&#x2F;value, tree, and list, and they all only need transforms within a category.<p>The second critique is around sequencing in a distributed system, but I&#x27;ve also never seen a production system that doesn&#x27;t have a central coordinating service.

My elementary school in the 1990s had a bunch of Apple Macintosh Performa 575 and 580 machines running Mac OS 7.5; the school still had them as late as 2001 when I completed sixth grade.  At the earlier grade levels we learned typing (using &quot;All the Right Type&quot;) and LOGO programming, and starting around fourth grade we learned how to write basic reports using ClarisWorks&#x27; word processor.  I am also familiar with the drawing tool that is part of ClarisWorks.<p>I&#x27;ve been collecting classic Macs for the past 16 years, ever since one of my teachers gave me a Macintosh SE and a Performa 6220.  Every now and then I boot one of my classic Macs and open up ClarisWorks.  One of the things I like about most software written for the classic Mac OS is their strict adherence to the Apple Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just the nostalgia talking, but Apple Pages and Apple Numbers do not spark the same joy in me that ClarisWorks did, though Apple Keynote is a superb software product.

The wave function does not exist in physical space, it exists in <i>configuration<\/i> space.  Configuration space is the same as physical space only in the one very special case of a single non-entangled particle.  The intuitions of physical space do not generally carry over into the general case of configuration space.<p>2.  In order to produce interference you have to split up the wave function into two pieces and then bring those pieces back together again with a phase change.  But since the wave function exists in configuration space, &quot;bringing it back together again&quot; becomes increasingly difficult as the number of entangled degrees of freedom grows.  As a practical matter, it is effectively impossible to do this once the number grows beyond a few hundred (this is why building quantum computers is hard).  But an actual macroscopic observer consists of O(10^23) degrees of freedom, and is also entangled with their environment.  This is the reason that large systems behave classically and don&#x27;t exhibit interference.<p>3.  Whether or not a system is in a superposition is not a physical fact about the system, it is a consequence of the measurement you choose to make.  A vertically polarized photon (for example) is in a superposition relative to a measurement axis rotated away from the polarization axis.  For a more complicated system, the measurement axis, like the wave function itself, is in <i>configuration<\/i> space.  But we can only do measurements in <i>physical<\/i> space.  This is the reason that in order to see interference in an entangled system it is necessary to do multiple physical measurements and look at the correlations between them.  Doing those kinds of measurements on actual macroscopic objects is <i>way<\/i> beyond the current state of the art, and may well be impossible even in principle.  But this is the sort of thing that is contemplated in the theory behind these experiments.  This is the reason that single particles are used as stand-ins for Wigner&#x27;s friend."],"time":["2020-08-17 23:58:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["monktastic1"],"id":[24190251],"kids":[24192365,24195237],"parent":[24189723],"text":["I haven&#x27;t read the new paper in enough detail to comment, but also mentioned is the Renner-Frauchiger paper, which Scott Aaronson heartily debunks here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=3975\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=3975<\/a><p>The primary error there is one that people can&#x27;t seem to stop making for some strange reason: if you don&#x27;t measure a property X, and instead measure a (non-commuting) property Y, you are not free to say what X &quot;would have been,&quot; and -- especially egregiously -- to use that to demonstrate a contradiction.

I probably sound like I&#x27;m verging dangerously close to anti-intellectualism here, which I don&#x27;t really want to do in the current cultural climate, but if anything it&#x27;s the opposite: We should remember that believing someone implicitly just because they&#x27;re an intellectual is also anti-intellectual.

Google Apps Script is Google’s development platform for writing scripts for Google apps like Sheets, Docs, Slides etc. It also lets you load HTML pages inside window dialogs in these apps, so you can build a simple UI that can interact with, for example, a spreadsheet, or you can use these dialogs to create an add on and publish it in the G Suite marketplace for others to use.<p>When you load an HTML file, the window dialog environment provides you with a way to call functions you’ve written in Google Apps Script (basically, Javascript with access to Google APIs).<p>The drawback with Google’s platform is the HTML file has to be a single page, and it can’t load other scripts. Google’s own documentation recommends using jquery and templates. Bah! Not good!<p>With the right webpack configuration and plugins you can build a complex React page that is bundled as a single HTML file, and load it into a dialog window. This project is a working demo of how to do that (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enuchi&#x2F;React-Google-Apps-Script\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enuchi&#x2F;React-Google-Apps-Script<\/a>).<p>The trickiest part here is building a proper local development experience. What I ended up doing is creating a wrapper app that is loaded into the dialog window during development instead of the actual React app. The wrapper loads an iframe pointing at a localhost address, and then I use a modified version of Webpack Dev Server to serve the React app in development at that localhost address. I use a helper utility to call the server-side Google Apps Script functions directly in production, but tells the wrapper component to call the functions in development, so it behaves pretty much the same way in production and development. Okay, a bit hard to explain…<p>Here’s a link to a quick video of using the development mode to actually hot reload the app inside a Google Sheets dialog.

I don’t disagree with it, but also some people just don’t produce enough milk to fully sustain a child and you need to supplement. When our kids were older my partner found out that her doctor actually noted that her breast tissue was likely to not produce sufficient quantities of milk on her medical chart, but failed to ever tell her. Hence feeding the kids 8-12 times a night, times two kids.<p>As a result years later I now can’t sleep for more than 5 hours a night without waking up and not being able to go back to sleep for an hour or two.

Sane code and architecture solves most performance issues. This includes technology decisions, like using web tech for applications instead of the native platform.<p>For example, Apple has had a lead of at least five years over Android when it comes to performance and user experience, because their system and apps were all built in native environments, instead of the JVM abstraction layer. It took at least five years for Android to catch up, and it took quadcore CPU&#x27;s to do it. Around then, Apple carefully started using dual-core CPUs.<p>Meanwhile, companies like Facebook and Twitter spent dozens of work-years on trying to make web technology feasible in native apps and never really cracked it.<p>If they had just focused on building good native apps they wouldn&#x27;t have wasted so much time.<p>Caveat &#x2F; Aside: IIRC Facebook is having &#x2F; has had massive issues with having too much code &#x2F; classes &#x2F; files in their app(s), on both iOS and Android.

IIUC, mass-produced physical goods are inferior to their handmade counterparts because of the trade-offs that enable profitable mass production. So we have a strong emotional attachment to handmade things being better, and the Handmade movement plays on that emotional attachment.<p>But the metaphor breaks down if you think about it. A carpenter making a single piece of furniture can tailor it to the person who will be sitting on it. A cook making a meal for one person can tailor it to their dietary requirements or tastes. But software of any non-trivial scale is rarely written for one person. Even when it&#x27;s developed according to the ideals of the Handmade movement, it will be mass-distributed.<p>I actually think that, contrary to our intuition about handmade things, Handmade software tends to have compromises compared to software that builds on well-established components. I won&#x27;t repeat miki123211&#x27;s top-level comment [1]. I&#x27;ll just add here that it&#x27;s precisely the economics of large-scale software distribution that allow concerns such as internationalization and accessibility to be addressed, while a solo Handmade project will probably not have these important things.<p>So, while slinging JavaScript code with no regard for performance and packaging it with Electron is certainly not the ideal, I strongly believe that the Handmade approach isn&#x27;t either.

When I saw the Yale domain I thought it would be a research paper or at least something written by an expert on the subject. It appears this is written by a journalist[0] and as typical of things written hy journalists, leaves out crucial details&#x2F;sources which leaves you with more questions.<p>&gt; the country’s commercial fishermen often serve as de-facto paramilitary personnel whose activities the Chinese government can frame as private actions.<p>???? The article doesn&#x27;t go any further, but how would you use a bunch of unarmed fishing vessels crewed by &quot;illiterates&quot; (according to the article) for anything resembling a military purpose. Later on it mentions &quot;crowding&quot; but doesn&#x27;t really go into detail about what that means.<p>Plus what is a &quot;distant water fishing fleet&quot;? The article gives numbers for overall number of fishing vessels and then &quot;distant water fishing fleet&quot;, but only provides context for the later number by saying the US has only 300 such boats in its fleet. If a country with coasts on two oceans only has 300 of these, it has to be some really specific category of boat right? What makes this category important?<p>And of course there&#x27;s the framing of the article, the fishing is done by private commercial fishers but apparently their entire country is to blame. I mean you can make some arguments about subsidies but then the article itself acknowledges that other countries also engage in similar level of subsidies.<p>Also there&#x27;s this weird fixation on North Korea, where it claims the Chinese fishing fleet is depleting North Korean waters, but doesn&#x27;t really tell us about whether or not that&#x27;s done with North Korea&#x27;s permission.

Maybe it’s just my perception but it doesn’t seem like we have very many people thinking deeply about what models we should build and to what ends. Instead we are just building the models and hoping we can put them to good use afterwards.<p>For example, what’s the end game for the cellular signaling modeling outlined in the article? It seems like the result isn’t valuable in and of itself, and it can’t be much more than that because the scientist “doesn’t understand it, and doesn’t think any person could.” So we now have an equation that expresses constants within a cell and that’s it. We don’t understand it and we can’t put it to good use. So was that time and effort well spent? Do we just put this work in a drawer so we can pull it out if it could be useful at some point in the future? Is that what we’re doing with all the similar advances in modeling?<p>There’s nothing wrong with knowledge for knowledge’s sake, but I think we’ve way over indexed on the tools and predictions side of the system. If we continue to constantly create new tools&#x2F;models&#x2F;predictions we might find a use for them by chance. It just seems more efficient to focus on what outcomes we really want and then put the models to work in pursuit of those outcomes. Perhaps we focused more on the outcomes in the past because we didn’t have the technological horsepower to constantly churn out new models.<p>Maybe I’m wrong and there are people working on the big picture.

For example, a computer model of the movement of people within a confined space who are fleeing from a threat--they are in a panic--shows that putting a column about one meter in front of an exit door, slightly to either side, actually increases the flow of people out the door. Why? There may be a theory or it may simply be an emergent property. We can climb the ladder of complexity from party games to humans with the single intent of getting outside of a burning building, to phenomena with many more people with much more diverse and changing motivations, such as markets.
