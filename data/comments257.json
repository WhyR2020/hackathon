To qualify my point: Ideally, you won&#x27;t be explaining your personal history to a prospective employer in these terms. It&#x27;s unfortunately all too common for people to fall on hard times resulting in prolonged periods of unemployment. Breaking ( back ) into a career after these gaps is an extremely hard task for an individual. Most people I&#x27;ve known ( myself included ) were able to do it though, through either good luck or perseverance ( or some mix thereof ).\nDon&#x27;t expect to be given a chance on the basis of sympathy. I&#x27;m sorry that this might sound a bit unfriendly, but it&#x27;s the unfortunate truth. You&#x27;ll need to accept the fact that your personal history will be a setback, to one extent or another.<p>Just so you don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overly unsympathetic, here is my personal story: I had a very rough upbringing. I moved between an unstable and violent household and the streets throughout my teens. I had very little positive influence throughout my childhood. I dropped out of school at 16 years old and lived as a petty criminal until my mid twenties. I did work some minor entry-level jobs from time to time, but certainly nothing that I would even want to list on a resume. Mostly manual labor.\nI spent some minor time incarcerated as a result of being convicted of many minor crimes. I feel very fortunate that I do not live in the US, where a history of incarceration permanent blacklists you from most professions. During an altercation I was injured very badly. I suffered ligament and tendon damage in my leg which near crippled me. It took two years of physiotherapy before I was able to even run at a jogging pace. I wasn&#x27;t going to be very good at my present vocation if I could only limp around the place. This necessitated major changes in my life.\nI was very depressed and purposeless for some time, but after a bit of an epiphany I won&#x27;t bore you with I decided to seek gainful employment.<p>I was about 26 years old at this point. I had some minor experience with programming from having an interest in graphic design as a kid. I took a terrible entry-level job in technical support and taught myself some web development while there. I was basically exploited by this company but I gained a sense of pride in being a reliable and competent worker. I had expected to be spat on by the rest of society, but I found that I was a smarter and more reliable worker than my peers and was quickly promoted. By complete chance I overheard a different department interviewing applicants for a web design&#x2F;development role within the company. In a pivotal moment that would change my life I decided to just knock on the hiring manager&#x27;s door and tell him that I had these skills. They submitted me to the same test they gave the applicants, which I ended up acing. From that day on I moved into my first programming role. The rest is history. I&#x27;ve been in this field for years now at a variety of companies. I have had to explain my past a few times, never publicly. Fortunately it&#x27;s been 8 years since I last had any trouble with the law, so most companies have been able to overlook this.<p>It is certainly possible to break into the industry with minimal experience and a terrible past. You can always start in very junior positions just to get your foot in the door and improve your resume. From there you can bend the truth without pushing the envelope. Work your actual skills into your work history creatively, pursue every chance you get to prove yourself to your employer. Jump at every chance you get to excel!\nThere&#x27;s no need to be brutally honest about your history either. Don&#x27;t expect anyone to take pity on you, they won&#x27;t.<p>Best of luck, and merry Christmas!"],"time":["2019-12-26 04:10:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["acollins1331"],"id":[21880817],"kids":{},"parent":[21880179],"text":["If your degree is in the physical sciences you might want to consider an entry level research position in that science.

Why? To protect LAPD Command officers who were members of the LAPD crime buster Vigilante Facebook group used to coordinate acts of terror and crimes of violence onto Los Angeles homeless population. It’s worse than President Trump’s corruption leading to Trumps impeachment because multiple homeless victims may be dead by induced suicide and outright violence, and even poisoning LAPD Crime buster Vigilantes have blood on their hands. Thus, no investigation by Becerra. California Attorney General Becerra is a corrupt Attorney General that will not do his job and investigate LAPD supported vigilante crime onto Los Angeles homeless. He is not be a good Progressive democrat like Congressman Shift or Nancy Pelosi. Becerra is two faced an lie to the public by refusing to investigate LAPD crime buster vigilante complaints. The LAPD calls most of the LA political shots and will do dirty, ugly criminal things to keep their power. They are racist and use Vigilantes on a homeless population that is 45 percent Black. The “Black Lives Batter” movement should be concerned about LAPD supported vigilante violence onto LA homeless.  Attorney General Becerra empowers LAPD racism by giving them a free pass on the crime buster vigilante scandal.  By Law the California Attorney General is required to gather California Hate Crimes Data. In California, he is allegedly a leading democratic leader who is to assists California State Assembly and Governor Newsom  so that California becomes the eighth State to protected homeless from hate crime attack as a class. Instead Attorney General Becerra protects the vigilantes who do horrible hate crimes onto homeless.  It happened like this: On August 1, 2018, a coalition of homeless advocacy organizations consisting of Los Angeles Community Action Network (LACAN), National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, and Western Regional Advocacy Project (WRAP), co-signed a complaint letter to the California Attorney General detailing vigilante activities. The evidence supporting the Complaint are the 43 Facebook postings that show LAPD and San Fernando valley residents targeting homeless victims for violent crimes.  LA City Attorney is involved in crime buster vigilante corruption The los Angeles City Attorney, Mike Feuer allows the Topanga Neighborhood Prosecutor to conspires and  do crime onto homeless. The Los Angeles DA and Los Angeles City attorney are corrupting the LA courts using them to jail homeless victims who fight back against the vigilantes. Los Mayor Garcetti also protects the LAPD by refusing to publicly expose  vigilantes who do anti-homeless psychological terror torture by constantly  stalking homeless victims until they snapped and commit suicide. Their Facebook dialog proves LAPD vigilante “Community Stalking” is done by the LAPD crime buster vigilantes.

This approach is much more stable numerically.<p>If for some reason want to insist on taking the normal equation approach, then maybe do a numerically exact solution of the system of equations and&#x2F;or matrix inversion:  For this, of course, start with rational numbers.  Multiply through by powers of 10 until have all whole numbers.  Then for sufficiently many single precision prime numbers, solve the equations in the field of integers modulo each of those primes.  For multiplicative inverse, that is a special case of the Euclidean greatest common divisor (least common multiple) algorithm.  Then for the final answers, multiple precision, use the Chinese remainder theorem.<p>For full details, see a paper by M.

The article assumed I was already familiar with MirageOS and why I would want such a set-up ... but thankfully the MirageOS homepage covered my questions:<p><i>...<p>Self-scaling architecture<p>We can create auto-scaling web-servers with very small footprints. These would be cheaper to run than current solutions due to the small size but they would also be highly elastic. If a sudden spike in traffic occurs, the web-servers can be configured to create and deploy copies of themselves to service the demand. This auto-scaling happens so quickly that an incoming connection can trigger the creation of new server and the new server can then handle that request before it times out (which is on the order of milliseconds). When the demand dies down again, these web-servers can automatically shut themselves down. Since these machines boot fast we can be more elastic, raising and lowering capacity to precisely meet demand and therefore only spending what we actually need when we really need it.<p>...<\/i><p>Xen is a very large beast so maybe replacing it with Genode could further reduce attack surface and even speed?

Allegorically, this was treated as a person, like Zeus, but recognized to be fundamentally transcendental and ineffable pure — the One.<p>The <i>Logos<\/i> was the emanation from the One; it was the son of god, so to speak, that crafted all material reality. Logos is typically translated as &quot;word&quot;, like &quot;in the beginning was the word&quot;, but that minimizes the concept of logos. Importantly, Jesus was understood to be the incarnation of the Logos in human form; &quot;the word made flesh.&quot;.

But a friendly reminder to those readers who want a quantum device but prefer a low-power, solid-state implementation: A &quot;quantum&quot; random number generator doesn&#x27;t always have to be fancy, it can be as boring as a diode. Diodes only allow current to flow to one direction, but if you reverse bias a diode hard enough, they&#x27;ll eventually breakdown, conduct, and produce a fixed voltage drop across it. This principle is used to make voltage references and regulators. But on a closer look, the diode also produces a significant amount of random noise in this process. And the mechanisms responsible for the breakdown of a diode, either Zener Effect or Avalanche Effect, although are semi-classical, but ultimately quantum mechanical in nature - the electrons received enough energy to randomly pass through the forbidden bandgap, and the noise is effectively unpredictable. (There are also tunnel diodes that use real Quantum Tunneling, which doesn&#x27;t have any classical explanation, fancier than Zener or Avalanche Effect, but general-purpose tunnel diodes are no longer in production of large quantity.)<p>There are some really expensive avalanche or tunnel diode noise sources you can buy, that are made by electronics giants like Keysight, that are designed to produce perfectly calibrated white noise across a few GHz of bandwidth for RF test, measurement, or cryptographic purposes. But you can build a simple one, the only problem is that the ordinary diodes are not designed to breakdown, they will, but it&#x27;s thousands of volts and potentially a destructive event, thus they are not really useful. You can buy Zener diodes, but it&#x27;s likely that you don&#x27;t already have one and you don&#x27;t want to wait for shipping. But there&#x27;s another neat choice - use a transistor. The base-emitter junction of any bipolar transistor is effectively a diode for DC signals. And the most common transistors are small-signal transistors, it&#x27;s easy to apply a low reverse voltage, typically 6.0 V [0] to make it go breakdown.<p>Then connect it to an amplifier and a ADC, you are done. And you don&#x27;t even have to use an ADC, you can use a 74ALS04 logic gate (the faster, the better, 74LS is not recommended) and connect a feedback resistor to force the logic gate to work as an amplifier rather than a switch, and you get an amplified and digitized output. This idea was originally posted to the sci.crypt newsgroup. And many have built variations of this circuit with success.<p>Although some warned that this circuit is vulnerable to external radiofreqency interference, which can be used by the NSA to attack your generator, so good RF design practices, such as heavily shielding the noise source and the amplifier, good power supply decoupling and filtering are recommended. It&#x27;s also recommended to add a builtin self-test routine to your microcontroller and disable the output in case the circuit fails the randomness check - it&#x27;s an industrial standard safegaurd.<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csshl.net&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;downloadable&#x2F;hw&#x2F;hw-rng.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csshl.net&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;downloadable&#x2F;hw&#x2F;hw...<\/a><p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makezine.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;really-really-random-number-generator&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makezine.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;really-really-random-number-ge...<\/a><p>* <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryogenius.com&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;rng&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryogenius.com&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;rng&#x2F;<\/a><p>On the other hand, readers who are interested in extremely fancy quantum number generators should take a look of the double-slit experiment, single-photon light sources, interferometry, and photomultiplier tubes. A simple idea would be making a single-photon light source first (e.g. adding a heavy attenuation filter in front of a dim laser, so at any time, it&#x27;s very likely that only a single photon can get out on average, it&#x27;s not strictly a single-photon source, but close). Then the single photon hits a beam-splitter (e.g. a half-silvered mirror), when the photon leaves the mirror, there are photomultiplier tubes working at a thousand volts and enormous gain to detect a single photon. There&#x27;s a 50% chance that the photon will hit detector A, and 50% chance that it will hit detector B. Take notes of the result, and you have built an amazing quantum random number generator.<p>[0] e.g. See the datasheet of the 2N3904 transistor, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onsemi.com&#x2F;pub&#x2F;Collateral&#x2F;2N3903-D.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onsemi.com&#x2F;pub&#x2F;Collateral&#x2F;2N3903-D.PDF<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-26 03:28:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["muzzletov"],"id":[21881519],"kids":{},"parent":[21862728],"text":["You mean &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to predict the bias&quot; :)"],"time":["2019-12-26 02:33:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vermilingua"],"id":[21880592],"kids":[21880660],"parent":[21862728],"text":["Would the uranium marbles be at all likely to cause bit errors?

It also provides an import&#x2F;export function that is compatible with other services like Pinboard.in.<p>After using Pinboard.in for several years I noticed that I basically only ever use the features described above. Also while I like the minimal approach and the quick UI of Pinboard, it could just look a little bit nicer. So I took that opportunity to make a hobby project out of building such a service myself while also learning something new. I decided on Python and Django as stack, as I never really used Python and Django looked impressive. Building the application took me around 2 weeks. I implemented the features above, added a basic CSS framework with minimal tweaks so the UI looks nice and made everything work on mobile. My take-aways from the project are that Django is really awesome. Django is a batteries-included web framework and provides pretty much everything you&#x27;ll ever need OOTB. The documentation is among the best I have ever seen.

That somewhat subjective attachment is going to be dictated by the audience one is writing for, a liberal audience is going to get a liberal opinion (here painting the Mormon leader in a negative right) and vice versa for a Mormon audience.

In practice, this happens extremely rarely and, in any case, every language provides some kind of a backdoor to bypass the type sys- tem when that’s really necessary.<p>This is patently false. Port a correct dynamically typed program to Haskell and it will certainly fail until you satisfy the type checker through no small <i>extraneous<\/i> effort. And this is not a theoretical matter; it is an enormous cost to the programmer that is not there in weaker or non- typed systems.<p>It is a certainty that type systems ask for far more than is needed to produce correctness. Anyone who tries to dodge this obvious and fundamental truth is operating off of a religious not rational commitment to defending their type system. Note that I am not saying the type system doesn&#x27;t <i>give you something back<\/i> but it certainly comes with a <i>inherent<\/i> cost over alternatives.<p>&gt; Another argument I hear a lot is that dealing with types imposes too much burden on the programmer.

I quickly analyzed the number of issues that had been submitted (including a recent influx of layman users), and simply removed it. Email support works fine for us based on our usage data. The decision was made easier because I didn&#x27;t invest a bunch of time up front integrating with some external service, or building a 100% solution the first time around.<p>&gt; It certainly didn&#x27;t help, that our former A&#x2F;B testing tool emphasized short-term wins. When we added a huge sales overlay, it appeared to bring more conversions — since the return visitors were ready to take action. The new visitors probably hit the back button as soon as they arrived.<p>This is great. All of your analytics insights are completely dependent on a) measuring the right thing and b) interpreting it correctly over the long term.<p>EDIT:<p>I do want to mention that these articles always point out downloaded code size as a primary factor in the decision, but I rarely see any data showing how the reduction in code size translates into an improved user experience, based on the principles of human perception. In my experience, the really big gains come from techniques like background fetching.<p>Not that code size isn&#x27;t important, but I think the main point should be the reduction in complexity that comes with it. That pays dividends in developer time and avoiding bugs, which translates directly to an improved user experience.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anderspitman.net&#x2F;11&#x2F;dependencies&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anderspitman.net&#x2F;11&#x2F;dependencies&#x2F;<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anderspitman&#x2F;issued\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anderspitman&#x2F;issued<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-24 17:55:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21879454],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-25 18:27:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21873487],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-24 18:28:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["xwowsersx"],"id":[21873603],"kids":[21873719],"parent":[21871491],"text":["I just see a blank grayish blue page."],"time":["2019-12-24 18:44:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["abraxas"],"id":[21881915],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":["If disquss is hailed as an example of good design we’ve fallen so hard..."],"time":["2019-12-26 04:46:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dominotw"],"id":[21872386],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":["YAGNI ?"],"time":["2019-12-24 15:51:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dsalzman"],"id":[21874903],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":["KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid is my mantra"],"time":["2019-12-24 22:05:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["volument"],"id":[21873424],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":["The title now matches the HN staff edit."],"time":["2019-12-24 18:19:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cvaidya1986"],"id":[21873687],"kids":{},"parent":[21871491],"text":["True."],"time":["2019-12-24 18:55:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baybal2"],"id":[21874040],"kids":[21877815,21875022,21874693,21875756,21874788,21874158,21875385,21875869],"parent":[21873229],"text":["Very relevant: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21747424\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21747424<\/a><p>Can this be an API leak which Chinese MSS used to track Chinese users?<p>It may well as be if we believe that API wasn&#x27;t implementing discoverability restrictions from privacy settings, and only hid users on the UI level.<p>&gt; Basically Twitter got pwned big time, and now denies it because GDPR will ruin them if breach is proven.\nHere is what Doubi&#x27;s online followers figured:<p>&gt; State security got all phone numbers used for Twitter phone verification up to May 2019 and possibly till July.<p>&gt; Twitter haphazardly closed the breach in complete secrecy.<p>&gt; API hole explanation is excluded as people with 100% private accs got police visits.<p>&gt; People with foreign SIM cards also got into trouble.

People will complain that you are being over-conservative and probably laugh at you or grow concerned. They might point to other companies that succeeded in such and such time. Ignore them just like they ignore survival bias.<p>* Divide revenue by 5 to 10. A repair business running at 30% profitability needs to gross $3 for every dollar it keeps. A restaurant needs to make 20x at 5% margin. Chargebacks. Refunds. Illness. Accidents. Countless life experiences can make it feel like you are treading water for months&#x2F;years. Another way to say this is that each dollar you make in your startup is like making $5-10 anywhere else, so treat it with the reverence it deserves.<p>* Donate plasma. This is a form of prostitution because you are selling yourself for money, but you&#x27;ll make an extra $300&#x2F;mo. You&#x27;ll get a glimpse of the value of human life and dignity inherent to an industrial society that&#x27;s being denied to us all by the lack of UBI. It will also show you the true value of money because you&#x27;ll see that retail service jobs pay 1&#x2F;2 to 1&#x2F;4 per hour what plasma pays. You&#x27;ll learn how all money is blood money because someone always exchanges blood, sweat, tears or time for it (unless they are born into it like the people who most likely have it today). And if you aren&#x27;t ready to put your life on the line in some fashion, you might not be ready to make the big sacrifices that running a startup demands, or even lead others.<p>* Learn The Secret (The Law of Attraction) and other mindfulness practices. It&#x27;s not so much that they are real (my experience is that it&#x27;s all real) but that successful people are likely to attribute their success to things besides luck. It&#x27;s good to know how to speak the lingo and present a good appearance for networking, since your primary revenue stream will probably come from a human need you might not have expected.<p>* Find a romantic partner that believes in you. Short of that, work a good job for a while and provide for their needs for some number of months or years before your startup so they&#x27;re willing to take a risk on you. Or reject this advice completely and be a loner for a few years. Most startups were started by geeks, so it might be advantageous. But if you succeed, don&#x27;t be a douche. Nobody likes that you succeed. Many secretly hate you for it. Be magnanimous. Pay it forward. If you suffer in solitude or walk around like a self-help guru, you&#x27;ll probably fail.<p>* Remember that the thing isn&#x27;t the thing. Financing to get you to the thing is. Our entire system of western capitalism is at odds with your personal dream of being the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. And since all money is blood money, maybe you don&#x27;t want that anyway. We need new heroes like, I dunno, Captain America. I think that there is vast untapped potential in ideas like cooperatives and communal stewardship of the things we care about. I&#x27;ve tried to adopt ideas like radical inclusion into my life. Maybe something in your belief system will lead you to a worthy cause and the funding to see it through.
