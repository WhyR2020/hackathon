If it isn&#x27;t someone who &quot;gets&quot; your industry, you&#x27;ll kind of just be thrown to the back of their pile. There is a lot of serendipity to who advances.

We did a different one (at a true &quot;idea stage&quot;) and it went great. Make sure to apply to others like Techstars, Capital Factory, Masschallenge, Betaworks, Boost VC, the list goes on.

He divided life into what he called the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom. Hägglund adopts these categories: the realm of necessity involves socially necessary labor and the realm of freedom involves socially available free time. Rationally, Hägglund says, we should strive to reduce the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom. But capitalism is systemically committed to exploiting most of us, and to steadily increasing the amount of labor at the expense of our freedom. Capitalism treats the means of economic life, labor, as though it were the purpose of life. But, if we are to cherish this life, we have to treat what we do as an end in itself. “The real measure of value,” Hägglund says, “is not how much work we have done or have to do (quantity of labor time) but how much disposable time we have to pursue and explore what matters to us (quality of free time).”"],"time":["2020-04-20 11:23:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loup-vaillant"],"id":[22922534],"kids":[22922550,22924068,22923013],"parent":[22922156],"text":["I have a major problem with the idea that death makes life precious.

I&#x27;m blind since birth and have had various software development jobs. These days I shifted a bit and started my own company doing digital accessibility consulting.<p>If you&#x27;ll become totally blind (e.g. need to transition to a screen reader some day), I would advise you to leave the Mac platform. The built-in screen reader seems good at first, but falls down in complex work. Support for web browsing is suboptimal (Firefox is a no go) and the screen reader is only updated in the regular OS X release cycle. This means bugs will stick around a long time and it&#x27;s totally unclear what the status of a bug is. Also, hackability of VoiceOver is limited. I find that a must for a tool that I am 100% reliant on.<p>I&#x27;m very sympathetic to Linux and run it in many places (Raspberry pi, home server, some stuff on VPSs), but I think Windows is a better accessible desktop experience now. Microsoft is trying tu push accessibility hard in most of their projects, this is often lacking in open source projects. Even if OS projects want to do a good job at accessibility, they usually miss the manpower of knowledge to do so. Especially given Docker and WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux), it is easy to run Linux-based development workloads on a Windows box.<p>My editor of choice these days is VS Code. That team is also very active on the accessibility of their editor. I use the free and open source NVDA screen reader. If something in NVDA is broken, I can at least look at their Github if any work is being done and if needs be throw in a few patches myself.<p>So, summing up I would say: find out a set of accessible tools to do your job, learn them before you get blind. Relying on vision until the very latest moment will give you an enormous productivity hit when the switch to 100% screen reader use comes (based on my experience training low vision and blind users in a previous job).<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen from the thread, others have already touched on some advantages of being a blind coder. You&#x27;ll get a better mental model of your code out of necessity and depending on your team&#x2F;employer you can be a more valuable team member because you also bring knowledge of software accessibility.<p>Hope this helps and good luck!"],"time":["2020-04-20 10:49:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["csdreamer7"],"id":[22919079],"kids":[22922745],"parent":[22918980],"text":["Please watch this video on the i3 desktop environment.

I might not be able to relate to your situation completely but here are some of my experiences:<p>&gt;Are there blind frontend engineers?<p>I don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t do frontend at all, just that you can&#x27;t do it completely. Something like copying the layout from a visual mockup doesn&#x27;t really work unless someone describes the mockup to you, and even then it might not be 100 % correct, though i&#x27;d say your experience as a sighted frontend developer would definitely help there. Thankfully (in this case anyway) SPA&#x27;s tend to be so complex these days that there is plenty of work to do without touching the actual layout. My frontend work has consisted mostly of refactoring and writing various integrations. Occasionally I&#x27;ve written some complete features where I&#x27;ve laid out a rough version of the UI and someone sighted in the team has finished it off for me. This strategy has worked out relatively well for me in the past. However I&#x27;d say doing solo frontend work is sadly a no-go.<p>&gt; What kinds of software engineering lend themselves to someone with limited vision? Backend only?<p>Basically anything non-visual works out. Backend, yes, but also the business logic of SPA apps as well as devops work.<p>&gt; Besides a screen reader, what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?<p>- A good editor which is accessible and has an extensive set of keyboard shortcuts. Visual Studio Code and Eclipse are the two editors that I use in my day to day work.<p>- Terminal. It&#x27;s often much quicker to do things like text manipulation, version control and devops administration there, since you don&#x27;t have to waste so much time going through information that you don&#x27;t need. I&#x27;ve found git gui&#x27;s to be particularly useless.

I would invest heavily in making sure that I have a very trivial way to deploy Chrome user extensions or similar such that I could write my own screen readers, document explorers, etc. tailored to my own liking. The only thing close to Emacs is the DOM with JavaScript as it’s Elisp. A lot of people gripe about the web, but the fact that almost all my apps come under the same pliable DOM means I can manipulate without vision almost everything. See e.g. vimperator.<p>These two things mean that you could do most of your job as-is, with assistance from colleagues.<p>As you’re a full stack developer, you’ll find point 2 easy.

He said that (paraphrasing) the thing he really valued was the care, thought and attention I paid to the work I did.

As I was introduced to this new would-be-teammate, I instinctively tried to thrust my hand forward for a handshake, only to stop myself short with a horrifying realization that might not be an appropriate form. Fortunately, to my great relief, he was used to such situations and offered his hand first. This moment particularly struck me.<p>The experience of working with him was exciting and as challenging as it was enlightening, as I think I learnt a bit more about myself and all the things around me I took for granted.<p>Anyway, here are some of my observations<p>1. Navigating a busy open-layout office is possible, but hard. My colleague was really great at doing so without using his stick.<p>2. Often it is the sighted who would hesitate at water-cooler chat for fear of offending or saying something untoward, but the colleague took the initiative to put them at ease, so it was always fun. No one could slip out unnoticed by him. The puns were mortifyingly entertaining, which I think only a blind person can make.<p>3. The written form of communication goes great lengths in bridging the communication gap (This is applicable in general as well)<p>4. ASCII diagrams and SVGs are great ways of making content such as flow charts and architecture diagrams accessible. Tools such as PlantUML, dotviz, mermaidjs are helpful.<p>5. Statically typed languages make it much easier to work within a screen-reader environment. We were working with Go, and he had much better success with it than a language that was used in other parts of the company.<p>6. Emacs seems to have a lot of tooling to facilitate the use of screen-readers.<p>7. Open-office chatter (in-person and chat) can become overwhelming very quickly, so setting expectations ahead on how you&#x27;d plan to work helps your teammates.<p>8. Monitoring is hard (in a server-side environment) as the notion of &quot;taking a look&quot; at the graphs doesn&#x27;t translate for someone who is not sighted. I wish there were better ways that are more accessible.<p>Losing sight is perhaps one of the most terrifying prospects anyone can face. However, seeing (see what I did there) my colleague also gives me hope that all is not futile. It is possible to live a fulfilled life. It is possible to have a successful career as a software developer.

The reason why I encourage learning braille is that in place of or paired with a screen reader, you could use a braille display connected to your computer.  This allows you to employ more rapid mobility parsing a document than you might with a screen reader.

The ability to solve software engineering problems starts with the cognitive aspects of your knowledge, intuition, experience and who you are. An engineer&#x27;s cognitive ability to solve problems and guide outcomes is the most valuable thing that we bring to any project we join or undertake.<p>Look for a team or project that values critical thinking to drive execution over just banging out code. Don&#x27;t sweat being hands on in the long run, i.e. writing code and pushing features. Make the most of the work you&#x27;re doing now to start honing your skills to be able to drive things like architecture, implementation choices, etc. based on experience, lessons learned, people you enjoy working with etc.<p>Also, keep in mind that you have a unique albeit unfortunate set of circumstances that can bring a perspective as you&#x27;re going through this to what works and doesn&#x27;t for others in similar circumstances that want to have careers in software technology. Be open to an awareness for areas where you can help solve problems and be involved in building solutions for others in a similar circumstance as you&#x27;re in. Look for ways to develop products, tools, advisory groups, training, etc. that can help engineers with similar disabilities.<p>I wish you the best and again, I&#x27;m very sorry you&#x27;re facing this.

I can no longer do that work, but started learning orientation &amp; mobility white cane training from the Lighthouse for the Blind in San Francisco and worked with the Dept. of Rehab to figure out life moving forwards. I received training in how to use a screen reader in iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows. I learned about accessibility and dove into my background as a former QA engineer for animation software and my UX&#x2F;UI experience from VFX and motion graphics and started learning development on my own time. Figured out Python using TextEdit and Terminal on my Mac, am in the process of learning JS,  used Xcode to learn Swift, and I tend to code websites by hand, then share them with someone with sight to check out my CSS.<p>There are a lot of resources out there to help you adapt, but it will take baby steps. I highly recommend you learn braille as blind coders tend to use braille displays to quickly check through lines of code, although I primarily just use VoiceOver to listen to code line by line at a very fast speed. Braille will help you type a lot faster on your phone when you find a collaborative work experience to be inaccessible; we use Slack at work, but the desktop version is awful in terms of accessibility, so I only use the iOS app and can quickly and accurately type out very detailed messages using Apple&#x27;s braille screen input.<p>It&#x27;s all about adaptation and not being afraid to ask for help. Zoom and Google Meet work great, and Microsoft products have gotten much much better in terms of accessibility. Google Suite takes a lot of getting used to, but is doable and functional with enough practice.<p>If you are on Windows, Jaws and NVDA will be essential to learn, and I&#x27;ve heard that Visual Basic studio is very accessible. I haven&#x27;t found Sublime, atom, or other text editors to be accessible on the Mac, but TextEdit and Xcode work just fine for all matter of filetypes, and of course emacsspeak and Vim work in Terminal or iTerm.<p>Check out the &#x2F;r&#x2F;Blind sub reddit, Applevis.com, and know that you&#x27;ll have support.

I have known some really badass back end engineers that are entirely blind. With the right tools and some experience, they are able to consume content at the same speed as any sighted person. Hell, in some cases... significantly faster.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m really trying to get ahead of this thing<p>I think this speaks for your character. It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in denial and to hold out until the very last moment.<p>I can&#x27;t personally speak to how it feels to deal with going blind, so I&#x27;ll let those with much more experience in this area speak to that. One thing I can say though, is to start using the available tools <i>now<\/i> and full time, even if you don&#x27;t require them yet. By the time you find yourself depending on them, you will already be accustomed to using them.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to speak about my own personal struggles with disability (I am rapidly becoming deaf), but honestly... I&#x27;ll spare you that unless you actually want me to. It&#x27;s obviously a very different experience and I don&#x27;t want it to feel like I am diminishing the significance of what you are going through. :)<p>&gt; Since my diagnosis I&#x27;ve slowly developed a crippling anxiety centered around a feeling that I need to figure out the rest of my life before it&#x27;s too late.<p>This is a very reasonable and understandable reaction to what you are dealing with."],"time":["2020-04-20 04:03:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["emgee_1"],"id":[22923827],"kids":{},"parent":[22918980],"text":["Definitely checkout emacspeak."],"time":["2020-04-20 15:57:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["emgee_1"],"id":[22923813],"kids":{},"parent":[22918980],"text":["Definitely checkout Emacspeak."],"time":["2020-04-20 15:55:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Fr0styMatt88"],"id":[22924509],"kids":{},"parent":[22918980],"text":["I&#x27;ve been very low-vision since birth and having glaucoma (since birth) meant that I lived with the very real possibility of going blind.  I knew this from the time I was a child and preparations were made.  Thankfully my glaucoma has been under control for many years at this point, though I&#x27;m still extremely low-vision.  So what follows is just some random points, as I don&#x27;t really know how to keep this post reasonably short, nor what should go in what order.  So hopefully this doesn&#x27;t devolve into rambling :) Anyway, some observations and lessons:<p>- Others have mentioned touch typing.  I was taught touch typing from an early age with the help of an educational support teacher.  I can say that it&#x27;s one of the most valuable skills I have and I&#x27;m really, really thankful to the special teachers that put in the effort with me over those years.<p>- I naturally gravitated to computers.  I don&#x27;t know what it was, but after seeing them in school, I had to have one! I never got into blind sports as a kid and couldn&#x27;t play most regular sports at school, so my parents saw the opportunity of computers as something I could get into.  Something else I&#x27;m <i>really really<\/i> grateful for (I&#x27;ve been incredibly, <i>incredibly<\/i> lucky).  The rest is history.<p>- I&#x27;ll stress again - if you love software engineering and computers, there is no reason at all that it can&#x27;t be your profession.<p>- Tech-wise, I use a magnifier on my Android phone and I use the magnifier on OSX.  On Windows, it&#x27;s easier to sit close to the screen.  If you&#x27;re at the stage where you need screen magnification, I can say that I&#x27;ve found the OSX built-in magnifier along with the trackpad a stellar combination.<p>- I find it difficult to locate the mouse pointer, so I use an extension called Saka Keys in my browser, which allows me to follow links on pages without having to use the mouse.  I primarily use the command line for things if I can, especially if I might be on another machine that I can&#x27;t get as close to as I need (eg- helping a friend quickly).  You get to a point with touch-typing where you can feel when you&#x27;ve made a typing mistake.  You also get really good at memorizing stuff, as others have said.<p>- At work, don&#x27;t be afraid to speak up about what you need.  This is tough.  For many years I was embarrassed about needing help.  It&#x27;s illogical, I know, but it happens.  You want to be independent and prove that you can be &#x27;just as capable&#x27; as everyone else.  That&#x27;s a double-edged sword though.  People WILL forget you are vision-impaired.  I had a friend that I&#x27;ve known for years ask me why I sit so close to the webcam a few days ago when we were video chatting.  My webcam is on top of my monitor.<p>- Believe it or not, people WILL forget you are vision impaired or even blind.  I have plenty of experience with the former.  If you&#x27;re fiercely independent, people won&#x27;t think to offer you help.  You need to get comfortable with asking for help when you need it.  It&#x27;s a long, long process and something I&#x27;m still not 100% on myself; it&#x27;s difficult.<p>- A case in point: At work, for the longest time if somebody wanted to show me code or talk me through code, I&#x27;d feel too self-conscious and awkward to say anything as we sat there and they started talking through their code.  You get really good at memorizing stuff and going off what they say along with the broad &#x27;shape&#x27; of the code.  It would only be when I needed something specific, like they were pointing to a value or something, where I would lean in and say &quot;what was that value again?&quot;.  Nowadays I&#x27;m much more comfortable in my own skin and I simply ask them to either enable the magnifier on their machine, show me code through a remote desktop connection or I go to my machine and I have them talk through the code while I&#x27;m sitting as close to the screen as I need to.<p>- On a more philosophical note about other people; you&#x27;re going to come across some strange, but well-intentioned behaviour.  I&#x27;ve had new co-workers ask me why I sit so close to the screen; people assume if you&#x27;re wearing glasses that your vision must be fine.  You&#x27;ll get really annoyed at the &quot;sitting close to screens ruins your eyes&quot; crowd; yes, I&#x27;ve been told (with good intentions) that sitting so close might damage my eyes.<p>- The way I think of this is that people are generally good and I&#x27;m happy to answer questions from anyone, as long as they&#x27;re made in good faith.  Often I think that people are just uncomfortable with talking about disability.  Being a kind of a taboo, they think it&#x27;s better to &#x27;not say anything&#x27;, or they&#x27;re afraid of being rude.  I&#x27;d rather people ask and I&#x27;ve also become a lot better at being forthcoming about what I need.<p>- I&#x27;m still learning not to shy away from being a &#x27;vision impaired&#x27; person.  There are some YouTubers that I recommend which I find really inspiring and helpful in this regard:<p>- The Blind Life is a YouTuber (who if I recall correctly has RP) who focuses on assistive technology and gadgets.<p>- Molly Burke does some great stuff.  She is also blind, RP I think.<p>- For disability more generally, I cannot recommend &#x27;Special Books By Special Kids&#x27; highly enough.  It will literally change the way that you react to people.  It is utterly incredible.<p>I know it&#x27;s very different when you haven&#x27;t grown up with a disability and suddenly you have to deal with it vs it being &quot;the way it&#x27;s always been&quot;, but I hope some of this might help and I wish you all the best."],"time":["2020-04-20 17:13:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mahdid000"],"id":[22922097],"kids":{},"parent":[22918980],"text":["you can work as a conciliar and give some advice to companies."],"time":["2020-04-20 10:13:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mhkool"],"id":[22924065],"kids":{},"parent":[22918980],"text":["Search for Dr den Boer on YouTube.

My formation was as an economist with a Master in management, but I went into a 10 month reconversion course to IT, focused on java programming.\nI am working at a Portuguese international company called Critical Software (I am Portuguese), and it is really inclusive and I feel great. When I was looking for a job in economics.&#x2F;management I felt that no-one wanted to employ me because of my blindness, it was a little depressing, but in IT what matters is your brain, so, usually, there is no discrimination. Sometimes some creativity is needed to overcome some visual challenges, some inaccessible documents or less navigable websites, but with a good team spirit and no problems in assuming when you need help, everything is doable.\nMy experience is fully as a backend developer, but I had an internal workshop on React and I could make things happen in frontend during that afternoon. I am a Mac user (using VoiceOver) and I&#x27;ve used Windows with Jaws and NVDA before 2013. Now I am starting a new challenge at work, because we have to use Linux to run the test environment and, after having a very inaccessible experience with Mint in the last days, I will now install Ubuntu and try to completely figure it out with Orca, its screen reader.\nI am also doing a Master degree in Software Engineering since September, I&#x27;ve encountered some challenges, but where others visualize, I tend to create mental representations and, sometimes, I have a broader mental picture of things than my colleagues. I also agree with the user about the super-powers, I am realizing that my reading speed is priceless when there are things to learn at work or to study.<p>Regarding life itself... you can prepare in advance, I knew that I would become blind since I was 8 (I am 29), I still see a tiny bit, irrelevant to work or study but useful to figure light and some walls. I started to try to get around my room at night with no lights and I developed some confidence in myself during my teens. I also learned how to walk with the cane before I thought I needed it, it gives you extra security to know that you are prepared for the inevitable. And walking independently on your own is a requirement to have a guide dog.<p>I am an independent blind person now and, besides driving, I do everything I want. I play guitar, drums, go to the gym, hear the books I want with my screen reader and I&#x27;ve lived alone and cooked on my own for one year and I still have all my fingers. I know blind people that watch Netflix with audio descriptions, others that run marathons, play futsal...<p>My biggest challenge was when I wanted to change to software development and my first trial was a failure, and I lost hope of doing it. Since you have that part already, my suggestion is to be calm, believe that, like others, you are capable of overcoming the challenge and try to be yourself and believe in your problem solving capabilities, because in the en that is what life and blindness is about. And trying to prepare in advance and believing it is possible is a decisive first step, believe me!<p>Try to familiarize yourself with screen readers - NVDA on windows, Voiceover on all Apple things, Orca on Linux, talkback on Android. Know how to turn yours on and off and try to get familiarized with hearing things. There are other tools but I am not an expert on neither: braille displays, tactile printings, haptics also.<p>Also, try to have some mobility lessons (I don&#x27;t know if it is the right English term), it is important to learn to feel and hear instead of seeing and to &quot;activate&quot; the capabilities you already have but never needed.<p>Sorry for the essay, but I wanted to assure you that you can live your own life and be independent despite being blind.

My name is Peter Sherman.  I have been a software engineer for 20+ years.  I have also engaged in regular meditation for 20+ years.  I would suggest that what you&#x27;re going to experience in the future may turn out to be a blessing, rather than a curse, as daunting as the idea of future blindness seems.<p>Now, before I am tarred and feathered alive by pretty much everyone here in the HN community, please give me a moment to explain!<p>You see, most people spend their lives, their entire lives, searching for something which is outside of themselves, something which they believe will make them happy.<p>If they find it, it very well might, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s only for relatively short periods of time, and then desire kicks in, and then there&#x27;s a new set of goals, a new set of priorities.  Nothing lasts forever.  Nothing that grants happiness, even for many years -- will continue to do that for many more.  Everything changes.  (This is Buddhist philosophy incidentally).<p>What you&#x27;re searching for, might very well be within -- rather than in the external world.<p>So how do you find this thing within?<p>Well, the first step is that you have to close down the external world.<p>You do this by closing your eyes (note that this is no different than blindness -- but it is less permanent), and relaxing, observing the mind and its flow of images.<p>If you see nothing but black... don&#x27;t worry, I promise you, there&#x27;s a ton of stuff in there -- more than you could ever imagine, more than 80 Zillion Internets&#x27; worth of data.<p>You&#x27;ll see black for a fairly long time, maybe it will be months, maybe it will even be years, but eventually (with continued regular meditation) is that you&#x27;ll start to see pinpricks of light, bits of sound, and you&#x27;ll start to get intuitions and ideas from the higher mind, and you might see flashes of images.  You might also drift off into lucid or semi-lucid dreams.<p>The trick is, don&#x27;t try to use any force whatsoever to try do any of that, or those things will disappear.  The harder you try, the less success you&#x27;ll have (it&#x27;s paradoxic in this respect), so a relaxed gentle focus is the key.<p>Becoming blind, at least the knowledge that that&#x27;s going to happen to you -- could be compared to knowing that one day in the future you&#x27;re going to be pushed into the ocean -- and you don&#x27;t know how to swim.<p>Meditation, closing the eyes for at least 20 minutes a day, at a regular time every day, and relaxing, letting go, but maintaining a teensy bit of relaxed, gentle focus, gentle presence (&quot;be here, now&quot;), is not unlike learning to swim.<p>By the time you are pushed into the ocean... you want to be a champion swimmer, not someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to swim.<p>Meditation then, is like learning how to swim, if the knowledge of future blindness is like being forced into an ocean...<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;d like, we can talk more about this.

This includes letting them eat dirt and play with pets without worrying too much<p>- Children observe&#x2F;copy&#x2F;improve (and wil let you know when they are not interested in stuff). It&#x27;s really fascinating to watch. Keep that in mind when you want them to learn something<p>- Let them play with other children without worrying that it&#x27;ll be bad for them. Also don&#x27;t be scared to hand your toddler over to some other family member to hold etc...noone will drop them. Humans intuitively understand how to care for babies&#x2F;children<p>- Do research and base stuff on that (name bias and praising effort vs. ability are the only two that seem interesting on a quick glance)<p>That&#x27;s all I got so far. And there&#x27;s a certain set of values I want to teach but I believe the best way of doing that is by living it (be decent to people, be critical of yourself&#x2F;don&#x27;t take yourself too seriously, always stay curious about life, value freedom highly)."],"time":["2020-04-19 20:58:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Linkd"],"id":[22916138],"kids":[22916318],"parent":[22913871],"text":["I love to highlight text on my browser as I read.

Two issues lead to the success of our attacks: First, the decrypted data are interpreted by the configuration logic before the HMAC validates them. Generally, a malicious bitstream crafted by the attacker is checked at the end of the bitstream, which would prevent an altered bitstream content from running on the fabric. Nevertheless, the attack runs only inside the configuration logic, where the command execution is not secured by the HMAC. Second, the HMAC key K_HMAC is stored inside the encrypted bitstream. Hence, an attacker who can circumvent the encryption mechanism can read K_HMAC and thus calculate the HMAC tag for a modified bitstream. Further, they can change K_HMAC, as the security of the key depends solely on the confidentiality of the bitstream. The HMAC key is not secured by other means. Therefore, an attacker who can circumvent the encryption mechanism can also bypass the HMAC validation"],"time":["2020-04-19 17:03:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lnsru"],"id":[22916250],"kids":[22917402],"parent":[22915831],"text":["If I would really care about security, I would not pick SRAM FPGA in the first place.

To begin with: While it&#x27;s not realistic to make secure hardware (let&#x27;s say, a OpenPGP&#x2F;X.509&#x2F;Bitcoin Wallet security token) that can be 100% independently verified and free from all backdoors, but still, relatively speaking, FPGAs are generally a better and more secure option as a hardware platform than microcontrollers (for example, see the talk [0] by Peter Todd on Bitcoin hardware wallet and pitfalls of general-purpose microcontrolles), because of three advantages:<p>* It&#x27;s possible to implement custom security protections at a lower level than accepting whatever is provided by a microcontroller or implementing it in more vulnerable software.<p>* Many microcontrollers can be copied easily, but FPGAs are often used to run sensitive bitstream that contains proprietary hardware&#x2F;software, manufacturers generally provide better security protections, such as verification and encryption, against data extraction (read: OpenPGP private key) and manipulation attacks.<p>* Most &quot;secure&quot; microcontrollers are guarded under heavy NDAs, while they are commercially available (and widely used in DRM systems), but it&#x27;s essentially useless for the FOSS community. On the other hand, because the extensive use of FPGA in commercial systems, security is NDA-free for many FPGAs. It&#x27;s often the best (or the only option) that provides the maximum transparency - not everything can be audited, sure, but the other option is using a &quot;secure&quot; blackbox ASIC, which is a total blackbox.<p>Unfortunately, nothing is foolproof, manufacturers leave secret debug interfaces, cryptographic implementations have vulnerabilities, etc. Hardware security is a hard problem - 100% security and independent verification is impossible, making it harder to attack is the objective, but it&#x27;s worse than software - once a bug is discovered and published, the cost of an attack immediately becomes 0, and it cannot be patched. We can only hope that the increased independent verification, like the researchers behind this paper, can somewhat reduce these problems systematically.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r1qBuj_sco4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r1qBuj_sco4<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-19 16:56:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["krilovsky"],"id":[22917004],"kids":[22917241],"parent":[22915831],"text":["I don&#x27;t know what the best prctices are now, but it used to be best practice to blow the CFG_AES_Only eFUSE when using bitstream protection, which prevents the loading of a bitstream which isn&#x27;t authenticated, and thus foils this attack.

Here&#x27;s how that works:<p>Have some states, right, they are\ndiscrete.  For FedEx, that would be (i)\nthe number of customers talking about the\nservice and (ii) the number of target\ncustomers listening.  Then the time to the\nnext customer is much like the time to the\nnext click of a Geiger counter, that is,\nhas exponential distribution, that is, is\nthe time of the next arrival in a Poisson\narrival process (e.g., the time of the\nnext arrival at the Google Web site).  So\nat this arrival, the process moves to a\nnew state where we have 1 more current\ncustomer and 1 less target customer.  Then\nstart again to get the next new customer.<p>The Markov assumption is that the past and\nfuture of the process are conditionally\nindependent given the present state; so\nthat justifies our getting to the next\nstate using only the current state --\ngiven the current state, for predicting\nthe future, everything before that is\nirrelevant.<p>What is a Markov process, what satisfies\nthat the Markov assumption, can depend on\nwhat we select for the state -- roughly\nthe more we have in the state, the closer\nwe are to Markov.  In particular, if we\ntake the whole past history of the process\nas the state, IIRC every process is\nMarkov.  But Markov helps in something\nlike the FedEx application since that\nstate is so simple.<p>We get to use continuous time since the\ntime to the next change of state is from a\nPoisson process whose arrival times are\nthe continuum -- that is, we don&#x27;t have to\nmake time discrete although it is true\nthat the history of the process (one\nsample path) has state changes only at\ndiscrete times.<p>So, for state change, and for some\npositive integer n we have some n possible\nstates, then for i, j = 1, 2, ..., n, we\ncan have some p(i,j) which is the\nprobability of jumping from state i to\nstate j, that is, we have an n x n matrix\nof transition probabilities.<p>[p(i,j) is the conditional probability of\nentering state j given that the last state\nwas i.]<p>For two jumps, square that matrix.  Now\nthere is a lot of pretty math -- get some\nlimits and eigenvectors of states, etc.\nActually fairly generally there is a\nclosed form solution to the process.\nAlas, often in practice that closed form\nis useless because the n and the n x n are\nso large, maybe n^2 in the trillions.\nE.g., in a problem I solved for war at\nsea, there were Red weapons, Blue weapons,\non each side some number types and some\nnumber of weapons of that type.  The\nstates were the combinatorial explosion.\nThen there were the one on one Red-Blue\nencounters where one died, the other died,\nboth died, or neither died.  The time to\nan encounter was the next arrival of\nPoisson processes, also Poisson.  Well,\nthat was an example where there was a\nclosed form solution but n and n x n were\nwildly too large for the closed form\nsolution but running off, say, 500 sample\npaths via Monte-Carlo was easy to program\nand fast for the computer.  So, sure the\nsoftware reported the average of the 500\nsample paths.  On a PC today, my software\nwould be done before could get finger off\nthe mouse button or the Enter key.<p>This approach is fairly general.  And\nsince what I did included attack\nsubmarines, SSBN submarines,\nanti-submarine destroyer ships, long range\nairplanes, etc., there should be no\ndifficulty building such a model for\nCOVID-19 that included babies, grade\nschool kids, ..., nursing home residents,\npeople at home, people working nearly\nalone on farms, ....<p>Back to S curves, IIRC dropping out of the\nmath for the n x n matrix and its powers\nis an S curve.  So, in a broad range of\ncases, always get an S curve although a\ndifferent curve depending on, yes, the\np(i,j) and the initial state.  Uh, when no\none is left sick, the Markov process\nhandles that as an <i>absorbing state<\/i> --\nonce get there, don&#x27;t leave.<p>For the n in the billions, the n x n is\nreally a biggie.  So, for the submarine\nproblem I did,<p>J. Keilson, <i>Green&#x27;s Function Methods in\nProbability Theory.<\/i><p>asked &quot;How can you possibly fathom that\nenormous state space?&quot;.  That is a good\nquestion, and my answer was:  &quot;After, say,\n5 days, the number of SSBNs left is a\nrandom variable.  It is bounded.  So it\nhas finite variance.  So, both the strong\nand weak laws of large numbers apply.  So,\nrun off 500 sample paths, average them,\nand get the expectation within a gnat&#x27;s\nass nearly all the time.  Intuitively,\nMonte Carlo puts the effort where the\naction is.&quot;.  Keilson was offended by\n&quot;gnat&#x27;s ass&quot; but liked the math and\napproved my work for the US Navy.  That\nquestion and answer are good to keep in\nmind.<p>There is more in, say,<p>Erhan Çinlar, Introduction to Stochastic\nProcesses, ISBN 0-13-498089-1,\nPrentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1975.<p>For why the arrival times have exponential\ndistribution and why we get a Poisson\nprocess, Çinlar has a nice simple,\nintuitive, useful axiomatic derivation.\nThere is more via the renewal theorem in<p>William Feller, <i>An Introduction to\nProbability Theory and Its Applications,\nSecond Edition, Volume II<\/i>, ISBN\n0-471-25709-5, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New\nYork, 1971."],"time":["2020-04-19 19:58:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yters"],"id":[22916319],"kids":[22916429,22916344,22916368,22916762,22916407],"parent":[22915837],"text":["There is no such thing as an &#x27;exponential curve&#x27; in our finite world.

And being inherently stateful, you can have chaotic influences in that diffusion process. For example, the idea of microservice architecture had an absolutely massive diffusion jump the moment Amazon sent out that now-famous email mandating adoption. It wasn&#x27;t linear, it wasn&#x27;t exponential...it was a discrete step, and a very large one at that. These are everywhere too, because communication doesn&#x27;t propogate like bacteria grows, it propagates due to extremely non-linear levels of influence.

(Self-driving car videos tend to be published sped up, so you don&#x27;t see the mistakes.)<p>The key part of this is, how well does it box everything in the environment? That&#x27;s the first level of data reduction and the one that determines whether the vehicle hits things. It&#x27;s doing OK. It&#x27;s not perfect; it often misses short objects, such as dogs, backpacks on the sidewalk, and once a small child in a group about to cross a street. Fireplugs seem to be misclassified as people frequently. Fixed obstacles are represented as many rectangular blocks, which is fine, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be missing important ones.  No potholes seen; not clear how well it profiles the pavement. This part of the system is mostly LIDAR and geometry, with a bit of classifier. Again, this is the part of the system essential to not hitting stuff.<p>This is a reasonable approach. Looks like Google&#x27;s video from 2017. It&#x27;s way better than the &quot;dump the video into a neural net and get out steering commands&quot; approach, or the &quot;lane following plus anti-rear-ending, and pretend it&#x27;s self driving&quot; approach, or the 2D view plane boxing seen from some of the early systems.<p>Predicting what other road users are going to do is the next step. Once you have the world boxed, you&#x27;re working with a manageable amount of data. A lot of what happens is still determined by geometry. Can a bike fit in that space? Can the car that&#x27;s backing up get into the parking space without being obstructed by our vehicle?

I am clearly not unique in this regard, as this actually seems to be the most common type of UBI advocate I&#x27;ve encountered.<p>That being said, the one lingering question I have comes down to a variant of inflation. I think most people think of inflation as something that only happens as a result of monetary policy, but that&#x27;s not entirely true. Let&#x27;s say that UBI could be entirely funded through taxation, no new money is introduced into the system. There is still a form of inflation on certain goods. For example, let&#x27;s take an extreme example of redistribution: we take all of the money from a billionaire and redistribute it. One billionaire doesn&#x27;t buy 100,000,000 TVs for their house, but 1,000,000 people with $1,000 might each buy a TV. 1,000,000 people with an extra $1,000 has a much larger impact on demand for typical consumer goods than having that wealth be more concentrated. Of course stricter taxation of the uber-wealthy would have impacts lessening demand for large investments, so it&#x27;s not a blanket inflation in the same way that just printing money would be, but it still has all of the same characteristics of inflation within certain consumer markets.<p>It&#x27;s all very complicated, and I would like to see it modeled. If I&#x27;m a landlord, and I know that my tenants now have an extra $12,000 a year, do I raise rents? I think the natural argument is that because the scarcity or value of my real estate didn&#x27;t actually change, I open myself to being undercut by competition if I try to arbitrarily raise the value of my property to reflect increased demand. But the problem is that it might not be entirely true that the value of my real estate didn&#x27;t change. When I have to call a plumber, or gardener, or construction worker for a remodel, are their rates going to be the same? Are rates going to go up or down? It&#x27;s very hard for me to know for sure.<p>It reminds me a bit of debt. Debt shouldn&#x27;t necessarily produce inflation, but it definitely does. Do you think houses would cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars if the average person didn&#x27;t have access to debt? Would it cost 50k+ in order to attend college? No. Access to debt dramatically increases the prices on the things purchased by the available debt, regardless of whether or not this theoretically is meant to produce inflation. My concern is that, as with access to debt, the increase in wealth will be met with an increase in cost across the board, and not due to exploitation, but because the effects are that most consumer products and services actually just end up costing as a natural reflection of increased demand."],"time":["2020-04-20 01:29:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["twblalock"],"id":[22919671],"kids":[22919746,22919712],"parent":[22916979],"text":["The problem with UBI is that we would turn it back into the welfare system we have now.<p>Let&#x27;s say we pass a truly universal basic income bill -- every person gets the same amount of money from the government, every month.

Even the US has programs like this in most states though you could argue that compared to other countries they are a combination of expensive, inefficient, and ineffective.<p>Basic income is formalizing the status quo that there&#x27;s a minimum standard for all that basically translates into everybody receiving those same guarantees but simply with less bureaucracy &amp; moralistic BS around it. Basically it gets rid off or vastly simplifies the business of collecting and handing out social security insurances and different types of benefits. The cost for this in some countries actually rivals the benefits handed out. E.g. unemployment benefit programs have amazing amounts of bureaucracy associated in many countries.<p>For those who work, what changes is that part of their income now comes from basic income and they pay taxes over the rest. For their employers, they pay less salary and have less bureaucracy around things like insurance programs and social security (all taken care off). Also things like minimum incomes go away: they pay market prices for what somebody does for them. State pensions, unemployment benefits, sick leave compensation, etc. all basically fold into this basic income. If you want more, you work and pay for extra insurances yourself. If you don&#x27;t, basic income is there for you.<p>For those that are not part of the labor market, i.e. approaching (or already over) 50% of the population in many countries, what changes is that their life becomes a lot simpler. Either they are happy enough to get by on basic income or they secure some additional source of income. Either way, we&#x27;re already paying for their health care, housing, and food as as society. It&#x27;s a much less radical change than people think.<p>IMHO this could actually unlock the labor market in lots of countries. There are a lot of weird rules around unemployment that actually make it unattractive or hard for people to work. E.g. people close to their retirement age are expensive to fire and therefore unattractive to hire in lots of countries. People on benefits are actually would risk losing their benefits if they take some job on the side. So, they don&#x27;t work until they find something &quot;proper&quot;, which for some never happens.<p>Of course this kind of debate always raises the question &quot;who pays for this?&quot;. The people that ask this never look at the other side of the debate: how much do we save by eliminating and dismantling the byzantine bureaucracy responsible for the current system. Nobody has actually run that experiment.<p>Also, we have plenty of taxes left and plenty of wiggle room with things like VAT, fuel tax, profit tax and income tax. It boils down to a quite simple formula: total cost = X*#people. If you have say 17M+ people (NL, my home country) and assume 500 EURO per person, the total cost would be about 100 billion&#x2F;year for absolutely everyone. Sounds like a lot but as part of the GDP (around 900 billion) it&#x27;s not that bad and the that&#x27;s completely ignoring the fact that this would make hiring people lower risk and lower cost for all companies; which tends to do wonders for their profitability (and thus profit taxes). The cumulative budget for existing programs in NL is actually similar to this.<p>Sadly, doing this is not feasible not for economical reasons but for political&#x2F;moralistic reasons and ingrained (wrong&#x2F;naieve) assumptions that many people have about how economies work (e.g. that they are balanced and circular). It&#x27;s simply too radical for a majority. Even socialist&#x2F;communist countries never went there and in fact had a lot of moralism and ideals around the notion of labor with the state actively trying to control who was allowed to do what and for how much."],"time":["2020-04-20 14:00:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["burlesona"],"id":[22917804],"kids":[22918022,22917987,22918155],"parent":[22916979],"text":["I don’t know what’s wrong with that website, but visiting it heats up my phone to the point of being uncomfortable to hold."],"time":["2020-04-19 20:33:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["williesleg"],"id":[22917476],"kids":{},"parent":[22916979],"text":["If everyone gets free money that will just cause inflation.<p>Get with the program, do something the world needs.

So you can test as much as you want, but this whole pandemic started from ONE person in China so as long as there is 1 or 5 or more likely 100s or 1000s of cases in any country then as soon as restrictions are loosened the infection rate will exponentially go up again.<p>You can play the game of opening&#x2F;closing schools&#x2F;shops every couple weeks for about 2 years until everyone either got eventually infected or we might see a vaccine hitting the public. Even if a vaccine might be available at the end of 2020, it won&#x27;t be available to the public across the globe for yet another year if not longer. That is just simple maths on manufacturing and distribution, anyone who thinks differently is completely dillusional.<p>So my question remains, what is the end goal with all of the testing? Calling testing as a way out of the lockdown is either a dumb assertion, because more testing won&#x27;t stop the spread (contact tracing and isolation will only slow the exponential outbreak by days or couple weeks), or it is a lie to give the public false hope.<p>There is only two ways out:<p>- Now, by lifting all lockdown restrictions, target, shield and isolate the most vulnerable in our society (old &amp; fragile, people with diabetes, cancer, HIV, etc.), ramp up hospital capacity and let the virus rage through the remaining population, hoping that everyone else will mostly experience mild or no symptoms and only very few people who need hospitalisation and who will die given that the most vulnerable remain in isolation...<p>or<p>- stay in lockdown for 24 months at a minimum until there&#x27;s the capacity to manufacture and supply a vaccine to roughly 60% of the population with a pointless ping pong exercise of easing and tightening the restrictions<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure which one is better, but there is literally NO OTHER OPTION.<p>Most of Europe is currently going down the second option and Sweden is mostly leading on the first option. I predict that if in ~ 6 months time countries will see that there&#x27;s little difference in the death rate between countries with tright restrictinos and those with lax restrictions (because tight restrictions only delay the deaths, but don&#x27;t prevent) then everyone will change to a more Swedish model probably.<p>Only time will tell the truth."],"time":["2020-04-19 23:16:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devit"],"id":[22917521],"kids":[22918754,22917733,22920284,22918350,22920266,22918293,22919392],"parent":[22915620],"text":["I don&#x27;t quite understand why Apple and Google are releasing an API instead of a single system application.<p>This is going to create a gigantic mess as governments with limited software development competence slowly release incompatible and partially broken applications, while Apple and Google could just deploy a single solution via a system update.<p>Also, it&#x27;s much easier to make it mandatory if it&#x27;s a system app (and obviously it needs to be mandatory to be useful)."],"time":["2020-04-19 19:57:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["diebeforei485"],"id":[22921031],"kids":{},"parent":[22915620],"text":["I actually turned off auto update on my iPhone and Apple Watch.

Everything below is a very personal view with incredibly limited general applicability.)<p>It&#x27;s interesting, because the way I feel about working from home has completely changed, and I suspect will continue to change as this pandemic progresses.<p>Previously I&#x27;d work from home for a day or two tops, and didn&#x27;t really enjoy it. Didn&#x27;t like the lack of company, especially not as I live alone, and found myself becoming easily distracted if I tried to work from home for longer periods.<p>I&#x27;ve now been working from home continuously since 16th March. Whilst loneliness and difficulty of focus were problems to begin with they&#x27;ve substantially passed, and I&#x27;m finding my ability to focus has improved.<p>I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the quiet and (ironically given what I said a couple of paragraphs back) lack of distraction. I can get up and move, or do something mindless if I need some time to get away from my screen and think without running into anyone. I can also make a cup of coffee without it turning into a 10-minute project where I have to queue&#x2F;make smalltalk&#x2F;empty and refill the coffee machine, and whatever else can distract and delay.<p>In general, if I&#x27;m frustrated by a situation at work, it&#x27;s easier to get some mental and emotional distance from it, which is helpful for clarity of thought and better decision-making.<p>I&#x27;ve managed to set boundaries and regular hours for working that I rarely stray beyond, and I find myself more creative and energetic in the evenings.<p>Not everything is perfect:<p>- Lots of video calls and meetings becomes draining, and we&#x27;ve had to learn to change our ways of working somewhat to deal with this.<p>- Related: I find that preparation for meetings is even more valuable now because it helps to keep them shorter.<p>- I also prefer to have difficult conversations face to face in a way that video calls don&#x27;t really substitute for.<p>- I miss my family and friends, and am missing out on my newborn nephew&#x27;s first months as he grows and develops.

And once you generalize from miming top10 songs to miming challenges created by other people, you arrive at the heart of TikTok&#x27;s social mechanics: it&#x27;s not just creating videos or remixing songs, it&#x27;s creating culture, conforming to it, and bending it towards yourself."],"time":["2020-04-19 18:05:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["api"],"id":[22915863],"kids":{},"parent":[22905336],"text":["They&#x27;ve nailed the formula for addictive social media apps.

However, there _is_ a magic bullet of sorts out there, Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).<p>IVIG is just concentrated antibodies made from plasma of thousands of donors. Its original use case was to clear out a patients antobodies to suppress any antibody-mediated autoimmune response, but turns out IVIG can have global immunosuppressive effects through other mechanisms as well. Importantly, it&#x27;s very &quot;benign&quot; - almost no known side effects, and your general immunity is still left intact. This has led to extensive use of this drug off-label for anything dealing with excessive immune responses.<p>The more and more I think and look, the more I&#x27;m convinced IVIG might help worsening covid patients. Indeed, a case study from China suggests it can be beneficial (3 of 3 very sick patients fully recovered) but of course a proper study is needed (IVIG is quite possibly the worst drug to try and ramp up production). On the other side, a pre-covid trial of IVIG on ARDS patients (already on EMCO) showed no effect, though I personally felt the study was too broad. More studies are also needed, because I&#x27;m sure any _new_ IVIG made, since it pools thousands of patients&#x27; plasma, is bound to have anti-covid antibodies as well, and this could have some potentially dangerous effects as well (Antibody-Dependent Enhancement).
