Uber determines the price of the ride; Airbnb doesn’t set the rent. Uber sends an order to a specific driver; Airbnb merely provides a prospective guest with a list of properties. Uber, according to Thursday’s ruling, exercises “decisive influence” over the transaction. That’s not the case with Airbnb.<p>&gt; That’s quite a powerful argument. Airbnb’s hands-off role — renters deal directly with hosts throughout the process — makes it less than a real estate agent. It actually has a good reason to define itself as an information provider rather than a deal facilitator.<p>&gt; One can imagine what the Uber app would look like if the company operated like Airbnb.

As far as the stock market is concerned, no sale occurred.<p>In this case, the only way to make it work is if the credit card has a whole bunch of buyers lined up for all of the various stocks that are sold whenever the card is used; AND is willing to float about 0.753782 shares of Tesla. This way they can let you sell 0.0001 share to pay for your stick of gum without them incurring the transaction cost of a share trade.<p>The problem is that, when you invest in something, you need to actively decide when to buy, hold, and sell.

(Otherwise, you&#x27;d want to back it by a mutual or index fund, or ETF.)<p>Or, another way to do it would be to have a card for each of your investments, and you actively choose which card you use at the point of sale.<p>(IMO, it&#x27;s easier just to sell an investment when you pay your credit card bill.)"],"time":["2019-12-20 21:55:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thimkerbell"],"id":[21847024],"kids":{},"parent":[21846744],"text":["what could possibly go wrong..."],"time":["2019-12-20 21:12:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jostmey"],"id":[21846808],"kids":[21846845,21846858,21846857,21847013,21846848],"parent":[21846744],"text":["Sign me up.

They used to blast the hell out of dishes with tons of hot water sprayed at high pressure, using strong detergents. But starting in the 1990s, efficiency regulations forced dishwashers to gradually become thriftier with water and energy. Then in 2010, phosphates disappeared from detergents.2 The industry switched to enzyme-based detergents, which work by breaking down food into smaller molecules (like the enzymes in your gut), and are biodegradable and easy to remove from water. After a few rough years of adjusting to this gentler, more-efficient paradigm, dishwashers and detergents emerged better than before. “Today’s dishwashers are really cleaning better than anything out there and use less water,” Barry said. “The key is that you have to use them properly, you need to load them properly, and use the right detergent.”<p>EDIT: also from the article, don&#x27;t pre-rinse. It&#x27;s counter intuitive, but modern systems have sensors and if the water looks too clean, they can stop the cycle prematurely.

That includes the &quot;security&quot; aspect. In my experience (did it for about 3 years), most of these are the white labeled cameras. A majority from China, but Germany and the USA have put out some absolutely dogshit cameras as well. Especially when you factor in the price tag. At least with the Chinese ones, you get a discount for bottom barrel.<p>At the same time, there&#x27;s something most people don&#x27;t really understand about security cameras, longevity. These are like servers (and technically are). They&#x27;re meant to run 24&#x2F;7, without stop. Quite a few (if not all newly manufactured one at this point... I hope) can have weekly scheduled reboots, which I always recommend customers set. Most don&#x27;t and actively refuse to allow a 2 minute block of downtime at an obscure hour. Camera manufacturers know that, and have to deal with it by having a product that just runs constantly.<p>Next up comes physical protection. You start getting into the $300+ per camera, it&#x27;s supposed to survive someone hitting it with a baseball bat a few times. Then comes protection from weather and generally being able to survive 120 deg f outdoor conditions or -40 deg f conditions. Your standard camera and embedded board can&#x27;t do that.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a lot of asshole integrators that oversell to governments a lot. My career was primarily based around fixing the last integrator&#x27;s complete fuck ups. I&#x27;ve seen how government agencies can be bent over and taken for a ride in that industry. Sad part is, none of these folks were even paid off. Just flat out duped. At least the ones I dealt with, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty that took money under the table.<p>On the software side, this is tricky. Yes, the basics of LPR can be done in a few lines of code. But there&#x27;s more to law enforcement and government accountability, even private sector when developing a case to hand over to the police after an incident. The software company (video management system, VMS), has to guarantee the information has not been tampered. A chain of custody of information has to exist. Video from the VMS cannot be altered in anyway when exported or a lawyer can just wipe his ass with it and throw it out of court. Then there&#x27;s usability, cross-platform support, driver support for a plethora of devices (there are hundreds of camera manufacturers with hundreds to thousands of SKUs each of devices that one software has to manage). And that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg. I haven&#x27;t even gotten into general security so it can&#x27;t be hacked... at least easily (I think Genetec is still top dog in this, it&#x27;s been 2 years, may have changed. They use to run really good bounty programs, don&#x27;t know if they still do).<p>I think 86mil is still retarded as hell because there are plenty of off the shelf solutions that accomplish exactly what they want already, from 2+ years ago. Would only cost them a less than... maybe 8-10 mil in license fees. I don&#x27;t know how big the city is or needs spec, so it&#x27;d take me a while to properly quote... eh, I also never did an international project. I don&#x27;t know if some of the vendors I dealt with have a different pricing structure for Australia (I know some countries get charged more, for various reasons). So, there&#x27;s that too.<p>So just saying, it&#x27;s a much more complicated issue than most people imagine. The VMS companies do have a large workforce of programmers that have a job I&#x27;d never take and do need to be paid. I also over simplified quite a bit and left out other &quot;fun&quot; aspects of selling and deploying physical security... the reasons why I don&#x27;t do it anymore. Hell, I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a bitch of a problem it all was until I actually had to do it. I can&#x27;t blame people for not knowing.

The best way to make your content last for a <i>long<\/i> time is to host it on a platform that is free and very successful. For example, whatever photos I posted on Facebook 12 years ago?

Still in mint condition, with 0 maintenance required.<p>In comparison, the websites that I&#x27;ve built and hosted or deployed myself, have constantly required periodic work just to &quot;keep the lights on&quot;.

Perhaps due to new additions to the family, medical circumstances, or even prolonged unemployment. And when that happens, even the smallest amount of upkeep, whether it is financial, technical or simply logistical, becomes something they have no interest in engaging with.<p>If we really want our content to last, not just for 10 years but for a generation, our best bet is to publish it on a platform like wordpress.com. One which requires literally zero maintenance, and where all tech infrastructure is completely abstracted away from you. I know this isn&#x27;t going to be a popular idea with the HN crowd, and I do not blame anyone at all for wanting to keep control over their content.

Just like the author recommends not using non-web fonts, we honestly don&#x27;t need much markup beyond &quot;monospace&quot;, &quot;em&quot;, &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;title 1-5&quot;, and &quot;p&quot;. Everything else HTML does is a huge distraction.<p>In the past thirty years, there have only been a few actual kinds of content:<p>- Article<p>- Comment<p>- Reference manual<p>Nothing really deviates from this. If it does, then it&#x27;s probably in the &quot;application&quot; domain and deserves all that javascript stuff.<p>I imagine a new semantic web inspired content type that bakes in permanent content URLs, author signatures, and supports sharing P2P and rich archival:<p><pre><code>   &lt;article&gt;\n     &lt;id&gt;\n       (Computed immutable content hash and signature. Subsequent revisions\n        will invalidate this and require new content hashes. Links can be made\n        to the old version.)\n     &lt;&#x2F;id&gt;\n     &lt;authors&gt;\n       (metadata, homepage, public key)\n     &lt;&#x2F;authors&gt;\n     &lt;contents&gt;\n       &lt;title&gt; Semantic Web was actually brilliant &lt;&#x2F;title&gt;\n       &lt;body&gt; \n         &lt;h1&gt;The Web was Embraced, Extended, and Extinguished&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;\n       &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;\n     &lt;&#x2F;contents&gt;\n   &lt;&#x2F;article&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt can be a really simple model. No divs or presentational CSS or anything. (Well, maybe some support for LaTeX and I18N.) The client decides how it looks, which is how it always should have been.<p>If every entity in the universe has an ID, they can link to each other in a distributed fashion. It won&#x27;t matter if the original source URL goes down as long as someone somewhere has a cache.<p>It&#x27;s also probably better to binary encode these (protobuf or something). Images and media could be inlined instead of href&#x27;d.<p>Instead of building on the layer cake, we should take a moment to reflect on what we&#x27;re trying to do. We have a lot of history and bad evolution that we can garbage collect and streamline.<p>If our objective is to <i>publish and share content<\/i>, a lightweight version of the semantic web is the way to go.<p>Oh, and check out my follow-up to the author:<p><pre><code>   &lt;article&gt;\n     &lt;id&gt; (my own post&#x27;s content hash) &lt;&#x2F;id&gt;\n     &lt;parent&gt; (the author I&#x27;m responding to) &lt;&#x2F;parent&gt;\n     &lt;author&gt; me &lt;&#x2F;author&gt;\n     &lt;contents&gt;\n       Hey you!

[...]<p>&gt; So that&#x27;s really slow and I&#x27;m going to talk about that for a bit, but there&#x27;s an element of severe irony to this which is that as soon as I double click this thing within one second <i>it draws an image<\/i> and it&#x27;s a pretty high resolution interesting image. It&#x27;s just not the image that I care about.<p>&gt; So obviously it&#x27;s not hard to start a process and draw an image on the screen in much less than seven seconds. They just don&#x27;t manage that.<p>&gt; Now. I gave a speech a year ago that started this same way. That was 2016. It&#x27;s now 2017 and of course a new version of Photoshop has come out and of course what will align directly with my point in the next few slides: they&#x27;ve made it worse. And the great way in which they&#x27;ve made it worse is: say there&#x27;s some operation that you want to do maybe once in a while like create a new image... So I&#x27;m going to go to file, new ... Urghh. And that menu takes - it probably takes about a second to come up.<p>&gt; And you might think &quot;Oh, well, you know it was just all these assets were cold or something.. Maybe they come off the hard drive. It&#x27;ll be faster next time.&quot; And it&#x27;s like: &quot;Well, let&#x27;s test that out. Nope.&quot; Like every time. I&#x27;ll use the keyboard shortcuts. File. New. Nyeaarghh. [...]<p>&gt; Imagine if the people who programmed this were trying to make VR games. Everybody would be vomiting everywhere all the time.<p>&gt; Well what machine am I running this on? It&#x27;s actually a pretty fast machine, it&#x27;s a Razer Blade laptop with a pretty high-end i7 in it, and you can talk about how fast the CPU is or the GPU is and some arbitrary measurement and I&#x27;m going to discuss CPU speeds here and I want to say in advance that none of what I&#x27;m about to say is meant to be precise or precise measurements. I&#x27;m making a general point.<p>&gt; And the general point is that the CPU of this thing would have been approximately the fastest computer in the world when I was in college. Or the GPU would have been the fastest computer in the world in the year 2000 or thereabouts.<p>&gt; Now you might say &quot;That&#x27;s a really long time ago. This is ancient Stone Age.&quot; Well. Photoshop was released in 1990 before either of those dates. And Photoshop 6, which I used heavily during my earlier days in game development is from the year 2000. And this is what it looks like. This is a screenshot of Photoshop 6. It&#x27;s got all the same UI that Photoshop has today. It&#x27;s got all these same control widgets and it&#x27;s got our layers and channels and all that stuff. Today the UI is a different colour but apart from that it&#x27;s essentially the same program.<p>&gt; Now I don&#x27;t doubt that it has many more features.

The N1 instance would be $52 rather than $61, but the author hasn&#x27;t talked about why they selected the more expensive N2 instances.  Given that competitors don&#x27;t talk about the CPUs they&#x27;re using, it seems weird to select the more expensive CPUs for Google.<p>Second, Google offers dedicated hyper-threads.  The author says that cloud providers (like Google) are more expensive, but they&#x27;ve compared dedicated hyper-threads on Google with shared hyper-threads on Digital Ocean.  DO offers an 8GB 2 vCPU (2 dedicated hyper-thread) instance for $60&#x2F;mo, but the author is using the 8GB instance with shared CPU for $40&#x2F;mo.<p>So, with storage, Google costs about $52 while DO costs $60 for an equivalent instance.  Linode&#x27;s $60 8GB dedicated vCPU instance does come with 4 cores so it seems like a better value.  One can also argue that the included transfer on Digital Ocean offers $8 in value.  However, the premium for the instances alone isn&#x27;t as big for Google.  In fact, google seems cheaper.<p>Now, it&#x27;s probably a fair comparison for Amazon&#x27;s instance which only gives you CPU credits for around a third of the time.<p>Google&#x27;s automatic sustained-use discounts and dedicated hyper-threads make it really competitive with Digital Ocean (if you don&#x27;t need a lot of bandwidth) as long as you&#x27;re doing an apples-to-apples comparison.  DO&#x27;s over-sold CPU instances will be cheaper because you&#x27;re getting less.  If DO didn&#x27;t offer dedicated hyper-thread instances, maybe you could claim that they were equivalent.  But DO literally sells something more equivalent for $60 rather than $40.<p>EDIT: Also, OVH is a bad comparison.  OVH is cheap, but inconsistent in their product offerings.  The author notes that they offer hosted DB services, but that&#x27;s only in France.  Their US, Canada, Singapore, Germany, Poland, and Australia locations don&#x27;t offer that.  Their US website is missing pricing on many of the things they seem to offer.  Plus, at a certain point, when you&#x27;re trusting someone with your datastore, you want a high level of certainty.  OVH&#x27;s website doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence given how much seems like someone didn&#x27;t even check it.  It&#x27;s certainly cheap, but it seems cheap for a reason.<p>One final thought: I&#x27;m surprised the author hasn&#x27;t talked about transfer pricing.  Cloud providers usually charge a bundle while others charge a lot less.  1 cent per GB at Digital Ocean is a lot less than the 9 cents per GB at AWS.  AWS even charges 1 cent per GB for data transfer between AZs in the same region.  If you&#x27;re running a compute and Kafka cluster in 2 AZs, then writing 1GB to a quorum of 3 servers means paying 1.5 cents per GB written (assuming that half the time you&#x27;re writing to 2 servers outside your AZ and half the time you&#x27;re writing to one server outside your AZ).  Likewise, when you go to read it, if half the time you&#x27;re not reading from a local AZ, you&#x27;re paying half-a-cent per GB to read the data.  So processing 1GB costs 2 cents.  That adds up fast.  Everyone compares things like compute instances and seems to ignore data transfer costs.  Frankly, Google is competitive on storage and compute costs with places like DO.  However, if you are trying to create the next Imgur, you probably care more about transfer costs than compute or storage costs."],"time":["2019-12-19 18:02:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blantonl"],"id":[21838927],"kids":[21840430,21839082,21839177,21840625,21840314,21838977],"parent":[21835366],"text":["I often see these comparisons done to try to discredit the use of cloud computing resources, often comparing single cloud entities to bare metal one-for-one comparisons.<p>But that&#x27;s now how compute is delivered in projects any more.

I wrote many mini-non-mission-critical apps to run on AWS, but I would think twice about putting my main business app in AWS without (costly)backup.<p>I imagine that for startups it might make sense to create their initial product on AWS and when the product takes off spend some of first revenue making it cloud agnostic.<p>The benefit of AWS is that a startup can implement a proof of concept quickly without having to worry about managing their own elastic search for example, and once it proves viable effort can be added to escape vendor-lock-in."],"time":["2019-12-19 16:56:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["samx18"],"id":[21835579],"kids":{},"parent":[21835366],"text":["I don&#x27;t agree with the pricing comparison, it is factually incorrect.

They even popularized the phrase &quot;undifferentiated heavy lifting&quot;. They were able to build a metric system, in less than a year, that supported full OLAP query with practically arbitrary number of dimensions. The system ingested &gt; 20 billion data points per minute, ran on more than a thousand machines, and did not set quota to any team or service. The entire system was built and operated by merely three engineers. This was simply not possible without AWS. Similarly, Netflix&#x27;s data pipeline, Elasticsearch cluster, and Druid clusters were developed and operated by two engineers. They were oncall 24x7, yet they rarely got waken up in the middle of a night. You think this was possible if Netflix tried to build its own infrastructure?<p>The counter example is Uber. Uber was ambitious and wanted to build everything. The results? More than 200 alerts got fired within 2 hours -- the poor oncall engineer couldn&#x27;t do anything but to keep ack&#x27;ing the alerts. Wanted to use Cassandra? 10-page forms that were more tedious than applying for the Ivy schools, weeks of waits, lots of angry emails, countless meetings, and still no Cassandra instances. Wanted to add 50 machines to your ES cluster? PPTs, meetings, escalation all the way to CTO, and weeks of planning. Want to try out Apache Kudu? No way, because our container-based EC2-like system did not support persistent volume, let alone something similar to EBS or EFS. Wanted to use container for your ES cluster? Same answer. Wanted to create your bespoke cluster topology? Same answer because apparently custom network configuration was not supported. After waiting for more than three years? Same answer.

Digital Ocean, at least, is the same for those cheap instances though I&#x27;m not sure how they dole out CPU credits (I think they yolo it and you cross your fingers that you&#x27;re not sharing a physical machine with the guy doing video transcoding and CI builds).<p>Both Amazon and Digital Ocean do have dedicated CPU instance types.

If one malfunctions, workloads can be easily moved to another computer.  All the machine setup work is made machine readable by building containers and authoring Deployment objects, so there is no mental investment in a particular computer or disk image that you get from logging in, installing Debian, screwing around with files in &#x2F;etc for an hour, etc.  Basically, any sort of maintenance involved with physical computers no longer concerned me; repairing a hardware failure basically meant just repairing that hardware failure at my leisure and then moving on.<p>Combined with this was the fact that we were an ISP, so we had a datacenter, power, networking, and all that the floor below our office.  I eventually convinced myself that for a month worth of AWS fees, we could have 10x the computing resources and 10x the bandwidth for a one-time cost.  Nobody was motivated to hand over the credit card and let me build the cluster... but for me, running dedicated servers went from &quot;thing that only Google does&quot; to &quot;why isn&#x27;t everyone doing this!?&quot;  It&#x27;s just not that expensive.  And, consumer-grade hardware is really good these days.  I drooled over the fast builds we got from a c5.4xlarge AWS instance.

The obituary paralleled the family story of his life: he&#x27;d been a drifter of sorts his whole life, always looking for some way out of the life of a dirt-poor, subsistence farmer. He was the first member of the family to leave the Amish &#x2F; Mennonite colonies of the east and come west.

It described young men a lot like my great-great grandfather, with just the moment in history changed. It seems fairly straightforward that the root causes are:<p>-- Limited economic opportunities &#x2F; safety net. \n-- Lack (for whatever reason) of social ties and support. A lack of an outlet for emotional intimacy.<p>Are chemicals, including in our air, at play? Sure, possibly. But, it seems clear that in any case you hear about a suicide the story is basically the same - someone simply did not see a future for themselves. We have not come fully to grips with a post-industrial &#x2F; post-agrarian economy here in the US, leaving many <i>men<\/i> in particular without much purpose.<p>The rural &#x2F; urban divide is mentioned in this thread - living here in rural America (hi y&#x27;all!) is a microcosm of the rest of the country - we have the same problems as cities, just on a different but compressed scale.

Mental health scores were surveyed in 2010 and 2014, allowing us to link changes in mental health to the changes in environmental variables. Increases in air pollution and temperature variability are associated with higher probabilities of declined mental health. Mental health is statistically unrelated to mean temperature in this study, and the effect of greenness on mental health depends on model settings, suggesting a need for further study.

As the founder of an API company, this article has me wondering about the semantics of versioning — so I thought I’d ask the community a question. I hope the Shopify API team doesn’t mind!<p>When you all think about API versioning, what makes the most sense to you — a semver approach (major.minor.patch) a la NPM, or a date-based approach (2020-01-07) a la AWS? Or is some combination of the two desirable?<p>At Standard Library [0] we both allow people to publish APIs but also publish API proxies on behalf of partners (Stripe, Slack + others) using a semver approach. It’s not perfect but theoretically enforceable (schema parameter additions can be forced to require a minor update, schema parameter removals can be forced to require a major update). We’ve just stuck to this semver approach based on intuition and haven’t had negative feedback about it, but I do like the idea of time-based versioning.<p>Would love thoughts!

He is both the scholarly, religiously inclined brahman and the warrior ruler who excels in martial arts, athletic pursuits, and sexual exploits.

And so rather than transmitting an ancient practice, they instead promoted a new spiritual discipline, formulated when Burmese Theravada was suffering in the shadows of the British Empire.<p>&gt; A feature of the modern mindfulness movement, inherited from fairly recent Burmese innovations, is its appeal to the laity, and hence its essentially therapeutic, rather than salvific, aim. Nothing could be further removed from the Buddha’s radical ideal of sagehood. By insisting on ascetic discipline and a life of homeless wandering, Gotama presented mindfulness as a total life commitment. Practised in this way, attending to the constituents of experience can be transformative: Gotama claimed it is a way of undoing one’s mentally constructed world, along with all its unsatisfactoriness and suffering.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the author means by saying &#x27;they instead promoted a new spiritual discipline&#x27;. I grew up in Burma in a Theravada Buddhists&#x27; household. We all knew well that the asceticism is the core of Buddhist teachings. The person who rekindled the meditation practice that is now popular in the west (there are various kinds of meditation beside that method and they are practiced by different groups of people who believe in different things in Myanmar&#x2F;Burma) was Goenka [<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;S._N._Goenka\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;S._N._Goenka<\/a>]. So I&#x27;m not sure why the author is saying that &#x27;they promoted&#x27; as if Burmese people promoted this. Also, the popularity of Vipassana meditation happens actually much, much later than British rule (like in late 1960s or even later). So there is no connection with it becoming popular and the British Empire.<p>Most Buddhists in Burma (the one who are somewhat educated about Buddhist scripture) believe that they have to become monks (ascetics) to attain Nirvana, the ultimate goal of any Theravada Buddhists. There is no way they would attain Nirvana without giving up their secular lives and that is clear to everybody thanks to the scripture. So I&#x27;m not sure why this author is misinterpreting&#x2F;misrepresenting the role of Burma in this rise of meditation practice as well as the belief of Burmese people regarding Buddha&#x27;s teachings.<p>Having said all that, I became an atheist since 8th grade. The main reason being that I see Buddha&#x27;s ascetic teachings to be impractical in modern day world. The sole reason Buddha and his follower ascetics can live such peaceful lives was because there were thousands of people earning day to day living and growing food. That&#x27;s one of the fundamental problems of Buddha&#x27;s teaching. It is not practical for survival (the bodily reality aka evoluntionary reality as I&#x27;d like to put it). Another big issue I have with this seeing of everything as suffering is that if one does that, s&#x2F;he is simply messing with her&#x2F;his own mind (meaning making one&#x27;s mind suffer more than necessary just like puritanical way of seeing sex&#x2F;masturbation as sinful and shameful behavior). If we learn to see the desire and perturbations as natural (instead of sinful like how Buddhists are taught to see), ephemeral, and even sometimes enjoyable&#x2F;exciting&#x2F;stimulating, the whole life in front of us becomes much brighter. Basically, I personally believe that Buddhist&#x27;s way of seeing things is useful when we need to remind ourselves to not go over the top"],"time":["2019-12-19 18:02:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["thehoomanist"],"id":[21830657],"kids":{},"parent":[21828888],"text":["You."],"time":["2019-12-19 00:39:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["thetanil"],"id":[21832877],"kids":{},"parent":[21828888],"text":["POPUP - i guess i&#x27;ll never know"],"time":["2019-12-19 08:52:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["smadurange"],"id":[21831134],"kids":[21831328,21831204,21831208,21831896],"parent":[21828888],"text":["It&#x27;s often hilarious when I hear western analyses of Buddhism and the Buddha.

In theory, Apple has no access to this data, since they don&#x27;t know the relevant passphrase. In practice, however, passphrases are weak, even under PBKDF2. An attacker that got access to Apple&#x27;s cloud environment would simply dictionary attack the encrypted blobs, and would probably succeed a lot of the time.<p>So instead of the obvious naive design, Apple stores enough secret data in an HSM so that you can&#x27;t attempt a decryption without the involvement of the HSM. At the same time, the HSM enforces an attempt counter, preventing brute force attacks. To scale the design, Apple partitions customers into &quot;clubs&quot; of HSMs, with the attempt counter synchronized among the HSMs of the club using a distributed commit algorithm.<p>(Somewhat infamously, Ivan Krstic detailed how they protected the HSMs themselves from malicious attacks by putting their software update signing keys through a &quot;physical hash function&quot; called &quot;Vitamix blender&quot;.)<p>What Signal is doing here is essentially what Apple did, but using SGX instead of an HSM, and RAFT as the consensus algorithm to synchronize the counters. You might reasonably prefer the Apple approach to SGX, but at the same time, the data that Signal is storing is a lot less sensitive than the data Apple stores.<p>Probably the biggest end-user takeaway from this announcement is that it&#x27;s the start of a process where Signal is able to durably and securely store social graph information for its users (without revealing the social graphs directly to Signal itself, unlike virtually every other secure messaging system). Once they can do that, they&#x27;ll have ended most of their dependence on phone numbers."],"time":["2019-12-19 21:45:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jtolds"],"id":[21841969],"kids":{},"parent":[21838413],"text":["I&#x27;m very puzzled by the consensus group load balancing section.

Just give me a local export, and import, and I&#x27;ll protect my data fairly well, thank you.<p>That would solve a major usability disaster of Signal on iOS devices: that even an orderly, planned device upgrade where <i>both<\/i> devices are in your sole control – and could conceivably do a direct transfer of all sensitive data! – will still lose all your history and Signal-contacts.<p>The cloud-centric strawmen from Signal continue with this related claim:<p><i>&gt; In the example of a non-phone-number-based addressing system, cloud storage is necessary for recovering the social graph that would otherwise be lost with a device switch or app reinstall.<\/i><p>No, again, all a user needs is a local backup&#x2F;transfer method for that list of usernames&#x2F;identity-endpoints.
