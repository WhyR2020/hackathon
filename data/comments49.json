Here&#x27;s another graph: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.endcoronavirus.org&#x2F;countries\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.endcoronavirus.org&#x2F;countries<\/a><p>In particular, compare Sweden and the US with other countries (Norway, perhaps, or South Korea).<p>Given the lack of correlation between government lockdown policy and public transit ridership, there&#x27;s a couple of conclusions you could draw. One, as the author does, is that government lockdown policy doesn&#x27;t effect behavior. Another, based on the second graph, is that <i>none of the four cities the author shows<\/i> had a meaningful government-mandated lockdown - that yes, as the author says, people didn&#x27;t change behavior on their own, but that we can&#x27;t conclude that government has no leverage here because none of those cities tried very hard. (As an NYC resident I can tell you that the government is sitting quite firmly in the unfortunate valley between leaving people alone and actually having an effect: there&#x27;s a lot of people out of work and enough stories of nonsensical policing like throwing people in a crowded jail for not social distancing, but there are a lot of people, including our mayor himself, who are out and about in public that it isn&#x27;t obviously helping with R0.) Another possible one is that public transit ridership is a limited subset of behavior and changes for its own reasons (it&#x27;s hard to maintain social distance and avoid touching metallic surfaces on a subway train) that don&#x27;t necessarily track whether people are staying home or whether they&#x27;re going around by means <i>other<\/i> than public transit.<p>While I do agree with the author that the model of the government having a magic lever is simplistic, I also don&#x27;t think it follows that the government has <i>no<\/i> leverage. There are a number of policies well within the powers of government, from unemployment eligibility to literally giving out food, that I&#x27;d think have a much more effective influence on whether people stay home than whether they&#x27;re told to stay home. (I suspect the author will agree with me that it&#x27;s better to use government levers other than &quot;we&#x27;ll send armed men after you if you don&#x27;t,&quot; if you have any.) The lockdown protests from people who want to return to work (to be distinguished from the protests from people <i>who want others to return to working for them<\/i>) are from people who need to work to survive and don&#x27;t have remote work options - there are other things the government could do to meet the underlying demands besides saying, okay, you can go to work. In general, it&#x27;s not that they want to leave their house, it&#x27;s that they have to.<p>And while I do agree with the author that it&#x27;s the people and not the government who make or break the lockdown (see also Hong Kong, where the citizenry realized that their government wasn&#x27;t taking the problem seriously, for a particularly good example), I don&#x27;t really think that ends the debate at all.

It&#x27;s rather disheartening as someone who actually is interested in AGI, but I&#x27;ve been driven away from wanting to pursue the field since the current research seems lacking in ambition and substance. My previous summer internship had me reading a lot of deep learning papers on arXiv, and the vast majority of them seem to be tweaking a single parameter in a DNN, achieving a 0.3% increase in score on an arbitrary benchmark, and calling it a meaningful result. I&#x27;d personally like to see more people doing work like the kind DeepMind does that seems to actually achieve breakthroughs informed by knowledge from neuroscience, but I have a feeling we won&#x27;t see that anytime soon since DeepMind gets their pick of the best researchers in the world. I&#x27;m just an undergrad though, would love to hear the opinions of more knowledgeable people! Specifically, I&#x27;d like to hear arguments against the sentiment that &quot;Deep learning right now is pretty much alchemy&quot;.

It could be addressed exogenously by making interactions dependent on the rolling average death count of the last several days as that is probably the signal that will the cause the most widespread panic.<p>However. There is some important context here which is that:<p>-This was not even the only model used by SAGE. The LSHTM model was run alongside it and gave similar results.<p>-The &quot;no intervention&quot; case was sense checked using the basic equations of epidemiology.<p>Models that drive decisions can be criticised on technical-procedural grounds (ideally this model should use fewer globals, and use psuedorandomness better so that it gives the exact same result on every run rather than more-or-less the same result on every run) and on model concept basis (the model assumes zombies) but the most important assessment of real models is how they drive decisions.<p>In that regard the model was successful and drove the same decision as the very different LSHTM model, the models used by almost every other country, and what could be estimated using Epi 101.<p>That is the necessity of mass social distancing. Even the Swedes, incidentally, accept this. They have chosen to make everything except for the closure of the highest risk establishments voluntary. I wonder though if isn&#x27;t the case that these restrictions are in practice voluntary in many cases even in the UK. I could easily visit my family and friends - the police would never know. My employer could continue having us come into work - there is no absolute ban on office workers being required to come in, just guidance that people who can work from home should. The actual legislation can be considered not only as enforceable rules but also as high-cost signalling. There will be people who simply will not take it seriously otherwise on the grounds that &quot;if it were really that bad, they would ban it&quot;<p>So to come back to the one substantive criticism - what different advice would a model that implemented behaviour changes have led to? I don&#x27;t think it would have changed anything, if you tell policymakers: &quot;listen, we don&#x27;t necessarily need to make these things mandatory, once the coffins pile up people will stay home by themselves&quot; what do you think that is going to drive? They&#x27;re hardly likely to decide that we can leave off the restrictions. We came up to 80% or so of ICU capacity as it was. That tells me that anything that led to less or later social distancing would have put us in the position that Bergamo or Madrid were - at least localised and temporary overwhelming of hospitals.

As an effort to censor, why in the ever loving fuck nuggets would you ever actually do that?<p>I have young kids and a large family. We all curse periodically. Instead of telling the kids that these are bad words, we told them they are adult words. As in, when you are old enough you can curse all you want, but as a kid you can’t. We felt that this was a more correct way to put it, and instead of making a huge deal out of them we instead taught them what is and what isn’t appropriate. You’d think this would result in them using those potty words all the time. Nope. I mean mostly no. Currently one of them asked one of the family members to stop using the word fuck because it makes her uncomfortable. The other one and I were playing Minecraft and I tried to explain the Nether to her as hell and she was like “wait is that a word I can say?” which led to us discussing when it’s ok and not ok to use that word. My girlfriend explained what “boss bitch” means to the kids recently in terms of dog mushing.<p>Some amusing stories: my oldest when she was in daycare made a pact with her classmates to go into the bathroom and say curse words because the teachers wouldn’t hear them in there. They even had someone on lookout when they did this. Words used were “poop” and “doodoo”.<p>That same kid when she was 4-5 came up to mom and asked “I really want to say a curse word”. Mom sent her to her room to say it no more than five times and come back. She did and that was that.<p>The other kid accidentally busted out with a periodic “what is this bullshit?” when she was much younger. She does not curse currently.<p>Words are words and censoring “bad” words is silly. You can’t censor meaning. “F<i><\/i>k you” is just as powerful a statement as “fuck you”.

I&#x27;ve been trying, and failing, to explain this at work for several years now. Indeed, swimming against the cultural tide is hard.<p>React is built on two fundamental ideas that are both extremely valuable. The first and most transformative is that the web is mostly made of _components_, and specifically that organizing the markup, javascript, and CSS makes many thing easier. The second idea is that _declarative programming_ is better than imperative.<p>The thing is, HTML and CSS are already declarative. So React is not inventing this, nor bringing it to the web, but rather providing a pretty solid idea for how to make Javascript (or more generally, complex interactivity in the browser) declarative as well.<p>Thus, as MacWright argues, there is a sweet spot for React (or similar libraries) where you have highly interactive, complex UI elements on the screen.<p>But the rest of the web really, really doesn&#x27;t need it, and when you try to apply &quot;React Everywhere&quot; things get very bloated, slow, and complicated, very fast. This is _especially_ true if you didn&#x27;t start from scratch with Next.js or create-react-app, but are incrementally converting an established application. It&#x27;s just painful.<p>I think more and more people are realizing this, and the fact that Dan Abramov himself agrees is pretty indicative that the tide is going to turn. But the question is, what next?<p>One major problem that the author didn&#x27;t go into is the special pain of bundling front-ends these days. The actual work of setting up and integrating a &quot;modern&quot; javascript asset pipeline with a server side framework is not trivial, and I&#x27;ve yet to see a framework nail this. In the ones I&#x27;ve used there&#x27;s always some gotcha - if you don&#x27;t roll your own web pack (and understand what every bit of it is doing), you will eventually run into some library you want to use that just won&#x27;t play nice with the rest of your bundle, and then you have a problem. And on the JS side, even simplicity-focued tools like Parcel are SPA oriented, thus gluing them together with your server-rendered app is non-trivial.<p>I think that will remain an issue for a while. But it also means there&#x27;s an opportunity for the &quot;old school&quot; frameworks to keep working at this and, if they really nail the bundling and server-rendered &#x2F; reactive component handoff, to thrive in the next decade of web development."],"time":["2020-05-11 01:46:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["paulryanrogers"],"id":[23137109],"kids":[23137208],"parent":[23136688],"text":["Good points that seem to boil down to choose simplest tool for the job, even if it&#x27;s not trendy."],"time":["2020-05-11 00:59:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["komali2"],"id":[23137907],"kids":{},"parent":[23136688],"text":["I see this sentiment a lot, and sympathize with it because I value accessibility and access to content by people with less powerful devices and connections.<p>But full time I&#x27;m employed to build web apps that I can&#x27;t conceive of building without Vue or React or some other AJAX tool at least.

A not amazing, but workable solution is to structure the site as follows:<p>* Split your &quot;entry&quot; bundle down to nothing, so it is <i>only<\/i> the map of other things that can load and a bootstrapper that looks at the URL and loads the right one.<p>* On the server generate html files for all your main endpoints (or hot routes for dynamic paths), ideally these are Server Side Rendered, but at a minimum they <i>must<\/i> include a script tag for both the normal entry bundle and the correct primary bundle for that page (ie, you eliminate the round trip for requesting the bundle).<p>The issue of running an &quot;out of date&quot; app is a present one. I can often restructure it to gracefully cache the state and refresh at an appropriate time without the user noticing, but it is often a far cry from simplicity.<p>His attack on SSR is largely correct for the way people currently deploy it, but there is nothing stopping you doing it a lot better. It is perfectly possible to generate correct HTML that works without needing to have a hydration step - its just most people aren&#x27;t willing to, or knowledgeable enough to, do the work to make only the parts that need rehydration be hydrated (or, allow everything to be rehydrated but with no effect to the majority of the page). To be clear, you don&#x27;t need to hydrate links, buttons, or even basic forms.<p>Of course, anything that genuinely requires your app js to be around to do anything reasonable needs to be there; but if you aren&#x27;t looking for a drag&#x2F;drop stay on page interaction you can normally just add a traditional route to allow it as well (more work of course).<p>He is right about API&#x27;s. Though I&#x27;d hardly count it as a web or an SPA problem. Software is all about abstractions and how they are very leaky (likely &quot;unfixably&quot; so).<p>I was surprised about the data fetching comment. I&#x27;ve taken a look at the React docs and done some searches around the web, and he&#x27;s right. Unless you know what terms to search to get the useful patterns its just a mess of amateur&#x2F;broken Medium posts.<p>SPA&#x27;s are built on top of browsers that are trying to predict where we are going and react to where we were yesterday at the same time. I&#x27;m with the author that most things don&#x27;t need react, and that the things that do are mostly SPA&#x27;s that <i>have<\/i> to be SPA&#x27;s. I have worked with other frameworks before, but my hammer is a nodeJS &amp; React stack I&#x27;ve cobbled together; thankfully its very good at SSR generating static sites, so most people don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m using such a big hammer.<p>And we finish with a wishy washy maybe its right maybe its wrong, do we need this, maybe we do, maybe we don&#x27;t.<p>Here is something concrete.

Google and Facebook have created really high-standards for what&#x27;s considered a usable web application\n2. HTML is still a language highly optimized for creating static documents, not building the reactive applications most devs want to build<p>I think experienced developers might even deliberately ignore how much of a moat these two facts create for big companies (because it serves their interest as well).<p>Think about it: if styling&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building a web app like Google Docs was easy, do you really think Google would be able to maintain its lead in every vertical in that market for so long? Sure, maybe for some use cases it&#x27;s the best solution — but what about lawyers or doctors: they could certainly use a custom version of a real-time document-editing app.<p>But, by keeping web development hard (i.e. split into a million different technologies that have trouble connecting with each other), Google and Facebook have enough breathing room to be able to create THE real-time work platform and THE social network, without worrying too much about competition sneaking up behind them.<p>And, if some small startup does manage to get off the ground despite the incredible engineering effort required, Google can just copy or acquire them with some of the billions they&#x27;ve made from their technology moat — and voila, as an extra bonus — all the devs who work at that acquired startup are already trained in the specific framework that Google and Facebook uses (oh yeah... that&#x27;s why they open sourced it in the first place...).<p>By creating this huge moat between what&#x27;s a &quot;good enough&quot; real-time web application in the eyes of most users (who expect instant updates, smooth transitions, collaborative features, and interoperability by default) and what most developers can pull off in a few months, these big companies can ensure they stay on top and not too many competitors arise.<p>And why don&#x27;t developers fight back against this? Because this moat benefits us as well. It artificially inflates our salaries by making web development a super complex field. Not only do you have to know a lot of technologies and all of their secrets settings, you also need to know how everything fits together behind the scenes.<p>Can you imagine if web development was as simple as learning a single language? We&#x27;d all be making far less money by tomorrow.<p>All these moving pieces and arcane knowledge gives us pride in knowing something other people done, while making it extra hard to be a new developer. It also protects our employers from being disrupted every 2 weeks, giving some economic stability to the tech market at large.<p>Another benefit it provides to those already in power is an easy way to control who the next breakthrough success: if you&#x27;re running a startup that&#x27;s competing (even tangentially) with Google or Facebook or the thousands of other entrenched players, you&#x27;ll need a million dollars just to catch up to them in terms of creating a usable product. People aren&#x27;t going to be impressed with your photo sharing app if its interface isn&#x27;t as sleek as Facebook&#x27;s or Instagram&#x27;s.<p>What&#x27;s the solution to all this? The no-code movement? Perhaps low code?<p>Nah — those are patches in a sinking ship. The fundamental fact is: the web wasn&#x27;t made for building dynamic web applications (and web components aren&#x27;t actually simplifying the process).<p>Think about this: your browser doesn&#x27;t even know what a &quot;user&quot; is or how to connect to a database or what a SPA is. And how long have we been building these things over and over again? It&#x27;s absurd there aren&#x27;t standard APIs for all of it...<p>But that would destroy the moat.<p>I think the true solution is a next gen version of HTML that abstracts away and standardizes everything difficult about building a web app.<p>Devs need to be able to focus on just building awesome products that serve a need — not configuring Webpack and getting a 5 year degree in CSS before even getting started.<p>It&#x27;s too bad Google owns the most popular web browser (that could actually make a difference in this fight) and Facebook has convinced every developer I know that they&#x27;ve solved web development. It&#x27;ll be their self-created competitive advantage until all developers simultaneously go crazy from having to re-implement the same damn architecture again for the thousandth time."],"time":["2020-05-11 07:19:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["danschumann"],"id":[23140126],"kids":{},"parent":[23136688],"text":["Better bundle splitting would solve most of his gripes, no?"],"time":["2020-05-11 10:51:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["giantrobot"],"id":[23138360],"kids":[23140561,23139985],"parent":[23136688],"text":["I think deep down people writing SPAs really just Flash apps or Applets would come back. They want to ignore everything about the web except the ability to deliver content over a network. I&#x27;d go so far as to say they hate the web as a concept.<p>Most problems stem from that disdain for the web. Many of those problems are then exacerbated by &quot;opinionated&quot; frameworks being en vogue. None of them are helped by the shit platform that is JavaScript.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the justification for SPAs front end JavaScript frameworks being a desire to separate data and presentation. A back end API serves data that&#x27;s displayed by the app. We had that fifteen years ago with XSL!<p>There were these things called &quot;browsers&quot; and they could parse and display HTML and even XML. They supported stylesheets that could arbitrarily style those documents for display. They could even decide to use different styling depending on the display device! If they sound amazing they were.<p>I mentioned XML parsing. An XML document could be used to represent all kinds of arbitrary data. While a browser might consume XML, a native application or service could also consume it. But arbitrary XML in a browser wasn&#x27;t super useful since a browser didn&#x27;t have rules to display every different XML document that could be made.<p>The people that developed XML also came up with a way to transform data in XML to different formats. Browsers, being able to handle XML already, added support for this transforming. An XML document could include a link to this stylesheet and the browser could transform it into something (XHTML) that it did have rules for displaying, including CSS to further style elements and JavaScript to make everything terrible.<p>A native app or service consuming an XML doc could and often would ignore the stylesheet so to them it was just data. Even JavaScript asynchronously loading XML data would ignore stylesheets. Usually it was only browsers that cared about linked stylesheets.<p>But this let a single API serve browsers and native apps and even JavaScript. Presentation and data were separate concerns. Browsers would also cache all the display resources for a document so when a new document was viewed all of those resources would be cached locally.<p>But then for whatever dumb set of reasons web developers ignored these &quot;browsers&quot; and and their cool abilities. They insisted on ingesting XML to their JavaScript and then manipulating the DOM of an HTML page causing hundreds or thousands of repaints. Then they knew better still and replaced XML with JSON. By making the data serialization format require JavaScript they could obviate the browser even more. Now browsers are relegated JavaScript runtimes and even web servers are just load balancing proxies for JavaScript runtimes running on servers."],"time":["2020-05-11 04:34:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["itsthecourier"],"id":[23138470],"kids":{},"parent":[23136688],"text":["I&#x27;m an old dog, almost 20 years programming now. 30 years old.

The stock price might remain tied to the performance of the company in broad strokes, but without regular dividends, sales, or buybacks to tie the stock back to the company, there&#x27;s nothing to keep it from becoming disproportionate with regards to the company&#x27;s value.[1]<p>Second, when companies <i>do<\/i> pay dividends or buy back stock, it&#x27;s sometimes done by borrowing money. This actually drives down the value of the company (since now the company has to pay interest on those loans) but drives up the value of the stock--the value of the company and the value of the stock are going in opposite directions.<p>Third, with the wealth disparity in the US, even if 90% of people pull out of the stock market, it&#x27;s quite possible for the stock market to go up, because the other 10% own &gt;80% of the stock market. 90% of Americans can divest completely from the stock market, and it could at most lower the stock market by 20%.<p>This is why stock market metrics are not metrics I care about when determining how the economy is doing.<p>[1] EDIT: What I mean by &quot;broad strokes&quot; and &quot;disproportionate&quot; here is: Events occur which change the value of the company and the value of the stock, and at least the direction of these price with regards to these events is likely to align. In broad strokes, because people believe the value of the stock is tied to the value of the company, if a &quot;good&quot; event happens, the stock price goes up, and if a &quot;bad&quot; event happens, the stock price goes down. But it&#x27;s pure speculation <i>how<\/i> good or <i>how<\/i> bad these events are. If big bad events are downplayed so they only are represented as slight drops in stock price, and small good events are marketed well so they are overrepresented as big upticks in stock price, then over time this can result in a stock price that goes up, when the value of the company is actually going down.<p>It&#x27;s actually even more complicated than that."],"time":["2020-05-10 21:08:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aazaa"],"id":[23135467],"kids":[23135836,23138384,23139344,23138382],"parent":[23133086],"text":["&gt; Measures by the Fed and U.S. government have underpinned the recent rally across markets.

In that case, borne out of anger and frustration from how slow Android was at some things, I complained to one of the engineers I had brought onboard about how a 1970s computer was vastly more responsive and performant (to the user&#x27;s perspective) than these modern (in ~2016) Android devices. We ended up building a prototype of a vertical scrolling ListView, implemented entirely in C, implementing all the &quot;normal&quot; functionality required to allow Android to use it.<p>I believe my initial frustration was borne from performance tracing of an app we were developing, and finding the amount of time spent in nested constructors and other kinds of inherited object-oriented bloat was actually impacting on the user perceived performance (users said it was slow to scroll). My hypothesis was that if the functionality itself was implemented in C, properly and efficiently, with none of these extra layers of abstraction, it would be faster. That was definitely validated. I don&#x27;t recall the figures now, but you could scroll a list with no perceptible latency as fast as you liked, with no stutter. The performance traces were nice and normal. It was smooth and fast.<p>Mobile apps were something I got far away from for a while, but every time I return, I&#x27;m disappointed to see an ecosystem of re-inventing the same (boilerplate) wheel, and running the same code. For the number of layers of abstraction I saw the OS burning cycles on, it is absurd to me why the &quot;end-developer&quot; is left to do so much boilerplate coding!

I noticed this especially when experimenting with EKS: There&#x27;s eksctl, which integrates with CloudFormation (generates some stacks) but is utterly useless for integration because you can&#x27;t import outputs or exports, so you have to hardcode all your SG IDs, VPC IDs, Subnet IDs if you want to integrate with existing infrastructure (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;weaveworks&#x2F;eksctl&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1141\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;weaveworks&#x2F;eksctl&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1141<\/a>).

I have yet to try Pulumi, and I don&#x27;t see any reason why I should to be honest. However, CloudFormation is required for automated build and deployment of Lambda functions--both Serverless Framework and AWS SAM use CloudFormation. I&#x27;ve also used CloudFormation StackSets to build out infrastructure for multi-account governance. In normal use though, Terraform is typically more usable, though both solutions can get pretty hairy.<p>By &quot;Kinesis&quot; the author seems to be referring to Kinesis Streams. In fairness I haven&#x27;t built anything where Kinesis Streams would be a better use case than SNS&#x2F;SQS, but that&#x27;s just as much a statement about the projects I have happened to work on than it is about Kinesis Streams. I have used Kinesis Firehose, which provides a very scalable mechanism for, &quot;multiple clients are intermittently spitting out a massive volume of data points, all of which need to be faithfully logged into S3 somewhere&quot;.<p>And finally, we come to Lambda. Lambda is a good fit for use cases where either you need to run some code on an intermittent basis or when you want to prototype faster and don&#x27;t want to mess around with provisioning and deploying to servers. Lambda is a great place for little pieces of glue code that get triggered on a x-minute cron or based on a CloudWatch event or from SNS or SQS. It&#x27;s good for serving an HTTP API that gets less than one request per second. These use cases are extremely common and I&#x27;ve encountered them a lot more than the author seems to, though again maybe that&#x27;s just me.

Of course there is the fear that it will <i>never<\/i> be relevant.  However, if you accept the thesis that the good idea is not valuable in itself, then you realise that it is not really valuable to pivot without a really good reason.  A good idea that is never relevant is just as worthless as a bad idea that is never relevant.

Removing the nubmer of choices likely will not remove the apprehension you have towards them.  There are two resolutions to this problem:<p>1) Perseverance<p>2) Medication<p>My recommendation is to seek out a mental health professional to provide you a medical solution, which is a treatment regiment and not necessarily pills.  I would consider a pharmaceutical answer only as a last resort and if the condition is severe, as determined by your mental health professional.<p>That being said perseverance, resiliency, is perhaps the best treatment path if you free to make major life changes and your anxiety is not a crippling mental health disorder.  I have encountered many people who have had, in my opinion, a rather boring and easy life thrust into a world of making decisions they are not prepared for. The resulting scenario is a variety of relatively minor mental health ailments, which is a coping disorder more than anything else.<p>This has been studied to death in the military, largely as a result of the military&#x27;s higher than civilian average suicide rate.  The primary reason suicides are higher in the military, and in law enforcement, is that there are default behaviors limit and deter suicidal ideation, such as fear of death.  Many military members and law enforcement learn to overcome that fear and so are less restricted from suicide as a matter of behavior alone.  Once those factors are taken off the table and suicides are examined purely from the statistical data correlation the largest demographic is young white males from suburban middle-class families.  The demographic with the lowest suicide rate are black females from lower-income households of any age.  The data suggests the primary differential factor is proximity and frequency of hardships prior to entering the military, as in learned coping mechanisms.<p>Coping mechanisms are skills that can still be learned as adults, but only if you are willing to accept that there is a current problem state and that some change is required.  This is why there are stories of people going on extreme out of routine adventures, which result in something they might describe as a religious experience.<p>In my own experience, having done this a few times, I find that I have exchanged one set of anxieties for others I didn&#x27;t realize were ever present.  I am embarking on my 5th military deployment and my 8 or 9th multi-month family separation due to military.  My marriage and bold with my kids are strong and being away is no longer a point of anxiety.  We have simply figured out how to make it work well for us.  I used to be anxious about learning professional skills and getting a better corporate job, but after having gone through that a few times and playing the corporate game I am confident in my capabilities don&#x27;t really care to play this game.  Now, I am anxious to be work as a corporate developer from the boredom, limited responsibilities, low stress, long periods of downtime, and so forth.  I see the things my coworkers stress over and I remember being stressed about those things many years ago and the familiar uncertainty of work, but its just not a big deal.

In a situation with no paid sick leave or less than 2 weeks of paid sick leave, the options are mostly reduced to 2:  First, return to work, get sick, then get fired for absence while off sick.  Or, second, remain home and get fired for absence while remaining healthy.  I suppose there is the third options, the danger-face economic kamikaze model that most Americans will likely be expected to endure - go to work, hope you don&#x27;t get sick, get sick anyway, get fired for absence.

It’s admittedly not very ergonomic, though.  Also, Bolt runs on the JVM and thus has a garbage collector.  This pattern is more powerful in a garbage-collected environment, because merely reading a pointer is enough to guarantee it won’t be collected.  Suppose you (1) read a mutable field of type string, (2) call some other code that might write a different string to that field, then (3) access the string you originally read.  With garbage collection, this is safe; without it, your string might have been freed by the time you access it.  You can also make this safe with reference counting – most interpreted languages do this, Swift does it with class fields, and there are libraries to do it in Rust – but fiddling with reference counts every time you access an object is fairly slow.<p>&gt; Concurrently mutate disjoint parts of object<p>Out of the box, Rust lets you take mutable references to disjoint parts of an object and send them to different places, including different threads.  Bolt also apparently lets you pass these around as linear capabilities; translated to Rust terms, it’s like if you could take a Box&lt;(Foo, Bar)&gt; and split it into a Box&lt;Foo&gt; and Box&lt;Bar&gt;.  Rust doesn’t support this out of the box, but you can get something equivalent with the owning_ref crate (again, a bit less ergonomic, but still safe).<p>&gt; Concurrently mutate object, locking overlapping state<p>You can easily do this in Rust with Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;.   Bolt apparently inserts mutexes automagically where needed, but other than that I don’t see any ergonomic difference.  Most Rust programmers would probably not appreciate mutexes being inserted automatically; locking is expensive and creates the possibility of deadlocks, so for both a performance and correctness standpoint you want to understand where mutexes are being used."],"time":["2020-05-10 06:25:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TheAsprngHacker"],"id":[23133765],"kids":{},"parent":[23122973],"text":["Discussion on r&#x2F;ProgrammingLanguages: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ProgrammingLanguages&#x2F;comments&#x2F;gg0cmd&#x2F;bolt_a_new_language_with_datarace_freedom&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ProgrammingLanguages&#x2F;comments&#x2F;gg0cm...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-10 18:18:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hpcjoe"],"id":[23133464],"kids":[23137347,23133531,23137123,23134254,23134471,23135113,23136053,23136154,23134341],"parent":[23131526],"text":["As a (non-practicing) physicist, I&#x27;ve always disliked the penchant of some in the HEP community to say what this article says.
