Perhaps I am an exception, but so far the majority of programmers I&#x27;ve worked with were very conscious of their software&#x27;s performance and worked hard on making it as fast as they could.<p>The problem is that when your software is built on top of a framework and&#x2F;or uses X different web APIs etc then you often run into issues where a part of the system that you don&#x27;t have control over causes performance issues and you don&#x27;t have the expertise&#x2F;time to profile it in order to fix it. So I think what&#x27;s causing problems is that software has become a lot more about putting together frameworks, libraries and reusable components and when faced with such a complex system a programmer will often give up and say &quot;there! it&#x27;s as fast as I can make it without rewriting everything from scratch&quot;.<p>Therefore, the issue seems to be that programmers are building on top of other systems that they don&#x27;t know enough about to use efficiently.

The build scripts are supposed to remove the unused ones, but even with maximum trimming enabled it can only remove somewhere around 10%.  There are hardcoded inclusion rules for some of the AppCompat java code, that no one&#x27;s found a way to override, which in turn reference the images - so they get kept a well, even if your app never uses them.<p>As for differing APIs, notifications have changed massively over the years.  The interface is so different you do actually need the AppCompat subset for notifications to target different Android versions (and that can be used separately from the rest of AppCompat), but there also have been a huge number of new features added to notifications - such as delay settings, shortcuts, icons, even full-on fancy designs, that didn&#x27;t exist early on.<p>I&#x27;m calling this only half an answer because there&#x27;s no apparent reason for some of the notification API changes, and the build scripts&#x2F;AppCompat can certainly be significantly improved to remove more cruft.  I have a sneaking suspicion that it&#x27;s not done because this is low-hanging fruit for handing over signing keys to Google for their &quot;optimized&quot; builds..."],"time":["2020-01-02 14:39:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ChrisMarshallNY"],"id":[21932069],"kids":[21932231],"parent":[21929709],"text":["Lots of moving parts.<p>I am a dependency skeptic.

I do remember that<p>i = ++j+++++k++<p>is legal; I don&#x27;t want any such code in my\nstartup; also my old tests showed that two\ncompilers gave different results.<p>I find Visual Basic to have a less\n&quot;idiosyncratic syntax&quot; and a more\n<i>traditional<\/i> syntax closer to the original\nBasic and then Fortran, Algol, PL&#x2F;I,\nPascal, etc.  So, my 100,000 lines of\ntyping are in the .NET version of Visual\nBasic (VB).<p>For my Web site, part of the code is for a\n<i>server<\/i> process for some of the <i>applied\nmath<\/i> computing.  The file of the VB\nsource code is 478,396 bytes long (the\nsource code is awash in comments), and the\nEXE version is 94,720 bytes long.  As far\nas I can tell, the code loads and runs\n<i>right away<\/i>.  Looks nicely small and fast\nand not bloated or slow to me.<p>(2) A bloated IDE (integrated development\nenvironment).<p>I have no problems at all with IDEs.  The\nreason is simple:  I don&#x27;t use one.<p>Instead of an IDE, I typed all my code,\nall 100,000 lines, into my favorite text\neditor, KEdit.  It has a macro language,\nKEXX, a version of REXX, and in that\nlanguage I&#x27;ve typed about 200 little\nmacros.  Some of those macros let KEdit be\nplenty good enough for typing in software.<p>E.g., I have about 4000 Web pages of .NET\ndocumentation from Microsoft&#x27;s MSDN site.\nMany of the comments in my VB source code\nrefer to some one of those pages by having\nthe tree name on my computer of the HTML\nfile; then a simple command displays the\nWeb page.  When reading code and checking\nthe relevant documentation, that little\ntool works fine.<p>After all, VB source code and HTML code\nare just simple text; so are my Web site\nlog files, the KEXX code, Rexx language\nscripting code, all the documentation I\nwrite either in the code or in external\nfiles (just simple text or TeX language\ninput), etc.  So, a good general purpose\ntext editor can do well.  And, &quot;Look, Ma:\nI get to use the same spell checker for\nall such text!&quot;  The spell checker?\nASPELL with the TeX distribution I use.\nIt&#x27;s terrific, really <i>smart<\/i>, blindingly\nfast, runs in just a console window.<p>For KEdit, it seems to load and run right\naway.  I just looked and saw that what\nappears to be the main EXE file\nKEDITW32.exe is<p>1,074,456<p>bytes long -- not so bloated.<p>(3) Windows 10 Home Edition Reliability.<p>For a move, I got an HP laptop; it came\nwith Windows 10 Home Edition.  I leave it\nrunning 24 x 7. It hasn&#x27;t quit in months.\nIt appears that now the Microsoft updates\nget applied without stopping the programs\nI usually have running, e.g., KEdit, the\nvideo player VLC, Firefox, etc.<p>Using carefully selected options for\nROBOCOPY, I do full and incremental\nbackups of <i>my<\/i> files.  I keep the\nROBOCOPY log output; that output shows the\ndata rate of the backup, and I have not\nseen that to grow slower over time.  The\n<i>disk<\/i> in that laptop is rotating, and\nI&#x27;ve never done a de-fragmentation.  So, I\ncan&#x27;t complain about performance growing\nslower from bloat, disk fragmentation, etc.<p>(4) Windows 7 64 bit Professional Server.<p>For a first Web server, I plugged together\na mid-tower case with an AMD FX-8350\nprocessor, 64 bit addressing, 8 cores, 4.0\nGHz standard clock speed and installed\nfrom a legal CD and authentication code\nWindows 7 64 bit Professional SP1.  As I\nleft that pair running 24 x 7,\noccasionally it would stop with a memory\nerror of some kind.  I installed an\nupdate and never again saw any\nreliability problem in months of 24 x 7\noperation.<p>Since then I looked into Windows 7 64 bit\nupdates and concluded that (i) there was a\nbig <i>roll-up<\/i> of about 2016 or some such;\n(ii) since then there have been updates\nand fixes monthly and cumulative since the\nbig roll-up, and (iii) the updates for\nWindows 7 64 bits and Windows Server 2008\nare the same.<p>I can believe that Windows Server 2008\nlong ran and still runs some of the most\nimportant computing in the world.  So if\nmy Windows 7 64 bit Professional has the\nsame updates as Windows Server 2008, maybe\nfor use as a server my Windows 7\ninstallation will be about the most\nreliable major operating system in\ncomputing so far.  Fine with me.<p>So, I am not screaming bloody murder about\noperating system or software reliability.<p>(5) Smart Phone Bloat and Reliability.<p>I have no problems with smartphones if\nonly because I have no smartphone and\ndon&#x27;t want one:  When smartphones first\ncame out, I saw the display as way too\nsmall and the keyboard as just absurd.\nHeck, in my desktop computing I have a\nquite good keyboard but would like a\nbetter one and, of course, would like a\nlarger screen -- no way do I want to\nretreat to an absurd keyboard and a tiny\nscreen.<p>Next I guessed that there would be\nproblems in security, bloat, reliability,\nsystem management, documentation, and\ncost.  Maybe history has confirmed some of\nthese guesses!<p>For a recent move, I got a $15 cell phone\nand did use it a few times.  Then I junked\nit.<p>My phone is just what I want -- a land\nline touch tone desk set with a phone\nmessage function from my provider.  Works\nfine.  So, I have a phone with lower cost\nand no problems with keyboard, screen,\nsecurity, bloat, or documentation.  Ah,\nold Bell Tel built some solid hardware!<p>(6) Web Site Speed, Reliability, and\nBloat.<p>My Web site apparently has few or no\nproblems with speed, ....<p>Why?  The site is simple, just some very\nstandard HTML code sent from now old and\napparently rock solid ASP.NET.<p>Fast?  The largest Web page sends for just\n400,000 bits.<p>The HTML used is so old that it should\nlook fine on any device anywhere in the\nworld with a Web browser up to date as of,\nsay, 10 years ago.<p>The key to all of this?  The KISS\nPrinciple.<p>YMMV!"],"time":["2020-01-02 03:22:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimhefferon"],"id":[21931262],"kids":[21931401],"parent":[21929709],"text":["&gt; Modern text editors have higher latency than 42-year-old Emacs.<p>Hmmm.

And the obligatory question, what is your take on the article&#x2F;why post?<p>I piled standout quotes below.<p>I think a big takeaway from the intersection of Bret Victor, Alan Kay, Jim Hollan and the ink&amp;switch folks and your work is that the right dynamic interface can be the &quot;place we live in&quot; on the computer.<p>Victor shows a history of interactive direct manipulation interfaces, live environments where explorations of models or the creation of art go hand in hand with everything else related to that task: data input, explicit (programmatic) requirements and the visual output.<p>Hollan and ink&amp;switch show the environment (ZUIs, canvas) can contain everything for doing work, the code alongside any manipulation of the viewport that can be conceived.

It seems clear that &quot;using the computer&quot; needs to return to &quot;programming the computer&quot; and that to achieve that we need to fundamentally change &quot;programming the computer&quot; to be a more communicative activity, to foster a better relationship between the computer and the user.<p>Where is this work being done now? VPRI shut down 2 years ago, Dynamicland seems to be on hiatus? I am inspired most these days by indie developers who write their own tools and build wild looking knowledge engines or what they sometimes call &quot;trackers.&quot;[1] And of course the histories and papers put forward by the above and their predecessors. And I play with my own, building an environment where I can write, draw, code, execute and interact with it all. I see no existing product which approaches what I want.<p>&gt; Everyone is busy building stuff for right now, today, rarely for tomorrow.<p>&gt; Even when efficient solutions have been known for ages, we still struggle with the same problems: package management, build systems, compilers, language design, IDEs.<p>&gt; You need to occasionally throw stuff away and replace it with better stuff.<p>&gt; Business won’t care Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide.<p>&gt; There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow, bloated, unreliable products.<p>&gt; The only thing required is not building on top of a huge pile of crap that modern toolchain is.<p>&gt; I want something to believe in, a worthy end goal, a future better than what we have today, and I want a community of engineers who share that vision.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webring.xxiivv.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webring.xxiivv.com<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 21:36:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["syntheticnature"],"id":[21931621],"kids":[21931854],"parent":[21929709],"text":["Some valid and useful points wrapped up in a pile of failure to do even trivial research (e.g. Google Play Services isn&#x27;t what the author thinks, the iOS &#x27;nothing changed&#x27; hand-wave) and the sensibility of someone walking around an art show saying &quot;I could do that, better.&quot; The author could bear introduction to Chesteron&#x27;s Fence, if nothing else, and a review of their apparent GitHub profile points to, perhaps, needing some time spent in the land of embedded systems to understand why a phone doesn&#x27;t just boot in 1s."],"time":["2020-01-02 00:39:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bronlund"],"id":[21930353],"kids":{},"parent":[21929709],"text":["I&#x27;ve seen several similar posts like this, but this is the best one yet.

The code is readable, the architecture is quite intuitive, and with the exception of a few engine components, you don&#x27;t run into much in the way of incomprehensible spaghetti code.<p>Adding features is more or less trivial, as has been merging upstream modules from more modern branches into the project.<p>I see a bright future for the engine, especially after the 3.1 update, and I anticipate that it&#x27;ll start seeing significant commercial adoption in the second half of this decade (it needs a few more years of refinement and PR).<p>The release of the Vulkan renderer will be a massive boost to public interest, and developers will increasingly consider it for their next projects.<p>That said, I do have a few concerns about its development. I&#x27;ll preface these critiques with the fact that I&#x27;m working from 3.1 stable, and have only merged from 3.2 as needed.<p>There&#x27;s a wide-spread conception among the Godot community that Godot&#x27;s performance (especially in 3D) is abysmal. This has been blamed on a number of factors, such as the memory model (largely heap-based), and the rendering engine (it uses quite a bit more cpu time than it needs to).<p>It is exactly the second-issue that has lead many community members to see the Vulkan renderer as Godot&#x27;s salvation. I can&#x27;t speak to that, but as is, many of the criticisms Godot faces are legitimate.<p>But among the projects I&#x27;ve seen where performance has been an issue, it&#x27;s largely been the product of a developer&#x27;s failure to understand how the engine is processing their content, and by extension their failure to architect their game around that.<p>This is an issue many inexperienced developers run into on just about any engine. Godot also lacks editor tooling that would allow anyone but a programmer to easily mitigate these issues in a scene, even if they knew where the performance issues were. This, compounded with the fact that Godot has largely focused on accessibility first and foremost has resulted in a lot of inexperienced community members without much understanding of the engine&#x27;s internals to discourage people from even trying to adopt the engine for 3D projects until 4.0.<p>I hope that 4.0&#x27;s release will be enough to minimize what I believe to be largely a PR issue, but I also fear that the inevitable bugginess that comes along with an entirely new rendering architecture may just exacerbate them, or that it will simply fail to live up to the expectations of many people who expect a more modern renderer to somehow fix their poorly considered code.<p>I&#x27;m concerned that this will slow the engine&#x27;s development with respect to its tooling, as there are few people really testing the bounds of it&#x27;s capabilities and workflows."],"time":["2020-01-01 21:42:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["inDigiNeous"],"id":[21932611],"kids":{},"parent":[21928831],"text":["Anyone have some good example project online, that utilizes more C++ scripting or custom Godot modules even ?<p>This was the only thing I could not easily find when trying to peruse the projects utilizing Godot online."],"time":["2020-01-02 03:55:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["spapas82"],"id":[21931965],"kids":[21935130,21931999],"parent":[21928831],"text":["Any recommended learning resources for Godot?"],"time":["2020-01-02 01:43:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fizixer"],"id":[21929869],"kids":[21929931],"parent":[21928831],"text":["Isn&#x27;t Unreal Engine an alternative in 3D space?"],"time":["2020-01-01 20:13:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sahiphopza"],"id":[21930044],"kids":{},"parent":[21928831],"text":["get mp3 here too <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sahiphopza.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;download-mp3&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sahiphopza.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;download-mp3&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 20:42:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sahiphopza"],"id":[21930037],"kids":{},"parent":[21928831],"text":["Visit &lt;a href=&quot;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sahiphopza.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sahiphopza&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sahiphopza.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sahiphopza&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;<\/a> for mp3 songs"],"time":["2020-01-01 20:41:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[21929224],"kids":[21929293,21931513],"parent":[21928734],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200101163454&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-will-happen-in-the-2020s&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200101163454&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avc.com&#x2F;2...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 18:42:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["opportune"],"id":[21930478],"kids":[21930693,21931486,21930857,21932032,21938398,21933869,21932280,21931277,21992064,21934917,21933562,21930892],"parent":[21928734],"text":["I don’t really buy into 4-6.<p>I don’t see any benefit for a country to turn its currency into a crypto asset.

But its government will survive.<p>4. Crypto currency will be no more relevant in 2029 than 2019. The dollar will continue to dominate beyond 2030, until at last in the 2030s the Euro is backed by a significant military force.<p>5. No decentralised internet will gain popularity.<p>6. Plant based diets will see a meteoric rise in the west, but will still be a minority by 2030.<p>7. Biggest story of space will be the failure of NASA to make much progress in landing humans on Mars. SpaceX will make the most progress along those lines, with a test landing of an unmanned craft, but safety concerns over manned flight will hold SpaceX back in serving NASA.<p>8. A surprising backlash against social media will see the end of Facebook (but Whatsapp will survive well, with Instagram in a long decline). Twitter will pivot successfully almost beyond recognition.<p>9. Baby boomers will no longer dominate the electorate, and a shift to the political left will take place across America and Europe. The UK will see the most left wing government since Atlee’s. The climate crisis will help make big government palatable again.<p>10. Progress on cancer will be piecemeal and slow.

Post Brexit UK will suffer a economic stagnation similar to Japan’s post banking crisis. Scotland will vote to remain in the UK, but Ireland will be reunified. A great number of people will leave the UK to work in the USA.<p>17. Putin will die, and Russia will enter a period of crisis and civil disorder.<p>18. After Trump’s second term ends in economic disaster, popularism in the US will slowly retreat.

While I do think climate change is something we need to mitigate now, political realities are very clear on this one -- people don&#x27;t want to spend much money on mitigation. Furthermore, the dire consequences are still quite far away, doubtful 2020s are the years this will turn around.<p>2. I think for now automation will do what industrialization did before -- increase productivity which will lead to increase in consumption. I think it is only when we start approaching AGI when human labor will start becoming superfluous. Again, I don&#x27;t think UBI is in the cards for mass adoption in the US or other major countries in the 20s (although I see it as inevitable on a longer time scale).<p>3. China IS a global super power, whether it will fully displace the US is again doubtful, they have the capacity to do it in the next 20-50 years, but probably not in the next 10. There is a lot of inertia against them basically everywhere (europe, east asia, india, etc).<p>4. There is literally no reason this would happen. Even private attempts on decentralized currencies (bitcoin&#x2F;etc) did not produce assets that are used as money for regular transactions (not black market, not aimed at speculation). For countries it is even less attractive to start a crypto since if you have a stable fiat then why wouldn&#x27;t you just... have the stable fiat? Countries LIKE having control over their currency.<p>5. Internet relies on hardware&#x2F;infra that is currently privately owned by what are essentially local monopolies&#x2F;duopolies. Unless laws that force infra sharing get passed (which in the US I just don&#x27;t see happening), decentralized internet will absolutely not happen. Again, the 20s are now and we have no real movement in this direction.<p>6. Most people prefer meat. Currently population growth is such that meat production can easily keep up with demand. I agree that meat production is worse for the world (due to being resource inefficient) and I agree that it is more ethical to eat artificial meat due to decrease in suffering, but let&#x27;s be real, most people will just eat the meat that is cheap and easily available. There is zero chance major countries manage to pass bills that would make meat expensive.<p>7. This one I almost agree with, I just don&#x27;t think that there will be &quot;a wave of hype&quot; since without better propulsion&#x2F;space elevators capital costs are obviously high and don&#x27;t scale well (space isn&#x27;t software).<p>8. I agree that governments will ratchet up surveillance, but I don&#x27;t think consumers will be willing to put much money into privacy. I bet most people don&#x27;t care (enough to spend money) about privacy, and the fraction who are OK with surveillance will only increase.<p>9. I mean, given that most baby boomers will be retired by 2030 I agree that they will play increasingly diminished role in the society, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because age&#x2F;experience will not longer matter.<p>10.

We will see nuclear power\nmake a resurgence around the world,\nparticularly smaller reactors that are\neasier to build and safer to operate.  We\nwill see installed solar power worldwide\ngo from ~650GW currently to over 20,000GW\nby the end of this decade.  All of these\nthings and many more will cause the\ncapital markets to focus on and fund the\nclimate issue to the detriment of many\nother sectors.&quot;<p>there is an accurate one word summary --\nnonsense.  With two or more words, even\nworse than nonsense.<p>It&#x27;s time to drive a stake through the\nheart of this climate change alarmism.  We\ncan do a good job just in this little\npost.<p>In simple terms, there is no serious\nevidence that CO2 from human activities at\nanything like probable concentrations will\nhave any significant effect on the\ntemperature or climate of the earth.<p>Yes, CO2 is a <i>greenhouse gas<\/i>, but it is\na long logical path from there to any\nclaims of a significant effect.<p>We need just two steps:<p>(1) History.<p>There is NOTHING in the climate history\nfrom the present back to about 1 million\nyears ago that supports the idea that\nanything like realistic concentrations of\nCO2 from human activities will have any\nsignificant effect on temperatures.<p>(i) For the ice core records going back ~1\nmillion years, yes, both temperatures and\nCO2 concentrations went both up and down.\nBUT, if we just look carefully at the big\ngraph in Al Gore&#x27;s movie, with high irony,\nthat graph totally destroys his claims\nfrom that graph:  He misread the graph.\nThe main point is that there is an 800\nyear delay; CO2 concentrations changed 800\nyears AFTER the temperature changes, from\nwhatever cause.<p>Specifically:  (a) When temperatures\nstarted increasing, from whatever cause,\nCO2 concentrations were LOW, not high.\n(b) About 800 years later CO2\nconcentrations were HIGH, from increased\nbiological activity from the higher\ntemperatures.  (c) When temperatures\nstarted to fall, from whatever cause, CO2\nconcentrations were still HIGH, not low.\n(d) The high CO2 concentrations did not\nkeep the temperatures from falling.  (e)\nOnce the temperatures fell, about 800\nyears later so did CO2 concentrations.\nNet, CO2 did not cause the higher\ntemperatures or keep the higher\ntemperatures from falling.<p>(ii) In the last 2000 years we had the\nMedieval Warm Period and the Little Ice\nAge, and there is no suggestion that CO2\nconcentration changes caused either.<p>(iii) Starting in the 1940s and through\nabout 1970, we actually had some\nsignificant cooling, but in those years\nCO2 from human activities -- WWII, pulling\nof the Great Depression, and the economic\nboom after WWII -- increased.  So, we got\nCOOLING, not warming, with the additional\nCO2 from human activities.<p>Net, there is NO data from the historical\nrecord that supports the claim that higher\nCO2 will cause higher temperatures.<p>(2) Yes, CO2 is a &lt;i&gt;greenhouse&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; gas.\nThe absorption spectrum is at<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webbook.nist.gov&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=0&amp;Type=IR&amp;Large=on\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webbook.nist.gov&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=0&amp;...<\/a><p>So, CO2 absorbs in three narrow bands, one\nfor each of bending, stretching, and\ntwisting of the molecule, out in the\ninfrared.<p>No, Tom Friedman of the NYT:  CO2 does not\nabsorb sunlight, and anyone can confirm\nthis by looking at a source of CO2, e.g.,\nexhaling or the bubbles from soda pop, and\nsimply observing that the CO2 is not\nvisible and does not cast a shadow.<p>So, the theory has been that the CO2 warms\nthe planet.  Then there has been<p>ALARMIST CLAIM:  Extra CO2 from current\nhuman activities will soon cause\nsignificant extra warming and, thus,\n&quot;climate change&quot;, a &quot;climate crisis&quot;, etc.<p>Since the historical record can&#x27;t support\nthe ALARMIST CLAIM, we have to rely on the\ntheory based on the absorption spectrum of\nCO2 and computation.<p>Well the computations were done by dozens\nof teams, and the results are summarized\nin<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energyadvocate.com&#x2F;gc1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energyadvocate.com&#x2F;gc1.jpg<\/a><p>Net, as in this graph, nearly all the\ncomputations predicted rapid, significant\nincreases in temperatures soon.  Well the\ntime of predicted increases came and went\nwith no sign of anything like the\npredicted increases.<p>In science, when predictions are made and\nfound to be false, we junk the science.<p>No doubt, the failures in that graph are\nsome of the worst in all the history of\nscience.  GOOD science, e.g., the hunt for\nand finding the Higgs boson at the LHC\n(Large Hadron Collider), the observations\nthat confirmed the predictions of black\nholes, many other confirmed predictions of\nspecial and general relativity, the\nA-bomb, the H-bomb, the design of the\nHubble telescope, to the quantum mechanics\nin semi-conductors that are the core of\ncurrent digital electronics, the science\nwas just rock solid.<p>We are just awash in super solid science,\nand the global warming computations in\nthat graph are just a humiliation of\nanything scientific and just sick.<p>So, for the ALARMIST CLAIM, there is no\nscientific support.<p>For more there is the video documentary\n&lt;i&gt;The Great Global Warming Swindle&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; at<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg<\/a><p>there see (A) the remarks of MIT Professor\nR. Lindzen on (i) why any warming we might\nbe getting now cannot be from CO2 and (ii)\nthe huge pile of money that didn&#x27;t just\nbuy off the climate scientists but HIRED\nthe climate alarmists pretending to be\nclimate scientists, maybe 10 times more\nalarmists than real scientists.<p>Also that documentary argues that the\nMedieval Warm Period and the Little Ice\nAge were caused by variations in the rates\nof sun spots.  More sun spots increase the\nsolar wind which, from more links in a\ncausal chain, in the end slows cloud\nformation and has a net warming effect.<p>So, since both (1) history from ~1 million\nyears ago to the present and (2) the\ncomputations based on CO2 being a\ngreenhouse gas fail to support the\nALARMIST CLAIM, we have no scientific\nsupport or even meaningful evidence for\nthe ALARMIST CLAIM or the proposed very\nexpensive reductions in carbon, etc.<p>In this case and quite generally, if we\nare willing to go forward with big,\nexpensive changes without good evidence,\nthen we leave ourselves open to some of\nthe worst mistakes in all of civilization.<p>One current example of such mistakes is\nkilling off the rhinoceroses to get their\nhorns for use in Chinese medicine.<p>For another such mistake, there is from\npage 76 of<p>Susan Milbrath, <i>Star Gods of the Maya:\nAstronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars\n(The Linda Schele Series in Maya and\nPre-Columbian Studies),<\/i> ISBN-13\n978-0292752269, University of Texas Press,\n2000.<p>with<p>&quot;Indeed, blood sacrifice is required for\nthe sun to move, according to Aztec\ncosmology (Durian 1971:179; Sahaguin 1950\n- 1982, 7:8).&quot;<p>That is the Mayan charlatans killed people\nto pour their blood on a rock to keep the\nsun moving across the sky.  No doubt the\nsun actually did keep moving across the\nsky.<p>If we go forward with the Green New Deal,\nthe Paris Accords, carbon taxes, etc. we\nare making a mistake as irrational as in\nthe Chinese medicine and the Mayans.<p>Warning:  It appears that now the sun is\nentering the part of the 11 year or so\nsunspot cycle with fewer sun spots.  So,\nwe are in line for a few years of cooling.<p>So, don&#x27;t believe a claim of the global\nwarming alarmists that their efforts\ncaused the cooling.<p>At this point, continuing with\nentertaining the ALARMIST CLAIM is just\nnonsense, expensive nonsense."],"time":["2020-01-02 10:20:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["ermartin"],"id":[21932521],"kids":{},"parent":[21928734],"text":["Would someone please TLDR these comments for all of us?"],"time":["2020-01-02 03:36:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["avrulz"],"id":[21931373],"kids":{},"parent":[21928734],"text":["the article pretty much ignores 80% of the world. its more like what will happen in america and china as my newsfeed only shows that all the time."],"time":["2020-01-02 00:02:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["jhbadger"],"id":[21928973],"kids":[21929231,21929011,21929021],"parent":[21928734],"text":["&gt;9&#x2F; We will finally move on from the Baby Boomers dominating the conversation in the US and around the world and Millennials and Gen-Z will be running many institutions by the end of the decade.<p>And as typical in such pieces, GenX gets forgotten..."],"time":["2020-01-01 18:05:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["watertom"],"id":[21930270],"kids":[21931037,21930654],"parent":[21928734],"text":["I think the climate is going to change much faster than any models predict, like 3-4x faster, because we went past the tipping point about 30 years ago.<p>Phytoplankton populations will crash out in the next 10 years and the marine food chain will collapse.<p>Extreme wether patterns are going to completely disrupt food production, which will cause mass starvation and a global immigration&#x2F;refugee crisis.<p>In the U.S., the terrified of everything elderly, and right wing will go for less freedom and more authoritative government control.

Some do it because they want to improve their public speaking skills or to prove something to themselves (&#x27;I can be as outgoing as the marketing guy next door, har har&#x27;). Or to improve their market value.<p>In my early days, I had also this urge but it&#x27;s wrong. The whole post is wrong. Ask yourself WHY you want to speak at tech conferences. What&#x27;s the aim of your speech? Most of the times and most people don&#x27;t have an answer.<p>You want to have nice Google SERPs on your name?<p>Why?<p>To increase your personal market value?<p>You think one speech is enough?<p>Not at all. You need so much more. A topic, more than your vim config or some Github repo which got five stars. You need achievements, first. You need a damn story, a sharp profile. Then go out and hold 10 talks&#x2F;year, shotgun Google&#x27;s video search with your talks. I promise you, once you have a good story, public speaking is easy, it feels like talking. But if you don&#x27;t have anything to tell you sound like the odd &amp; boring AWS sales guy who wants to sell some new overpriced AWS service and paid for the speaking slot.<p>And be aware that public talks don&#x27;t necessarily improve your market value. One so-so talk on Youtube about your vim config at some third-class conference is worse than nothing. Besides, most tech conference are third-class created by some greedy local meetup tycoon rebranding his useless meetups. The best is that the meetup tycoon gets free content, YOU on stage, on Youtube, for a crappy conference he sold tickets for 500 bucks. He doesn&#x27;t care if the entire world makes fun of your speech about your vim config.<p>I remember one guy who did music with hard-coded JS decades ago, not impressive, maybe a bit interesting. This guy was on several speaking gigs with always the same topic, his stupid JS music. After the third time I saw him, I started to hate him, I swore to never hire this person. Remember, speaking can backfire if you don&#x27;t have a topic.<p>I&#x27;ve another guy: Jared, he wrote amazing Formik, a great lib. His talks though are so-so, promoting his company (I think it&#x27;s just a shell for him freelancing) too much and yeah not on par with his repo. When seeing his talks on a shabby meetup, my first thought was, better fix your repo&#x27;s issues instead of doing this self-promotion. Again: it backfired and didn&#x27;t improve his market value. Rather the opposite, before I thought Formik, Jared, the king. Once I saw the speaches, OMG, Jared got jarring.<p>I rather prefer a cozy Youtube video on a living room couch on Svelte like from the Youtuber Harry Wolff (highly recommended!!! =&gt; [1]). Good speakers like Harry are entertainers, they understand to be authentic without even trying and it&#x27;s hard to deconstruct what they do right.<p>So, public speaking skills are overrated. It&#x27;s enough to be able to moderate a meeting&#x2F;standup for 10-50 people. To do proper speaking, you need to do it frequently, you need to understand entertainment, you need to get deeply into story telling, how to plot narratives, sometimes you need script writers, media trainers and you MUST be in shape, no need to look like James Bond but getting on keto few weeks before sounds like a plan.<p>If you still think you should be a public speaker, test if you have the basics for being a good entertainer. Do internal presentation at your company, bigger ones where you invite multiple departments, do Youtube videos, screen recordings. Test how people react on your voice, on your appearance, your jokes, If you see positive signals or slight growth, continue.<p>Otherwise just don&#x27;t. Public speaking is a profession and imagine a public speaker who wants to pair-program with you in C++. I mean why not? If you can hold a speech he should be able to write some kernel code.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TPVQ3M9b6CY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TPVQ3M9b6CY<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 21:09:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FsDuke"],"id":[21933349],"kids":[21933587],"parent":[21929675],"text":["These threads always bring out the jealous introverts getting mad at more outgoing people that are able to speak in public.<p>Guys you can do it too, really.

Background: I’ve spent the last 20+ years writing low-latency realtime audio applications, technically cross-platform but focused on Linux.<p>If you care about low latency on any general purpose OS, you need to use a realtime scheduling policy. The default scheduling on these OS’s is intended to maximise some combination of bandwidth and&#x2F;or fairness. Low latency requires ditching both of those in favor of limiting the maximum scheduling delay of a thread that is otherwise ready to run.<p>Measuring how long synchronization primitives take without SCHED_FIFO is illustrative, but only of why, if you care about scheduling latency, you need SCHED_FIFO. There are several alternative schedulers for Linux – none of them remove the need for SCHED_FIFO if latency is important.<p>It is absolutely not the case that using SCHED_FIFO automatically starves non-SCHED_FIFO threads. Scheduling policy is set per-thread, and SCHED_FIFO will only cause issues if the threads that use it really do “burn the CPU” (e.g. by using spinlocks). If you combine SCHED_FIFO with spinlocks you need to be absolutely certain that the locks have low contention and&#x2F;or are held for extremely short periods (preferably just a few instructions). If you use mutexes (which ultimately devolve to futexes at the kernel level), the kernel will take care of you a little better, unless your SCHED_FIFO thread doesn’t block – if it doesn’t do that, that’s entirely on you. Blocking means making some sort of system call that will cause the scheduler to put the thread to sleep – could be a wait on a futex, waiting for data, or an explicit sleep.<p>In particular, this: “This was known for a while simply because audio can stutter on Linux when all cores are busy (which doesn’t happen on Windows)” is NOT true. Linux actually has better audio performance than Windows or macOS, but only if the app developer understands a few basic principles. One of them is using SCHED_FIFO appropriately.<p>Pro-audio&#x2F;music creation scheduling is MUCH more demanding than video, and a bit more demanding than games. Linux handles this stuff just fine – it just gives you enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot if you don’t fully understand what you’re doing."],"time":["2020-01-01 04:23:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devit"],"id":[21926695],"kids":[21927241,21939517],"parent":[21919988],"text":["The claim that &quot;the Linux scheduler is bad&quot; seems wrong.<p>First of all, a program that calls sched_yield() for synchronization is simply broken, since doing so can cause 100% CPU usage (if the other thread is stopped at an unfortunate place), so the only correct method among the ones benchmarked is std::mutex.<p>When using std::mutex (the only correct approach), Linux and Windows both seem to have similar average performance, but Windows has 10x latency, so Linux is better."],"time":["2020-01-01 05:41:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amluto"],"id":[21926917],"kids":[21928139],"parent":[21919988],"text":["I’m not convinced the measurements are really meaningful in this article.

I can’t find any mention of how many threads there are, how many CPUs, or what else the system is doing.<p>So this is measuring a mess of a few things:<p>For mutexes (assuming all the implementations actually make syscalls for unlocking), this has something to do with how long it takes for the scheduler to activate the waiter and run it, plus how long the scheduler waits because the system is doing something else or it wants to try to avoid bouncing a task between CPUs.<p>For anything that does <i>not<\/i> involve the kernel in unlocking, this is really just a measurement of the pauses in execution of long-running threads that continuously hog the CPU.  If the thread is also calling sched_yield(), the results are erratic, since sched_yield() more or less means “I don’t want to run now, but I’m not actually waiting for anything visible to the scheduler and, um, run me again soon maybe?”  This is almost always the wrong solution. Other than that, this test has essentially nothing to do with <i>which<\/i> spinlock is in use, unless the spinlock itself wastes time failing to figure out that it’s ready.<p>From old memory, the Windows scheduler is (was?) mostly based on per-thread priorities, highest priority wins, where the priorities are occasionally automatically adjusted.  So, if you set a high-ish priority, you get to hog the CPU. In contrast, Linux tries quite hard not to let normal (non-RT) threads hog the CPU, so a thread that effectively runs continuously measuring pauses will detect significant pauses in which Linux decides that the rest of the system deserves to run too."],"time":["2020-01-01 07:20:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pixel_fcker"],"id":[21923189],"kids":{},"parent":[21919988],"text":["I think the answer, as always, is to measure on your own workloads.

That is, precisely: enough that each new person who masters Rust will be able to find work writing Rust. (To be clear, it would be good if this were to happen.)<p>The deepest observation in the article is the remark about the cognitive load imposed by need to avoid pitfalls inherent in the programming model.<p>I coded K&amp;R C in the 80s, and while I never shipped an argument-type bug, avoiding them was a continual distraction. I coded C90 from 2006 to 2012, with a similar cognitive load I was happy to leave behind, although again I never shipped a bug caused by its failings. (We had bugs, but they were specification bugs: building the wrong thing.)<p>Writing C++ post-14 has been an increasing pleasure. The cognitive load noted is present at times, but decreasingly so as the Standard Library and other libraries get more powerful.<p>I am disappointed that the author found it too hard to implement a correct program with C++, but more disappointed that he chose to blame his tools for his failure.<p>It has become fashionable to insist that correct programs cannot be written in this or that unfashionable language, but in fact a great many correct programs have been written in all of them, not excepting octal machine code.<p>What varies is how much work is needed, and how many people can do it: it is certain that, for any chosen language past or future, most people cannot or will not write a correct program in it. Rust is not different in this.<p>Many people coding C++, and perhaps most coding C, are not writing correct code, and have over the years written a very great deal of bad code. Will those same people succeed in learning Rust, and learning to write good code in it? It appears that the people currently adopting Rust are more skilled than is typical, so it seems hard to generalize their results to more typical programmers.<p>C++ and Rust embody different choices in emphasis: Rust, safety; C++, library power. Stewards of C++ have decided the best way to get substantial correct programs is to enable encapsulating semantics in well-tested, well-optimized libraries that can be used without compromising performance or system architecture. Rust has chosen to emphasize making wrong low-level code hard to express, although its ability to express libraries will only increase.<p>It will not be clear for a long time which will have better results. Will enough people learn Rust to write the correct low-level code needed? Will enough C++ programmers learn to use libraries that make (re-)writing dangerous low-level code unnecessary?<p>What is clear is that the number of C++ programmers is growing faster than ever, and interest in coding to high level C++ libraries, as measured by attendance at an ever increasing number of conferences, is exploding. Even attendance at each ISO Standard meeting is quite a lot larger than at each previous one, now reliably in hundreds. The number of new C++ programmers in any unit time is still larger than the number of new Rust programmers, by a large factor.<p>So, the experiment is interesting and valuable. What we can be confident about, either way, is that, for every C coder, or C++ coder writing low-level, often bad code, switching to Rust or to C++ using reliable libraries will result in more good code. It matters much less which they choose."],"time":["2020-01-02 09:25:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0xdead"],"id":[21927970],"kids":{},"parent":[21927248],"text":["It is hard to take someone seriously when they write &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot; in their articles like C and C++ are the same thing."],"time":["2020-01-01 14:46:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["blargmaster33"],"id":[21929014],"kids":[21930170,21929893,21931988,21930515,21931304],"parent":[21927248],"text":["Why did rust not go with standard c syntax"],"time":["2020-01-01 18:13:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["minikomi"],"id":[21927553],"kids":[21927679,21927565],"parent":[21927076],"text":["Happy new year, everyone<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;AIxvWUh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;AIxvWUh<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 11:48:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wiz21c"],"id":[21928181],"kids":[21928446,21929003,21928498,21929007,21928438],"parent":[21927076],"text":["not 100% related but is there any good information source on the web to learn how to build a good car simulator ?

If you haven&#x27;t found his YouTube channel yet prepare to lose several days of your life. I find his arguments here compelling.<p>Basically planets only matter as a source of raw materials.

We&#x27;ve seen no evidence of any K2 civilizations within millions of light years, which suggests their existence is highly unlikely (within the cone of spacetime we can observe).<p>Given this seems to be such a natural evolution you can extrapolate and say that we are pretty much alone.<p>Remember it&#x27;s not about what most civilizations do because it only takes one to go this road.

How long before you will want to have full autonomy, specially given the distance?<p>- Cultural and political factions - Is it possible that individuals in the colony have different objectives, resulting with political infighting or open war?

The UFOs fired light beams at people, causing injuries and sucking blood from 400 witnesses. After a rise in local concern, the mayor of the city requested help from the Air Force. Operation Saucer started, during which numerous photos were taken and testimonies collected. Operation Saucer is just one of the compelling cases which A. J. Gevaerd, editor of Brazilian UFO magazine, talked about in his latest lecture in Copenhagen, paving the way for complete Disclosure in his country.   Kudos to Exopolitics Denmark for setting up their excellent annual conference at the Danish National Museum on September 26 in Copenhagen!<p>The first case involves thousands of people, living on an island in the Amazon, who were attacked by UFOs over a period of several years (1975-1977 IIRC).  Flying cans with visible pilots were shooting people with bending &quot;light&quot; beams and sucking up their blood.  It got so bad that thousands of people evacuated and the Brazilian Army sent in a unit to find out what was going on and try to make contact.

Seeing that light when coming down the hall has saved us heaps of times from leaving the garage door open all night.<p>I also have laser pointers hanging from the ceiling in the garage that are positioned so when the laser dot reaches the dash you know the car is in far enough.<p>Another not quite automated addition is using a Sonoff wifi touch light switch[2] in the lounge room[3]. Reflashed with Tasmota it allows us to easily turn the overhead lights on and off from the same remote control for the TV, Amp and Kodi media player. (Works via a script in Kodi.)<p>Probably the handiest is using an ultrasonic distance sensor as a presence sensor to tell the computer when I’m in front of it or not[5]. If music is playing when I walk away from the computer, it pauses then resumes when I come back. Also wakes sleeping screens when I return.<p>Just recently I wrote a little script that displays the number of minutes I&#x27;ve been sitting at the computer in the corner of the screen. At thirty minutes it turns from green to red and plays, &quot;Move it! Move it!&quot; sound, which it&#x27;ll keep doing every five minutes until I get up and leave the computer for a little bit. (Although I think I&#x27;m going to have to change the sound to something that doesn&#x27;t startle the hell out of me every time.)<p>Also have an analogue modem on the phone line that lets me initiate calls from my command line by just typing something like, &quot;call dad&quot; and it looks up contact information in my centralised contacts list. It also cross-references incoming caller ID info with the contact list and displays caller info on my computer screen and the Kodi media player[6].<p>If I were to really get into more home automation in earnest, I think being able to control the curtains in the house would be ahead of controlling lights. Hate wandering around the house opening and closing them all.<p>Two things I dislike about current trends in home automation are:<p>1) The requirement for an active Internet connection for a lot of your stuff to work. I want it self contained to the house and not sending information out into the world.<p>2) The need to have your phone near to you to use half the stuff. E.g., with the lounge room light switch mentioned above I can turn the light on or off at the switch (as well as the remote). I don&#x27;t have to go find my phone and swipe back and forth five times just to toggle it.<p>One concept I find very interesting from the late 90&#x27;s was the adaptive house[7]. It would learn things like your hot water usage, preferred room temperature and ambient light levels and used neural network reinforcement learning to optimise. I wonder how far this could be taken now with advances in machine learning.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.michevan.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;garage-door-sensor&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.michevan.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;garage-door-sensor&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itead.cc&#x2F;sonoff-touch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itead.cc&#x2F;sonoff-touch.html<\/a><p>[3] Aside: To my mind, in most cases it seems to make more sense to automate the switch, than automate the light bulb itself.

I&#x27;ll use x for multiplication. X + &lt;a,b,c,d&gt; means the four values A+a, X+b, X+c, X+d.<p>Let Y be the last two digits of the year.<p>Observation: 365 = 1. If it weren&#x27;t for leap years, the year factor would simply go up by 1 each year. A leap year pushes the start of the next year back a day, and that&#x27;s cumulative, so we need a correction of the number of leap years that have past.<p>1. That gives the first, and simplest, way to compute the year factor for year Y.<p><pre><code>  return Y + Y&#x2F;&#x2F;4\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAdvantage: simplest algorithm.<p>Disadvantage: numbers get larger than you might be comfortable with for fast mental meth. Doing 99, for example, gives 99 + 99&#x2F;4 = 99 + 24 = 123 = 4, which has plenty of opportunity along the way to goof.<p>Many people will do better with a method that uses a little more complicated algorithm but cuts down the size of the numbers.<p>2. The divide by 12 method, which is the one given in the article, does this.<p><pre><code>  a, b = Y &#x2F;% 12\n  c = b &#x2F;&#x2F; 4\n  return a + b + c\n<\/code><\/pre>\nHere&#x27;s why it works.<p><pre><code>  Y = 12 a + b\n  Y&#x2F;&#x2F;4 = 3 a + b&#x2F;&#x2F;4\n       = 3 a + c\n  Y + Y&#x2F;&#x2F;4 = 15 a + b + c\n           = a + b + c\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAdvantage: a &lt;= 8, b &lt; 12, c &lt; 4. Other than the first &#x2F;%, you only deal with fairly small numbers.<p>Disadvantage: Still easy for many people to goof on the initial &#x2F;%.<p>Note: if you divide by 20 instead of 12, you get a similar method, except that you&#x27;ll need to use 4a instead of a. Since a is at most 4, 4a is not large. For many people %&#x2F; 20 might be sufficiently easier to deal with in mental math than %&#x2F; 12 that it is worth the cost of having to multiply by 4.<p>3. The odd 11 method.<p><pre><code>  Y += 11 if Y is odd\n  Y &#x2F;&#x2F;= 2\n  Y += 11 if Y is odd\n  return -Y\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe easiest way to see that this works is to go back to Y + Y&#x2F;&#x2F;4. Write Y = 4q + r, where r = 0, 1, 2, or 3.<p>The first conditional add 11 step turns 4q + &lt;0,1,2,3&gt; into 4q + &lt;0,12,2,14&gt;. Dividing by 2 then gives 2q + &lt;0,6,1,7&gt;. The second conditional add 11 gives 2q + &lt;0,6,12,18&gt;. Negating mod 7 gives 5q + &lt;0,1,2,3&gt;, which is 4q + &lt;0,1,2,3&gt; + q = Y + Y&#x2F;&#x2F;4.<p>Similar considerations give other divide by 2 and negate methods. If you note that if Y = 4q, then Y + Y&#x2F;&#x2F;4 = -(Y&#x2F;&#x2F;2), then it is just a matter of how to take into account the r in 4q + r when r != 0. One way to do that would be first subtract r, then do the -(Y&#x2F;&#x2F;2), and then add r back. That works because none of the r != 0 years are leap years, and so we just need to add 1 for each of them.<p>Another way would be to just go ahead and do -(Y&#x2F;&#x2F;2), and then add in a correction based on r. Let Y = 4q + &lt;0,1,2,3&gt;. Then -(Y&#x2F;&#x2F;2) = 5q + &lt;0,0,-1,-1&gt;. We want 5q + &lt;0,1,2,3&gt;, so we have to add 0, 1, 3, or 4 if r = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively.<p>That last correction can be split into two parts: add 1 if Y is odd, plus add 2 if Y&#x2F;&#x2F;2 is odd. That gives:<p><pre><code>  t = Y odd ? 1 : 0\n  Y &#x2F;&#x2F;= 2\n  t += 3 if Y is odd\n  return -Y + t\n<\/code><\/pre>\n4. The method I actually use, which views the two digit year as a decade part and a year within the decade part, and operates on them separately. Since I gave a long description of it yesterday, I&#x27;ll just link to that [1] here.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21926543\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21926543<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 21:06:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bubba1236"],"id":[21926720],"kids":{},"parent":[21926097],"text":["this is a great article went through it and can do it now"],"time":["2020-01-01 05:53:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kissgyorgy"],"id":[21927808],"kids":{},"parent":[21926097],"text":["It&#x27;s a nice article and a good algorithm, kudos to all who can do this.<p>My philosophy however is that I don&#x27;t need to learn this kind of stuff nowadays.

It&#x27;s not scalable and no one has time to janitor every product and service they use in their lives.<p>The only solution to it is regulation. Fortunately one rich guy in California is putting his personal money up to move the ball forward [1]:<p>&gt;Mr. Mactaggart said his 2020 state ballot initiative, among other things, would create a state enforcement agency, limit targeted advertisements based on geolocation and add items covered by the “negligent data breach” section, which would allow consumers to pursue legal action in more instances of a hack.<p>&gt;Most significantly, Mr. Mactaggart said, his new effort would make it harder to adjust the current law any further. The initiative includes a “purpose and intent” section that requires any amendment to the law to be in the service of protecting consumers’ rights to privacy, a legally binding clause that Mr. Mactaggart said would prevent industry from chipping away at the measure.<p>CCPA is a mediocre version of GDPR, but it&#x27;s certainly better than the status quo.<p>&gt;The lobbying against Mr. Mactaggart’s earlier initiative kept it from the ballot in 2018, and legislators instead passed the privacy law. “It was the right thing to do because there was no guarantee at the ballot box,” Mr. Mactaggart said of his agreement to drop his measure. “Now, it’s different because we have the law.”<p>&gt;Mr. Mactaggart said he would do whatever it takes to pass his initiative next year, including spending millions of his own money. He bankrolled his last campaign almost entirely himself, spending more than $3 million. Mr. Mactaggart will have to collect more than 623,000 signatures for his new initiative to qualify for the ballot. A survey in October by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research of 777 registered voters in California found that most supported Mr. Mactaggart’s initiative.<p>If you care about privacy, help this guy get his ballot initiative over the finish line. California can serve as inspiration for other state privacy laws (and may just become the default, as it often does). Tech people love scale, and you know who has scale? Governments.

I agree with the points Robin made, and want to toss out a few additional bits of info.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of chatter on social media over the last couple years suggesting Redux is dying or no longer needed.  While it&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s a number of other options available, and that there&#x27;s not as much _need_ to use Redux right away as there used to be, there&#x27;s still plenty of good reasons to use Redux.  In addition, Redux continues to be very widely used, and I&#x27;ve seen quite a few major apps choose to use it over the last year.  I talked about these aspects in my Reactathon 2019 talk on &quot;The State of Redux&quot; [0] and my post &quot;Redux - Not Dead Yet!&quot; [1].<p>We recently released a new official package called Redux Toolkit [2], which includes utilities to simplify several common Redux use cases, including store setup, defining reducers, immutable update logic, and even creating entire &quot;slices&quot; of state at once.  It&#x27;s now our recommended approach for writing Redux logic.  It&#x27;s also written in TypeScript, and the API is designed to provide a great experience in TS apps.<p>We&#x27;re currently working on an ongoing major rewrite of the Redux core docs [3], which has several goals: updating content to better match today&#x27;s target dev audience (removing references to &quot;Flux&quot;, etc), simplifying explanations, encouraging easier patterns, and adding additional content and guidance on real-world usage.<p>As part of that, we&#x27;ve added a new &quot;Style Guide&quot; page [4], which has our recommended patterns and practices for writing good Redux code.  We&#x27;re specifically emphasizing and recommending patterns that simplify the amount of code you have to write, like using Immer for immutable updates, using the &quot;ducks&quot; structure for files and logic, treating actions as &quot;events&quot; rather than &quot;setters&quot;, and so on.<p>Earlier this year, we also released new versions of React-Redux.  v7.0 was a complete rewrite of the internals to improve performance, and v7.1 added a new React hooks API [5] as an alternative to the classic `connect()` API.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in some of the behind-the-scenes details on how these libraries have evolved, see my posts &quot;The History and Implementation of React-Redux&quot; [5] and &quot;Redux Toolkit 1.0&quot; [6].<p>If anyone&#x27;s got any questions, ask away!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;presentation-state-of-redux&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;presentation-state...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;redux-not-dead-yet&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;redux-not-dead-yet...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux-toolkit.js.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux-toolkit.js.org<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3592\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3592<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;style-guide&#x2F;style-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;style-guide&#x2F;style-guide<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;react-redux-history-implementation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;react-redux-histor...<\/a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;redux-starter-kit-1.0&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;redux-starter-kit-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-01 06:13:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Karupan"],"id":[21927001],"kids":[21928687,21928750,21927010,21929961],"parent":[21926659],"text":["Redux was such a mental overhead for me when I started out with it.

For instance your store might say isLoading:true but the UI might not show that since it&#x27;s rendering&#x2F;working another higher-priority element on the screen.
