But the primary difference I see in this comparison is simply risk aversion. YC and their VCs are in it to make money by placing a number of small bets, knowing some will be losers. To go big like SpaceX requires you to be all in. Elon nearly went broke a couple times. He&#x27;s willing to take that risk because he&#x27;s in it for the results, not the money.<p>I used to wonder if it was just hype for employees and investors to say that SpaceX goal was to make humanity multi planetary. The last couple years have convinced me he&#x27;s for real. The man could retire now. SpaceX could just own the launch industry by cutting cost for a while, or sit back and enjoy higher profits from reusability. But starship and mass production of it? Nonsense unless the stated mission is for real.<p>People can do so much more if it&#x27;s about the mission and not the money, and that includes investors."],"time":["2020-03-17 18:59:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zackmorris"],"id":[22606884],"kids":[22607626,22611082,22610565,22608388,22608111],"parent":[22590558],"text":["To me, the next great challenge of our time isn&#x27;t finding the next SpaceX, but gradually dismantling the corporate dogma of full employment. The short-term goals should be along the lines of getting to a 30-hour work week, a single-payer healthcare system, free college and UBI from an automation moonshot.<p>The long-term goals should be about how to get everyone in the world self-actualized, but doing it sustainably so we don&#x27;t destroy the planet in the process. We&#x27;ll be on renewable energy by 2030, but the real destruction is happening due to manufacturing that we don&#x27;t actually need. Getting demand flipped so that we can get to a sustainable or non-growth based economy is going to be tricky and may not happen before 2040-2050 as the singularity looms.<p>My dream for this would look like a 20-hour or less work week, with a great deal more capital available at the bottom with near-zero or negative interest rates. Young people would train for a few years in something like a peace corps doing the difficult work that nobody wants to do, then use the life skills they&#x27;ve learned to eliminate those hardships for everyone else going forward. Their degree or equivalent certificates would go towards hard disciplines, advancing things like medicine where devotion and commitment to a large organization is actually required.<p>But the rest of their time would be spent in their own endeavors in the humanities or working in maker spaces to invent new things. That&#x27;s where the real innovation will come from. So instead of a the next SpaceX requiring $300 million, it will just need a few people with access to shared computing resources so they can iterate unfettered by the time suck of the workaday world.<p>We can look towards Star Trek for inspiration. In the meantime, I expect everything to go the opposite direction from the way I suggested, just like it has been for the last 20 years. We&#x27;ll see more wealth inequality, more disenfranchisement, more neocolonialism. Unfortunately it&#x27;s probably going to get worse before it gets better.

They were RT-PCR positive and their serum neutralizing titers and even ELISA titers went to almost zero within a few months.<\/i><p>Baric: <i>And it has not been studied and it should be studied, and this is the contemporary human Coronaviruses -- nobody knows how they maintain themselves in human populations. They don&#x27;t undergo rapid antigenic variation like influenza. There&#x27;s not 115 common cold or corona virus type genotypes or whatever they&#x27;re called, serotypes. Sorry Vincent, I just butchered the coronaviruses.<\/i><p>Vincent Racaniello: <i>That&#x27;s ok.<\/i> &lt;laughter&gt;<p>Baric: <i>So one hypothesis is that they cause a transient protective immune response that wanes quickly and then they can reinfect and cause mild upper-respiratory tract infections and that&#x27;s how they maintain themselves. So it is quite possible.. there&#x27;s been a number now of reported cases in China of SARS2 infections where people were documented to be infected and recovered. They were RT-PCR negative. They went home and they became reinfected a month later or so.<\/i><p>Baric: <i>In this case the United States has sufficient cases that we can actually track the serologic responses of the individuals and their general immune.. both B- and T-cell responses after infection and we can get a handle on the long term immunity that may be elicited after infection.<\/i><p>On the other hand, from a letter read on an earlier <i>TWiV<\/i>[2]:<p><i>I&#x27;m an infectious disease doctor and would like to point out an important factor in diagnosing this infection (and all respiratory pathogens that use nucleic acid probes for specimen collection).  This is of particular concern now that China has transitioned to a much more problematic clinical diagnosis based more on clinical symptoms than PCR testing.<\/i><p><i>While it may seem trivial how a health care worker jams a swab in to someone&#x27;s throat or nose, technique is important.  If anterior naries (front of nose) swabs or side of mouth swabs are done, rather than the true posterior nasopharynx or oropharangeal swabs, the sensitivity drops dramatically.<\/i><p><i>We have shown this to be true repeatedly with diagnosis of influenza and respiratory pathogens, and I am disappointed that it has not been mentioned more in discussions about the PCR tests, missing the diagnosis in people who are positive and negative then positive again.<\/i><p><i>We often see people admitted from the ER with the perhaps carelessly collected flu test who miraculously are flu positive by the time they are admitted.

While the impact on small businesses and workers in the “gig-economy” hasn’t made the news, it will be worse for them. They have fewer cash reserves and less margin of error for managing sudden downturns.

Of course there are ridiculous hoaxes and bad advice floating around, but it pales in comparison to the erroneous information that authorities are putting out, and it is way easier to distinguish as BS.<p>For instance, I have read from official sources:<p>Vitamin C does not help. Garlic (powerful anti-inflammatory and antiviral) will not help. Black and green tea will not help. Chance of infection outside of China is negligible. Human-to-human transmission is unlikely. Coronaviruses don&#x27;t survive on plastics and metal surfaces. Taking anti-inflammatory drugs is not dangerous. Face masks are not protective against the virus. Gargling and swallowing hot iodized salt water does nothing. The virus is not mutating and not creating more deadly strains. The virus can&#x27;t be made by humans. The official statistics are real and not a gross undercount. Cities will not go in lockdown or quarantine. Longer than expected incubation periods are not impossible. Sauna&#x27;s and hot showers don&#x27;t help. Everything is under control and contained. The flu is more deadly. You should not avoid public transit or large gatherings. We have enough ventilators. We have enough protective equipment for medics. You should not be worried about COVID-19 if you got flu-like symptoms before the first confirmed case on 19 January. The CDC is and was not lying about the number of cases, and warnings circulating online reporting community spread are hoaxes. The virus can not pass the brain-blood barrier. The virus does not increase chance of triggering latent schizophrenia and psychosis. Some national from a different country did not die outside of China before the WHO called a world health emergency. This is not yet a pandemic. Fantasies about coronavirus are more contagious than the disease itself. Not eating in Chinatown restaurants is racist. When hand sanitizer ran out, it&#x27;s not a good idea to make your own hand sanitizer. Countries in Europe won&#x27;t follow Italy. The virus started in a wet market in Wuhan. You can&#x27;t blame China for the pandemic, they did a great job and set an example for outbreak response.

Before switching, my QWERTY avg was around 60. Switching allowed me to relearn touch typing with a clean slate.<p>Now, 15 years later, I still regularly use QWERTY and Dvorak. But the contexts are different. I use QWERTY on my phone when typing with my thumbs, and Dvorak on my keyboard.<p>Recently I did an experiment with myself where I replaced all the keys on my keyboard with blank keycaps. Then I tried playing typeracer with a QWERTY layout. As expected, I consistently scored around ~40wpm.<p>However, if I allowed myself to look at the BLANK keycaps, it’s like a switch triggered in my brain and I was able to consistently type around ~60wpm. It’s like the visual input unlocked something in my brain.<p>When I type Dvorak, I use proper form, and don’t rely on the visual signals. I believe that because of this, my fingers have had to learn more deeply the shapes of the words as I type them.<p>One thing which I do is to type words up to about 7 characters as a single fluid motion. For longer words, I subconsciously chunk them into smaller parts, and type each of those parts in a single motion.<p>So my suggestions is to block all visual signals in whatever layout you use, and allow your fingers to develop a deep intuition about the shapes of words. Typing with proper form will definitely help, but the fastest typists in the world typically don’t use proper form. They just have really good accuracy.<p>Finally, I don’t think the physical keyboard matters that much. I would not recommend dropping &gt;$150 on a fancy keyboard in order to practice typing faster. I use a fancy keyboard because I like fancy keyboards and how they feel, but that has very little impact on my typing speeds.

(Plenty of resources already recommended in other comments.)<p>2) Use an ergonomic split keyboard of some sort so your posture is much more relaxed and you&#x27;re not hunched up trying to type on a straight keyboard.<p>Those two things will get you a long way. You can worry about other productivity improvements after that, but honestly I think they will be incremental once you&#x27;ve done the above.<p>Other fast gimme. Remap the capslock key to something useful but usually more awkward to reach. I&#x27;ve remapped it to ctrl, but considering switching to esc as I&#x27;m a vim user. Mind you, I&#x27;ve also got a FS3-P USB Triple Foot Switch Pedal under the desk with one of them mapped to esc, so not so urgent there. I wouldn&#x27;t go remapping too much else otherwise it&#x27;ll trip you up too much whenever you&#x27;re at someone else&#x27;s keyboard.<p>I learnt to touch-type in 1986 on a mechanical typewriter in school. I knew I was going to work with computers and so knew touch typing would be a valuable skill. I was the only male in the class as everyone else perceived it as a class for women looking to go into secretarial work.<p>I am absolutely amazed that touch typing is no longer taught in school in this age of ubiquitous computing.<p>As far as split keyboards, I love my MS Natural Ergonomics 4000. If I could get one with the number pad cut off (less reach for the mouse) it would be perfect. They do tend to last and last which is good as they&#x27;re getting harder to find when one finally breaks. I&#x27;ve tried the MS Sculpt but I find the mushy esc key a real drawback (again, vim user). Overall just not especially nice to type on. I also do use the function keys and the extra media keys on the 4000 a fair bit, so missed them on the sculpt.<p>One of the advantages of vim is you can do almost all the editing without having to move your hands from the keyboard. You don&#x27;t event have to move to the arrow keys as you can use hjkl for movement. Once learnt, it can be very efficient.<p>If I hand the time and energy, I would consider learning the Colemak layout. Given vi is hardwired into my brain by now I suspect it would make Dvorak too awkward.<p>Funny story. Once you can touch-type, you learn to unconsciously position your hands properly by feeling for the little marks on the J and F keys. When I worked in Japan, they didn&#x27;t have these marks and I was forever drifting my hands over they keyboard until getting annoyed and having to look down to put my hands on the right row. You don&#x27;t realise how many times a day you rely on that.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until one of the locals pointed out to me that the curve of the J and F keys was deeper than the other keys on their keyboard that that particular stressor was solved. I learned to feel for that instead."],"time":["2020-03-18 13:13:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aldoushuxley001"],"id":[22610402],"kids":{},"parent":[22609607],"text":["Learn to play the piano"],"time":["2020-03-17 22:03:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["aldoushuxley001"],"id":[22616802],"kids":{},"parent":[22609607],"text":["Am I shadowbanned?"],"time":["2020-03-18 15:09:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["ta999999171"],"id":[22620304],"kids":{},"parent":[22609607],"text":["Keybr.com"],"time":["2020-03-18 20:28:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["aldoushuxley001"],"id":[22616799],"kids":{},"parent":[22609607],"text":["test"],"time":["2020-03-18 15:09:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["chrisa"],"id":[22604559],"kids":{},"parent":[22591633],"text":["Has anyone gone through any of these?

Totally fascinating - more than once I even got it out to show to people visiting! n:)<p>The Neato ones are a bit more methodical - they have a simple time-of-flight rotating laser sensor that does some SLAM-style stuff to map out the room which means it can do long continuous back-and-forth paths across the room (random image I found that explains it nicely: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.generationrobots.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;cms&#x2F;Navigation-Algorithm-Neato-XV-15.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.generationrobots.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;cms&#x2F;Navigation-Algorith...<\/a>) It has a charging base thing - it has a special pattern of stripes (kinda like a barcode I guess) behind a human-opaque panel that it uses to locate the charger.<p>While it was nice to just set the thing off and leave it to do its thing, it is not without problems though:<p>- it would very happily suck-up and chew cables or errant socks etc, and&#x2F;or push low stuff around in front of it (e.g shoes).  You had to spend time picking up phone charging cables and shoes etc before starting.<p>- it was not very accurate when it came to working around slanted chair&#x2F;table legs (since its laser beam would only pick a point approx 5cm off of the ground, it would often hit the lower part of the leg that was in its path but that it could not see)<p>- it would often get stuck &quot;under&quot; things since there was about 1.5cm of extra height above the laser, and it feels like a lot of IKEA furniture is all just high enough for it to drive under and get wedged because it could not see it.<p>- it would sometimes get stuck in situations where there was a very tight space between two things (e.g. dining chair and a wall)but where in theory it was wide enough for it to drive down - it would end up trying to reverse out, but actually managing to reverse into the wall and jack its self up so the wheels lost traction.<p>- it does not know if it has &quot;missed&quot; something or done a good job, so often stubborn bits of fluff don&#x27;t get picked up.<p>We&#x27;ve now had to retire ours because we got new carpets and it seems to get stuck a lot on the new carpet that is a bit thicker, often doing wheel spins for 30 seconds at a time.  This seems to really confuse the SLAM algo since after it regains traction it ends up just driving straight into walls and stuff, despite having a laser sensor to tell it there was a wall there ... I guess it used some sort of encoding from its wheels as input too (perhaps as a effort to ignore &quot;unexpected&quot; laser returns - e.g. perhaps intended to ignore people pets when it has already mapped a room?)<p>We&#x27;ve replaced it with a dyson cordless stick vacuum thing with a wall-charger-dock thing.  It doesn&#x27;t take that much longer to do it by hand when you factor in the prep-time (picking up cables, moving dining chairs away from the table, moving things far away out from the wall etc etc), rescuing stuck robot time, or manual pick-ups of things it missed required afterwards, and then moving all of your chairs etc back into position.

If the number of cases were to continue to double every three days, there would be about a hundred million cases in the United States by May.<\/i><p><i>Still, without any measures to slow it down, covid-19 will continue to spread exponentially for months. To understand why, it is instructive to simulate the spread of a fake disease through a population.<\/i><p>It will continue to spread exponentially for months!? Millions &amp; millions of cases &amp; or deaths? These are really sloppy and dangerous ideas to put in peoples head. They are just plain wrong, and not how pandemics play out in reality.<p>Here is what the CDC says about how pandemics spread (Under the &#x27;COVID-19 Now a Pandemic&#x27; heading) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;cases-updates&#x2F;summary.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsummary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;cases-updates&#x2F;summ...<\/a><p><i>Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a “Pandemic Intervals Framework.” Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.<\/i><p><i>Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity. The United States nationally is currently in the initiation phases, but states where community spread is occurring are in the acceleration phase. The duration and severity of each phase can vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response.<\/i><p>So no, it will NOT continue exponentially for months. Especially given the amount of isolation&#x2F; quarantine measures and canceling of large events taking place. I think it is reasonable to expect these measures will help us progress through to the deceleration phase faster.<p>Further-more, there is more and more evidence coming out suggesting the in China where it started, they have already entered the deceleration phase.

If this occurs, the district will make every effort to ensure that our students&#x27; educational opportunities continue while at home. Throughout the years, the district has compiled a comprehensive collection of online content and digital resources. The district also provides mobile devices for students to check out for home use to ensure that district students (non charter) can continue their learning without interruption.<p>...<p>The Instructional Continuity Plan (ICP) has three components: Content Delivery, Mobile Devices, and Internet Access. Content Delivery explains which resources students will use for core instruction and which materials can be used as supplemental resources to enhance core instruction. Mobile Devices provides the steps the district is taking to ensure that any student who needs a mobile device to access the instructional resources will be provided with one, upon request, for the duration of the schools&#x27; closure. ... Internet Access poses the greatest challenge to ensuring that M-DCPS students can continue their studies while at home. The district has taken steps throughout the years to assist students in getting access to the internet at home through projects such as The 1Million Project; however, partnerships with service providers is crucial to providing free or reduced-cost internet service to students should the district close in case of emergency situations.<\/i><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;icp.dadeschools.net&#x2F;#!&#x2F;fullWidth&#x2F;2943\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;icp.dadeschools.net&#x2F;#!&#x2F;fullWidth&#x2F;2943<\/a><p>Also:<p><i>Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS) is continuing its efforts to provide support to students and their families during school closures, which begin tomorrow, March 16.
