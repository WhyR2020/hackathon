Open up pretty much any article about a complex issue, and you’ll see the pattern. Relevant facts will be combined with irrelevant ones and set in a narrative arc, a story with clearly identified villains and victims. The reader knows what conclusions she is supposed to draw based on how she feels about the villains and victims, as opposed to objective big picture analysis.<p>Take a simple example: Trump’s recent proposed revisions to NEPA, the federal law that requires government entities to perform environmental review of infrastructure projects: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;climate&#x2F;trump-nepa-environment.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;climate&#x2F;trump-nepa-enviro...<\/a>. The whole thing is set within a narrative arc about Trump’s deregulatory agenda, with Trump as the villain. Isolated quotes from individuals are provided, making various assertions. Nowhere is there any analysis of objective facts by which someone could evaluate the proposal. For example, there is no mention of the fact that European countries have environmental review rules even more streamlined than what Trump is proposing. There is no mention of the median environmental review period of transit projects under NEPA (6.7 years), studies that have been done estimating the costs of delaying infrastructure projects (trillions), etc. Nothing to permit objective evaluation, just narrative, victims, and the villain. This is how journalists are taught to write and this is how they do write.<p>Anti-vaxxers and chemo truthers simply engage in a somewhat more extreme version of this reasoning. They likewise ignore the big picture analysis. Chemotherapy, for example, clearly causes harms, but has even greater benefits. There are many studies quantifying those harms relative to the benefits. Instead of looking at that analysis, they elevate the narrative above all else. “Big drug companies,” “western medicine,” etc., are the villains. The narrative is that those greedy players are suppressing natural remedies out of a desire for profit. Within that narrative, a few anecdotes about people getting better without cancer are all it takes to make the narrative plausible.<p>If you read Matt Taibbi’s work, for example, is he so different? He uses “Wall Street” and “big banks” in the same way as these folks use “western medicine.” He constructs a narrative where the entire global banking system, and practices employed by nearly every advanced democracy, are causing harm in the pursuit of profit. The experts are hoodwinking you, but he and a few others have seen through it! Throwing in a few anecdotes of misconduct or bad behavior seals the deal and makes the narrative believable."],"time":["2020-01-11 16:37:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajay_sibri04"],"id":[22020474],"kids":{},"parent":[22019923],"text":["Here&#x27;s something I heard from an Oncologist in the family.<p>&quot;Everyone that gets cancer dies from it eventually.

Also, the last four of one&#x27;s social security number is perhaps the shittiest way to authenticate _ANYTHING_. For many years, a lot of sites online would show you the last four of an account holder&#x27;s SSN (and some places still probably do) if you have an email address, correct name, and phone number or physical address.<p>Getting the account number would likely be even easier thanks to helpful store reps...

But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world&#x27;s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You&#x27;ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.\nThere are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It&#x27;s outrageous and unacceptable.<p>&quot;I agree,&quot; many say, &quot;but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it&#x27;s perfectly legal — there&#x27;s nothing we can do to stop them.&quot; But there is something we can, something that&#x27;s already being done: we can fight back.<p>Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It&#x27;s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn&#x27;t immoral — it&#x27;s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. It&#x27;s time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that&#x27;s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web.

They change their mind after about 100 confirmations from their lawyers, accountants, financers... and just ghost hours after I send it.<p>It has been greatly discouraging to me, as the 3 serious attempts to sell have essentially crushed our momentum, and now the company is dying&#x2F;dead.

I&#x27;ve been on the founder side in convs like this, both real+fake, so some advice I got here that has resonated the most:<p>1. Assume 95+% of inbounds won&#x27;t go through, even if &#x27;serious&#x27;<p>2. Use every ask from the acquirer to get a parallel give: if they&#x27;re serious, they&#x27;ll increasingly show they&#x27;re not the 95% here<p>3. Almost all teams are not emotionally equipped to understand the 95% no-deal thing, unless you&#x27;re say a VP-only company (???). As soon as they hear potential acquirer, it&#x27;s natural to think &quot;maybe 30% chance for one, so 100% across 3-4 inbounds&quot;, not &quot;maybe 5% for just one if we qualify it more.&quot; It&#x27;s hard to do anything if you&#x27;re worrying about your kid&#x27;s college tuition for 6mo wrt to a fragile deal&#x27;s ups and downs that you have little control over.<p>A common path here is to understand indiv employee personal goals, and only bring in the acquirer in front of them, such as for interviews or whatever, only once you&#x27;ve gotten a deal to the 99% point (one of the biggest asks). Baremetrics is going for more transparency afaict, so having someone to help contextualize for both its ~first-time ceo + employees would seem required to avoid morale going through the ringer.<p>4.

They expected battle—perhaps another war—but found only the Mandarin. The irate official left too, and the British took the city, though the Chinese never renounced their claim. Missionaries moved in and built churches and schools, pig farmers from the surrounding hills took plots of land within the walls. There was almost no administrative control, and the city became a slum. Yet whenever the Hong Kong government tried to clear it to turn it into a park—evicting the residents in the process—the Chinese government always stepped in. After all, this tiny rectangle of land was still officially their territory.<\/i><p>Answers a question I&#x27;d had for a while: what was special about this piece of land that made it effectively lawless?"],"time":["2020-01-09 23:21:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ottolin"],"id":[22008314],"kids":[22010779],"parent":[21998799],"text":["I was studying in Kowloon City, the area where Kowloon Walled City is located at.

Think of it like making a smoothie - you add bits of fruit to the drink (the input data), then pulse the blades to blend it up (making the output hash). This change basically runs the blades for 7 seconds instead of 10 seconds each time they add fruit. They cite evidence that the extra 3 seconds aren&#x27;t doing much - once the fruit&#x27;s fully liquid, extra blending doesn&#x27;t help - but I worry that this reduces the security margin. Maybe those extra 3 rounds aren&#x27;t useful against current attacks, but they may be useful against unknown future attacks.<p>The other change they make is to break the input into 1KiB chunks, then hash each chunk independently. Finally, they combine the individual chunk hashes into a single big hash using a binary tree. The benefit is that if you have 4KiB of data, you can use 4-way SIMD instructions to process all four chunks simultaneously. The more data you have, the more parallelism you can unlock, unlike traditional hash functions that process everything sequentially. On the flip side, modern SIMD instructions can handle 2 x 32-bit instructions just as fast as 1 x 64-bit instructions, so building the algorithm out of 32-bit arithmetic doesn&#x27;t cost anything, but gives a big boost to low-end 32-bit CPU&#x27;s that struggle with 64-bit arithmetic.

Taos was an operating system that was coded in VP1, an advanced assembly language that used instructions for an imaginary, idealized RISC CPU. When Taos programs were loaded into memory, the system translated the VP1 opcodes into the equivalent ones for whatever CPU it happened to be running on. Taos could run on an x86, a MIPS, a PowerPC, or a transputer, and many more—or even different combinations running at the same time. Because VP1 instructions were more compact than most CPU’s native opcodes, Taos programs would often load and run faster than native ones, even when you included the time it took to do the translation.

The former have complicated configuration surfaces but change relatively rarely, while the latter are usually much simpler (because microservices) and change daily in many cases.<p>We find helm works very well for the infrastructure pieces. Yes it&#x27;s complicated and easy to get wrong, but so are most other package management systems. Charts for complicated things can be quite dense and hard to comprehend. See the stable prometheus chart for an excellent example. But once the work is done and as long as there is commitment to maintain it the results can be pretty awesome. We use helm charts to install and upgrade prometheus, fluentd, elasticsearch, nginx, etcd and a ton of other tools. Yes we&#x27;ve had to fork some charts because the configuration surface wasn&#x27;t fully exposed, but they are a minority.<p>For our own services charts are overkill. They&#x27;re hard to read, and crufted up with control structures and substitution vars. Essentially all of our microservices are deployments with simple ingress requirements. We currently use kustomize to process base manifests that live in the service repos and combine them with environment-specific patches from config repos. Both are just straight yaml and very easy for backend developers to read and understand, and different groups (i.e. devops, sre, backend dev) can contribute patches to the config repos to control how the services are deployed.<p>Bottom line: if you&#x27;re going all-in on kubernetes, which you really need to do to get the most benefit from it, then you&#x27;re going to need more than one approach to deploying workloads."],"time":["2020-01-10 19:29:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cbushko"],"id":[22017573],"kids":[22018641,22026938,22019011],"parent":[22011251],"text":["I spent about 6 months using helm and made around 20+ charts for the services.<p>In the end we got rid of it and replaced it with Terraform.

I know everyone&#x27;s experience is different, and addiction and alcoholism are genuine diseases that become incredibly physiologically difficult to overcome.<p>But I find it a complicated topic. I&#x27;ve had so many great times drinking - sitting around with friends, late into the night, making real connections, debating things, laughing, and not being in a rush to check my phone or go somewhere else.<p>Yes you can do this stuff without drinking, and we should probably make more of an effort to as a society just to be more inclusive of those who don&#x27;t drink. But in my own experience and own social circles, these kinds of interactions seems to happen less or at least in different ways without drinking. When I&#x27;ve hung out with groups of friends that don&#x27;t drink, maybe they&#x27;ll play a board game, or have a bbq, usually something that&#x27;s a bit more of an activity than just sitting there doing nothing. And then when the activity&#x27;s over people leave. There&#x27;s something kind of unique about sitting around drinking, it can bring such an intense emphasis on the act of just being present and connecting with the people you&#x27;re with.<p>Another aspect is always having somewhere to go. If you&#x27;re out in a big city with friends there&#x27;s basically a limitless number of bars you can go to, with fun and inspiring ambiances. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s really any equivalent without drinking. You can go out to eat but it only lasts an hour or two. Go to coffee shops, but they close at 9 or 10pm.<p>Obviously you can always do all of this stuff and be the person in the group who&#x27;s not drinking, and that&#x27;s totally cool. But once nobody in the group is drinking, the dynamic is a little different. And it&#x27;s frowned upon to go to a bar with a group and not buy any drinks.<p>Anyway, not sure what my point is. I still drink regularly, though now I try to limit it to 2-3 drinks at a time and only 1 or 2 days a week. I don&#x27;t think I have a problem with alcohol, but of course the confusing part about it all is that&#x27;s exactly what someone who has a problem with alcohol would say. Maybe I should stop drinking just to be safe.

I don&#x27;t regret a second of it, but the drinking culture was omnipresent (we did have dry brothers but if you drank you drank).<p>After college I moved back home. I had a few concerning episodes that one could &quot;pass&quot; as a mildly embarassing thing (vomiting after a comedy show once I was home, passing out during a family party). The first time my drinking came to a head was when my then-SO called me at a work retreat and I realized I had consumed about 30 drinks in the past 4 days- I was violently hungover and unable to consume food.<p>Several months later, we broke up, a relative died, and I came into enough money to pay off a significant enough chunk of my loans so that I could move out. During this time my therapist suggested I curb my drinking but I didn&#x27;t really take him all that seriously. Dumb things kept happening- the most prominent event during this period was that I vomited while drunk gaming online with friends. Sometime after this I took my therapist&#x27;s advice to quit drinking for a week. My mind cleared up a lot but I resumed after.<p>Things came to a head when I woke up one day after a day-long bout of drinking (I went to a tailgate and ended up going out to bars later that night). I felt like my liver was going to explode. The worst part was that I had errands to do that day and the entire time I felt like I was going to die.<p>I decided to indefinitely quit drinking. This was over this past November and December, and I had a few holiday parties to go to- I mostly teetotaled at them, but one conversation stuck out to me. A college friend who was older than me told me she had to re-calibrate her drinking life post-grad to function normally.

He had young women and girls around and gave them money in exchange for sexual acts. This is something society doesn&#x27;t like to think about explicitly, but might these young females have actually chosen&#x2F;wanted this? The typical answer is: They were underage and vulnerable therefor anything they did doesn&#x27;t imply consent. That is a very condescending view. The age of legal consent in the US is 16 in many states and as low as 11 under some circumstances! In the charges against him it says:<p>&quot;Once minor victims were recruited, EPSTEIN or his employees or associates would contact victims to schedule appointments for “massages.”  As a result, many victims were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent occasions.&quot;<p>&quot;To further enable him to abuse underage girls, EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform “massages” and similarly engage in sex acts with EPSTEIN.  When a victim would recruit another underage girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash.  Through these victim-recruiters, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit, and gained access to dozens of additional underage girls to abuse.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-sdny&#x2F;pr&#x2F;jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-sdny&#x2F;pr&#x2F;jeffrey-epstein-charged...<\/a><p>These account make it clear to me, that these girls were not helpless victims suffering at the hands of an abuser. That just doesn&#x27;t scale. 100s of girls agreeing to be scheduled again and again (without use of force threat or violence), and to recruit other girls means that it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I know this is something &quot;you can&#x27;t say&quot; hence the throwaway.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there wasn&#x27;t any foul play, or that Epstein was a great guy. Far from it.

In a way treating both these cases as &quot;pedophilic sex offences&quot; is offensive to victims of the latter. My point is that society needs to re-embrace Proportionality.<p>We wrote this man off as pure Evil, so anything he touches must be Evil too. We don&#x27;t allow any positive attribution to his actions. Any money he gives is tainted money only used to launder his reputation. Any person that has ever come into contact with him, let alone had any positive thought about him, is also Evil. Why is accepting donations from him frame the person or organization as endorsing child abuse? Why is having a photo with him, or being at a dinner party with him mark you as suspect?

Interesting closing reflections from the article:<p>... not enough Americans know or care about what happens in other countries or what their government and military is doing in their name. Do many Americans know that there are at least 1000 American military bases around the world, or that there is a fast growing Africa Command branch of the military that is involved in almost every country in Africa? Certain politicians would like to cut “discretionary” spending for such unnecessary things as education, health care, infrastructure, and protecting the environment, but over $1 Trillion a year in allotted to the military, secret intelligence, and “homeland security” in order to continue such unholy activities we have seen for over 100 years.<p>It is telling that such a high profile person like General Butler could give such influential speeches in the ’30’s, and that even a president (who was also a general, perhaps not coincidentally) could warn against the military-industrial complex in 1961. Such a thing has been unimaginable since the Carter presidency. With the possible exception of Bernie Sanders, there are no politicians today brave enough to take on this problem, and certainly none with as high a profile as president. Maybe it’s time for less money in the hands of arms producers and war profiteers. It’s time for less war and weapons in general. Sadly, this means that it must be time for new politicians.

As others have stated , clearly there usually are other areas (easier targets like too much javascript or tracker code crap) to optimize performance than here. But what i find disappointing is that i was under the belief that things like a TLD were merely cosmetic and didn&#x27;t have an impact on underlying performance.  Domain names were supposed to be sticky labels on more important underlying infrastructure. I always thought that choosing a .COM, .NET, .WHATEVER didn&#x27;t matter for delivering digital assets across the internets to one&#x27;s customers&#x2F;users...well, if bunnycdn is onto something, color me surprised, and slightly saddened.<p>I&#x27;ve owned my own {$last_name}.CC domain name, and have used it as the basis for my personal&#x2F;family email for over a decade, and am quite aware of how it has gotten treated at least on the spam front.  Admittedly, I&#x27;ve had very, very minor issues compared to many others who have used other seemingly &quot;non-traditional&quot; TLDs&#x2F;ccTLDs. (I attribute the low issues to having used G Suite for many years. Spam fighting: One of the few good things i like about google.) While the .CC tld was originally based on a country code, it was marketed (and i guessed managed) for many years now as a generic TLD. My friend gave me the idea to use it after he set his domain name up for his then-nascent (ahem) <i>computer consultancy<\/i> ...And, since the .COM, and the .NET versions[0] of my $last_name at the time were not available for me, i went with a nice short and sweet .CC domain. Back then i also felt a mild sense of edginess for using something different than &quot;boring old&quot; .COM, or .NET.  But i never figured there would be DNS&#x2F;nme resolution performance issues...Its just a name resolve process going from some arbitrary text name to ip addresses, etc...why should there be an issue, right?<p>Beyond the admittedly minor spam issues that I&#x27;ve had with using a &quot;non-traditional&quot; TLD, the biggest headache by far is having to educate people that the world has more than just .COM and .NET domain names. Having to emphasize (both verbally spell out, and through bold text or caps while written) that my email address ends in .CC and <i>NOT<\/i> .COM is quite annoying.  After so many years, it still has not lessened much...At least not in the U.S. - where i live and work.  However, strangely&#x2F;unexpectedly, outside the U.S. this issue is vastly less of a thing.  During the last 2 years I&#x27;ve traveled to many parts of the world for my dayjob, and wow, my {$last_name}.CC domain name is pretty much not an issue outside of the U.S.  So this whole time it&#x27;s my own Americans who lack the literacy in this regard.  From my experience, in the minds of typical, layperson Americans there exists only .COM, .NET, .ORG, maybe sometimes .UK...But everything else might as well be .SPAM or .FAKE  ;-)<p>So, after the spam, after all the years of annoyance of emphasizing the spelling of the TLD, and now there could be possible performance issues!?!  Man, this whole domain name thing sucks (to say nothing even of the sleazy business&#x2F;marketing side of the racket).  I mean, weren&#x27;t domain names supposed to make things easier than having to remember arbitrary IP numbers&#x2F;addresses?  I think we need a new method or system.<p>[0] By the way, the .ORG version for my domain name was available years ago, but I wasn&#x27;t a non-profit, so felt i didn&#x27;t want to grab it; happily allowing any true, legitimate non-profit to scoop it up. My mental jury is still out on whether that was a wise decision that i made or not.

You could seed it with a hash url pointer to the root algorithm to employ and a hash url to the data to run against and it could download all of it&#x27;s dependencies then run. I imagine once such a repo was up and running you could do something like a co-routine like call and that entire process just happens in the background either on a separate thread or even scheduled to an entirely different machine in a cluster.

In Unison, the ‘codebase’ is a somewhat abstract concept (unlike other languages where a codebase is a set of files) where you can inject definitions, somewhat similar to a Lisp image.<p>One can think of a program as a graph where every node is a definition and a definition’s content can refer to other definitions. Unison content-addresses each node and aliases the address to a human-readable name.<p>This means you can replace a name with another definition, and since Unison knows the node a human-readable name is aliased to, you can exactly find every name’s use and replace them to another node. In practice I think this means very easy refactoring unlike today’s programming languages where it’s hard to find every use of an identifier.<p>I’m not sure how this can benefit in practical ways, but the concept itself is pretty interesting to see. I would like to see a better way to share a Unison codebase though, as it currently is only shareable in a format that resembles a .git folder (as git also is another CAS).<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unisonweb.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tour\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unisonweb.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tour<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Content-addressable_storage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Content-addressable_storage<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unisonweb&#x2F;quickstart\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unisonweb&#x2F;quickstart<\/a><p>PS: The website is very well made, but I would like to comment that there should be two buttons on the top front page, the tour and installation, as I think most people want to have a glimpse of the PL before installing.\nI, at least was puzzled because I thought the button was a link to an introduction of the language."],"time":["2020-01-10 13:38:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["UglyGenius"],"id":[22011958],"kids":{},"parent":[22009912],"text":["Wondering if Unison was designed as (or ever planned to become) a general-purpose language or it something more domain-specific, e.g. distributed computations."],"time":["2020-01-10 17:12:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["UIZealot"],"id":[22012001],"kids":{},"parent":[22009912],"text":["This is seriously impressive.

But I don&#x27;t think saying everything is &quot;content-addressed&quot; can land as such of a big mic-drop moment when I&#x27;ve never heard the term or the concept in my life and the front page does absolutely nothing to explain it beyond that.<p>------    \nEDIT: My tone here is a little more antagonistic that I meant (proofread kids, don&#x27;t just check for spelling and publish) but my first impression was a kind of &quot;buzzword-y&quot; vibe. I&#x27;ve looked a bit more and the authors seem genuinely passionate about shaking things up and trying something completely different, which I can respect. I&#x27;ll leave it up as is because I still think my issue are legitimate, but the tone is a little off and I apologize.    \n------<p>Let&#x27;s take my discovery path so far as an example:<p>&gt; Functional language: cool cool. I know what that is. Immutable: also cool. Content-addressable: no clue. Saying it&#x27;ll simplify code bases and eliminate dependency and &quot;no builds&quot; is supposed to sound amazing, but it really doesn&#x27;t land when I have no clue what the premise is.<p>&gt; Alright, that&#x27;s it for the front page. No code examples, nothing linking the currently known to this new paradigm-shifting stuff. K. Let&#x27;s try the docs.<p>&gt; The Welcome is the state of the project without saying anything about the language itself. Roadmap isn&#x27;t gonna help Quickstart! Let&#x27;s look there.<p>This amount of effort for discovery isn&#x27;t very helpful for me. I found a selection of talks elsewhere on the site. One of them is labeled &quot;This is a longer (40 min) introduction to the core ideas of Unison and probably the best talk to start with.&quot; That might be a nice link for the front page.<p>I unfortunately don&#x27;t have anymore time to look at this this morning, but the first 5 or so minutes of the talk say waaaaaaaaay more than the first however long I spent. Honestly, I think all of that information (code examples, linking core ideas to what we already know, basis of comparison) could be on the front page.<p>The tl:dr I can glean from it is:<p>It&#x27;s kinda like Haskell, but every definition is turned into AST and put in a hash table. Any references are secretly references to the table, so changing a definition is making a new hash and changing the reference, and renaming is changing the reference to name table.<p>Also, everything is append instead of rewrite, which makes all kinds of stuff cleaner, like versioning and refactoring.<p>Pretty neat idea, I just don&#x27;t really like how long it took me to come to that knowledge. I don&#x27;t know how well it would scale or be usable in a real world scenario, but I also have never used Haskell or any functional language in a &quot;real world&quot; scenario so I&#x27;m not the best one to ask."],"time":["2020-01-10 13:04:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Vlad_Zamfor"],"id":[22010733],"kids":[22010737],"parent":[22009912],"text":["&gt;&gt;code is content-addressed and immutable.<p>No, as I keep insistently repeating: Code is content-immutable and addressed.<p>Also, Urbit is a lie, Surface detail is true and you are a lie and your code is retarted."],"time":["2020-01-10 14:23:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stef-13013"],"id":[22010852],"kids":[22011111],"parent":[22009912],"text":["The language of the month...

I just returned it and got a Novosbed for half the price and it was way better so I’m pretty glad it turned out that way. Keep in mind that Casper can’t sell a return so they have to donate it. The whole return was a mess to deal with as well. Glad they lost money on the return even if they get to write some of the donation off.<p>Guess my point is that I don’t think Casper treats their customers well.

(I don&#x27;t know about libxsmm on current AMD hardware, but it&#x27;s free software you can work on if necessary, like AMD have done with BLIS.)
