All I knew was that I&#x27;m a programmer that&#x27;s terrible at design I thought this might be useful for me in someway although I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what this site was.<p>Not knowing what &quot;open-source design&quot; meant, I visited the site and clicked the first design. I ended up on a page asking me to pay $60 for something. I closed to tab. I was really confused. Only after reading the comments here did I realize I must have done something wrong.Then I realized the first &quot;design&quot; isn&#x27;t a design, it was a native ad. It looks like the designs but says ad instead of having a yellow gem.  If I had just stumbled across this some other way and had the experience I would have closed the tab and never thought about it again. Sites that trick users into clicking ads are a red flag for me.<p>Ok, so I clicked another design that had a yellow gem. All it did was give me a blown up image of the thumbnail. I still wanted to know what the open source design actually was. I almost clicked something off to the right thinking it would be a preview or something. Before I did though I realized it was another ad. It wasn&#x27;t even labeled though like the one on the main page.<p>The only thing left to do was click &quot;download&quot;. I hovered over it to see what kind of file I was downloading. It didn&#x27;t say since it&#x27;s a button and not a link. So I clicked it. It was a &quot;.sketch&quot; file. Arggh! I knew that sketch was a Mac App and not open source. I don&#x27;t have a Mac and I&#x27;m not using proprietary software unless I absolutely have to.<p>I went the the front page again because I realized that I must have missed something. I didn&#x27;t see that these were sketch downloads. Then I discovered there are multiple formats you could filter by. The front page just happened to have only all Sketch format ones visible at the moment. I guess I was just supposed to know the logo was for Sketch. I assumed the yellow gem meant that it was actually a design and not an ad.<p>I had a hunch that the rest of the formats were proprietary to so I looked them up (by extension since the names of the apps are not mentioned anywhere, not even as title text on the images like they should be for accessibility). Yep, they where. It was at this point I closed the tab for good. My definition of open source is different from yours. If you can&#x27;t open an open source file with open source software or if the file format is proprietary it&#x27;s not open source IMO.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean for that to be such a long rant. I&#x27;m sure your web site will be useful to a lot of other people. It would be nice if the people it&#x27;s not useful for could determine that up front. Not knowing all the product logos, it was pretty much impossible for me to determine what your site was for without wasting time clicking around. You did trick me into clicking an so mention accomplished I guess.

So, of course, we do indeed see them attacking both Trump (and his racist&#x2F;hyper-capitalist&#x2F;misc-other-stereotype supporters) and the DNC&#x2F;Biden.  Nothing strange yet.<p>But here&#x27;s the weird thing: being a political junkie, I have been interacting (primarily on Reddit) with Democrats supporters now and then over the last several weeks&#x2F;months.  In near every single conversation, there is this unmistakable, uncanny pattern in the discussions, where it <i>seems<\/i> like these people are so blinded by rage, that they <i>literally can&#x27;t fathom<\/i> the idea that a person could hold my stance.  Or even that a single Trump supporter could hold any belief that does not <i>perfectly<\/i> line up with the stereotypes of what a Trump supporter &quot;is&quot;.  Like, it&#x27;s not like you have a back and forth with them and then they decide &quot;you know what, I think you&#x27;re lying&quot;, but they just <i>cannot<\/i> believe, as if they have lost control of their conscious mind and free will, like there is some sort of a cognitive malfunction.  Essentially, a real world actual manifestation of the NPC meme.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NPC_(meme)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NPC_(meme)<\/a><p>&gt; NPC, derived from Non-Player Character in video games, is an meme to express the idea that individuals of the political left do not think for themselves; it is also known as NPC Wojak.  The NPC meme, which graphically is based on the Wojak meme, was created in July 2016 by an anonymous author and first published on the image-hosting website 4chan, where also the idea and inspiration behind the meme were introduced. The NPC meme has gained widespread attention and been featured in numerous news outlets, including The New York Times,[4] The Verge,[3] BBC,[7] and Breitbart News Network. Media coverage of the NPC meme has been politically biased according to the news watchdogs Accuracy In Media[8] and Media Research Center.[9]<p>Now, the average person is not very good at rational thinking.  So, one should expect a fair amount of this behavior, especially under the stress of modern day politics.  No problemo.  But my issue is that firstly, this scenario isn&#x27;t really all that complicated (is it?), and more importantly, this behavior seems to occur <i>in at least 90% of my interactions<\/i>.  I can understand <i>a lot<\/i> of people being dumb, <i>but almost all of them<\/i>? (I should also note:  I&#x27;m not taking only my personal conversations into account here, much of my confidence level derives from observing similar behavior in the conversations of others).<p>Which leads me to my question:  what are the odds that there is some entity out there that happens to posses &quot;AI chat&quot; technology that is way beyond what is considered to be the current state of the art (like how the NSA is reputed to be &lt;x&gt; years ahead), and that this technology is now in the wild?  It seems like an outlandish theory, but on a technical basis, is it really that far out there?<p>I suppose I should note two other explanations that come to mind:<p>- rather than bots, these entities could just be paid trolls (with the sums of money thrown around in an election, this could be done at very significant scale)<p>- if a given ~environment can invoke ~insanity in one person, it may also be able to invoke the same thing in millions of people simultaneously; but the problem with this is, could it reach 90% levels?  Although, Redditors are not a representative sample, so it would only have to make that subset crazy, which seems much more plausible.<p>Anyways, this question has been on my mind for a while so thought I&#x27;d just throw it out there and see what others think.<p>EDIT: Thinking a bit more about it: &quot;90% of Redditors are literally incapable of high-skilled rational thought&quot; actually feels about right, so maybe nothing nefarious is afoot.  Although, I&#x27;m not sure which of these is the scarier scenario.  And if it&#x27;s both (which it actually kinda is, with respect to fake news), God help us all.  So perhaps I&#x27;ve answered my own question, but would really like to hear what others think.  The degradation in the quality of thinking and discourse in the Western world is beyond out of control in my opinion, and I am legit worried that if some sensible special interest groups outside the formal political process don&#x27;t set aside their differences and unify to set us back on the right path, I actually think tyranny (the serious kind) may be inevitable.  One year ago I would have dismissed such claims as hyperbolic, but considering planet earth is currently on a near total lockdown due to a literal global pandemic, that could have <i>easily<\/i> (at least relatively speaking) been prevented&#x2F;managed, I think erring on the side of extreme caution is warranted.  The next event could end industrialized human civilization, and I almost feel like I am the only person that seems concerned about the mass psychology aspect of it.

It is kind of a parallel universe to normal C++ - lots of ideas in it predate their STL equivalents, and some have yet to make it to the outside world.  Some ideas just went off in different directions.  Shared pointers are one of the latter.  I no longer recall the exact name of the type, but Office shared pointers are intrusive - your interface inherits from `IMsoSharedRef&lt;IMyInterface&gt;` or something like that, and your concrete types would in turn inherit `SharedRef` or whatever.<p>There are a number of really interesting aspects to this family of types, but the one that&#x27;s relevant here is that it handles situations like this very gracefully.  If you want to pass your shared object to a function that won&#x27;t take ownership (shared or otherwise), it&#x27;s simple - the type just decays into a raw pointer.  So your function can be<p><pre><code>    DoSomethingWithFoo(IFoo* theFoo);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nand you can call it with your smart pointer<p><pre><code>   ISharedRef&lt;IFoo&gt; myFoo = Mso::Make&lt;IFoo&gt;(...);\n   DoSomethingWithFoo(myFoo);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis is of course a double-edged sword because you have to know that your callee won&#x27;t try to hang on to that pointer.

To make a variable mutable, you need to write &quot;let mut&quot;, which takes more effort. By contrast, C&#x2F;C++ variables are mutable by default, but made immutable by adding &quot;const&quot;. So in Rust, the safer behavior takes less code.<p>* The Rust compiler checks for mutable variables that don&#x27;t need to be mutable (e.g. never reassigned, never calling any mutable method), and gives you warning messages to nudge you to remove the unnecessary &quot;mut&quot;. I don&#x27;t recall C&#x2F;C++ compilers offering this help."],"time":["2020-03-27 04:47:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cgrealy"],"id":[22698868],"kids":[22699182],"parent":[22696362],"text":["The code smell here is the use of shared_ptr.<p>Yes, there are times when it&#x27;s the least bad option, but using a shared_ptr is the C++ equivalent of throwing your hands up and going &quot;screw it, I have no idea who&#x27;s supposed to own this&quot;."],"time":["2020-03-26 23:59:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bradford"],"id":[22698291],"kids":{},"parent":[22696362],"text":["I know that it&#x27;s a bit dated with respect to modern c++, and it&#x27;s also a partial rant, but when coming across such articles I get a chuckle from yosefk&#x27;s C++ FQA:<p>What is &quot;const correctness&quot;?(<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yosefk.com&#x2F;c++fqa&#x2F;const.html#fqa-18.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yosefk.com&#x2F;c++fqa&#x2F;const.html#fqa-18.1<\/a>)<p>Should I try to get things const correct &quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot;?

We’re accelerating opening a new warehouse in Houston that was due a few months later. We’re taking some of our warehouses in the state and transitioning them over to serving just meat, because we’re seeing such significant demand for meat, poultry, and eggs. We’re still having a real hard time sourcing eggs. We had big loads in the last few days, and they’ve been scooped up as soon as they hit the shelves, so we’re working very hard with egg suppliers to see where we can get additional eggs. But our meat plant is running 24&#x2F;7—we have our own meat plants here. They normally don’t go 24&#x2F;7, but we’ve focused them down to serving the top fifty items out of our meat plants; they normally carry several hundreds.

And if they are prepared, and IF anything <i>approaching<\/i> NYC scale problems happens in their area, there is a better chance they will help rather than hinder efforts to flatten the curve.<p>Please don&#x27;t dismiss what is happening here as anecdote or irrelevant. Believe me, I&#x27;m no better than you, I did this too, when this was &quot;just&quot; in Wuhan, or &quot;just&quot; in China, or &quot;just&quot; in Italy. I took a trip at the end of February in the U.S. on an airplane. I look back -- what was I thinking?! Now I&#x27;m locked in my apartment going on three weeks. My wife had a fever for 6 hours a little over a week ago, she&#x27;s been coughing. Probably we&#x27;re ok. But it&#x27;s in the back of your head: What if I get sick, and she gets worse, who will take care of our kids? What if they close the stores and we can&#x27;t get groceries?<p>I wish some of the anecdotes had reached me earlier.

It&#x27;s mind-blowing.&quot;<\/i><p>Historically, when sexually transmitted disease outbreaks occurred in the US, social workers would ask for the names of everyone you had slept with if you were infected and they would contact them and screen them and treat them. This was effective in stopping outbreaks.<p>We largely abandoned this approach after AIDS became a thing. In the US, AIDS was mostly a disease of IV drug users and gay men, both of whom were highly stigmatized populations. They understandably did not wish to give up the names of people they had slept with (or shared needles with).<p>Although I think we got a lot of human rights gains out of the battle to protect those populations, the downside is that we largely abandoned a proven method for putting a stop to disease outbreaks. Instead, we now default to trying to find drugs and vaccines rather than trying to stop the spread via &quot;social&quot; means (for lack of a better word).<p>There is a book called <i>The Hot Zone<\/i> that similarly describes non-medical&#x2F;social interventions that helped stop the spread of Ebola. Among other things, tribal elders in Africa blockaded the roads so outsiders couldn&#x27;t come in, they told their people &quot;Don&#x27;t go to the white man&#x27;s hospital&quot; because you go with a broken leg and die of Ebola and they began quarantining the sick.<p>You were forbidden from leaving your hut. They would leave food on your front doorstep for you to provide for you. If it sat there for three days in a row untouched, they burned the hut down without going in to check if you were still alive.<p>We are currently focusing a lot on ventilators. I&#x27;ve seen numerous articles on ventilators on HN and there are numerous projects trying to develop open source ventilators. Meanwhile, we are apparently largely overlooking noninvasive lung clearance techniques that can help with less extreme cases and may help prevent them from becoming such.<p>In human history, epidemics tend to mostly get stopped with non-medical interventions. Yes, I know, there are states under lock down. I&#x27;m in one of them.<p>But I feel I am seeing inadequate emphasis on prevention, changes in lifestyle, promotion of remote work as a solution, non-medical home care options so fewer people end up at the overwhelmed hospitals where care is getting rationed etc.<p>I have been saying for some days now that high use of ventilators will promote a rash of antibiotic resistant secondary infections. There has been at least one article posted to HN that suggested that antibiotic resistant infections may be a factor in the high death rate in Italy.<p>I think we can do better. I think that&#x27;s not going to happen as long as we continue to worship medical intervention as the answer here.<p>I think lifestyle and procedural changes are needed. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and prevention doesn&#x27;t require you to see a medical professional or get prescribed anything, yet everyone acts like either that&#x27;s not going to be effective or it is too objectionable to embrace or making suggestions of that sort amounts to practicing medicine without a license.<p>-----<p>Previous comment about the history of AIDS in the US: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22658583\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22658583<\/a><p>PDF version of <i>The Hot Zone<\/i>: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projectavalon.net&#x2F;THE_HOT_ZONE_Richard_Preston.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projectavalon.net&#x2F;THE_HOT_ZONE_Richard_Preston.pdf<\/a><p>Previous comments by me about about air clearance techniques and ventilators: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22651884\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22651884<\/a><p>To the people inclined to harass me and threaten to sic the mods on me for commenting here, the mods appear to be well aware of my comments and have already asked someone to please cease and desist harassing me: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22660362\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22660362<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-26 16:15:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["noads"],"id":[22694075],"kids":[22695602,22694322],"parent":[22693320],"text":["All the emergency managers did a great job posting videos and FAQs, which are completely useless now.

Since then I&#x27;ve been thinking a little bit about MathML and how compilers from other more input-friendly formats to MathML might encourage wider adoption. So I&#x27;m excited to see this library.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of AsciiMath before but hadn&#x27;t ever had a chance to play with it, so I appreciated the live demo on the project website. One thing I noticed is that AsciiMath uses whitespace around operators to determine binding order.<p>For example (AsciiMath on left, TeX on right)<p><pre><code>    f(x) = x+1 &#x2F; 2    =    f(x) = \\frac{x + 1}{2}\n    f(x) = x + 1&#x2F;2    =    f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhen there&#x27;s equal spacing around neighboring operators, normal order of operations seems to apply.<p>This seems fairly intuitive, but might not scale to large, complex equations as well as TeX&#x27;s bracket syntax does. Nonetheless, I think I like it for simple equations.<p>Question for the author: you mention on the page that Mathup supports an input language inspired by AsciiMath [2]. What are the differences? Does Mathup accept a subset of AsciiMath, or are there cases where the syntax diverges? And if the latter is the case, what motivated devaiting from AsciiMath&#x27;s syntax?<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22582343\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22582343<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19347737\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19347737<\/a><p>[2]: There&#x27;s a typo in this phrase on your page, BTW: &quot;insipired&quot; has an extra &quot;i&quot;"],"time":["2020-03-26 21:43:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mirekrusin"],"id":[22697229],"kids":[22697284],"parent":[22694695],"text":["Loading library fails on the page and the whole project looks like april&#x27;s fools day joke, ie. the whole library being an identity function."],"time":["2020-03-26 20:51:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sz4kerto"],"id":[22692195],"kids":[22692284,22692263],"parent":[22691926],"text":["This is a bit like the financial crisis in 2008.<p>In 2008, the idea was that if you bundle up a large bunch of mortgages, then the bundle will have low risk because the chances of everything failing at the same time is low.

That’s no longer the case.<p>Wearing a mask of any sort reduces the risk of infection. That’s why hospitals need PPE and are even resorting to using lower-grade protection (e.g surgical masks instead of n95) due to lack of supplies. CDC is even recommending scarves as a last resort. They’re also reusing masks and wearing them for longer than they should. These are all signs that _any_ mask can provide some benefit.<p>Furthermore, it’s been well cited that wearing masks does more to protect others from the wearer than vice versa. Given that its possible to be an asymptomatic carrier, you should wear a mask to avoid spreading the virus unknowingly.<p>Obviously, full PPE should go to healthcare and other critical needs right now due to shortage. That doesn’t mean the rest of us shouldn’t wear masks, just that we shouldn’t selfishly hoard a bunch of n95s. I’ll bet lots of Californians have leftover masks from the wildfires that they could use.<p>My take is that reserving proper PPE for health workers until the crisis peaks is critical.

That might not be a huge problem on its own, but it seems to give them an excuse to risk compensate. And that’s a huge problem.<p>If you plop on an N95 mask, it’s not going to work as intended. Sure, it might block some stuff and discourage you from touching your face, but it’s certainly not going to make you invincible. Even when fitted correctly, it’s still letting stuff through.  If you have to choose between staying home vs. gathering in a group while wearing a mask, one is obviously lower risk than the other.<p>N95 masks are uncomfortable. When used correctly, you feel like you’re breathing hot, humid air that you just exhaled.  They clamp down pretty tightly on your nose.<p>People don’t like this, so they adjust the mask until it’s comfortable (or just don’t fit it in the first place)—and in this case, comfort = leak. Or they get a mask with an exhaust vent—which might protect the wearer reasonably well, but now everything they exhale exits the mask unfiltered.  Or—and this is my favorite one—they put the mask on over sunglasses to keep it from sitting on the bridge of their nose, then wonder why their glasses fog up.<p>Or perhaps they have facial hair that they don’t want to shave. For the seal to work, the part making contact with your face needs to be clean-shaven.<p>And you can’t make your own N95 mask from scratch. They’re not simple cloth; that’s why they’re expensive and hard to produce.<p>Again, none of this would be terrible if people didn’t risk compensate. Wearing any mask—even incorrectly—is probably better than no mask, as long as you didn’t cut up a fiberglass HEPA filter in the process. Wearing a mask to get some groceries or pick up a prescription? Great! At the very least, it’ll keep you from touching your face. But wearing a mask so you can throw a party is a terrible idea.<p>I’m mostly targeting N95 masks here since they’re not as easy to use as surgical masks, but the same general rule applies to everything: masks are an extra tool in your arsenal; another layer of protection.

I did a bit of research and found multiple articles claiming masks DO work.<p>These sources acknowledge that masks are a contentious point and that some experts disagree with the part of the articles I am quoting below. Even the CDC recommends against members of the public using respirators without specific risk factors (having Covid, or treating someone with Covid). The CDC wants to prevent hoarding, as they should.<p>But many sources claim that a homemade mask from a spare vacuum bag or dish rag makes you a bit safer (2-5x safer than nothing), and I&#x27;m going to make one for myself and use it when going out. From the overall body of evidence, I believe that masks are substantially better than nothing, and a social norm of everyone wearing masks would lower Covid transmission. If you disagree provide sources and reasons.<p>&gt;Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).[0]<p>&gt;The public doesn&#x27;t need to wear heavy-duty respirators, but it&#x27;s a smart idea to don a face mask or wrap a clean scarf around your nose and mouth if you&#x27;re going into a crowded place during the COVID-19 outbreak, an infectious disease doctor told Live Science.[1]<p>Even the CDC agrees that &quot;The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes.  Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.&quot; [2]<p>Other articles agree that sick people wearing face masks helps prevent them spreading to others, e.g., [3]<p>I have read sources that Covid19 can be transmitted even if you have no symptoms.  So if everyone wears face masks, then everyone who is infected with no symptoms will have a reduced chance of transmitting the virus.

I think the hardest thing to adjust to is patchsets being sent over email. But when you think about it that is the way git is supposed to work. It keeps version control decentralized. Drew DeVault has also created a site git-email.io I believe to help new users with the process. He has also either implemented or is implementing a good web interface to sit on top of patchsets.<p>It is nice knowing that your data is actually protected and private because Drew is very public about his ideals.<p>One of the cooler features I think is the site runs without JavaScript entirely, unless you need to pay for the first time, which uses Stripe, but even then Drew allows for alternative methods of payments including walking up to him at FOSDEM and giving him a check.<p>The communication of the service to its users is actually really nice. You get monthly updates regarding development, and quarterly updates which I will are similar to like state of the union addresses, where Drew will talk about the financial situation in detail, including a line item receipt of expenses like new hardware and salaries. Drew used to put his own salary down, but since Simon Ser was hired to work for SourceHut, Drew has chosen to protect Simon&#x27;s salary and reports salary payouts in totality.<p>The performance is also a big bonus. Consistently you will find that SourceHut just outperforms GitHub and GitLab on SSH operations. Now this might have a lot to do with the amount of users who use the site, but if you watch the dev mailing list, performance is a top priority. And it is funny watching Drew complain about Python on Mastodon every once in a while.<p>As far as self-hosting, the documentation seems fairly straightforward. You can pick and choose the services you want, so unlike other options where its all or nothing you can cater to your needs. You can also just move to SourceHut incrementally. Some projects use lists.sr.ht but keep code elsewhere. Some use git.sr.ht, but run CI on Travis. Some use the github.com, but use builds.sr.ht. Any combination is possible.<p>I definitely recommend using the service. Later this year the service will be in beta, and there are some good features coming right around the corner including names.sr.ht and hub.sr.ht.<p>Important note that at least during the alpha you can use the entire site for free. Pricing is a pay what you want scale (for sr.ht, there are 3 options), but you get all the features."],"time":["2020-03-26 21:21:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stratosgear"],"id":[22694278],"kids":[22694751],"parent":[22693941],"text":["I hate to be that guy, but have you given it a try?"],"time":["2020-03-26 16:11:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["timvisee"],"id":[22694798],"kids":[22696178],"parent":[22693941],"text":["You should give it a try.<p>When comparing it to Git{Hub,Lab}, it misses an issue board, pull requests and many other features in favor of different approaches.

With UA,all versions of a client have the same exact detail and most people need an extension to change it, so it makes it much less easy to finger print.<p>This is the same ol sneaky bait and switch Google pulls.
