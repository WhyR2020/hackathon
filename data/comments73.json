I feel that people don&#x27;t take racism against Asian-Americans as seriously as racism against other groups.<p>Here&#x27;s more about me. Like many people on HN, I&#x27;m a programmer. I&#x27;m interested in functional programming, programming language theory, and type theory. These interests caused me to discover pure math (such as category theory), and although I do not know as much about math than about programming, I want to learn more because I find these ideas elegant and beautiful. (For example, the Curry-Howard correspondence, which links programming to logic through the idea that programs are proofs, or HoTT, which gives types higher-dimensional structure based on the idea that equality types are the isomorphisms of an infinity-groupoid.)<p>I applied as a CS major to several colleges where PL theory had an academic presence, and in my supplemental essays, I discussed my interests and my desire to work with professors and do undergraduate research. I have competitive stats. Although other kids in my school got into my &quot;reaches&quot; (e.g. Cornell), I got rejected, but luckily I got into some &quot;match&quot; schools that did PL theory.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say if affirmative action made a difference. Maybe if my application were exactly the same, but I weren&#x27;t Asian, I would have gotten in, and if my application were the same except that I got an A instead of a B+ in a class, I would also have gotten in. I got waitlisted from some highly competitive schools, so I could have been on the edge. A big part of me not knowing how much my race would have made a difference is how non-transparent college admissions are. It&#x27;s left up to some nebulous idea of &quot;fit&quot; decided by a group of people sitting at a table, who only have a few minutes to spend on each applicant.<p>But, what bothers me is the stereotypes. They&#x27;ve turned liking math and CS into a bad thing, at least when it&#x27;s an Asian kid who&#x27;s doing it. People defend affirmative action by saying that there are simply too many highly competitive Asian kids who want to study computer science. So, if I want to go to a good school, I shouldn&#x27;t study computer science, even though that&#x27;s what I want to do, just because of the way I was born? Among non-CS people, CS is probably seen as the stereotype track to get a high-paying job (and cynically, perhaps it&#x27;s a popular major for this reason), but hopefully on a site such as HN, people will be more empathetic to the appeal of CS.<p>I&#x27;m also frustrated because most people probably don&#x27;t know how math really is like. People just see it as nerdy word problems, and they&#x27;ve never heard of ideas like constructive math, programs-as-proofs, Cartesian closed categories, etc that I&#x27;ve become so intimate with. Why is it bad that I love math? Shouldn&#x27;t you encourage me to learn this? I guess it&#x27;s similar to the old stereotype of the &quot;nerd&quot; with no social skills, except with a racial element now.<p>It&#x27;s a Catch-22 because people hold Asians to a higher standard, so we need to get higher grades and test scores to be competitive, then that feeds back into the stereotype that we are overly studious and have no personality. There is no winning for us in this game. Isn&#x27;t it an objectively good thing to do well in school? If it were someone who weren&#x27;t Asian, people would see high scores and grades as a positive thing or even cheer it on as a sign of increasing equality. Like all competitive high schoolers (of all races), we must play the game of having loads of AP classes, etc, but people specifically see Asians doing this as a negative stereotype.<p>But, on the front of us studying too much and not having personality, if you play an instrument, people will assume that you&#x27;re doing it because your parents made you, or because of college admissions. Music is truly a beautiful thing and I experienced just how heartfelt it can be. (Sidenote: Watch Hibike! Euphonium or Your Lie in April!) But, just like the universal language of math, people have somehow turned Asians practicing the universal language of music into a bad thing. I can&#x27;t imagine stronger proof of not being a robot, of being human, than experiencing how music can move you.<p>I implore you, in the meritocratic tradition of the hacker culture, to speak out against affirmative action and support Asian kids who want to pursue these passions.<p>EDIT: In fact, &quot;affirmative action&quot; is a euphemism. It&#x27;s a vague-sounding term (an action that affirms something?) because people don&#x27;t want to say &quot;racial discrimination.&quot; Words have power to influence people, so I should start calling it what it is."],"time":["2020-04-25 05:15:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xiaolingxiao"],"id":[22975132],"kids":[22976208,22976687,22977293,22976334,22975164,22975139],"parent":[22974585],"text":["This is typical, Harvard did it for Jews back when they were discriminated against.

Balance this with the sum total of all educational investment individually by their parents&#x2F;teachers&#x2F;schools, and also the collective investment in their peers and across all schools. It’s one thing to know someone is a good applicant. But if we argue that this is a meritocratic system that also accounts for inequality of opportunity, we should do more to articulate what it means to be a good student.<p>What does it mean to be a good student versus a potentially good student? How do you tell the difference between a good student with test anxiety, an average student who tests well, and a below average student who has been tutored to compensate for their lack of discernment? How do you compare a good student in a severely disadvantaged intellectual and&#x2F;or economic environment with a student who rates the same on educational attainment as the prior student, but lacks meaningful barriers to learning?<p>Differences and advantages in stimuli and investment in intellectual activity exist in continuum that isn’t just what happens at school or at home but also what happens in the hands and minds of students. It also touches on funding of public schools, and how that funding is levied mainly by local municipal and county property taxes with federal and state contributions. This reliance on local tax base creates intellectual deserts in many of the same places you find food deserts. For a fair system to be possible, we have to have a conversation about goals in admissions process and what is fair and what is unfair in the current system to inform us about what a fairer system might look like.<p>If college admissions is a measure of success, the measure should not be the target and be gamed by those with power and influence to do so. There must be some accounting for this disparity in opportunity for the student and their representatives to game the system. It’s fine to have a legacy system but I see it as opening the door to this kind of anti-meritocratic  behavior by students, their families, their schools and counselors, and especially by the colleges and universities they apply to.<p>In order to know how good an individual is we need to know both how big a fish they are, and how big the pond is. But we can’t stop there. We need to know how much food they ate and how much energy they expended to get it. Would they have done better in a different pond? Possibly. Should they have done better considering how much opportunity they and their peers had? Also a question we should be able to answer.

If you are an individual given a situation, all things else considered equal (attractiveness, intelligence, parenting, culture, neighborhood, familial wealth, etc), being Asian will give you a harder time than any other racial&#x2F;ethnic characteristic in terms of pursuing a good life. That doesn&#x27;t mean that Asians as a collective will net worse results than black people as a collective, because collectively, parenting, culture, neighborhoods, familial wealth, etc, are not at all comparable between those groups. But if you are the same exact individual with the same exact circumstances, and you could choose to be black or Asian, you would be better off choosing to be black.<p>You want to get into a good school? Diversity programs and affirmative action, above board, use the basis of your race to actively advantage you in your admittance if you are black, and do the exact opposite if you are Asian. Quotas for racial makeups almost always necessarily and uniquely disadvantage Asians. Because of being so overrepresented in achievements relative to their makeup of the population, any quota that goes off of anything other than their meritorious accomplishments necessarily puts an arbitrary scarcity on available opportunities for them.<p>You want to get a good job? Sure, you might find certain employers in particular regions that may be discriminatory on the basis of race to black individuals. But large, highly desirable companies nearly unilaterally have diversity hiring practices that likewise greatly advantage black individuals relative to those who would otherwise hold comparable characteristics to individuals from other populations. YouTube famously had reports from their hiring department that a hold was issued on the hiring of white and Asian individuals for the remainder of some time period in order to ensure that diversity quotas were satisfied. Being Asian in a &quot;sea of hyper-qualified Asian applicants&quot; _is_ a distinct disadvantage, and the degree of competence needed to stand out from a group that is already associated with high achievement is uniquely unfair.<p>What about dating? I have worked in this space. Every dating app shows the same thing: Asian men and black women are the least desirable groups for getting responses or being sought after, by quite a bit. I have worked in this space, and what is admittedly anecdotal, I have heard &quot;I&#x27;m just not attracted to Asian guys,&quot; on many occasions. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any taboo in this particular area, it doesn&#x27;t seem to imply closed-mindedness. I have _never_, _ever_, heard somebody say &quot;I&#x27;m just not attracted to black guys,&quot; in my personal or professional life. I believe that this would be met with a great deal of social pushback. There seems to be a willingness for people to say things about Asians that is just not felt in other ethnic groups, and it possibly stems from this idea that it&#x27;s safe to be &quot;punching up.&quot;<p>Lastly I just think there is a general cultural obsession with racial injustices which completely casts Asians aside due to their collective competencies. Think of all of the hullabaloo regarding the fact that there isn&#x27;t enough black representation in the Academy Awards, regardless of (last I checked) the makeup of Oscars in the last few decades has been about 10% awarded to black individuals, which is about what their 13% of the population in the US would lead you to expect. Asian actors? Something on the order of 4. Nobody cares.<p>I&#x27;m not Asian. I hate racial politics, but I just find it particularly absurd that Asians are ostensibly cast aside in this game when they strike me as having the most to complain about. Most other cases of supposed injustice stem from people comparing the outcomes of two racial populations, and subsequently stipulating that the differences must be due to racism.

I can&#x27;t do many of them, but reading the problem statements is usually enough to make me realize I don&#x27;t understand something.<p>When I started learning crypto, I spent a lot of time reading A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra [1] another free, high-quality book by Shoup.

I emailed professor Shoup, but he said it may not be a good idea because people would copy my solutions for their homework. It turns out he&#x27;s right. The blog posts that I published still get hit from time to time, and the search keyword is always solutions for NTB [2] =).<p>Later on, I took CS255 [3] from Boneh. I had to pay for it myself.

I felt like I was part of this amazing history. There&#x27;s a stream of knowledge flowing through me and maybe one day I&#x27;d discover something cool.<p>Boneh is simply the best teacher.

A lot of our development patterns were born of seeds planted in the 1950s during an era when the nuclear family -- with a male breadwinner, female homemaker and 2.5 kids -- was the assumed standard basic &quot;economic unit&quot; and one male breadwinner provided adequate money, healthcare benefits, etc for multiple other people.<p>Suburbs grew out of the idea of a separation of the public and private spheres. Please note the assumption there is that it separates them for the male breadwinner.<p>The female homemaker de facto worked at home. Most <i>women&#x27;s work<\/i> -- cooking, cleaning, raising kids -- is done at home and is generally not assumed to be anything like paid work that needs to be regulated as a profession. Yet it is essential work, critical to the health, welfare and productivity of the world.<p>With people living longer, marrying later, having fewer children, living many years after the kids grow up and move out, etc. this model breaks down. As the world has generally moved more towards two-earner couples, a house in the suburbs has gradually turned into a nightmare we don&#x27;t know how to escape because, at least in the US, it&#x27;s our default assumption for a good home looks like and most of our financing and tax benefits etc are aimed at that type of home, so it is a large share of our good housing stock. Attempts to find alternatives, such the Tiny House movement, have largely not worked all that well.<p>We need to re-envision our social fabric. This baked-in, unstated assumption that most people are part of a nuclear family with multiple children and one partner doesn&#x27;t need a full-time paid job is very much out of date. It&#x27;s mostly no longer true and, unsurprisingly, the built environment we created to accommodate that lifestyle works rather poorly for all too many people today.<p>So that&#x27;s where we need to start. And it is very much bound up with car ownership and car use because the single family detached house in the suburbs assumes you have a car and assumes a family of five only needs one car.<p>When mom and dad both work and the neighborhood has a dearth of children for your only child to play with, the social fabric that lived when I was a child in a neighborhood full of kids cease to exist and the road are congested and people are both time stressed and financially stressed.<p>This is the crux of a lot of the problems with the world today. We built a world for the parents of the Baby Boomers, in essence, and we haven&#x27;t updated it.

This problem domain naturally fits into a shape like this:<p><pre><code>  What should I eat tonight?\n\n  | Option x Factor   | Effort | Taste | Biosafety || SCORE |\n  | Factor weitht     |      2 |     3 |         4 ||       |\n  |-------------------|--- ----|-------|-----------||-------|\n  | Turkey sandwich   |      3 |     2 |         3 ||    24 |\n  | Pizza (delivery)  |      4 |     4 |         1 ||    24 |\n  | Pizza (homemade)  |      1 |     2 |         4 ||    27 |\n  | Chicken soup      |      2 |     3 |         4 ||    29 | &lt; PICK ME\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA spreadsheet interface would make this tool <i>much<\/i> more convenient, and offers plenty of opportunities for futzing with UI (color coding, sliders for input, whatnot).<p>Something I think you should consider for version 2.0 or as an alternative to test out.

According to Wikipedia, this extension isn’t an acronym for “resource configuration” or “runtime configuration” but comes from a command called RUNCOM.<p>RUNCOM was created by Louis Pouzin for the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), which was one of the first time-sharing operating systems. RUNCOM was used to execute a series of commands in succession—a precursor to what we now call a shell script.<p>He is even credited with coining the term shell, as he describes in a post on the Internet from 2000 on the origins of the shell:<p>&#x27;After having written dozens of commands for CTSS, I reached the stage where I felt that commands should be usable as building blocks for writing more commands, just like subroutine libraries. Hence, I wrote “RUNCOM”, a sort of shell driving the execution of command scripts, with argument substitution.

CMOS devices (and really just anything which depends on PN junctions) are notoriously difficult to manufacture outside of a controlled setting and often require dangerous chemicals. On the other hand, the ferromagnetic  effect works on a macro scale (read: hobbyist-friendly) with fewer process steps and friendlier materials for the most basic implementations.<p>You can make memory devices out of it from just two materials — a toroid-shaped ferromagnetic “core” (e.g. nickel) and a wire running through the core (which can be used to polarize the core, or to read its polarization). That’s core memory, used extensively after the era of vacuum tubes but before the era of flash or silicon-based memories.<p>To my knowledge it was never used much for logic, but the row + column select of a core memory circuit perform an AND operation, and if you search around you can find at least a few papers proposing combinatorial logic based on those ferromagnetic cores.<p>It’s <i>two<\/i> materials (a ferromagnetic material and a conductor), it’s something that was actually used for a decade in industry (core memory), and you can get to 1 MHz even with macro-scale devices. Ferromagnetic devices seem like a hobbyist’s dream!

Compositors can decide to perform their work later, some amount of time before the next display refresh (e.g. a few milliseconds). This allows to reduce latency because the new buffers submitted by clients (such as web browsers) can be displayed with less than 1 refresh period worth of latency. For instance the browser can update its buffer at last display refresh + 8ms, then the compositor can composite at last display refresh + 13ms, and the new frame can be displayed at last display refresh + 16ms.<p>Here&#x27;s for instance how Weston does it: [1]. Sway has a similar feature.<p>&gt;However since pointing with a cursor is such a core experience in these OS&#x27;es, the &quot;screen compositor&quot; usually have special code to draw the cursor on screen as late as possible—as close in time to an actual display refresh as possible—to be able to use the most recent position data from the input device driver.<p>That&#x27;s not entirely true. Nowadays all GPUs have a feature called &quot;cursor plane&quot;. This allows the compositor to configure the cursor directly in the hardware and to avoid drawing it. So when the user just moves the mouse around the compositor doesn&#x27;t need to redraw anything, all it needs to do is update the cursor position in the hardware registers.<p>Compositors don&#x27;t have code to draw the cursor as late as possible. Instead, they program the cursor position when drawing a new frame. (On some hardware this allows the compositor to &quot;fixup&quot; the cursor position in case some input events happen after drawing and before the display refresh.)<p>But in the end, all of this doesn&#x27;t really matter. What matters is that the app draws before the compositor draws, thus the compositor will have a more up-to-date cursor position.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ppaalanen.blogspot.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;weston-repaint-scheduling.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ppaalanen.blogspot.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;weston-repaint-schedu...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-25 22:41:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["skybrian"],"id":[22981155],"kids":[22981524,22981684,22981189,22981839],"parent":[22980869],"text":["If you try to &quot;predict the present&quot; based on the past (and when you use previous points to calculate velocity and acceleration, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing) it will overshoot when there&#x27;s a change in direction, and how much depends on how aggressively you try to extrapolate.

Find a VPL that was designed for the era where graphics are cheap.<p>- Automatic layout is hard?  Yes, an optimal solution to graph layout is NP-complete, but so is register allocation, and my compiler still works (and that isn&#x27;t even its bottleneck).

Take <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;162487395171\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;162487395171<\/a> as an example, it&#x27;s actually one of the simpler graphs from that page. But if you take a look at it you see it&#x27;s just doing standard function calls in a sequence, like trunctate(), toText() setText(), what&#x27;s then the point of making it visual?! For simple signal control loops with only mathematical operations the labview model works really well, but when you start doing things like subString, groupBy or indexOf and don&#x27;t realize you should change domain, that&#x27;s when you get the worst spaghetti.<p>The benefit of a visual representation is that there are different ways to visualize things and you can choose which one fits the problem best. You have sequence, dependency, state, class, call-graphs, signals, lexical parsers, tables, charts, etc. Most visual environments only implement one of these and very soon you are using the wrong tool for the job."],"time":["2020-04-26 08:26:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hermitcrab"],"id":[22981326],"kids":[22981764],"parent":[22978454],"text":["Visual programming is great for <i>some<\/i> application areas.<p>I recently wrote software that allows you to transform data step-by-step visually (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easydatatransform.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easydatatransform.com<\/a>).

He makes good points about the lack of formal specification, portability, and specialty software; this is indeed a problem, as all the best visual programming platforms are proprietary.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s no fundamental reason that visual editors shouldn&#x27;t be able to load and save source code; it&#x27;s just a different way of thinking about program structure and user interface. There&#x27;s already a lot of tools out there that generate dependency graphs within or alongside an IDE; the main shortcoming i see is a lack of nesting. There are few instances in which i want to see the entire structure of a program all at once, any more than I want to read all the source code in a single giant text buffer<p>One might equally ask if textual languages are so great, why are there so many of them? Couldn&#x27;t everything be written in a nice capable high-level language like C? And of course it could, but lots of people don&#x27;t like C&#x27;s minimalism and lack of guardrails. It seems to me that most new general-purpose languages originate in a desire to have the computer do some of the tedious housekeeping (like casting variables) and frustration with awkward syntax.<p>I&#x27;m old, so when I was learning to write code it was just flat text files and every build necessitated a round of swearing over forgotten semicolons, mismatched brackets, or incorrectly spelled variables. Syntax highlighting, code folding, autocompletion, and bracket matchings which do so much to make development in a modern IDE pleasant and productive were once viewed as undesirable crutches that would lead to poor practices, lack of portability, and inaccurate second-guessing of developers&#x27; intention by the IDE, subjecting hapless coders to the tyrannical will of the interface illuminati.<p>I suspect that behind the aversion to visual programming lies a fear of standardization and automation that will result in widespread developer redundancy as it becomes easier for domain experts to build out their tools without code specialists, somewhat parallel to the development of electronics from hobby clubs where people helped each other with soldering irons, multimeters, and resistor identification charts to today&#x27;s electronic factories populated only by pick-and-place machines assembling components too small for adult hands to manipulate at dizzying speeds.<p>The more automation and and ML that finds its way into IDEs, the more standardized the underlying libraries are likely to become. To the extent that programmers are freed from syntax production and housekeeping duties and processes can more easily be read (from visual graphs&#x2F;charts) with domain knowledge alone, the more likely it is that the most common functions become wholly standardized, in the same way that chips are. 555 timer ICs have been around since 1971 and the most popular derivatives are dual and quad versions.

Most of the users will just get on with their life when using your software, but it is the &quot;power users&quot; who will <i>make sure<\/i> that you&#x27;re aware of how much your team&#x27;s work sucks.<p>When the &quot;power users&quot; are a significant proportion of your users, only then is it worth formally recognising their needs as part of the formal design, otherwise it generally seems to be a lot of work to support the niche needs of literally a handful of users at the opportunity cost of adding features for the other 99.99995% of your users."],"time":["2020-04-25 14:40:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tjoff"],"id":[22977588],"kids":[22977919,22986820,22978966],"parent":[22975656],"text":["<i>&gt;&gt; We just simplified the whole Desktop Environment Experience!<p>&gt; Fine, this will be great for onboarding new users but you just made it a lot harder to use for all existing users.<\/i><p>This is one of my biggest pet peeves in UX.

My eyes are bleary after eight hours, so a short film is ideal.<p>Later in the evening, we&#x27;ll jump on Amazon Prime or Netflix and watch something family friendly (though I recently discovered that my 15-year-old kid was watching an anime that had about the most graphic violence I&#x27;ve ever seen)."],"time":["2020-04-26 04:45:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AzzieElbab"],"id":[22982475],"kids":[22983918,22982852],"parent":[22978103],"text":["Is the Economist trying to get us to kill our wives and children?"],"time":["2020-04-26 01:09:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lihaciudaniel"],"id":[22983911],"kids":{},"parent":[22978103],"text":["What mental illness he had?

The fact it is restricted to being higher among whites as opposed to those even worse off. Not to victim blame but that the difference might be useful for uncovering the root cause. There likely dysfunctional elements enshrined that are individually found within - take anti-intellectualism which is not exclusive to them may arise more in fatal combinations. There are likely many in reality but a simple &quot;fatal combination&quot; may also suffice.<p>Anti-intelletualism has always lead to bad outcomes really as a whole. There may even be toxic movements &#x2F;within&#x2F; a given college culture but crucially there is always an element of self improvement there as a motivation. Even in the most degenerate stereotypical case of &quot;learn nothing in four years to get the diploma for connections&quot; they still have a goal even if they have latter regrets from doing things wrong.<p>The crab-bucket mentality often found within looks down upon those who do anything to try to make more of themselves as it makes them feel bad to see others try when they do not.<p>A third obvious ingredient is &quot;lack of opportunity&quot; which has synnergy with the first two - if they see opportunity but wind up in learned helplessness leaving it out of reach or fundamentally betraying who they are or degrading themselves. Combine the three and well it starts to become understandable how it becomes a fatal trap.<p>But minority groups show it isn&#x27;t so simple. Given the evidence has throughly shown people are people the difference is likely that they tend to more often have or develop some sort of support network because they feel the world or authorities are aligned against them. Even the long cast out from born family LGBT members who were (and sadly often still are) societally strongly encouraged to keep it secret.<p>Sadly one outlier I am aware of are Native Americans who tend to have less than ideal situations with reservations to put it mildly.

I’ll accept their conclusion without looking at the underlying data.<p>That said, conclusions are only as good as the data and methods used to produce them.  If we looked our physical world and universe and neglected to include the influence of gravity we would reach conclusions that could be valid in that context yet not so if gravity is considered. It is important to understand this for any study, not just this one.<p>So, what’s the “gravity” missing from this study?<p>The erosion (or disappearance really) of the industrial base in the US (and other parts of the world).<p>The industrial base is where the people at the center of this study found employment, careers and the basis for a fulfilling family life.  With that gone we have the reality rightly exposed by this study.<p>Yet, the solution isn’t more college degrees.<p>This virus has exposed a sad reality: That the industrial base in the west has been eroded down to the point where we can’t locally manufacture simple products like masks and gowns at scale.  We can’t even manufacture the plastic vials, swabs, reagents and packaging for vital test kits at scale (just try to find somewhere where you can order a billion of these in the US or Europe).<p>That, as the world know now, is a formula for disaster.  And that is where the solution to the problem exposed by this paper lies.<p>Put simply, the US and Europe need to invest heavily in taking back massive segments of the industrial base.  This won’t be cheap, simple or fast, and yet I think everyone understands this must be done.<p>We don’t need more degrees, we need to recover a portion of the economy that has evaporated over the last fifty years.<p>The other missing elements in the study are: Europe and the rest of the world.<p>Europe is an obvious place to ask: Does the same demographic have the same problems?<p>The rest of the world is, in some way, the “placebo” for a study like this.  The study says that non-US whites and other races in the US don’t seem to have this problem.  The obvious question is:  How do they do at their countries of origin?<p>The answers to these basic questions would help frame the results and perhaps reveal some of the issues in the US.<p>One of the questions I would ask is: What is the effect of the $15&#x2F;hr minimum wage on this segment of society?<p>I visited a friend’s factory in Los Angeles yesterday.  Massive place.  Imagine a Home Depot full of every type of manufacturing equipment you can imagine.<p>We talked about why he can’t manufacture consumer goods in this factory.  It came down to high minimum wage, high taxes and onerous regulatory burden.  He could literally hire hundreds of people and make consumer goods at scale were it not for this framework that simple makes manufacturing of consumer goods at scale (include masks, gowns and test kits in that) in the US impossible.<p>I am not n necessarily talking about simple products here. Phones, computers, graphics cards, displays, computer mice, tablets, watches, printers, tv’s, microwave ovens, refrigerators, clothes washers, grass mowers, etc.  I could go on forever.  Walk into a Home Depot or Best Buy.  We can’t make anything sold in those stores (except for some of the construction materials at Home Depot).<p>The problem isn’t the lack of college degrees.  The problem isn’t even capitalism.  The problem is a combination of failed international and domestic policies that allowed for the loss of a massive portion of the industrial base that employed tens of millions of people for decades.<p>We can fix this."],"time":["2020-04-25 17:19:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["oDot"],"id":[22978412],"kids":[22978473,22978959,22978655,22978512,22978495],"parent":[22978248],"text":["They wrongly call the current economy in the US &quot;capitalist&quot;.

However, AirBnb refuses to implement the ability to filter your results by terms inside review.  They claim that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too technically difficult to implement this.  I am no search guru, but I have fired up an Elastic Search instance to make a-one-to many relationship searchable back in my day without too many issues.

So inexorably tying LSD to Manson makes sense if you want to outlaw a currently researched substance with positive clinical trials, especially when Tom&#x27;s research reveals he may have been a subject himself as he had a series of unwarranted releases from arrest or jail and state appointed relationships with MK Ultra program operatives.<p>I&#x27;m just MAPS has been able to reignite the legitimacy and utility of these class of drugs again after all these years.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=J36xPWBLcG8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=J36xPWBLcG8<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-25 14:04:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rdli"],"id":[22977413],"kids":[22978563,22978861],"parent":[22976626],"text":["Ingress controllers are quite confusing. Here&#x27;s the general summary:<p>- General best practice for Kubernetes clusters is to have a proxy that routes external traffic to internal services<p>- This is because Kubernetes provides its own internal network space so each of your internal services aren&#x27;t directly exposed externally (although you can do this if you like)<p>- Kubernetes has a spec for how this is done, the &quot;ingress&quot; spec<p>- An ingress controller implements the ingress spec<p>- The ingress spec is pretty limited in functionality (basic routing, no support for timeouts, as an example)<p>So if you just need to do basic routing, any ingress controller is going to do the same thing, more or less.<p>If you want to do more than that (which is very likely), then you&#x27;ll want to compare the ingress controllers beyond basic ingress. That&#x27;s where NGINX vs Envoy Proxy vs Traefik etc come into play as your core data plane proxy, and then how much stuff comes on top of it.<p>Hope that helps.<p>(Disclosure: I work on Ambassador, one of the Envoy-based ingress controllers)<p>Edited: formatting"],"time":["2020-04-25 13:51:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["busterarm"],"id":[22977376],"kids":{},"parent":[22976626],"text":["For anyone trying to wrap their head round the myriad of choices available these days...<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;flant-com&#x2F;comparing-ingress-controllers-for-kubernetes-9b397483b46b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;flant-com&#x2F;comparing-ingress-controllers-f...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-25 13:40:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["llarsson"],"id":[22977085],"kids":[22977281],"parent":[22976626],"text":["This is the first I hear about this project.
