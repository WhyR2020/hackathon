His argument was that we could predict the age of the earth by measuring the temperature gradient at the surface of the planet (which is related to the amount of heat that is being radiated to space). He modeled the earth as a cooling solid sphere and using the heat equation[2] he computed that if the earth started at the temperature of molten rock then it would take some tens of millions of years to cool down to the current surface temperatures. Conveniently, this estimate matched contemporaneous theories about the sun being powered by gravity. If one assumed that the sun was slowly shrinking while releasing that gravitational potential energy as light, it also ended up with an age of some tens of millions of years. (Remember: back then neither radioactive decay nor nuclear fusion had been discovered yet).<p>The major flaw in Lord Kelvin&#x27;s calculations were only discovered in the 1890&#x27;s when Irish mathematician John Perry suggested that modelling the earth as a cooling solid sphere would not be appropriate if the earth&#x27;s core were actually liquid. The key difference is that a liquid core transfers heat much more efficiently, due to convection. In the presence of a liquid core the surface of the earth receives more heat from the interior and takes longer to cool down to the present temperatures, compared with an earth that has a solid core. Once Perry corrected Kelvin&#x27;s model to account for convection the age of the earth jumped to the billions of years that we now know it has.<p>It took a while for the theory of the convective mantle to become widely accepted but it was ultimately proven correct by radiometric dating.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Age_of_the_Earth#Early_calculations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Age_of_the_Earth#Early_calcula...<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heat_equation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heat_equation<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 03:41:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jaggederest"],"id":[23074976],"kids":[23075167,23075090],"parent":[23074435],"text":["This is really interesting, because we had a lot of the machinery in place to make accurate observations, but not a lot of the theory to link them together.

It gives you an incentive to postpone technical debt, you want to grow and be acquired at the expense of whoever is going to integrate your startup into $bigco later.<p>Side note: &quot;AWS Organizations&quot; to me is simply a way for AWS to try to cover for the poor design choices of the organizational structure of an AWS account, and the unnecessary complications related to billing and metering.<p>Try to understand the AWS bill of a sufficiently large company - you won&#x27;t. The AWS rep won&#x27;t. The AWS Solutions Architect won&#x27;t.<p>Also, never heard of a company being acquired at a higher price because they had a &quot;proper&quot; AWS setup.<p>Ah, forgot this: if your acquirer is using MS Azure, good luck telling them that you are using Cloud9 or other AWS-specific stuff.<p>Let&#x27;s continue...<p>&gt; #2 Build as if you may open-source at any time<p>Yes. In an ideal world. In practice, almost nobody follows best practices. Because there&#x27;s always some urgency that takes precedence. This is why companies like Accenture, PwC, Deloitte, etc, keep billing monstrous amount of money to help large companies &quot;migrate&quot; or &quot;evolve&quot; or &quot;adapt&quot; or whatever buzzword they use.<p>&gt; #3 Build with a cloud-native mindset<p>&gt; ... going outside of the platform should be an exception and something you do only when truly needed<p>&gt; My thinking on serverless these days in order of consideration.\n&gt; - If the platform has it, use it\n&gt; - If the market has it, buy it<p>Serverless, really?

Different types of problems can occur.  Some people may be busy and decide they don&#x27;t have time to acknowledge emails.  So you literally don&#x27;t know if they even read them.  The next issue is they will read the first one or two sentences and get the gist, but are unwilling or unable to do any real thinking about what you wrote, and so will reply with something fairly obvious that may actually have been covered in your email.  So technically they read it, but they didn&#x27;t understand it well or do any analysis of the information.<p>The other one is where the other guy has a different viewpoint and that causes them to not want to understand the part of your message that contradicts it.<p>The other issue that can occur is that some people just don&#x27;t quite have enough will power or cognitive ability to focus on something without having an audio chat.  So something that requires their input but isn&#x27;t their own task, they are not able to put adequate analysis into it in an email, even though you can see they are trying.

But, verbal communications are prone to rambling and argumentative paths which begin to reverse business value.<p>IMO, the best is a dual-stack approach. Have a daily standup call, but require that everyone email out to the participants all of their discussion points prior to the call. All participants should be expected to read the discussion points of others prior to joining the call. This means that everyone should be more-or-less discussing just the aspects of the written communications that have gaps or otherwise raised new concerns. I find this can eliminate most of the frustration that can emerge with both techniques. For us, this isnt even an explicit email process.

By &quot;group&quot; I&#x27;m including situations where the group might just be a single boss or client. Your job is to adjust to the communication style of that group. Some groups like to communicate in fragmented &quot;texting&quot; speech. Some groups communicate in perfect English. Best to adjust or you won&#x27;t get much further than that.<p>2. Be authentic. Write like you speak. Start out speaking like you would to any person you might encounter in public. Then you can adjust based on the group. If you&#x27;re trying to appear as someone you aren&#x27;t, people will see through you quickly and you&#x27;ll look silly. It&#x27;s also refreshing to be speaking to regular people.

Tamiya is a Japanese scale modelling and remote-controlled vehicle company with a loooong history of making quality products that the industry just eats up. Like Nintendo, Tamiya has always been in the back row when it comes to technological innovation, but lead the pack when it came to functionality, reliability, and quality. Just like Nintendo, there are Tamiya fan clubs where people are enthusiastic about products from this one company. The rest of the industry doesn&#x27;t exist to them. I&#x27;m trying to illustrate how Tamiya is to the R&#x2F;C world what Nintendo is to console games.<p>That said, vintage Tamiya products new in original packaging from the 70s and 80s can sell for thousands and thousands of dollars. Simple plastic and aluminum parts that were consumable in the 80s were selling for hundreds of dollars in the late 2000s. The market was a rough place. I have about a dozen antique Tamiya models, so I was one of those people engaged in bidding wars for 1&#x2F;4&quot; long tie-rod ends. A brand new Tamiya in the 80s was probably about $100 for a rolling kit. Now people are paying that for individual parts. Nobody was having fun with their models anymore. Everyone was just dusting them off and spending money keeping them pretty.<p>Tamiya had to get the kids playing with their models again. They had to take this exclusive, elitist market they created by accident 30 years ago and start making money off of it again.<p>So Tamiya re-released nearly <i>ALL<\/i> of their vintage kits. Brand new, with original design, documentation, decals, and packaging. This was in addition to their new models and high-tech racing vehicles which were still being released on a regular schedule at the same time. Initially all the collectors (myself included) were livid, because for a while it meant my $1,100 Bruiser 3-speed was only worth $500. That didn&#x27;t happen either. For a time the prices dipped significantly, but collectors still demanded vintage parts to repair their vintage models. The prices soon stabilized. Now that market is healthy and stable, vintage vehicles can be repaired cheaply if desired, and collectors can still spend thousands on NIB models.<p>If Nintendo embraced their market they could possibly reap the same benefits. The enthusiasm for their products is there. Tamiya has shown it is possible to separate collector demand from commodity demand and still have those ecosystems thrive side-by-side. I think Nintendo could pull that off as well."],"time":["2020-05-05 16:05:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gregjw"],"id":[23079010],"kids":[23079043,23079929,23079060,23079651,23081796,23080012,23079199,23080862,23079270,23079931,23079130],"parent":[23078078],"text":["Is this bad?

There is an existing RFC drafted in 2013 with a focus on OAuth 2.0 threat model and security considerations [1], and it looks like this new RFC is making more specific recommendations on top of it. May be read them together.<p>To be honest, I was wishing for OAuth 2.5 if not OAuth 3.0 to consolidate already fragmented OAuth 2.0 spec and landscape [2]. At this stage, there are too many draft proposals and a majority of them led by vendors with some interest in standardizing their implementations.<p>For example, this RFC suggests restricting issued access token to one resource at a time (using audience parameter). Well with Microservices landscape this gets really challenging. Your client application may be interacting with multiple resources. Neither OpenID Connect nor OAuth 2.0 offer solutions to issue multiple access tokens (not yet). An API Gateway may be a solution but still so much ambiguity.<p>I think OpenID Community has done a better job to organize their specifications and working groups [3]. If you go on their specification page it tabulates really well what spec is final, currently under implementation, draft, or obsolete.

These decisions are like deciding what side of the road to drive on: it doesn&#x27;t matter which side of the road you drive on, as long as everyone drives on the same side of the road. The function of a standard is to decide what side of the road everyone drives on.<p>OAuth isn&#x27;t a standard. It&#x27;s just a description of all the various homegrown third-party auth systems that anyone has implemented over HTTP, with only the absolute worst patterns weeded out. None of the shareholders wanted to re-implement their third-party auth, so they just made sure their flavor of auth made it into the standard.

It was a long an arduous process but we chose not to compromise.<p>Basically for the greatest amount of modularity, we divided all 400 functions in our monolithic application into 400 individual servers because obviously functions aren&#x27;t modularizing everything enough. You really need to put more and more wrappers around all of your functions. First put a framework around your function, than put an http api layer around it, then wrap a server app around it, then put an entire container around it and boom! More wrappers == Less technical debt. To illustrate how this works see example below:<p><pre><code>   wrapper(\n     wrapper(\n       wrapper(\n         wrapper(\n           f(x)\n         )\n       )\n     )\n   )\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSee that? Obviously for every additional wrapper you add around your original function your technical debt becomes less. This is why it makes sense to make to not just use functions to modularize your data but to wrap all your functions in containers and then put those containers in containers.<p>Now all 400 of our engineers each as an individual manages one entire function within one entire container. It&#x27;s amazing, they don&#x27;t have to think about two things anymore, they can just concentrate on one thing.<p>While I&#x27;m not sure what has improved yet, everything feels better. Our company is following industry trends and buzzwords. Technical debt actually went up but that&#x27;s just our fault for building it wrong.<p>Some engineer asked me why couldn&#x27;t we just load balance our original monolith and scale it horizontally. I fired that engineer.<p>Another engineer came to me and told me that for some function:<p><pre><code>   func some_func(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int: {\n      return a + b\n   }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt&#x27;s probably better to do 1. instead of 2.<p><pre><code>   1. Call the function: some_func(2,3)\n\n   2. Make a request: request.get(&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pointlessapi.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;morecomplexity&#x2F;someextratechnicaldebt&#x2F;randomletters&#x2F;asdfskeidk&#x2F;some_func?a=2&amp;a=3&quot;) \n   and parse the json:\n\n   {\n     &quot;metadata&quot;: {\n         &quot;date&quot;: &quot;1&#x2F;1&#x2F;2020&quot;\n         &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;123323432&quot;,\n         &quot;other_pointless_crap&quot;: ...\n         &quot;more_usless_info&quot;: ...\n         &quot;function_name (why?)&quot;: &quot;some_func&quot;\n     }\n     &quot;actual_data&quot;: 5\n   }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nI fired that engineer too. Obviously 2. is better than 1. Also why am I using JSON? Not enough wrappers! You have to wrap that http call in additional wrappers like GraphQL or GRPC!!! (See wrapper logic above).<p>Have you guys heard of a new trend called Sololithic architecture? Basically the new philosophy states that all of 400 of our microservices should be placed in 400 containers and run under a cluster of 399 computers under kubernetes!<p>I may not understand where technical debt comes from and I also may not understand how all these architectures will fix the problem of technical debt forever... I know that industry trends and buzzwords are more intelligent than me and monoliths are bad bad bad and obviously the source of all technical debt! Just cut everything into little pieces and technical debt becomes ZERO.<p>Right? The technical definition of Technical debt is not enough cutting of your logic into tiny pieces and not enough wrappers around your modules so all you need to do is cut everything up and put wrappers around it and problem solved!

I ended up being thwarted, to my surprise, by the touchpad support.<p>The big problem I encountered was poor palm detection: I learned through this process that I have a tendency to use the touchpad with my right hand, while my left hand is still in typing position. This means that the edge of my left palm rests along the upper-left corner of the touchpad. This would result in the driver sometimes detecting two touchpoints instead of one, and I would end up scrolling when I meant to move the pointer.<p>The result of this was pretty amazing to me: after a few hours of use I found that my wrists, shoulders, and neck hurt because I was subconsciously trying to adjust my hands to avoid this.

Lake Agassiz is thought to be responsible for the deeply incised Minnesota River valley.<p>The shifting of glaciers and the ice sheet altered the effective relief of the basins over time, so simulating these lakes today takes a lot of work.<p>In the Great Basin, away from glaciers, Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan were the largest lakes that formed during a colder, wetter time, as endorheic valleys filled with water and repeatedly overflowed the lowest sill of their basins. Lake Bonneville is thought to have overflowed the outer edge of Great Basin itself at Red Rock Pass near Downey, Idaho; eroding the gap and releasing a huge flood into the Snake River basin.<p>Because a moving ice sheet wasn&#x27;t a factor in their case, DEM shading can be used to approximate their overflows. This doesn&#x27;t account for isostatic rebound or tilt in terrain, but gives a visually enlightening approximation, and lets one interactively explore how these outflows may have worked.<p>One can shade a topo map of the Great Basin at 4785 feet -- today&#x27;s elevation of Red Rock Pass -- to approximate how Lake Bonneville&#x27;s floods may have worked. Or, shade at these key sill elevations, in feet, to see how Lake Lahontan may have outgrown one valley after another: 3878, 3933, 3976, 4154, 4180, 4301, 4386.<p>Example with Caltopo at 3976 feet: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caltopo.com&#x2F;map.html#ll=40.28729,-118.02612&amp;z=8&amp;b=t&amp;o=r&amp;n=0.25&amp;a=sc_e0-3976fcFF0000-0000FF&amp;cl=%7B%22cfglayers%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22179ac9d4-1494-4e74-ad1a-6b78626556cd%22%2C%22geometry%22%3Anull%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22title%22%3A%22%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22sc_e0-3976fcFF0000-0000FF%22%2C%22class%22%3A%22ConfiguredLayer%22%7D%7D%5D%7D\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caltopo.com&#x2F;map.html#ll=40.28729,-118.02612&amp;z=8&amp;b=t&amp;...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 10:31:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kqr"],"id":[23077813],"kids":[23077948,23078122,23081231],"parent":[23076241],"text":["&gt; The last major shift in drainage occurred around 8,200 years ago. The melting of remaining Hudson Bay ice caused Lake Agassiz to drain nearly completely. This final drainage of Lake Agassiz has been associated with an estimated 0.8 to 2.8 m (2.6 to 9.2 ft) rise in global sea levels. [...] A recent study by Turney and Brown links the 8,500-years ago drainage to the expansion of agriculture from east to west across Europe; they suggest that this may also account for various flood myths of prehistoric cultures, including the Biblical flood narrative.<p>Reading things like this is very humbling. Humankind has been good at keeping records of things for the last, what? 300 years? Nearly by accident, we have successfully retained some accounts from the ancient Greeks, which were produced not even 3000 years ago. So 3000 years is a long-ass time, and really stretches our capabilities of preserving records. And this was after we invented some forms of writing, as far as I understand it.<p>Yet historians have reason to believe that in the 5000 something years before that, humans told stories about actual great floods, passing them down one generation at a time, to a point where they still form part of our cultural heritage today? That is absolutely mind-boggling to me. Obviously, I can&#x27;t tell whether or not that is actually the case, but that there&#x27;s even a possibility that it is the case is just beyond me.<p>Of course, for the generations living around 8,500 years ago, even just a 3 ft flood must have really been something if it happened all over the world at once – even if it takes multiple generations for it to reach peak levels.

Specifically, it could be justified for two reasons:<p>First: you might have more impact on the organization from the inside than from the outside (this is most relevant to people joining at a high&#x2F;senior level).  For example, Google seems to be making privacy far, far worse.  Yet there are some people on the inside fighting to limit the privacy violations, which leads to decisions like banning GPS tracking in their contact tracing app[0].  Would the world be better or worse off if the <i>only<\/i> people working at Google were people who don&#x27;t care at all about user privacy?  I&#x27;m honestly not sure, but I can at least see an argument that it might be even worse off.<p>Second: you might get something from the organization that lets you do good that outweighs any harm you contribute to (this is more relevant to junior employees).  Many employers provide something (training, future job opportunities, or a high enough income to open your own small business&#x2F;non-profit).  A thoughtful employee can go into a &quot;negative impact&quot; employer with eyes wide open and a plan to get something, and get out.<p>However, in either case, self awareness and a definite exit plan are _key_.  As Drew writes, once you are working at a &quot;negative impact&quot; employer,<p>&gt; Doublethink quickly steps in to protect your ego from the cognitive dissonance, and you take another little step towards becoming the person you once swore never to be.<p>The way to avoid that sort of conative dissonance is 1) know that you&#x27;ll experience it and be on guard against it, and 2) know all along that you&#x27;re there temporarily and should never get too comfortable. Even then, you should be realistic about how long you can maintain your personal values in face of a very different culture.  For a junior employee, I&#x27;d say two, maybe three years should be the absolute limit before you get out.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-usa-apps-idUSKBN22G28W\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-usa-ap...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 16:26:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["screye"],"id":[23080937],"kids":[23081186,23081333,23081281],"parent":[23079571],"text":["Tech has a tendency to view the world in isolation.<p>You can&#x27;t work in fashion because it uses child labor.

I unfortunately can&#x27;t make that same call here. It&#x27;s taken me a while to realize this, but I have begun to filter out reading thoughts that aren&#x27;t fully formed, and I think this is one of them.<p>The author brings up the Nuremberg defense[1] as an example of complicity which is indefensible, but this is rhetorically quite hollow. If you go a little bit further into political theory and consider Arendt&#x27;s conception of the banality of evil[2], and furthermore the idea of a panopticon[3], you very quickly come to the philosophical impasse between individual culpability and agency and systematic mechanisms and the political.<p>What is this impasse? Plainly, I think it is that the individual has nearly zero agency alone, and only has power when effectively organizing into groups. That makes arguments like these functionally useless (or even &quot;usefully idiotic&quot;[5]), because they fundamentally misattribute the locus of value production, capture of capital and political clout onto the individual, in what Marx would call the petite bourgeoisie[4].<p>This misattribution misses the asymmetric distribution of power towards the top of organizational hierarchies, especially within the size of large mega-corporations. If this author were correct and engineers were truly accountable for the work of their employers, what is the unique labor that managers and executives contribute to the corporation that ICs do not provide? And who has the power to make and override decisions at a corporate policy level? It&#x27;s transparently obvious that corporations are intentionally set up divide labor such that decision making agency is allocated towards executive leadership and management, and that line level ICs serve to execute on those decisions but do not have the agency to veto decisions they disagree with.<p>This is obvious to anyone who has ever worked at a mega-corporation, enough so that I wonder if the author has. If they have not, then the post amounts merely to speculation about something the author doesn&#x27;t have enough firsthand experience with to credibly analyze. That doesn&#x27;t mean it should have never been written, but I certainly got no value from it.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superior_orders\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superior_orders<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eichmann_in_Jerusalem#The_banality_of_evil\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eichmann_in_Jerusalem#The_bana...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Panopticon#Criticism_and_use_as_metaphor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Panopticon#Criticism_and_use_a...<\/a><p>[4]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Petite_bourgeoisie\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Petite_bourgeoisie<\/a><p>[5]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Useful_idiot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Useful_idiot<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 19:13:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["C4stor"],"id":[23081362],"kids":{},"parent":[23079571],"text":["As usual, someone suggests that _other people_ change their way of life because it&#x27;s bad, without any impact on himself of course.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to preach without having any skin in the game isn&#x27;t it ?"],"time":["2020-05-05 17:52:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["austincheney"],"id":[23080701],"kids":[23081124,23080801],"parent":[23079571],"text":["Uggghhhh, the entitlement of well paid and under qualified developers is loathsome.

Since DP-3T discloses less information about your social graph to the central party (although in some edge cases more about your social graph to everyone in the network) this would mean that DP-3T is superior.<p>Clearly if they both work well, then the one that discloses less data is better.<p>It is important that we maintain context here: these are both &quot;minimally disclosive&quot; protocols which were designed to transmit as little information as possible while being effective tools. Compare this with the absolutely pervasive tracking being done in South Korea and other places. The difference is that NHSX and the designers of PEEP&#x2F;ROBERT thinks that a higher level of disclosure is required than DP-3T to be effective. At the moment, we do not know if either of these will work, so it&#x27;s not the case that we can say: &quot;they both work, therefore only a surveillance state would pick the one that discloses more information&quot;.

However, this assumes there are a sufficient number of phones running the tracing app nearby still broadcasting to keep enough people&#x27;s apps awake: there needs to be a critical mass of users while we&#x27;re all supposed to be socially distancing. If two or more people pass each other and their apps have stopped broadcasting, the software will never know they came in contact.<p>Bluetooth LE has four main states: scanning, advertising, peripheral connection, and central connection. In order to exchange the data that the app needs it needs one device in the peripheral connection mode and the other in the central connection mode. This means one device must have previously been advertising and the other scanning. The two important states are advertising and scanning.<p>Android devices can advertise in the background but they can&#x27;t scan reliably, they can do this for a short period of time enforced by the Android time limits on apps running in the background and possibly manufacturer specific power savings measures.

My observation is, FP lacks such gateway languages. Even the simplest FP-first language is intimidating.<p>So my answer to your question is, a good strategy to learn these can be carving out a relatively small portion from a language (i.e Haskell with only Algebraic Types and Pattern Matching) and working only on it for a period of time. Doing that doesn&#x27;t teach terminology but exposes what Haskell is really obsessed about. For the curious, it is expressing type relationships as flexibly as numeric arithmetic we know from high-school.<p>Just like high-school arithmetic, several recurring patterns (often called formulas in Math classes) have their special names. Almost all programming languages are good at closely matching that syntax in their numeric expressions. It is unfortunately not the case for types though. In programming,<p>this functional type (pseudo code):<p><pre><code>  A = (X + Y) | Z\n<\/code><\/pre>\ntend to be expressed as:<p><pre><code>  interface class A {\n  \n  }\n  \n  \n  class A1 implements A {\n    X x;\n    Y y;\n  }\n\n  class A2 implements B {\n    Z z;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nor as:<p><pre><code>  union A {\n    struct A1 {\n      X x;\n      Y y;\n    } a1;\n\n    struct A1 {\n      Z;\n    } a2;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn both examples, it is longer to write the same &quot;meaning&quot; in OOP than FP, especially when there are abstract methods involved.<p>This difference in verbosity (aesthetically subjective) bugs an FP programmer more and more as they get used to their language. When that happens, people start naming things. Having an abstract type of `Collection` is no longer enough because we realize `Collection`, `Mappable`, `Traversable`, `Generator`, `Optional`, `Atomic`, `Pair` and `Tuple` all share the similarity of:<p>* wrapping a type,<p>* having a way to access the wrapped value(s),<p>* and the wish to support all operations the wrapped value supports without an unwrap, composable out of the box.<p>We call this pattern a name, the infamous &quot;Functor&quot; (incorrectly but who cares), and axiomize those assumptions formally in the target language, so that it is longer reimplemented again and again. The word &quot;Functor&quot; itself otherwise has no meaning, it is letter salad.<p>To learn those names effectively, you must be comfortable enough with the basics so that you get annoyed by the repetition and start researching new names as you stumble upon with new patterns.<p>In Haskell, &quot;abstraction over type constructors&quot; usually means (in OO terms) &quot;declare a new generic interface and implement that in the abstract type so that you don&#x27;t have to reimplement it non-genericly in the concrete type&quot;."],"time":["2020-05-06 17:09:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Twisol"],"id":[23086420],"kids":{},"parent":[23078173],"text":["&gt; So how does a programmer from non-functional world become fluent in understanding sentence such as &quot;abstraction over type constructors&quot;?<p>Incoming essay...<p>Pure functional programming is fundamentally about software components called &quot;pure functions&quot;, or just &quot;functions&quot; for short. (I&#x27;m quoting the term because they&#x27;re not the same as what are called functions in other languages. I&#x27;d call those other things &quot;procedures&quot; instead, but alas.) Other programming communities rally around components like &quot;objects&quot;, and that&#x27;s fine. The important thing is to pick something to break your system down into, and here, we&#x27;re talking about &quot;functions&quot;.<p>&quot;Functions&quot; are simpler kinds of components than objects or procedures: the ways in which they behave are much more limited, so they&#x27;re easier to reason about. When a &quot;function&quot; is interacted with, it can&#x27;t perform any side effects, so interacting with the &quot;function&quot; multiple times gives the same behavior every time. Procedures can manipulate global state, and objects can manipulate internal state, so reasoning about them takes more effort. You have to keep track of time: what happened before this interaction?<p>&quot;Functions&quot; have two interfaces: an input side and an output side. When a &quot;function&quot; receives a value on the input side, it will always emit a value on the output side. We can wire &quot;functions&quot; together by connecting the input of one to the output of another. The result is a system with a single free input side and a single free output side -- that is, it&#x27;s also a &quot;function&quot;. This makes it very easy to wire up lots of &quot;functions&quot;.<p>Usually, a &quot;function&quot; has certain expectations of the input values that it receives, as well as some guarantees about the output values it emits. In a dynamically typed language, when those expectations are not met, a runtime error is emitted. This is fine -- it&#x27;s just one way to handle failed expectations. But sometimes we can formalize those expectations statically, and let the compiler check up-front whether those expectations are met. This does add some complexity: you might not be able to wire up two &quot;functions&quot; if one can&#x27;t satisfy the other&#x27;s expectations. Statically-typed programmers have decided that they&#x27;re willing to put up with that.<p>In a statically-typed world, the input and output interfaces of our &quot;function&quot; software components can be tagged with specifications. Functional languages are often judged by how expressive these specifications can be; a specification language like this is called a &quot;type system&quot;. You can have type systems for components that are not &quot;functions&quot;, but the rules of composition become more complex. (For &quot;objects&quot;, class systems are quite popular.)<p>Most type systems allow you to break down an interface specification into smaller pieces, which themselves are valid specifications. That means we now have two kinds of components in our system: &quot;functions&quot;, which exist at runtime, and types, which exist at compilation time. The rules for how types compose can be more complicated than those for &quot;functions&quot;, but we&#x27;re usually okay with that, as long as &quot;functions&quot; are kept simple.<p>Some type systems allow a value to satisfy multiple types. For example, class-based systems allow this via subtyping relations. Others might describe types as predicates (truth functions) on a pre-existing universe of values (e.g. TypeScript). Pure functional programming typically requires mutual exclusion: a value cannot be part of multiple types. We often say the the type <i>defines<\/i> its values because of this.<p>The low bar for a static type system is &quot;algebraic types&quot;. This means that we have two ways to compose types, conventionally called &quot;product&quot; and &quot;sum&quot;. Most type systems have products, but sums are historically rarer. Values of a product type `X * Y` look like `(x, y)`, and we can pull out either element of the pair. Values of a sum type `X + Y` look like either `Left x` or `Right y`, and we can ask which one it is and do something different depending on the result.<p>Java and C++ do not have sum types. You can approximate their specifications to some extent using the Visitor pattern or discriminated unions, but the implementations in these languages are verbose, and unpleasant to read and write. Rust and Haskell do have sum types, so specifications of that nature are used much more readily.<p>We can generalize further. We can think of the product and sum of types as &quot;type functions&quot;, or &quot;type constructors&quot;, that take a pair of types as input and produce a type as output. Many type systems allow you to define your own &quot;type functions&quot;. In Java, these are generic classes: &quot;List&lt;T&gt;&quot; is a type function from some type T to the type of lists containing that type. In C++, these are templates. But in most pure functional programming, static type functions look just like runtime value functions, since they behave just like them too. It&#x27;s just a matter of when they&#x27;re evaluated.<p>Once again, when you have functions, you often want to place demands on their inputs, and guarantees on their outputs. Type functions are no different. There are many possible ways to &quot;type types&quot;, as it were, but a popular approach is by using &quot;traits&quot; or &quot;typeclasses&quot;. Just as with types and values, a typeclass places requirements upon the types that inhabit it. (But a type can also satisfy multiple typeclasses.)<p>For instance, &quot;Monoid&quot; is a typeclass on types with two associated items: a &quot;zero&quot; value of that type, and a &quot;concat&quot; function that takes two values of the type and gives another value of that type. If you know that a type is a Monoid, then you know that these associated items are also available to you, regardless of what the actual type is. (For instance, you can write a &quot;concatAll&quot; function that iterates over a list of elements of a monoid and concatenates them together <i>regardless of what the monoid type actually is<\/i>.)<p>With typeclasses in mind, instead of taking a &quot;list of X&quot; or a &quot;set of X&quot;, you might abstract over all such things as &quot;collections of X&quot;. But you don&#x27;t want to say what a collection is for every possible X. We need to <i>abstract over type constructors<\/i>. A &quot;collection&quot; is any type such that, given a type X, you get a type with certain associated items expected of all collections. Java approximates this with subtyping.<p>&quot;Functor&quot; is, in some ways, a generalization of &quot;Collection&quot;. A type function that is a &quot;Functor&quot; is a type that, if you have a value of that type over Xs, and you have a function transforming Xs into Ys, then there must be a mechanism to get a value of that type over Ys instead. We call this mechanism &quot;map&quot;, and it can be instantiated over any collection. Got a list of X and a function from X to Y? We&#x27;ve got a way to get a list of Y. Got a set of X and a function from X to Y? We&#x27;ve got a way to get a set of Y.<p>Because &quot;set&quot; and &quot;list&quot; are type constructors, we say that we are <i>abstracting over type constructors<\/i> to get a single statement about all such things. &quot;For every Functor F, if I have an F containing Xs and a function transforming Xs to Ys, then I can get an F containing Ys.&quot;"],"time":["2020-05-06 01:45:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rb808"],"id":[23085301],"kids":[23085309,23085500,23085982],"parent":[23078173],"text":["Give up while you can.

Even with deep Kubernetes experience, we struggled at times with Istio at $previous_job, especially around:<p>- Control-plane performance on a cluster with a large-ish number of pods (thousand+) can be hit-and-miss, and &quot;what to scale up&quot; was hard to pinpoint (though admittedly it seems to be getting better)<p>- Istio upgrades often are a pain, but mostly around the actual way of deploying the upgrade, rather than the upgrade itself. For a long time there was no official Helm chart, then there was a Helm chart, then two Helm charts, now it looks like Helm is deprecated and will be removed; instead installing via `istioctl` is recommended... Some of it is due to the pain of upgrading CRDs, which is a general Kubernetes issue, but there&#x27;s still a _lot_ of churn to keep up with.<p>- Adding a new VirtualService registered to the same hostname as an existing one will be accepted by Istio (at least as of 1.4), and will proceed to _silently break all routing for new pods joining your istio cluster_! This was a bear to debug too, given how noisy and confusing the Pilot logs are, and we ended up stitching up a custom Prometheus alert around this given it bit us roughly every other week<p>- HA for control-plane components isn&#x27;t explained in the docs. Is it safe to run two Citadel pods? We did it and it seemed fine, but who knows?<p>- We sometimes ran into pathological cases where traffic would for some reason completely drop after a new deploy, and gradually pick up after the config was stremed onto sidecars, over a span of ~10-15 minutes. We never managed to debug this issue (which happened probably half a dozen times over a year), and that mere fact turned me off the complexity of Istio in general.<p>(Some of these might have been fixed in Istio 1.5+, as 1.4 was my latest experience)<p>Of course, once your setup is stable, everything is awesome: sidecar injection works flawlessy, observability is awesome, distributed tracing is a breeze, Kiali is a great crowd-pleaser when showing off features, mTLS + TLS origination mean full on-the-wire encryption without losing any of the previous benefits...

There is some questionable things here and I&#x27;ll just touch on a couple of them.<p>1) TCP checksums are a bit weak.<p>The author claims that we don&#x27;t know how many errors are not caught by TCP&#x27;s CRC and while that&#x27;s true on some level the probability of <i>bit<\/i> errors is driven by properties of the physical medium over which the packet is traveling, not the transport layer protocol in use. That&#x27;s why most, if not all, physical layers that do have a significant chance of bit errors have FEC built-in at the physical layer.<p>As a point of reference, I pulled stats on one of our servers and see about 10k bad packets out of 1.3 billion. If we assume that bit errors caused all 10k, we get an error rate of about %0.00076. Since we need two independent bit errors to trigger a state where the CRC might not catch the error, we can calculate that on this particular server we would expect .076 packets that might be corrupt in a way in which it&#x27;s even possible for the existing checksum would miss it (and it probably would still be caught).  If that is an unacceptable error rate, you should absolutely be using some way to verify message integrity at a higher layer. Still, for most applications, a fast hash that lets a bad packet through every couple of years is a good trade-off.<p>2) TCP&#x27;s over-eager in-order delivery<p>The author talks about getting packets 1,3,2 in that order in the context of a file transfer, and in that specific scenario, it <i>might<\/i> be marginally preferable.  Far more likely than out of order packets are lost packets and lost packets may never come if the connection gets closed&#x2F;reset before its retransmitted.

I think most people who think about it can agree that a lot of factory farming conditions are terrible.  Cramped quarters, lack of outdoor time, space, exercise, poor food, etc.  So working toward eliminating those problems seems incontrovertibly good to me.<p>However, let&#x27;s say hypothetically we&#x27;re only talking about farms run with a focus on animal welfare.  (And not just giving animals 10 square feet of &#x27;pasture&#x27; so they can say they&#x27;re free range, but really.)  So the issues of poor living conditions are removed, and we&#x27;re just talking about killing animals for meat.  If people stopped eating meat altogether, most farm animals simply wouldn&#x27;t be born in the first place.  Farmers aren&#x27;t going to raise animals if they can&#x27;t eventually earn money from them, obviously, and most of these animals wouldn&#x27;t exist in large numbers in the wild.  So what I&#x27;m wondering is, for a farm animal is it not possible that a decent life followed by being slaughtered for food might be superior to no life at all?<p>Obviously if we think in terms of humans, that would be horrific; we consider killing humans unnecessarily an absolute moral wrong.  If someone decided they would have a child, but only if they could murder them after some period of time, that&#x27;s obviously monstrous.  I&#x27;m just not sure that that analogy applies to farm animals who certainly are living creatures who feel pain, but don&#x27;t have the same understanding of the world and their place in it that humans do.  To me that&#x27;s the rational reason why the the idea of killing humans could be considered differently from killing other animals.  That said, I expect the real reason we instinctively feel that killing humans is wrong is more an evolutionary drive to protect our own species.<p>I do grant that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to think about when the analogy to humans is drawn.  For some I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s uncomfortable even without consciously making that connection.  I can absolutely understand why someone would therefore conclude it&#x27;s morally wrong to use animals for food.
