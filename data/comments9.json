Our core technology team has been remote first for some time, and the whole company is following suit, post-COVID.<p>I&#x27;m one of the three people running the firm, responsible amongst other things for technology across the firm and I’m posting this myself. That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm.<p>We are three years into a period of transformation from initially a fairly standard enterprise finance approach to technology to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming but are oriented towards solving their business problems with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that&#x27;s now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.<p>The language is written in D, we hosted dconf last year and will do so again this year. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.<p>It&#x27;s quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it&#x27;s commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.<p>We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren&#x27;t a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We&#x27;ve recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with our stack.<p>Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards.

The informational complexity of an OS installation was defined by the skill of the package managers.

Instead I have a few kB of YAML and ansible to build everything.<p>Case in point.  Debian 10 ships with LXC 3.  If I want LXC 4 I just script the build and installation.  The script is what needs backing up.  The OS is disposable.  In the past I might have taken care to .&#x2F;configure to install in &#x2F;opt but why bother?  It’s more work (LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs setting) so just blast it into &#x2F;use&#x2F;bin and don’t lose sleep over treading on Debian’s carefully pedicured toes.

Because anything down that low is irrelevant as an answer and is probably discarded by google anyways, which wasn’t the case when it was a search engine.<p>I’m not saying this is a bad thing. In fact, I suspect the majority of time the majority of people want an answer, and not a multitude of results.  But I think this is what leads to google search changing in a way that does not meet many people’s expectations here.<p>It means google emphasizes stuff that gets people answers quickly.

I would like to touch to some of the points here, as the arguments of the article were not very clear to me:<p>&gt; The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible – that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography&#x2F;other elements should be few in number.\nI strongly agree with this statement overall, and the article doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any counter-arguments against it. We need to serve the smallest page possible because the larger the page, the more resources it consumes, it is that simple. Every _unnecessary_ byte added to a page literally translates to more storage for the page, more processing power to prepare the page, more data being sent on the wire, more data on the client-side to interpret the given data, and all these add up to more energy being used to consume that page and more resources being wasted. If I can remove one byte from a page, this is for sure a win for everyone, one byte is one byte, whether that saving is relevant considering the scale and the effort is a whole another discussion, and the claim was never &quot;send the smallest page at all costs&quot;. Considering the time and effort, if there is a way to send a smaller page, then do it, it is no different than turning the lamp off of an empty room, just on a different scale.<p>&gt; Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page – like interesting design, for instance.\nI have never seen such a claim anywhere before, needs citation. As a developer, I think the look and the feel of the pages are as important as performance or efficiency, and web on its own can be used as an art platform, which would make this whole point irrelevant. Again, the overall point is this: if you can offer the same thing with smaller pages witha reasonable amount of effort, do it.<p>&gt; Minimalistic design is necessary.\nI have never seen such a claim, needs citation. As a user, I prefer cleaner design over fancier things, but this is neither a &quot;rule&quot; nor the industry standard. There are various research being done on this topic and I am no expert on it, but a joint research [1] done by University of Basel and Google&#x2F;YouTube User Experience Research shows that the users perceive the cleaner designs as more beautiful, making the point that if the user perception is a goal for the given webpage, then keeping things simple might actually make a difference there. Again, depends on the use-case.<p>&gt; 22.82 Mbps will reliably download very complex web pages nearly instantaneously\nThis is a pain I am living with every day. I have a 4 year old mobile phone with 6GB of RAM, and it takes at least 8-10 seconds for Medium to be usable over a ~100Mbps connection, combined with fetching the page and rendering &#x2F; interpreting it. This is exactly the point I was making above, if the page was smaller, it would have actually made a difference of seconds. The same device over the same connection at the same time opens the bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com in under a second, so, there is something to be seen there.<p>In addition to that, even if I had 1Ghz connection, a 1-byte waste is a waste, irrelevant of my connection speed. I am not talking of the effort of saving that byte, but it is important to acknowledge the waste.<p>&gt; Google has the right to dictate “Best Practices.”\nThis is a point that I agree with more than the other ones, but this seems to be a separate topic to me. The previous arguments were against the practices themselves, and this one is against the entity that is supplying those practices. Even though I agree with the majority of the points there, it would have been a more informative read if the claims and frustrations there were stated with better point-by-point explanations and data to back those claims up.

It&#x27;s interesting to see how the interpersonal dynamics among the Justices influence decisions.<p>An example of this is looking for unanimous decisions to send a strong message, whether it is for school desegregation:<p>&gt; <i>Since 1954, the Court had always been unanimous in school cases, its strong commands to desegregate joined by every member. For fifteen years, the Justices had agreed that it was essential to let the South know that not a single Justice believed in anything less than full desegregation.<\/i><p>or to reject Nixon&#x27;s executive privilege claims in Watergate [2]:<p>&gt; <i>The Nixon challenge had to be met in the strongest way possible. An eight-signature opinion would do it [...] The country would benefit from such a show of strength now.<\/i><p>These decisions required significant reconciliation between the original ideas of the Justices. They don&#x27;t operate in a vacuum of law study. The Muhammad Ali draft dodging case [3] also demonstrates this, where a 4-4 deadlock is turned into a unanimous 8-0 decision centered around a technical error which would not set precedent - the book describes Burger as considering that &quot;it might be interpreted as a racist vote&quot; if he dissented.<p>Like the link, I am also curious about why these delays have occurred, especially the most recent one. Wildly speculating, maybe the Court does not want to appear too politically activist in this moment; or maybe the members are trying to find consensus for their preferred outcome before granting cert at all.

We need reform of how abuses by law enforcement are handled.  Many things could be done besides and in addition to relaxing qualified immunity.  For example: send all cases to the States&#x27; Attorneys General rather than to the local district attorneys -- district attorneys have to work closely with police, so they have social barriers to effectively policing the police.  Another thing is that being placed on desk duty or off duty with pay is abusive when it turns out the behavior was a fireable offense or criminal, so the officer should have to pay back that pay or simply not get it to begin with.  Another thing is that police need to be trained in stepping in to their partner&#x27;s business and halt brutality (preferably before it crosses the line) -- again, there are social problems here -the blue wall- that make this difficult, so maybe, too, change partners often.<p>Also, normally, when someone gets charged with a crime, the Speedy Trial clock begins running immediately (or at arraignment), so it&#x27;s unwise to charge persons before the State is ready to try the case, and filing charges only to later drop them due to being baseless in retrospect is problematic, but perhaps for LEO there could be a notice of intent to charge whose purpose is to signal to the public that the State intends to charge the LEO if they can find enough evidence to go to trial with.<p>We need to get serious about dealing with police brutality and the system&#x27;s inability to deal with it effectively.

I was trying to read numbers on houses, then I saw flashing red and blue lights ahead and knew where my prospective passenger would be found.<p>A police officer was on watch outside; his colleague was inside wrapping things up. The police officer told me the family had called for an intervention. The fire department had already departed, as Grandpa had declined medical assistance.<p>I asked what the story was. The police officer said simply &quot;probably meth&quot;, and pointed out the right to refuse medical care is fundamental. I was supposed to take Grandpa to a motel.<p>At one point in our interaction, the police officer pointed out that it takes different kinds of cops to work in Scottsdale (for example), where some drunk kid might have a prestigious lawyer as their parent, vs. his ghetto precinct, where it&#x27;s a point of pride to have &#x27;taken a swing at a cop&#x27;.<p>Eventually Grandpa came out and got in my cab, the two police officers departed... Then grandpa wanted his son&#x27;s phone number. I started the meter and pulled forward a few feet to where his son was standing. He got the phone number, then a woman appeared... She said they just wanted him to get help, Grandpa said &quot;I just want to get some rest...&quot; &quot;oh, you can rest here...&quot; My passenger&#x27;s son paid me $6 for the 20 feet, and that was the end of that.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of collateral damage in policing... Many other passengers had stories of being pointlessly harmed through their interactions with the police. One white fellow let his medical marijuana card expire. One day he got mouthy with a cop, who searched him and found his non-medical &quot;dangerous illegal drug&quot;. My passenger said the search was probably illegal, but his overworked public defender didn&#x27;t get the charges dismissed. I remember him saying it cost him about $5000.<p>The modern police officer&#x27;s job involves, in part, hurting people who don&#x27;t actually need to be hurt. Qualified immunity allows them to do the full spectrum of their job responsibilities without being hurt themselves. Ending auto-immune drug war, and finding ways to help people who need help, are the actual reforms that policing needs to break it of its destructive tendencies."],"time":["2020-06-01 19:57:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jeffdavis"],"id":[23382159],"kids":[23382252],"parent":[23379910],"text":["I feel like we are conflating a civil issue (qualified immunity) with criminal issues like murder."],"time":["2020-06-01 20:46:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rowawey"],"id":[23387247],"kids":{},"parent":[23379910],"text":["Libertarian talking-points ahead.

What I and my peers do for a living is nothing like building rocket ships or designing amazing software applications, but it provides information and entertainment for millions of people every day.<p>Like many people on HN, I regularly use the wayback machine or other parts of the Internet Archive to track the history of websites or read out-of-copyright and public domain works. Sharing this information is important and should be continued.<p>I also believe in the concept of &quot;Fair Use&quot; for sharing and discussing excerpts of more current works.<p>But when it comes to outright republishing of in-copyright printed works, the rights of creators and publishers need to be recognized. The Internet Archive decided that its mission trumped these rights and the laws of the United States. Even when it was asked to repeatedly stop, it continued. So here we are today.<p>Someone earlier asked the question, &quot;Why can&#x27;t the publishing industry just hurry up and die?&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to put the question to those HN members who work in tech: How would you feel if someone took your output without permission, whether it&#x27;s designs or code or something else unique and hard to make? How would you feel if people cheered this on, or called for your demise, suggesting that the world would be a better place without your work?<p>The traditional publishing industry has been in economic decline for 20 years, with the number of regular readers declining and most retailers on the ropes. Few publishers or authors make much money, yet the output of authors and publishers grows every year thanks to self-publishing and other trends.<p>And some of the work published every year is fantastic. I sometimes serve as a judge for indie publishing competitions, and it&#x27;s amazing some of the work that authors and their publishers are putting out, even though very few titles will turn a profit.<p>Even if you haven&#x27;t read a book in the past year or two, it&#x27;s safe to say at some time you did, or your loved ones did, and it informed or delighted you.<p>Finally, even if you don&#x27;t personally care for the book industry, try to show some respect for what we&#x27;re doing, and the legal and business frameworks we need to do what we do."],"time":["2020-06-01 21:27:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["en4bz"],"id":[23380127],"kids":[23380161,23380341],"parent":[23379775],"text":["There&#x27;s a reason this as filed in the southern district of NY [1].

You broke into computer systems.<p>2. You needed to be curious in order to do it.<p>This took me 8 months, personally (60 hours per week). I found it a lot of fun. It could take you a lot less time or more time.<p>-----<p>I&#x27;m assuming you already know how to program, if you don&#x27;t then get the following prerequisite knowledge.<p>Step 1: do CS50 in order to learn programming and learn how to learn programming languages. What I&#x27;ve seen in students is that the first 6 weeks are experienced as more difficult than the last 6 weeks (hint: it&#x27;s because you start off with C). So don&#x27;t get discouraged. If this is not you and it is the other way around, I&#x27;ve seen that too (though, I&#x27;ve seen it less. It depends on the default mode of thinking that a person uses).<p>Step 2: do <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nand2tetris.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nand2tetris.org&#x2F;<\/a> to understand computer systems and get some assembly under your belt.<p>Step 3: if you feel like this road is too rigid, do a project that you&#x27;re interested in here. Get it out of your system now, because the above mentioned stuff took me 10 months, personally. Create a computer graphics engine with OpenGL and Java. Yes, you could do C++ but that&#x27;s complicating things for now. If you really want to though, go ahead, C++ is a fine choice if you&#x27;re burning with passion.<p>These 3 steps probably take between 4 to 8 months. Some people with a hacker mindset could do this within 2 months, or 1 month even (email me if you did!). Some people that have other stuff going on in their lives will do this in 8+ months.

I&#x27;ll describe the guy as a &quot;scraggly white guy&quot;. He was dirty, unkempt, skinny, poor spoken in an old vehicle. The cops I believe were Hispanic. So the decide he is hiding meth on him, search him, push him around a little. Then they  drive him to the hospital and force several enemas on him. Which turn up nothing. Then the hospital sends him a bill for the &quot;service&quot;. It&#x27;s egregious and he is rightfully suing. Is this a race issue?<p>If George Floyd had looked like Obama or OJ Simpson, had been driving a nice car in nice clothes and was well spoken and had no priors would he have been treated the same? I don&#x27;t think so, particularly if it appeared he had means to get a good lawyer.<p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand, I&#x27;m not saying racism isn&#x27;t an issue. It is and it exists. But the problems with police brutality seem almost as much a class issue. In fact you can see no shortage of black cops. But the problems still keep happening. Addressing this is long overdue but perhaps the lens should be expanded?<p>Thought #2:<p>People believe and are suggesting to make their voices really heard engaging in violence and unrelated property destruction is appropriate. I guess the thinking goes this will force systemic change.<p>Here&#x27;s the systemic change I see coming from that. Increased support for surveillance. Scaring the average joe middle class person into voting for law and order candidates. A few hundred people rioting aren&#x27;t going to overturn capitalism. Capitalism is well embedded and a little scratch isn&#x27;t going to harm it, nor is this kind of behavior likely to change public sentiment. However it does make it easier to lump everyone (rightfully) upset with police brutality into the camp of crazy destructive anarchists. So I think it&#x27;s going to turn out to be a counterproductive move. The massive peaceful marches were much wiser and also get effects believe it or not.

When I was a kid, I had a peaceful revolution in my country (Czechoslovakia). Here&#x27;s roughly what happened and I think is relevant:<p>- A student protest was beaten by the police, which shocked the nation. More mass protests were organized. You&#x27;re at that point now.<p>- A week later, there was a general strike. It was more a symbolic one (I think it was a day). I think it&#x27;s good to organize it because it signals to the elites and everybody - this is serious, and the citizens are willing to solve the problem peacefully and constructively. The protests can be easily misconstrued in the media, the general strike cannot.<p>- In our case, the general demands (IIRC) were as follows:<p>1. Make constitutional changes to remove the single party (the communist party) from power.<p>2. Organize a free, special elections, which would allow newly formed parties and other candidates to run.<p>3. Free all the political prisoners, and honor the general declaration of human rights in practice.<p>- As a result of this, a provisional cabinet (kind of compromise between the current elites and opposition) was established, which realized these goals in the timeframe of half a year.<p>I think in your case, you should organize a general nationwide strike, and demand the following:<p>1. A constitutional reform to end dual-party system in the US, i.e. allow more candidates and parties to run, forbid all the shenanigans around voting (like electoral college and gerrymandering and queues at polling stations and obscure voting methods and machines), reform the campaign financing.<p>2. A special elections (starting on federal level, going down eventually) under this better system.<p>3. A constitutional police reform, which will put more oversight over all the civilian and military intelligence agencies that you have in the U.S., both federal and state level.

For example, updating a context re-renders the whole component chain from producer to consumer, and trying to block useless re-renders with shouldComponentUpdate easily leads to mistakes where children don&#x27;t update when they should. Since React rendering use lazy evaluation of JSX expressions, tracking who exactly updates and when is much harder than what it might seem initially (akin to tracking mutations in a language with lazy evaluation). As this library actually tracks dependencies and only re-renders what you want, all of this bloat is avoided. One aspect that impresses me in particular is that JSX expressions actually return real DOM nodes, making it easy to keep references to them for imperative operations (not a big deal but so much nicer than React refs).<p>I&#x27;m wondering why you opted for the setState API rather than a nicer imperative API like Mobx.

I view this process as an inefficient way of serializing an idea and transmitting it over voice to another person, who has to unserialize the sounds, convert them to words, then they have to create the associations in their brain based on the meaning of those words, and then probe into the correctness of the associations by asking clarifying questions.<p>Is this really the best we can do in 2020?

It must be true, because it does happen.<p>On the other hand, while a programmer can learn from source and documentation the wheres, whens, and whats of the program, there is always the remaining question of &quot;Why?&quot;, which is central to this discussion. Here, I think good high-level examples of usage tend to do a good job of covering the inputs and outputs. But with regard to all of the intermediary states of the program... there is too much detail there to really document it. Those details evolve as an evolution more than a design. There is code added, then replaced or omitted entirely. Things are designed which work, but then are restructured for performance, organization, or to eliminate repetition.

We were under the leadership of an incredible division head and most of the folks in our group felt a deep sense of loyalty to her. Nearly all of us, including that division head, are gone now, mostly laid off. If you poll any random Hertz alumnus, the story you&#x27;re likely to hear is &quot;we had a great team and incompetent senior management.&quot;<p>To us, there is a quote in a different bloomberg article from last week [1] which strikes us as accurate. Attributed to Maryanne Keller, who is referred to in this article, it says:<p>&gt; &#x27;It’s a saga about gross mismanagement,” said Maryann Keller, a longtime auto-<p>&gt; industry consultant who was on the board of Dollar Thrifty when Hertz acquired<p>&gt; the company. “It could have been salvaged had he picked the right management,”<p>&gt; she said, referring to Icahn.&#x27;<p>Icahn lost $1.6b. Thousands of us lost our jobs. But these C-suiters sailed the company to bankruptcy over five years, each of them extracting 7 or 8 figure bonuses. The CIO who laid us all off, for example, received $6.5 million compensation that year [2]. (Sidenote, the work we were doing was replaced with Accenture consultants, who couldn&#x27;t handle it, screwing up so bad they ended up in court [3].)<p>One former colleague of mine wrote a post on LinkedIn suggesting Icahn was the unwitting victim of untenable debt situation, and while he may be correct that the debt made it difficult, Icahn can read a balance sheet and he understood the situation.<p>I can&#x27;t speak about Marinello&#x27;s performance, but I agree that the problem dates back to 2014 or even earlier. People have a widespread belief that Frissora was flying too close to the sun, driven by his aggressive personality. Despite his flaws, he had a great team of people who kept the business running, and it wasn&#x27;t Frissora who fired them all. Nobody, it turns out, was a fan of him.

The outbreak was traced to a herd of sheep in Libya&#x27;s Tripoli region, which began suffering screwworm attacks in July 1989; over the following months, the myiasis spread rapidly, infecting numerous herds across a 25,000 km2 area. Eventually, the infested region spanned from the Mediterranean coast to the Sahara Desert, threatening the more than 2.7 million animals susceptible to C. hominvorax that inhabited the area. More than 14,000 cases of large-scale myiasis due to the C. hominivorax species were documented. Traditional control methods using veterinary assessment and treatment of individual animals were insufficient to contain the widely dispersed outbreak, so the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization launched a program based on the sterile insect technique.[10] About 1.26 billion sterile flies were produced in Mexico, shipped to the infested area, and released to mate with their wild counterparts. Within months, the C. hominvorax population collapsed; by April 1991, the program had succeeded in eradicating C. hominivorax in the Eastern Hemisphere. This effort, which cost under US$100 million, was among the most efficient and successful international animal health programs in UN history.&quot;<p>Incredible!<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cochliomyia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cochliomyia<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-01 14:14:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geofft"],"id":[23375586],"kids":[23376738,23377811,23377564,23376390],"parent":[23368585],"text":["A little tangential, but having just been in an argument here with someone who advocated a &quot;nightwatchman state,&quot; I wonder what they&#x27;d think of the USDA&#x27;s efforts here (as well as the other governments&#x27;).

I feel the quality of most software today is _far_ lower than it could be, and make a conscious effort to set a high bar in terms of quality for myself and, to the best of my ability, encourage those around me to do the same.<p>If you think we could do good work together, please contact me at my email address listed above.
