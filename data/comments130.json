Everyone thought it was great and for a while the marketing people actually thought about making it a product !!! hahaha.<p>One other fun fact about rotary dials... have you ever noticed how most downtown business districts have low digit prefixes, like 221, 223 etc.  That is because it saved time dialing.  If you have to dial a bunch of 8&#x27;s and 9&#x27;s it takes forever !  hahaha.

My routine for listening and\ndiscovering new music has been to ask last.fm to play similar artists to some\nartist I already loved and liked or just let last.fm do it&#x27;s job and play its\nsuggestions for me based on my listening history.<p>This worked nicely for me. But as I&#x27;ve drifted more and more to a mousless world\nthanks to Emacs and StumpWM, I became more and more frustrated every time I&#x27;ve\nhad to change songs, add a song to my favorites or just browse an artist\npage. This back and forth between the browser and Emacs got tiring after a\nwhile. Besides, a few years back, last.fm dumped its old system where it used\nit&#x27;s own database to play songs and just played the songs directly from\nyoutube. This got me thinking that maybe I can use last.fm&#x27;s huge dataset to\ncreate my own playlists based on similarities between artists and even browse an\nartist page as I would do in a browser, only inside Emacs. And since youtube is\navailable to everybody, and mpv can play youtube links and can even do searches,\nI&#x27;ve started playing with this idea.<p>Another pain point that I&#x27;ve had is lyrics. Sure, if I can get the above thing\nworking, Emacs will know what song I&#x27;m currently playing, and fetching the\nlyrics and displaying them in a new buffer would be a no brainer. But, lots of\ntimes I&#x27;m having trouble finding the song FROM the lyrics and not the other way\naround. Especially if I&#x27;m not remembering so many words from the song. So why\nnot keeping a local database with all the lyrics I&#x27;m interested in and do a\nlocal search, from Emacs, and not from Google. Since counsel and helm are such\nnice tools, I can use those to browse through the results, hit enter, and play\nmy song. No leaving the Emacsland required.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to implement this first in Common Lisp and call it directly from the\nwindow manager (StumpWM). It worked, but it was somehow hard to use. I then\ntried to implement it directly in Emacs. The first package was lastfm.el with\nwhich I can have access to the whole last.fm database. All artist&#x27;s songs,\nsimilarities, user top tracks, everything. With authentication, the user can\nalso add loved tracks, scrobble tracks and all that. In short, everything you\ncan do from the last.fm page, you can now do from Emacs. This was a nice first\nstep. The second step was to implement the lyrics functionality. This is another\npackage, versuri.el.<p>And the last step is this package, vuiet.el. It brings together lastfm.el and\nversuri.el with mpv.el for playing songs and some org-mode for displaying and\nbrowsing artists and genres. I&#x27;ve gone wild with the playlists and created more\noptions for them than what is available by default on last.fm. I can pick a\nrandom artist from my loved songs list, for example, and then play a random song\nfrom a random artist similar to it, ad infinitum. Or, when browsing an artist\npage, I can do a search first and let counsel guide my way as to the exact name\nof the artist. Maybe I&#x27;m lazy, maybe I forget. All in all, it has been a great\ntool to listen and discover new music, for the lazy people.<p>I got mostly positive first impressions until now, and I&#x27;m sure there are more exciting features to explore with this tool which I cannot think of right\nnow. Improvements and features are waiting to happen, in short. Some bugs are\nalso lurking in there, for sure. But I&#x27;m using it for approximately two months\nalready and I really like it. I&#x27;m curious how others would use it, what features do they\nmiss, what bugs do they find, etc.<p>Thanks for trying it out and happy listening!"],"time":["2020-03-20 12:21:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bloopernova"],"id":[22640721],"kids":[22641587,22641019],"parent":[22625836],"text":["This is really nice!<p>In my nonexistent free time, I&#x27;m very slowly learning Lisp.

A few years ago, one of the vodka companies put an article into Wikipedia with all their high-end vodka hype. That did not end well for them. People started digging for reliable sources about the company, and found them. Turned out the vodka company was entirely a marketing operation. Production, bottling, and distribution was outsourced to another company, one that makes liquor products to order in addition to marketing brands of their own. That company is quite open about what they do in the trade press, so lots of reliable info was available.<p>The ethanol came from an industrial refinery sized plant in the Midwest, where corn went in and ethanol and cattle feed came out. Some of the alcohol was re-distilled for beverages and cosmetics, and some of it went to oil refineries to be blended into gasoline.  Tank cars of ethanol went by rail to the outsourcing company, which had its own railroad sidings. The outsourcing company took in ethanol, did a bit of re-distilling and polishing, added de-ionized tap water and flavoring, and bottled. Just like they did for the other thousand or so products they make. No secret in the industry, but something the general public usually doesn&#x27;t find out about.<p>It&#x27;s all bottles and labeling. The outsourcing company admits they make a thousand different brands of booze, but only have a hundred different recipes. The company moved to an area north of San Francisco a few years ago to be next door to the bottle-making plant, and have better rail access. All that ended up in Wikipedia.<p>There&#x27;s an interesting economy of scale in doing it this way. Under US law, the booze industry is divided into distillers&#x2F;brewers, wholesalers, and retailers.  Usually, the distiller&#x2F;brewer makes the final product and bottles it, there are bulk shipments of bottled goods to wholesalers, and wholesalers are basically a fulfillment operation serving retailers. But the way this outsourcing company does it, the distiller&#x2F;brewer is an industrial plant sending them tank cars of ethanol, and they make up the consumer product and distribute it to retailers.

If this works, it&#x27;s only because &quot;vodka made from milk&quot; is a neat marketing ploy that&#x27;s bringing in premium prices. If several people did this, it would end quickly.<p>My math:<p>Milk is about 5% sugar. Typically for distilling you want to get a wash of at least 10% sugar. So for this to add up milk would have to be half the price of 10 brix simple syrup, and it definitely is not. A gallon of 10 brix simple syrup would cost about 40 cents and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re just buying the sugar at a grocery store. Average price of milk is over $3&#x2F;gallon.<p>Also, you can buy enough bulk neutral spirits from MGP to fill a bottle of vodka for about 40 cents. It would take 1.6 gallons of milk to end up with that same amount vodka, and that&#x27;s if your distillery ran at 100%, which it doesn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;d be close to 2 gallons.

We now know that there is much more to classical mechanics than previously suspected. The behavior of classical systems is surprisingly rich; derivation of the equations of motion, the focus of traditional presentations of mechanics, is just the beginning. Classical systems display a complicated array of phenomena such as nonlinear resonances, chaotic behavior, and transitions to chaos.<p>&gt; Traditional treatments of mechanics concentrate most of their effort on the extremely small class of symbolically tractable dynamical systems. We concentrate on developing general methods for studying the behavior of systems, whether or not they have a symbolic solution. Typical systems exhibit behavior that is qualitatively different from the solvable systems and surprisingly complicated. We focus on the phenomena of motion, and we make extensive use of computer simulation to explore this motion.<p>They are basically making the computer do the work, with emphasis on unambiguous, computable notation.<p>(It could be considered a companion to SICP.)"],"time":["2020-03-20 19:17:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["westurner"],"id":[22644620],"kids":{},"parent":[22637402],"text":["Average of a <i>finite<\/i> series: There&#x27;s a statistics module in Python 3.4+:<p><pre><code>  X = [1, 2, 3]\n\n  from statistics import mean, fmean\n  mean(X)\n\n  # may or may not be preferable to\n  sum(X) &#x2F; len(X)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;statistics.html#statistics.fmean\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;statistics.html#statistics...<\/a><p>Product of a terminating iterable:<p><pre><code>  import operator\n  from functools import reduce\n  # from itertools import accumulate\n  reduce(operator.mul, X)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nVector norm:<p><pre><code>  from numpy import linalg as LA\n  LA.norm(X)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.scipy.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;reference&#x2F;generated&#x2F;numpy.linalg.norm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.scipy.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;reference&#x2F;generated&#x2F;numpy.l...<\/a><p>Function domains and ranges can be specified and checked at compile-time with type annotations or at runtime with type()&#x2F;isinstance() or with something like pycontracts or icontracts for checking preconditions and postconditions.<p>Dot product:<p><pre><code>  Y = [4, 5, 6]\n  np.dot(X, Y)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.scipy.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;reference&#x2F;generated&#x2F;numpy.dot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.scipy.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;reference&#x2F;generated&#x2F;numpy.d...<\/a><p>Unit vector:<p><pre><code>  X &#x2F; np.linalg.norm(X)<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-03-21 06:06:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kstrauser"],"id":[22639650],"kids":{},"parent":[22637402],"text":["Seeing `for i in range(len(lst)): lst[i]...` gives me hives.

And I <i>have<\/i> experienced the “cabin fever” feeling before... but not everywhere I’ve lived. In some environments, it happened easily and immediately; in others, it never did. I’ve tried to think about my environment at each juncture to figure out if the situations where I <i>did<\/i> experience “cabin fever” had anything in common.<p>Every time I experienced the symptoms described in the article (restlessness, lightheadedness, insomnia, irritability, etc.) I was living in a modern, rather-well-sealed apartment building; or was on a long road-trip in a modern, rather-well-sealed car; or was on a long plane flight; or was staying in a modern hotel room in a high-rise; or I was camping in a tent or camper-trailer.<p>Meanwhile, I’ve never experienced these symptoms while living in an old, drafty brick building (repurposed office building); or while living in a Victorian-era farmhouse; or while staying in a low-rent motel; or while camping under the stars.<p>My conclusion is that “cabin fever” is a feeling you get when your living space is not well-ventilated. Specifically, when there’s no way to create a through-draft of air, so even opening windows won’t force out the air deeper in the home—leading to that air becoming stale, creating a built-up “cloud” of CO2, other gaseous bodily wastes, and exhaled aerosolized water droplets (you know, those things that viruses travel on.) It happens faster when more people are cooped up together in a small space, because this cloud of stale air gets denser, faster; and because there’s less time when everyone is gone at once, where the air can “recharge” by slow through-insulation-barrier gas exchange.<p>If the problem is stale air, then just “going outside” is only a temporary fix, because the air will usually be just as stuffy when you return (unless you leave for hours and leave your windows open and fans on.) On the other hand, you <i>can<\/i> be fine while inside indefinitely, if you open a window and then sit right beside it, where the outside air can reach you. <i>But<\/i> this will only work if there’s enough wind to push the air into the house a small bit; <i>and<\/i> it seemingly has no effect—possibly for purely-psychological reasons?—if the air outside is humid, as it is in e.g. Hong Kong. (But going outside in humid places still works for temporary relief. Weird.)<p>And that last realization leads me to the secondary conclusion that the (or my, at least) human physiology is responding mainly to aerosolized-moisture-content in the air (in some way that’s distinct from responding to the evaporated humidity) as a proxy metric for the other, harder-to-sense air-quality measures. So, in theory, you <i>might<\/i> be able to reduce the qualitative of “cabin fever” just by buying a dehumidifier.<p>But really, I wouldn’t recommend it; there’s pretty good documentation about the subtler, less-self-apparent effects that a high CO2 concentration in a room can have on people, and on how much CO2 does tend to build up in closed or not-well-ventilated rooms—especially people’s bedrooms at night.<p>Relevant links:<p>- Tom Scott’s <i>This is Your Brain on Stale Air<\/i> — <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1Nh_vxpycEA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1Nh_vxpycEA<\/a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sick_building_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sick_building_syndrome<\/a> (when this same thing happens in offices)<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feng_shui\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feng_shui<\/a> (which, at its practical core, seems to be about arranging the contents of living spaces to avoid having objects act as <i>baffles<\/i> to the through-flow of air)"],"time":["2020-03-20 15:43:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jeadfa"],"id":[22650756],"kids":{},"parent":[22636047],"text":["Getting Your Travel Information , Travel Guides, Discover, Plan, Destination information if you Love Travel .

Did the disease simply spread in close quarters where many elderly live? Elderly folks aren’t necessarily out and about drinking espresso and touching surfaces yet alone having younger asymptomatic carriers cough on them.<p>I wonder if Italy is similar to a Kirkland, Washington situation.

He doesn&#x27;t assert that the policy response has gone too far; instead, he asserts that in the absence of good data on the pandemic, it&#x27;s difficult to know whether the policy response is too much or not enough. In my view, on this point he&#x27;s exactly right.<p>From the actual Stat article:<p>&quot;At a time when everyone needs better information, from disease modelers and governments to people quarantined or just social distancing, we lack reliable evidence on how many people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who continue to become infected. Better information is needed to guide decisions and actions of monumental significance and to monitor their impact.&quot;<p>On &quot;we lack reliable evidence&quot;: his point is that we don&#x27;t have what we need, namely an accurate denominator in calculations of morbidity and mortality. &quot;We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300.&quot; He&#x27;s not wrong! In epidemiology, accurately estimating, say, case fatality rates is notoriously difficult - especially in the middle (or the beginning!) of an epidemic. Given the issues we&#x27;re all familiar with surrounding the lack of testing, this should come as no surprise.<p>On &quot;better information is needed&quot;: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that far off-base to say that in the absence of (what asserts is) good data, it&#x27;s impossible to calibrate policy responses to 2019-nCov so that you&#x27;re saving as many lives as possible while doing as little damage to the rest of society (e.g. economy) as possible at the same time. This suggestion is eminently reasonable: &quot;The most valuable piece of information for answering [questions about how many people will die of the coronavirus] would be to know the current prevalence of the infection in a random sample of a population and to repeat this exercise at regular time intervals to estimate the incidence of new infections.&quot;.<p>Ioannidis (a physician and an epidemiologist) has made a career out of shedding light on science&#x27;s mistakes and blind spots, and rightly so. I think the controversy surrounding this piece is overblown: the &quot;fiasco&quot; he&#x27;s talking about is not a policy response fiasco, but an &quot;evidence fiasco&quot; - without knowing (or, in the US, even attempting to know) the true prevalence and incidence of coronavirus, it&#x27;s impossible to say how well we&#x27;re responding.<p><i><\/i>* Edit &#x2F; addendum:<p>Counterpoints to Ioannidis to the effect of &quot;well this is all moot anyway, when faced with high uncertainty about a really scary thing, you act as cautiously as possible regardless of the quality of your data&quot; have a lot of merit. If you&#x27;re a policymaker right now and you see what&#x27;s happening in Italian ERs, hell yes you implement social distancing on a mass scale, maybe full lockdown &#x2F; shelter in place, etc.<p>But these two sets of tools aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive; we have a lot of smart and capable people, plus a lot of money, to sic on each. We can allow policymakers to react strongly and cautiously right now to maybe save lives, <i>while also<\/i> setting up the sorts of basic epidemiological studies Ioannidis calls for: repeated random samples of a representative chunk of a population (e.g. the US population) with the ability to test everyone for corona (preferably using multiple different tests) in order to accurately estimate the denominator."],"time":["2020-03-20 01:53:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["majkinetor"],"id":[22637821],"kids":[22639367],"parent":[22632369],"text":["I suspect that certain pharma drugs given to elder people for cardiovascular and diabetes diseases may be in part responsible for current state.

This happened around 10 months ago and it involves hash browns.<p>Due to mouth radiation I had to have all my teeth pulled and then two months of radiation and chemo just made my mouth a nightmare. I hit the point where trying to get down warm chicken broth was impossible. Everything I tried to eat just resulted in hours of pain to get down a swallow. So I didn&#x27;t eat for around six months. I have a feeding tube for slurry to provide nutrients. It takes a bit to get used to getting full without using your mouth. There is a bit of a disconnect between your mouth and stomach.<p>I hit a point where my neck muscles were so unused they almost stopped working. I couldn&#x27;t even swallow a tiny pill. So the doctors started talking about putting a balloon down my throat and inflating and deflating it a bunch of times to get the muscles working again. Fuck everything about that.<p>So I decided to just suffer and I started eating the blue box. (mac and cheese, kraft dinner for those up north). It was all I ate for months. I like noodles al dente but I had to overcook them to the point of mush so I could swallow them. Then I slowly worked my way to firm once I was able to normally swallow again.<p>But back to the greatest day of my life. I had only eaten mac and cheese for months and I decided to get adventurous. We had frozen hash browns in the freezer. So I cooked some in a ton of butter. My neck was still really raw so I barely browned them and covered them in ketchup to help them slide down since I can&#x27;t chew anything.<p>It worked and was amazing. Then I had the bright idea to cover them in cheese so I ran up to Safeway and got a bag of shredded cheese. That was next level shit. I used to love the fried tater-tops covered in cheese and ketchup from Taco-Time.<p>But yeah. I was under 100 pounds and I put on about 15 pounds in a matter of weeks. That was 95% hash browns and Safeway cheese.<p>I think I need to put the internet down. Everything is so negative.

This requires a Quality Management System [2] (QMS) and very specific training for everyone involved.  Pretty much any manufacturer that is not already manufacturing in accordance with 21 CFR Part 820 [3] and related regulations will have a ton of work to establish a suitable QMS.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that at least some auto workers already have some taste of working under the eye of regulators and auditors and as such their adjustment to GMP has the potential to be smooth.  The days of leaving empty beverage containers in the hollow of a door are long past, right?<p>Management that is not experienced in FDA regulations will try to ignore or short-cut them.  In the best of cases, this turns into fines and manufacturing delays.  In the worst of cases, it turns into deaths due to defective product or manufacturing delays.  Every level of management needs to be experienced in GxP.<p>The most reasonable path to getting a QMS in place and having compliant manufacturing would seem to be to have the manufacturing capacity be leant to an established manufacturer that has a solid QMS, the expertise to adapt it to the new reality, and a solid relationship with the FDA.  That is, the auto manufacturer&#x27;s management would need to be out of the picture or 100% subservient to the experienced medical device manufacturer.<p>Once that is worked out, I suspect that manufacture of the devices is comparatively easy.
