There is no good reason for it to be privatized and many Americans lives will be negatively affected by such a change.<p>1) There are already private mail carriers (FedEx, UPS, et al.). They do not have an obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner anywhere in the continental US and overseas territories. This is fine if you are a city dweller, but private mail carriers notoriously do not guarantee &quot;last mile&quot; delivery. This will cut off many isolated rural communities for whom the USPS is a lifeline to the outside world.<p>2) USPS receives no tax dollars for their services. They are completely self-sustaining. A Republican congress forced an insane burden for the USPS to pre-fund 75 years worth of pension obligations: there are future postal workers who have not been born yet that the post office must plan pensions for. No other government entity has such an obligation - this is the only reason the USPS is in a financial problem and it is a manufactured crisis. There is no &quot;small government&quot; argument here since your tax dollars don&#x27;t fund them.<p>3) The USO pledge states that the USPS must offer affordable rates to customers. Privatized companies have a market incentive to keep prices low, yes, but in practice there is no way that there won&#x27;t be price collusion&#x2F;fixing if a handful of private carriers become market dominant. Antitrust is laughably weak in the US right now.<p>4) DeJoy is using the manufactured crisis from pension obligations as a canard for slashing worker benefits and overpay to the bone. He is intentionally gutting the USPS so the Republicans can point at it and whine about how socialized enterprises don&#x27;t work as well as private ones. This is why all mail is so delayed right now: postal workers rely on overtime to ensure that all mail is delivered in a timely manner."],"time":["2020-08-12 22:15:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scabbycakes"],"id":[24136521],"kids":{},"parent":[24135668],"text":["I imagine Trump&#x27;s installed someone in charge of the USPS to destabilize it in a hurry in order to erode confidence in the USPS to be able to handle mail-in voting.<p>Perhaps he&#x27;ll get the public behind him enough to somehow stop mail-in voting if the next few months the mail system falls apart.

They have been traumatic and damaging, both to individuals and to Mozilla overall.”<p>From <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebb.org&#x2F;bkuhn&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;gerv.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebb.org&#x2F;bkuhn&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;gerv.html<\/a><p>“I bring up Gerv&#x27;s open-mindedness because I know that many people didn&#x27;t find him so, but, frankly, I think those folks were mistaken. It is well documented publicly that Gerv held what most would consider particularly “conservative values”. And, I&#x27;ll continue with more frankness: I found a few of Gerv&#x27;s views offensive and morally wrong. But Gerv was also someone who could respectfully communicate his views. I never felt the need to avoid speaking with him or otherwise distance myself. Even if a particular position offended me, it was nevertheless clear to me that Gerv had come to his conclusions by starting from his (a priori) care and concern for all of humanity. Also, I could simply say to Gerv: I really disagree with that so much, and if it became clear our views were just too far apart to productively discuss the matter further, he&#x27;d happily and collaboratively find another subject for us to discuss. Gerv was a reasonable man. He could set aside fundamental disagreements and find common ground to talk with, collaborate with, and befriend those who disagreed with him. That level of kindness and openness is rarely seen in our current times.”<p>Here is an article another person who knew Gervase Markham who refutes Mitchell Bakers account <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;762345&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;762345&#x2F;<\/a> .

The execs flew first class, stayed in fancy hotels, and had very expensive dinners and retreats - sometimes in the high five-figures. This is not even included in comp. One time, the CFO sent out a missive urging everyone to stay in AirBnB to save money and the execs (literally the following week) booked $500&#x2F;night rooms at a hotel in NYC. I think the moment that made it clear as day was during a trip to Hawaii for the company all hands. The plane was a 737 so you had to walk past first class. These all hands are a huge deal for families - many were struggling down the aisle, carrying booster seats, etc. And they were passing two of the C-levels sitting in giant first-class seats sipping tropical cocktails.

It’s a huge improvement in the way we reason about UI and it’s very hard to go back to imperative DOM manipulation once you get used to this.<p>IMO, UI structure and state management of the UI are orthogonal concerns. Trying to make these part of the same problem - a &#x27;Component&#x27; - is how you wind up in the Angular-style trap where you can never quite cover 100% of the use cases, so you have to keep adding new leaky abstractions to compensate for prior ones. Passing events back up the chain is a particularly egregious constraint when you are trying to do things with the UI that the modeling does not agree with on paper (i.e. modals, status bars and nav menus are children of whom? One big global component?).<p>I have made this realization recently when working with Blazor. The statefulness of a UI is a completely different thing from the visual presentation of the UI. We do one-way binding into UI (e.g. foreach over collections to build table rows). But, stateful concerns are injected as scoped services (i.e. per user session&#x2F;request). UI events are passed into the state service methods directly, and the UI is redrawn on top of the updated state. Each state service can only be mutated by way of one of its public methods.<p>This approach allows for us to build &amp; test our UI state machines to deterministic levels of correctness without a single line of HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS or manual user testing being involved. Once we have the state machine figured out, we can build whatever arbitrary UI we want on top of it."],"time":["2020-08-11 19:58:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sharpercoder"],"id":[24121067],"kids":[24121170,24121219,24121249,24121113,24121891,24121639,24125342,24121168,24128889,24121900,24121401],"parent":[24120311],"text":["The promise of Rust is safe and fast low-level development.

The Rust world is much more open, responsive, and caring about user concerns. Rust isn&#x27;t afraid to offer unsafe escape hatches even if they&#x27;re not pretty or elegant. With Rust you have the added advantage of being able to use the language for the entire stack, both front- and back-end.

A standard which marks text as &quot;data&quot; would let a user know what they&#x27;re saving, and let them point a camera in the general direction of some text, and all the relevant info be extracted and organized. (Think addresses, receipts, etc.) I already use my phone to remember lots of things - like I take a picture of the back of my DSL router for the access codes printed there, or take a picture of my bike tire to remember the size of the tube I need, etc.<p>Or if transparency isn&#x27;t important, given we have 4K cameras now, imagine if there was a popular standard using steganography! I can imagine movie posters having showtimes, director and actor info, URLs for streaming it online, etc. all baked into the image."],"time":["2020-08-11 21:56:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Bokanovsky"],"id":[24125758],"kids":[24128858],"parent":[24119124],"text":["For those interested in the creation of the QR code.\nJapanese TV Station NHK World have a 15 minute documentary charting it&#x27;s creation - \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;nhkworld&#x2F;en&#x2F;ondemand&#x2F;video&#x2F;2072031&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;nhkworld&#x2F;en&#x2F;ondemand&#x2F;video&#x2F;2072031&#x2F;<\/a><p>It also features interesting details such as how they figured out the ratio of the marker squares should be."],"time":["2020-08-11 22:44:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jrexilius"],"id":[24120265],"kids":{},"parent":[24119124],"text":["This was a good exploration of your approach.

Our platform allows users to create and publish their own content. Our primary target is education, teachers and students. But naturally it&#x27;s being abused by spammers. It&#x27;s been an interesting cat and mouse game to counter them.<p>- One time, they used our platform to publish links to their streaming websites for the quarter finals of the 2018 Champions League. Suddenly we ended up being first result on Google for &quot;arsenal v barcelona&quot;. It was fifteen minutes before the game so you can imagine that we got <i>a lot<\/i> of traffic. On the one hand it was kind of flattering that the SEO ranking of our domain was so strong. On the other hand, it wasn&#x27;t great nor beneficial for the platform to be abused like that. As a counter-measure, we decided to block indexing of project pages for 24 hours when they&#x27;re first made public. The spammers never came back.<p>- Another time, we got an email from AWS that our SES bounce rate was 15%, and it was rising fast. Being blocked from sending emails by AWS would have been a disaster. It turned out that our invitation system was abused. A creator of a project can invite an external person by email. That person receives an email saying &quot;John Doe invites you to collaborate on &#x27;A nice project about the 2018 Champions League&#x27;&quot; with a link to the project. Replace &quot;A nice project about the 2018 Champions League&quot; by a Chinese ad and you&#x27;ve got yourself spammers who are sending thousands of emails a second to a random collection of email addresses. Naturally a lot of these bounce, which caused AWS to warn us. So we had to start verifying the MX validity of invited email addresses and throttle the system to a maximum of 100 emails in a window of 24 hours.<p>- We still get a lot of spammers publishing obvious spammy projects. One thing that has helped is the Clearbit Risk API. You send them an email address and it comes back with an assessment of how spammy the address is. We use it for certain domains (protonmail.com, yandex.com,...) and it frequently flags someone as a spammer right after signup. They can still use the platform but can&#x27;t make stuff public, completely defeating the purpose of them being spammy.<p>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll keep finding creative ways to get around the limitations we put in.

These are accepted as proof of identity only, and grant no additional privileges beyond proof of residency within the federation.<p>Second, each member state issues their own photo IDs following their own independent processes. These are neither proof of citizenship to the federation’s border control, nor to other countries, and data sharing agreements historically did not exist between the states and the federation.<p>The member states of the EU issue passports as the state ID card, and requires each member state to accept those passports as approximately equal to their own for most intents and purposes.
