It remains unclear whether any possess human-like curiosity. We previously proposed three criteria for applying the term curiosity to animal behavior: (1) the subject is willing to sacrifice reward to obtain information, (2) the information provides no immediate instrumental or strategic benefit, and (3) the amount the subject is willing to pay depends systematically on the amount of information available. In previous work on information-seeking in animals, information generally predicts upcoming rewards, and animals’ decisions may therefore be a byproduct of reinforcement processes. Here we get around this potential confound by taking advantage of macaques’ ability to reason counterfactually (that is, about outcomes that could have occurred had the subject chosen differently). Specifically, macaques sacrificed fluid reward to obtain information about counterfactual outcomes. Moreover, their willingness to pay scaled with the information (Shannon entropy) offered by the counterfactual option. These results demonstrate the existence of human-like curiosity in non-human primates according to our criteria, which circumvent several confounds associated with less stringent criteria.<\/i><p>Paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0010027719300642\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S00100...<\/a><p>Non-paywalled version: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;biorxiv&#x2F;early&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;291708.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;biorxiv&#x2F;early&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;291...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-13 11:57:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24142646],"kids":{},"parent":[24139261],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-13 14:28:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["pul"],"id":[24141299],"kids":{},"parent":[24139261],"text":["This has surprising similarities with data science theory: multi-armed bandit with a decreasing-epsilon strategy (children) or an epsilon-first strategy (adults)."],"time":["2020-08-13 11:00:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kingkawn"],"id":[24143955],"kids":{},"parent":[24139261],"text":["That’s why we train them to want rewards first, then use that to get them to do what we want"],"time":["2020-08-13 16:57:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ZainRiz"],"id":[24149349],"kids":{},"parent":[24139261],"text":["I can attest to this.<p>I tried offering my toddler a thousand dollars.

Unfortunately there is no political incentive to do this—the Republicans will almost certainly attempt to restore a situation by which blacks end up in the grand scheme of things disadvantaged, with no correction at university admissions, whilst the progressive narrative is controlled by mostly white liberal bourgeois class interests, and therefore will continue to find some other group to make the sacrifices it deems (not incorrectly in this case!) necessary, and happens to create not inconsiderable employment for them, inter alia—indeed, one might go so far as to say is necessary for their broader control of the capitalist system by holding onto cultural power within education."],"time":["2020-08-14 01:45:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["three_seagrass"],"id":[24149968],"kids":[24150277,24150601,24150399,24150065,24150078,24150110],"parent":[24149352],"text":["Lots of soapboxing in the comments here.<p>The Justice Dept made the exact same allegations against Harvard, and last year a Federal Judge found that Harvard was constitutionally in the clear.<p>SCOTUS has said that race can be narrowly used in admissions to promote diversity, which Yale says they are doing.

I want to present an alternative viewpoint. It&#x27;s not a monopoly issue, it is an anti-competitive issue.<p>In Canada, we have three major cell carriers. None of them has a monopoly, or anything close to it. None of them has even 50% market share.<p>You can have a 10 GB smartphone plan with Rogers for $75. If you don&#x27;t like that, you can switch to Bell&#x27;s 10 GB plan for $75. If you don&#x27;t like Bell, of course you can switch to Telus&#x27;s 10 GB plan for, wait for it, $75.<p>The Big 3 operate smaller brands with fewer bells and whistles and lower costs. You can get a 4 GB cell plan from Koodo (Telus subsidiary) for $50, or from Fido (Rogers subsidiary) for $50, or from Virgin Mobile (Bell subsidiary) for $50.<p>Sometimes one of them has promotional pricing, like $45 instead of $50 for 4GB. The other two offer the same pricing for the same duration. Sometimes one of them increases their prices by $5 a month citing reasons such as infrastructure investments, lower Canadian dollar value, or inflation. The other two increase their prices by the same amount a couple of days later.<p>And none of this is collusion in the legal sense. They don&#x27;t gather in smoke-filled rooms and decide how to screw over their customers. There is not back-channel communication whatsoever. And it is not because the competition is so perfect the prices have been commoditized. In fact, Canada has some of the highest cell plan prices in the world, even adjusting for factors such as population density and GDP.<p>It&#x27;s just that the big companies have decided to stop competing. If you live in, say Alberta or Ontario or BC, you have three options and they are all the same overpriced crap. Cell carriers in Canada are not a monopoly, but you don&#x27;t have to be a monopoly to harm customers with anti-competitive behaviour. Apple and Google, Android and iOS do not have a monopoly or a collusion agreement. But they are harming the customers all the same."],"time":["2020-08-13 21:35:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xoxoy"],"id":[24147018],"kids":[24147587,24147208,24148091,24147562,24147395],"parent":[24146902],"text":["Fortnite of course expected this: seems like they’ve prepared a short video mocking Apple’s old super bowl ad 1984 to premiere in an hour <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;fortnitegame&#x2F;status&#x2F;1293984290326433792?s=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;fortnitegame&#x2F;status&#x2F;1293984290326433792?...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-13 21:06:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["epaga"],"id":[24146997],"kids":[24147062,24147111,24149221],"parent":[24146902],"text":["This is not surprising to me, and I have to say, I completely agree with it.

Of course they attempt to make it look like this isn&#x27;t what they want by not demanding a cash payoff, but the obvious play is that if they win then a) they will be able to sell V-Bucks again for presumably a higher margin, and b) they will launch their own Epic app&#x2F;game store and take a small cut of those transactions.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;6&#x2F;21249497&#x2F;fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;6&#x2F;21249497&#x2F;fortnite-350-mill...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-13 22:46:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TheRealSteel"],"id":[24149062],"kids":{},"parent":[24147486],"text":["I have zero sympathy for a corporation that thinks everyone should have to pay them a 30% cut of everything, but that they shouldn&#x27;t have to pay any tax themselves."],"time":["2020-08-13 23:01:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["azuriten"],"id":[24147678],"kids":[24147787,24148341],"parent":[24147486],"text":["Looks like this was the plan all long.

The people investigating these attacks likely only have a rudimentary understanding of TCP&#x2F;IP, have virtually no ability to read or write code, and mostly are trained to build and enforce policy.

The media focussed on the man rather than the info he provided, so the conversation was &#x27;where was he?&#x27;, &#x27;where was his girlfriend?&#x27;, etc - that told me everything.

Does feel like this could have been a tweet that said the necessary condition for successful ML solution is applying it to a problem that has asymmetric upside.<p>Great for telling people they should get tested for diseases, terrible for diagnosis. In the alerting first case, consequences of being wrong are no better than base rate as they wouldn&#x27;t have been tested otherwise, and the upside saves a life. In the latter diagnosis case, the consequences of being wrong are catastrophic, and it is substituting for the best available judgment. Similarly, it&#x27;s great for fraud detection, terrible for making credit decisions, because the false negative rate is essentially externalized. It&#x27;s good for finding opportunities, bad for providing services. So funnels and conversion pipelines it&#x27;s great for.<p>So perhaps there&#x27;s an ironic Turing test for ML solutions that is related to the relationship between the size of a group of people and the effect of mean reversion of their collective intelligence on their behaviour makes them indifferent to the perceived intelligence of the model, whereas a given individual will find the results of the model unsatisfying. From an indifference perspective, AI can fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but no confusion matrix satisfies all the people all the time. Economically, ML will be useful for creating simple and cheap services that people who can&#x27;t afford better will use, and substitute up from them when they can afford better, known as &quot;inferior goods.&quot; There may be a hard limit on ML providing &quot;normal goods,&quot; to individuals at scale for this reason. Lots of money to be made, but lots to be wasted tweaking your ROC curve to in the hope of creating a normal good.<p>I yell from the rooftops every chance I get that &quot;the confusion matrix is the product.&quot; That is, your FP&#x2F;FN&#x2F;TP&#x2F;TN rate is your product, and you are optimizing your system for the weights your customer assigns to those variables.<p>There is another ML&#x2F;DL use case I&#x27;m hacking on that is about  enabling privacy, but even this reduces to the asymmetry of the upside&#x2F;downside of the confusion matrix.

That&#x27;s 90% reduction.<p>– When I approximate AQI, it&#x27;s common for outdoor air (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfpub.epa.gov&#x2F;airnow&#x2F;index.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfpub.epa.gov&#x2F;airnow&#x2F;index.cfm<\/a>) to be in the &quot;Moderate&quot; scale, and my indoor air to be at the floor (best) of &quot;Healthy&quot;.<p>– The IQAir HealthPro Plus (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iqair.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;room-air-purifiers&#x2F;healthpro-series\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iqair.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;room-air-purifiers&#x2F;healthpro-series<\/a>) is incredibly effective. It lowers particle count to <i>zero<\/i> at its outlet.<p>– My other air filters are still effective, even though they don&#x27;t get the particle count down to zero. They are the RabbitAir minusa2, and two Blueair Classic 205 units.<p>I was also very surprised when I carried the particle counter around my neighborhood. The quiet streets often have worse air quality than the arterial! And the particle count on the arterial was just as bad as on the Interstate 5 overpass. I think the better airflow on the arterials may help get the pollution out of the area. I really expected the quite streets to have fewer pollution particles.<p>I have not ventured into testing for C02, other gasses, or Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). But I&#x27;m very curious and may try to measure that myself someday soon."],"time":["2020-08-13 22:21:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["germinalphrase"],"id":[24146630],"kids":[24146827],"parent":[24143979],"text":["I live about two blocks from a four lane road (functionally - a highway).

(Or at least, prepared in a way that several of its constituent subsystems &quot;fall into&quot; that state.) Transitions to the lower-energy stable state require overcoming a barrier, and jumping over that barrier is of course faster at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures you essentially have a slow internal self-heating from the periodical jumps of subsystems through this forbidden region by thermal excitations, not unlike phosphorescence having to tunnel through an energetically forbidden region; this self-heating prevents the thing from cooling down fast enough.<p>Actual applicability to water is kind of harder to evaluate. I&#x27;ve long thought that you could indeed have an Mpemba effect caused by persistent induced convective currents in a  fluid: so a hotter thing placed into a fridge might create a more dramatic internal flow as its outer boundary layer cools and changes in density, the convective current would certainly increase the slope of the hotter cooling system beyond the naive temperature scaling, and might then persist as a physical difference even after the two systems arrive at the same temperature, leading to a faster cooling speed of the convective system that &quot;started out hotter&quot;.

I was given a freeze-pump-thaw protocol to follow in order to remove oxygen from a copolymer solution. Basically we used liquid nitrogen to freeze the mixture, then used a vacuum pump to remove the gases above the mixture. When we thawed the mixture, the dissolved oxygen would escape, in order to equilibrate with the amount above the surface. I repeated this for a few cycles. It was all done with sealed glassware.<p>Unfortunately, the glassware kept cracking during the thaw stage. This went on for a couple of months, till finally my supervisor reviewed the procedure, and realised that, whether cracking occurred, depended upon the relative concentrations of the two polymers. If I recall correctly, the problem occurred when the polymer with the lower freezing point (which, thereby, thawed first) was present at a lower concentration. It was basically trapped inside the other still-frozen polymer, and expanding, as it thawed ... till crack!<p>The solution was surprisingly simple. Change the method.  Bubble nitrogen through the mixture to drive out (sparge) the oxygen. Replacing the oxygen with nitrogen was beneficial, as nitrogen didn&#x27;t interfere with the copolymerisation reaction.<p>The main problem was that I had lost two months of experimental time, and this was just the start of a series of experiments and instrumental analyses.

For this particular day, the number of carrots eaten can be seen in animals_and_carrots.csv.<p>At the end of each day, Farmer Fred often asks aggregate question about how many carrots everyone ate.

The first sentence tripped me up. “ You should go to bed 5-6 90 minute sleep cycles before your wake up time.”<p>a. It should be 90-minute.

Career software person here.<p>Here&#x27;s some unsolicited advice for improvements:<p>* Focus relentlessly on the calculator experience.  Why am I pressing &quot;calculate&quot;?  What are some ways you could rework it so that I can give quicker input and get more meaningful output?  Your goal should be to reduce friction.  Maybe let me type in the time in addition to having the android-style clock widget.  Definitely show me a series of clocks as I&#x27;m updating the picker as I change the time.  It&#x27;s important to let your users play so that they can intuit about the concepts.  Also, maybe show extra times for oversleep&#x2F;undersleep, but accented in such a way that the user knows they&#x27;re not healthy choices.  Maybe include &quot;in x minutes&quot; with the times too.  Maybe start the page with the current time + 8 hours selected, showing the live updating output.<p>* Bury all the sleep health and science stuff.  It&#x27;s probably great for SEO, but the star of the show here is the calculator widget.  If anything, maybe instead have a short promotional video that explains the science&#x2F;health stuff briefly and explains what the calculator does.<p>* This would be more useful on my phone, possibly as a native widget.  And it would be useful paired with an alarm clock.  I&#x27;d really like an app (ideally with a widget) that shows me wakeup times based on the current time and lets me quickly set alarms.  I always check my phone right before I go to sleep anyway, so it would be easy to click a widget and get proper alarms set.  You&#x27;re probably going to need to learn React Native at some point anyway, might as well do it now.<p>Take this simple calculator, polish it to absolute perfection, give it away for free, and promote it wherever you can.  Having one successful app at your age, even if you don&#x27;t make a dime, will open up so much opportunity for you that it&#x27;s 100% worth it.<p>Also, it&#x27;s super hard to get software &quot;right&quot;, and it&#x27;s a drifting target.  Look at how much Apple and Google have changed their basic Clock apps over the years.  I think doing everything perfectly is usually terrible advice, but at your age and with the simplicity of this project, it&#x27;s worth trying to be a perfectionist.  You&#x27;ll learn that everything is a lot harder than it looks and that you should be terrified of software development :)<p>Side rant:  OP led with &quot;I&#x27;m 15&quot;, which makes sense, and this wouldn&#x27;t have frontpaged without that context.  I understand that touches a nerve with people who believe the frontpage should be 100% dictated by objective merits.

One of the weirder ones is glue-chipped glass[0]. You roughen the surface of glass, spread hide glue with a high gram strength on it, and as the glue dries, it contracts, chipping out the glass leaving a neat texture. One has to be quite careful disposing of the glue&#x2F;glass waste. Dogs will apparently eat that, to their considerable detriment.<p>Fish glue is also still available from luthier suppliers; it has a higher tack than hide glue.<p>My favorite glue for general woodworking is Old Brown Glue[1], which is a hide glue that&#x27;s been modified to remain liquid at room temperature (it&#x27;s still best applied warm though). It has a longer open time than hot hide glue (which is a gelatin at room temperature), while retaining all of the benefits of hide glues generally: reversability and low creep. For a neat demonstration of the reversability, I highly recommend his column veneering video [2].<p>I did a project with a large bent lamination, and I was looking into the modern adhesives people typically use. Unibond and epoxy both have pretty substantial health concerns. You don&#x27;t typically use yellow glue (Titebond, etc) because they do have a lot of creep, which can lead to your lamination changing shape over time.

They pay with their personal data. This is exchanged into regular currency via the advertising industry. Services that cannot or will not exploit this income stream will inevitably run into financial trouble.<p>Economically, spending personal data makes sense for a lot of people. Unlike money, you generate personal data continuously and effortlessly. You can spend it multiple times, many people spend it with little obvious downside, and the process is completely frictionless. Consider the effort involved with setting up, maintaining and eventually cancelling a subscription to a money-financed service, vs. a data-financed one, which you simply start and stop using at your leisure.<p>Some people do not like this situation. They object to the entire notion of personal data being used as a currency. They attempt to prevent it via advocacy and legislation. Advocacy does not seem to work, at least on its own. Many people, if you explain the situation to them in terms of privacy, will express a theoretical desire not to trade away their personal data. However, their behaviour is not consistent with this. Faced with a choice between using data-financed and money-financed services, the majority chooses the former.<p>Legislation attempts to resolve this dilemma, either by outlawing the use of personal data as a currency at all, or more often by making the spending of personal data more a onerous and explicit process, in the hope that a closer equivalence in terms of convenience combined with repeated reminders of people&#x27;s stated preference to maintain their privacy will alter their behaviour.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m skeptical this type of legislation will succeed.

Who thinks &quot;indigenous&quot; people do not have archaeology? It seems like such a person would be quite uninformed to say such a thing.<p>The challenge with a lot of archaeology of &quot;indigenous&quot; people (using the manipulative vernacular) though is that not all cultures and societies advanced enough to produce significant amounts of discoverable artifacts. Fact is simply that you are not going to find, e.g., a lot of Aboriginal artifacts, like you are in Greece, Italy, Egypt, etc. Or, as was the case all throughout the Americas, the hispanics had essentially already eradicated hundreds, if not thousands of years of culture and artifacts as they plundered their way across the continent; which has left very little of what must have been mind boggling and dazzlingly stunning amounts of gold artifacts.<p>I encourage everyone to read, &quot;The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo Written by Himself&quot;, for an amazing accounting of what that era of hispanic plundering of the Americas was like. It will likely surprise you in many different ways.<p>It comes down to the fact that in spite of what &quot;scientists&quot; may want you to believe, neither can they know things that are negative, nor can one find things that do not or never existed. On a side note, I am very interested in the rather recent significant satellite surveys of the Central American forests that has shown far more extensive man made works than we had known before.<p>As strange as this may seem, it may even be that the viruses that the hispanics carried to the Americas that eradicated huge numbers of the population, may have also caused whole towns&#x2F;cities to become suddenly deserted and overgrown, leaving behind covered up time capsules going back 500+ years."],"time":["2020-08-13 23:38:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["tmabraham"],"id":[24135682],"kids":[24136046],"parent":[24130890],"text":["The perfect example of a textbook as a collection of Jupyter notebooks may be the Deep Learning for Coders book:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastai&#x2F;fastbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastai&#x2F;fastbook<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-12 21:17:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["abdullahkhalids"],"id":[24135478],"kids":[24136074,24136805,24136038],"parent":[24130890],"text":["I like the concept of Jupyter Notebooks and I do use them extensively, but I can&#x27;t use my emacs shortcuts which makes writing anything more than a few lines really annoying.<p>Especially, writing Latex Math without Auctex (emacs package) is very tedious.

What we need is a good, high-quality debate, and a way to quantify and compare costs and benefits from both sides. We need mortality numbers for different age groups from different independent sources. We need research on mental health effects of lockdown and pulling kids away from school. Anecdotally, I have a 6-year-old son, who got noticeably distressed after the school went online-only during his Kindergarten. I am not worried about his academic success (he&#x27;s doing Grade 2 workbooks at home), but the lack of social interaction is certainly freaking him out. Except, I don&#x27;t know the real numbers. In fact, nobody does, because there is too so much focus on political stand-offs instead. It&#x27;s hurting both sides, really.<p>It&#x27;s like with Hydroxychloroquine. Ever since Trump endorsed it, the republican media is proclaiming it to be The Cure (with people literally considering it for prophylactic (sic!)), while the democrat sources are censoring videos and avoiding the topic, because the paper stating its benefits used weak methodology. And again, your stance on HCQ is used as a proxy for your political orientation, rather than an honest professional opinion. All that instead instead of an actual unbiased research aimed at discovering cases and circumstances where it could work.
