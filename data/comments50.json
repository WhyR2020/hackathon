I think that’s actually missing the point.<p>&gt; “Behind our screens, at work and at home, we have sutured the temporal segments of our days so as to switch our attention from one task or one source of stimulation to another. We cannot but be changed.”<p>This part rings true for me.<p>Last summer I read Cal Newport’s “Deep Work” and then “Digital Minimalism,” in which he gets very into this topic of hypermedia and distracted living. It greatly influenced my thinking about how I use my time, and made me more conscious of the need to focus and actually be present with one activity at a time. This has greatly increased my productivity and lowered my stress level, so I highly recommend it.<p>Newport argues that a lot of what is “wrong” with today’s computers (in every form factor) is the very thing that makes them so useful: they can do so many things. So unlike a paper book, which is really only for reading, a screen is for displaying all kinds of things, and if we are reading on a screen with notifications turned on then we’re probably reading distracted which means we aren’t reading well.<p>I read almost exclusively on my iPad or phone. I find it quite comfortable to sit on the couch and read from either device, but I prefer the iPad (mini). When I occasionally still read a paper book I find the experience is really no better or worse than reading on the iPad, except that the iPad has hundreds of books stored in the space and weight of a single magazine.<p>However, I do think one reason the experience is qualitatively equivalent it is I don’t do a whole lot <i>else<\/i> on my iPad, so I don’t find it to be a distracting device. I associate it with reading.<p>Another relevant book on this topic, “Moonwalking with Einstein,” is all about memory. That book essentially makes the case that (educated) people in the pre-internet era had to hold a lot of material in their heads, because you couldn’t google stuff, and so everyone practiced using their memory more, committed more “important,” things to memory, and generally did a better job retaining things they learned.<p>All of these are interesting, complex side effects of the internet and the ever more ubiquitous computer, and I think there is a lot for us to think about here. On a personal level, we have some opportunity and perhaps obligation to ensure our lives are enriched by these technologies and push back on the negatives that come with them. But just FWIW, I don’t think trying to switch back to only reading on paper is, by itself, the answer :)"],"time":["2020-05-10 07:55:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sq_"],"id":[23130464],"kids":[23130676,23130560,23130639,23130524],"parent":[23130156],"text":["This line from the article really caught my attention:<p>&gt; In sum, Wolf says, the paper reading brain has better memory, more imagination, immersion, and patience, and more knowledge than the screen reading brain.<p>I&#x27;ve been torn for years about how to feel about my reading and writing habits.

I appreciate people read a lot of text messages, articles, posts, etc. But they don&#x27;t read 100,000 words worth of those things on average a day by any means. 34 gigabytes of data is also definitely not 100,000 words, more like 5,100,000,000 words or 17,000,000 pages.<p>Is it based on some &#x27;a picture is worth 1,000 words&#x27; argument?<p>Reading is not thriving.

People consume a lot of data because they&#x27;re watching Netflix, YouTube videos and Instagram (and downloading the same JavaScript over and over again on every website).<p>The whole article is just bizarre. It conflates so many unrelated things and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real thesis. People not reading books doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with people using phones except for the indisputable fact anyone here will attest to: going back to reading books after not doing so for a long time is <i>really<\/i> hard. You find your mind wandering, you find it hard to read linearly one line at a time without skipping around, etc. The kind of reading you do of a blog post is totally different from the kind of reading you do of a novel. That people read pamphlets in the 18th century has <i>nothing at all<\/i> to do with the decline in people reading books today.<p>I literally have students coming into tutorials that <i>cannot write<\/i>. They cannot write down answers on paper. They struggle to <i>write<\/i> (to write!) because they&#x27;ve been told they can just type and never have to write. It&#x27;s absolutely bizarre, but that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re told by their school teachers, apparently. They also can&#x27;t sit still and read something without getting out their phones. Students complain that their lecture notes aren&#x27;t put online and they have to actually attend lectures and take notes themselves even though it&#x27;s been proven again and again that handwriting notes in lectures is much better for information retention and synthesis of ideas than typing or god-forbid not taking notes at all.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m really unsure whether I would even let kids have access to the internet. I had a lot of great experiences online as a kid (I have very fond memories of RuneScape from ages 9-12), and I learnt computer programming online. At the same time, I think you have to be really careful to limit it. It shouldn&#x27;t be the primary means of entertainment. Mobile devices are probably the main issue: avoid them and at least you can ration and supervise their access to the internet. It can be a tool for research, homework and learning (and fun and games) without the dangers.

Vermont cheese makers, which also once supplied the restaurants of New York and Boston, have had a different experience. This comes from an email newsletter published by someone on the Vermont Cheese Council (who urged recipients to spread the word, so I am sharing it here):<p><i>As restaurants in NYC and Boston started closing their doors, specialty cheese shops and wholesales distributers that sold artisan local cheeses started simultaneously seeing 50% drops in sales overnight.  I started calling cheesemakers around Vermont to learn how the situation was impacting them.  My job took a turn, shifting from trying to support best practices for makers in Vermont to trying to ensure that as many makers as can are able to get through the COVID-19 impact without shuttering their businesses.<p>I try to call a few cheesemakers every day to see how they are doing, and we’re facing a range of challenges.  Some are trying to reduce cheese production, so that production doesn’t exceed demand.  This means reducing incoming milk quantities, which means diverting milk produced by dairy animals to another buyer (since those animals keep producing milk every day!) or, in some cases, selling animals off.  Others are facing stock issues:  Limited aging spaces – meaning that if they continue to make cheese and can’t sell it, eventually their aging spaces will fill, and their animals will still continue to make milk … and they will be back to the previously expressed need to reduce incoming milk.<p>Alongside the production challenges, there are other issues.  The gooey, runny, high moisture texture that makes camembert-style cheeses a delight to enjoy also comes with a short shelf life.  These cheeses often need to be eaten fairly quickly when they are ripe, or they will quickly deteriorate in quality beyond where one would want to eat or sell them.  For those makers who focus on making these softer cheeses – they have inventory that is sitting in aging cellars without its usual consumer audience.<p>... So to summarize the situation, it’s like this:  Imagine we had a three lane highway going into NYC with cheese instead of cars, then two lanes closed down.  We have … a massive cheese traffic jam.  We (Vermont Cheese) would normally sell hundreds of thousands of pounds of cheese from our mid- and smaller-sized makers over the next four months…and currently we are selling around half (or perhaps less than that) compared to what we’d normally sell.  On other words, we have a BIG cheese traffic jam – one that will grow to likely be hundreds of thousands of pounds of cheese if people don’t buy it – or if makers don’t stop making it (and again - the milking animals will keep producing milk ...).<\/i><p>Online sales can only go so far. Some people won&#x27;t order online, and certain produce and dairy products are not suited to UPS deliveries, especially when the temperature rises. Unless more distant producers can make the long round trip to the NYC and&#x2F;or work out wider grocery distribution, they&#x27;re going to suffer."],"time":["2020-05-10 18:38:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["flyingfences"],"id":[23134769],"kids":{},"parent":[23133371],"text":["NPR also published an article [0] on the same topic this morning, which is not behind a paywall.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;852512047&#x2F;as-food-supply-chain-breaks-down-farm-to-door-csas-take-off\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;852512047&#x2F;as-food-supply-chai...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-10 20:22:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23134826],"kids":{},"parent":[23133371],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-10 20:28:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["niftylettuce"],"id":[23139201],"kids":{},"parent":[23133371],"text":["If you&#x27;re in NYC, check out our farm-fresh service, OurHarvest.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourharvest.com&#x2F;?coupon=HACKERNEWS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourharvest.com&#x2F;?coupon=HACKERNEWS<\/a><p>Coupon code &quot;HACKERNEWS&quot; gets you 25% off first order."],"time":["2020-05-11 07:40:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["engineer_22"],"id":[23137860],"kids":{},"parent":[23133371],"text":["New York&#x27;s dairy farmers are PAYING to dump their milk.

LLVM 6 was released with the intrinsic llvm.sideeffect added, and in 2019, rustc got the -Z insert-sideeffect flag, which adds llvm.sideeffect to infinite loops and recursions.

I often go from the laptop docked to a Usb-C hub to using my laptop on my coach. And my external display and laptop screen don&#x27;t share the same pixel density. And it is a mess to switch from one to the other without hurting my eyes. Fractional scaling is blurry under Wayland or X in Gnome. Also some apps rely on Gtk for font rendering and thus react to GDK_SCALE environment variables but some don&#x27;t. Some understand the Xft.dpi X server font dpi setting, some don&#x27;t... I stopped doing fractional scaling of the whole display and just automatically detect which display is connected (thus does not work on both) and change the Gnome font settings<p>* Worse Battery life. I kept the Windows10 partition just in case and sometimes spend a bit of time on it and I have a much longer battery life on Windows10 doing the same things. On Linux I get 6 to 8 hours, when on Windows it is more between 8 to 10 hours. I think the main reason for that is the lack of off-the-shelf hardware accelerated video decoder in the browsers on Linux (I watch quite a few youtube videos). Yes I know TLP, powertop, etc.<p>* No driver for the fingerprint reader. It is a shame since the same model is sold by Dell with Ubuntu but the driver is not available. It is something I really like on Windows.<p>* Worse bluetooth experience. On Windows10, my bluetooth headset or speakers connect instantly, on Linux it takes up to 30 seconds and I usually have to manually force it (completely random)<p>* More instabilities. Usually after a resume sometimes bluetooth or wifi stop working and I need to reboot (once or twice a week).<p>* Lack of Wayland compatible apps. (I run Gnome) and some apps do not work and sometimes don&#x27;t have Wayland equivalent: OBS is buggy on Wayland, polybar (status bar) does not work. I moved back to Xorg but I find it less responsive.<p>That being said I experimented a bit WSL on Windows10, it is nice but I am still not coming back to Windows 10.

The reason for that is that scientific principles force people to avoid &#x27;language games&#x27; or rationalisations and provide a common formalism to make &#x27;progress&#x27;.<p>People often use &#x27;scientism&#x27; as a pejorative for a sort of cold, broken calculator like mentality, but a scientific account of justice, grounded in biology, evidence about punishment and so forth would almost certainly be more humanistic, forgiving, and productive than say, religious debate or ad hoc moral justification, which has led to some of the more cruel treatments in our history.<p>The author also I think makes some basic mistakes about the nature of science, she says for example:<p><i>&quot;But too often those elegant mathematical models turn out to be based on assumptions about “rational economic man” true of no real-world economic actors.&quot;<\/i><p>This is true, but not really a problem. As Milton Friedman put it: <i>&quot;Truly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have &quot;assumptions&quot; that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions (in this sense) Why? Because such hypotheses and descriptions extract only those crucial elements sufficient to yield relatively precise, valid predictions, omitting a welter of predictively irrelevant details. Of course, descriptive unrealism by itself does not ensure a &quot;significant theory&quot;<\/i><p>Believing in the &#x27;rational man&#x27; is no mistake of scientism but like believing in a perfect sphere.

You know the type I&#x27;m talking about. And to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t those times on all sides, but here me out.<p>It reminds me of a video I came across a few years ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LDu2dgTT5t4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LDu2dgTT5t4<\/a>. It&#x27;s a debate between an atheist professor (from University of Arizona?) and a christian professor (from MIT?) where they polled the audience at the end to determine a winner. The prompt was not &quot;does God exist&quot;. The prompt was &quot;does science refute God&quot;. The atheist spent the whole time trying to disprove God by saying he&#x27;ll believe in a god if the stars align and send him a sign. The christian spent the time arguing that it doesn&#x27;t matter whether anybody believes in god or not. Science is simply not a tool that can be used to make any statements on the metaphysical, whatsoever. And concepts like religion, morality, ethics, etc. only make sense in that realm.<p>My two takeaways were 1. how annoying it was that the atheist missed the subtlety in the prompt and insisted on trying to disprove <i>God<\/i> rather than discussing the actual prompt of whether science <i>can<\/i> actually study things that aren&#x27;t observable. Perhaps maybe that&#x27;s the definition of a true rationalist, though. And 2. how sad it was that the audience also seemed to miss it, voting for the pompous atheist at the end. As far as I could discern, the atheist failed to provide any argument leading to the conclusion that science can refute God, irrespective of whether anyone believes in a God or not.<p>Which brings me back to my point: things should not <i>have<\/i> to be scientific to be valid, socially. You should not have to argue that psychology, or economics is a pseudo&#x2F;soft science in order to validate funding it. An archeologist or historian should not feel invalidated if they need to sprinkle in some interpretation to connect dots between the facts at hand. In fact, applying scientific method to domains where it does not apply is at best wasteful and at worst counterproductive. The whole &quot;science vs the arts&quot; mindset is a false dichotomy. There&#x27;s a lot of useful knowledge to be gained that is neither rational nor strictly artistic. But if we reduce it to that socially, then you <i>need<\/i> to argue that you pursuit is someone rational and scientific in order to justify it to peers, etc. And I do blame the &quot;asshole atheist&quot; for that reductionist mentality.<p>I think everyone should read some Thomas Kuhn. It&#x27;s interesting to look at what happens when the popular rational dogma itself changes. Rationalists and even atheists are equally susceptible to dogma. And sometimes it&#x27;s not about whether you&#x27;re right or wrong. It&#x27;s having the humility to admit that there might be another way to skin the cat that ultimately leads to real progress."],"time":["2020-05-10 22:04:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["icedata"],"id":[23133542],"kids":[23134038],"parent":[23121438],"text":["I once drove through the border from Canada to the US with Steve.

For example, you could give your items an auto-incrementing sequence number and tell the API consumer the sequence number of the last item in the result set.

In my judgement, we already have a pretty good idea of &quot;who decides&quot; in most matters that affect the whole of society, but not in some others. It&#x27;s the government, which is supposed to be accountable and elected by the populace, or at least take into account their wishes.

To that end, it&#x27;s worth asking why &quot;harm&quot; in the interpretation of laws on speech is defined in such a way that it only includes physical assaults.

This rant would also make a good first day read in an enterprise software engineering class.<p>Thinking over my career, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of libraries and tools out there that are really trying to be tiny frameworks.  One example is [ngOptions](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.angularjs.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;ng&#x2F;directive&#x2F;ngOptions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.angularjs.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;ng&#x2F;directive&#x2F;ngOptions<\/a>) from angular 1.  As a web developer, you&#x27;re already using javascript, html and css at the very minimum. Yet ngOptions went ahead and created a new configuration language just for rendering a drop down.  It was ok for simple stuff, but it rarely felt right for more complex widgets.<p>I think java bean mappers kind of fall into this trap as well.  On the surface, bean mappers look like libraries.  But once you start customizing the mappings, you see that each library has created a complex configuration language.  The problem is that configuring custom mappings takes about the same amount of space as creating a tiny method to manage a specific field mapping. The difference is that I have to read a bunch of documentation to understand the bean mapper, but I already know how to write java.<p>At the end of the day, library vs framework boils down to imperative vs declarative. Libraries and imperative languages are composable and relatively easy to understand but can sometimes require a lot of work to accomplish difficult tasks.  Frameworks and declarative languages require a lot of work to get right and are really only appropriate for problems that are well understood or formally described.

Restriction increases\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSo when someone writes an article like this, what they are actually saying is this:<p><pre><code>    &quot;The complexity and restriction balance in the current framework&#x2F;programming language \n     strikes the right balance so in my opinion (keyword)\n     writing another framework on top of the current framework will\n     increase the restriction to the point where the trade off is not worth it.&quot;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhen writing a library as opposed to a framework, what people are essentially doing is augmenting the capabilities of the current framework without creating an extra layer of abstraction. Another good way to think about it is that frameworks are equivalent to extra layers of abstraction and therefore the benefits and downsides of adding more layers of abstraction are equivalent to adding more frameworks. So it&#x27;s really not as simple to say that &quot;Libraries are preferred.&quot;<p>The story actually gets even more complicated then this. I spoke previously as if there is a trade off between Complexity and Restriction. While a decrease in complexity is always good, an increase in restriction is not always bad.<p>Take for example ELM. ELM is a language (or framework) that compiles to javascript and HTML. It is more restrictive then javascript due to type checking. Yes type checking is a framework that decreases freedom and increases restriction. But people think type checking is a good thing. Why? Well, the ELM type checker&#x2F;framework is so powerful that it restricts you from ever writing a run time error. You absolutely do not have the freedom to write code that has certain bugs in ELM while in javascript you absolutely have the freedom to pollute your code with thousands of obscure bugs.<p>Restriction can be good, really good. In fact restriction outside of testing is our greatest tool and weapon for combating the problem of bugs occurring as a result of too much complexity.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t like this article because it doesn&#x27;t illustrate the full story. It kind of biases against frameworks. The author did not think deeply enough, he thinks of frameworks in terms of things like rails or django, but he does not think of what a framework is from a more general perspective.<p>Keep in mind, react or how react is used is basically a framework as well. Nobody uses it as a library, they prefer the component abstraction to take over the entire notion of the DOM."],"time":["2020-05-09 22:53:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Vekz"],"id":[23122767],"kids":{},"parent":[23121192],"text":["Write small sharp tool modules like &quot;left-pad&quot;, not libraries."],"time":["2020-05-09 08:34:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["inglor"],"id":[23123328],"kids":{},"parent":[23121192],"text":["However if yo write a framework write a framework.<p>Don&#x27;t cripple the community by doing the IoC part and the framework calls you but create a fragmented ecosystem of a million ways to do state, routing and so on.<p>Looking at you React.

When I am in the zone outside distractions are eliminated and my mind is fully focused on the task at hand. When I am truly in the zone matters such as health, family, children, work and (when I was younger) even hunger or the need to sleep disappear; all that remains is the task. My brain has maximum cycles to iterate again and again until I achieve greater understanding and&#x2F;or arrive at a solution.<p>I do not have very good general tips on how to get in the zone. I have some things that work for me, although not always. They include:<p>- Real-world isolation: These days where everyone is at home, I go to a corner in my garden where my family knows not to bother me.<p>- Virtual-world isolation: No emails. No browsing. No notifications of any kind. Phone on silent. Absolutely no Slack, Teams, etc!<p>- Friction-free programming environment: If the build takes 20 minutes, then it will be hard to remain in the zone. If the Mac has stuck keys get them fixed or buy a laptop from a different brand.<p>- Headphones with some favorite music: For programming I like trance, the more repetitive the better. I often use this youtube channel: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;MrLemilica2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;MrLemilica2<\/a><p>- Review previous work on the subject: This acts as a brain warm up for me and usually puts me in the right mood.<p>- Some times work better than others: When I was younger it was far easier to get in the zone at night. These days I do not have that luxury because of family.<p>- Work on a problem that excites you: It is much easier to get in the zone when the subject matter interests you. It is harder (although still possible) when the subject is less interesting.<p>- No context switching: Choose a task and stick to it for at least a few hours.<p>- Get the non-enjoyable tasks out of the way: (This may not work for everyone.) I like to complete tasks that I do not enjoy (e.g. administrative or legal) first. I can then continue my work care-free instead of having this niggling thought in the back of my mind: &quot;do not forget to respond to the lawyer&quot;."],"time":["2020-05-09 02:56:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["odomojuli"],"id":[23119636],"kids":[23122309],"parent":[23118940],"text":["Have a sharpened pencil and stack of paper handy always.

I use Visual Code with carefully chosen extensions that alert me all the time about error.<p>2. I have enabled linter autofix on safe. It fixes a lots of stuff very good fast.<p>3. I wrote several own extensions. One for example shows error in the code when i do some mistakes i normally do. It also boosts my speed because i dont go through the whole process of finding these errors.<p>4. Since i code using TypeScript and Angular i use a lots of OOP and composition to reuse easily and modify code fast. And have less errors. OOP gives great propert and method suggestions in VSC so there is less space for errors.<p>5. I have a lots of generators and snippets custom for my projects. So writing similar things is blazing fast.<p>6. I dont overcomplicate stuff. Write everything as simple as possible so it is easy to refactor and modify and understand.<p>7. I use bash with a menu to have complicated operations like git operations to be done easily. Without clicking with mouse. It is a boost.<p>8. I have written also some software in C# that operates on the TS code base. I use it to generate some more complicated stuff that includes multiple files at once. I use code comments to put for example snippet examples into Angular code. Than a C# app looks for these in whole project  and generates snippets for VSC automatically.<p>9. An extension for VSC executes tests one by one. I can choose test to start. It is faster than start all each time.<p>10. CI&#x2F;CD, unit testing, linting, end to end tests give a boost if done right.<p>11. I side from solutions that are hype but cause loads of code to be written. For example some silly state management libraries. Overkill.<p>12. My PC is packed with best hardware, updated regularly to be fastest as possible. Since every second you wait ia a second you waste. PC ia better because you can upgrade it cheaper than laptop. Remote access is the key if you want use laptop.<p>13. Good sleep and diet, sports is essential for good performance. And music.<p>14. I never go into the zone if i am not 100% sure what and how to do stuff. In the zone you arw blazing fast, but be careful to not write useless code because of bad approach.<p>15. Notes notes notes. For everything. Refactored often. JIRA as a single source of tasks. Notepad as a detail task list.<p>16. I adjust tasks to the time of day and my mental focus. Some easy task for first half hour, and than the big ones for the rest of the morning.<p>17. I have wrote a lots on keyboard to have very high speed. It saves me time writing (actually you need to use keyboard when you are a dev anyways) and less wasted time for typos.<p>18. All notifications off. All spam sms, emails, calls off. No distractors.<p>19. I never code when i am not 100% sure what and how to do it. No guessing, always asking. A lots of wasted time saved. Never being ashamed to ask even the most stupid question.<p>20. I always remember that things take time and not stress too much about it. Stress harms performance if too high. But also some stress can let you go into the zone. And this is magical place to be in.<p>I enjoy coding. Always had.

There might be various others specific to the project-domain, but these are the most common:<p>• <i>notes&#x2F;<\/i> contains plaintext files of everything i write down. File-name structure is <i>&lt;date-str&gt;:&lt;note-type&gt;<\/i>, e.g. <i>2020-05-09:call<\/i> (<i>:call<\/i> are the most typical ones). As others have also suggested, I take a lot of notes for record keeping &amp; plannning purposes.<p>• <i>workspace&#x2F;<\/i> contains all source code repositories, or other files necessary to work. Pretty much anything I might touch while coding.<p>• <i>auth&#x2F;<\/i> for things like ssh public keys used on the project<p>• <i>downloads&#x2F;<\/i> Project-specific downloads.<p>Then I create new entries in my ~&#x2F;.bash_aliases that &quot;get me&quot; right into the coding-env of a project. Say I work on a python project, I might have an alias that looks sth like:<p><pre><code>  alias fb=&#x27;cd ~&#x2F;fooproject&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;foobot &amp;&amp; echo &quot;loading virtualenv...&quot; &amp;&amp; source .venv&#x2F;bin&#x2F;activate&#x27;;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nOn of my current side-projects is a full-stack clojure(-script) app with these aliases:<p><pre><code>  alias foh=&#x27;cd ~&#x2F;opendecks&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;foh&#x27;;\n  alias fohj=&#x27;cd ~&#x2F;opendecks&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;foh&#x2F;src&#x2F;clj&#x2F;opendecks&#x2F;foh&#x27;;\n  alias fohs=&#x27;cd ~&#x2F;opendecks&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;foh&#x2F;src&#x2F;cljs&#x2F;opendecks&#x2F;foh&#x27;;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nFirst one gets me into the the source-root of the project, the other two into respective sub-paths for back- and front-end. These aliases allow me to immedeiatly &quot;jump into a project&quot; from any open terminal.<p>Lastly, I started employing chrome&#x2F;chromium&#x27;s user-profiles to seperate browsing for each project. This isolates work-related browsing from my personal activity (cookies, logins, passwords etc), and provides a nice cognitive barrier against procrastination. I&#x27;m not logged into any social networks on those work-profiles and switching to my private profile to browse facebook is a more concious act than opening a new tab in the current window. Each browser profile is set-up to save all  downloads to the project-specific `.&#x2F;downloads` directory, again not to mingle (potentially confidential) resources.<p>I haven&#x27;t automated any of the above steps, because it&#x27;s so simple and takes me at most 10-15 mins to create a new instance. This has worked really well for me so far, because it clearly seperates almost all resources associated to a project, while being friction-less in tooling&#x2F;switching between workspaces (versus e.g. waiting for a VM or docker instance to start). Another nice side-effect is that I can easily archive or clean-up past projects."],"time":["2020-05-09 12:50:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23123652],"kids":{},"parent":[23118940],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-09 12:50:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["tonymet"],"id":[23121516],"kids":{},"parent":[23118940],"text":["step through debugger"],"time":["2020-05-09 03:57:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["imjustsaying"],"id":[23119224],"kids":[23119689],"parent":[23118940],"text":["password manager"],"time":["2020-05-08 22:42:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ooyimusic"],"id":[23128633],"kids":{},"parent":[23118940],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rXBaRwX5BPY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rXBaRwX5BPY<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-09 23:59:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["andrewparker"],"id":[23128015],"kids":[23129360,23129502,23128108,23129975,23128806,23134030,23129771],"parent":[23126455],"text":["This is a clever twist on unbundling.

Decreasing the number of buttons and displays is not the solution. The solution is to understand the total system, to design it in a way that allows all the pieces fit nicely together, so that initial learning as well as usage are both optimal. Years ago, Larry Tesler, then a vice president of Apple, argued that the total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person&#x27;s interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex. This principle is known today as &quot;Tesler&#x27;s law of the conservation of complexity.&quot; Tesler described it as a tradeoff: making things easier for the user means making it more difficult for the designer or engineer.”\n<U+2015> Donald A.

The organ lurches around like a carousel horse as he sings of both wanting to escape the anguish of earthly life even as he looks forward to being reunited with his parents with all of the feel of revelation in a drunken moment.  It was off of his second gospel album, a little break from the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, often attributed to some difficulties he had with a plane being a very sharp sign from God.  It borders on the sacrilegious with the sound, but the hope to escape misery in his voice turns the sound into a repudiation of the world.<p>I&#x27;m not religious myself but I can feel what it must be like from the track, a sense that the man wanted to escape this swampy carnival with leering pitchmen even as you sense just how comfortable he is with the environment as a whole, how well he fits in.  Salvation must have seemed as out of reach, like any brass ring, to a man lured by the money that came rolling in, flattered by the adulation, pampered by the lifestyle, and at ease with casual accommodation of his apparently voracious (and omnivorous) sexuality.  Being a lot further to one side of the Kinsey scale than the other must have been another layer on the leaden robe, however gilt, as he struggled to heed the call.<p>He would of course go back to rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.  Like Willie Sutton said, that&#x27;s where the money is.

Why were there not secessions after it? The reason has to do with the growth of the Roman Empire. Rome’s conquests really went into overdrive after that and they conquered many kingdoms. Along with those conquests, there came a lot of slaves. This totally changed the dynamics. After a while, the wealthy depended not on their poor fellow Romans to farm or make goods, but on slaves. Now it did not matter if the plebes didn’t not show up.<p>I fear that globalization may have served the same function in the United States. The wealthy don’t depend on their poor fellow Americans to provide goods for them and work for them. They depend on good produced oversees and even for domestic production on immigrant labor(look at who gets employed in fame labor or domestic help). They have an alternative to their fellow poor Americans.<p>Now, a strike in the US has a good chance of resulting not in long term employee benefits like it did before, but in the plant being moved oversees.<p>Unfortunately, this has bad consequences. When the relatively peaceful secession was no longer an option, Rome devolved into outright violence in the Roman Revolutions which saw demagogues and authoritarians mobilize the disaffected poor to kill their enemies and establish their power. When it all ended with the ascension of Augustus in AD 31, Rome was a republic in name only, but in reality a military dictatorship. And the people were generally happy with it because it brought peace after  decades of violence and bloodshed.<p>I hope our democracies can find a better solution to the issues of wealth inequality, before this story happens to us too."],"time":["2020-05-09 08:48:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["runawaybottle"],"id":[23126606],"kids":[23127817],"parent":[23121851],"text":["This exists in modern American history as well under the term ‘solidarity’.

The whole premise of card counting is to vary your bets where you are betting more when the count is in your favor, and less when it isn&#x27;t. Also &quot;penetration&quot; into the deck is important because the less cards there are remaining in the deck the probability of you getting the cards you want (positive count big cards) is higher.<p>So with that said:<p>- Casinos employ methods such as continuous shuffling machines that make counting impossible. Tables that have hand shuffling of 6-8 decks cut the deck and reshuffle with 2 decks remaining or so. So it is harder to get penetration.<p>- The way to be maximally profitable is to vary your bet very widely depending on how positive the deck is. This could be 30x your low bet. Behavior like this will get you detected.<p>- Security personnel and even dealers keep counts. It is not some savant activity. It is not hard especially since all these people do all day is look at cards. So they know when the deck is positive and if you are always betting big when that happens you will be detected.<p>So the people that are left counting have to avoid heat by &quot;camouflaging&quot; their actions. They don&#x27;t vary their bet that widely and make purposeful bad decisions to make it appear they are not keeping a count. They want to appear like someone that does not know how to play basic strategy and raises and lowers their bets based on superstition (there&#x27;s a lot of them). This all eats into their advantage substantially. Then in addition betting big at high limit tables is going to be more carefully scrutinized as well.<p>With that all added together the life for a modern card counter is grinding out for comps and very low player advantage for very long times. Casinos aren&#x27;t dumb anymore. So while we watch the chronicles of the MIT team, and others, those days are long, long gone. Makes for great stories as people love Robin Hood like tales, but it just isn&#x27;t happening like this anymore.<p>Edit: Also the tactic she mentions: Entering a game mid shoe after watching for a while, and waiting for a positive deck, is called &quot;Wonging&quot; After Stanford Wong a longtime gambling expert and advantage player. There is NO WAY you&#x27;d get away with &quot;flashy big bettor Carlos&quot; coming in after she counted detected a positive count. Tables with any meaningful limit usually do not allow mid shoe entry for this reason.

My brother and I were getting ready to go with my Dad to Vegas for the first time, and we were keen on not being typical dumb ass gamblers...we wanted an edge.<p>We quickly learned that the only beatable game in town was card-counting at Blackjack, so I got busy first verifying that card counting wasn&#x27;t some casino ploy (it wasn&#x27;t), and then modifying the same simulator code to actually &quot;teach&quot; the systems it was simulating.<p>I wish I still had this code... I absolutely loved developing it, and eventually it was a very powerful blackjack system.  It had configurable <i>everything<\/i>..system counts, decks, rules, players at the table, etc. I literally spent 7 years plus working on it.  Eventually it was ported to Turbo Pascal for speed.<p>I became a whiz at counting... I eventually settled on &quot;Wong Halves&quot;, the most complex but supposedly the most accurate count system there was.  Remember, this was in the late 80s early 90s, and back then casinos were wide open to be taken.<p>I was only a $5 to $25 player though, so I never got any real heat.  I used a 1 to 5 bet ratios (1 unit at low counts and 5 as &quot;big bets&quot;), which was very conservative, and looking back, I had a good deal of small-time success.  Unlike my brother, I was never banned... I was far better than he at &quot;blending in&quot; and being personable.<p>Nowadays, I live in Vegas, and they have <i>completely<\/i> destroyed the chances of winning any real money at the casinos.  Hell, I remember my simulations showing me that the primary money advantage was made when you had a large bet out at a high count (favorable to the player), that the fact that blackjacks came at a higher rate WAS THE ONLY REAL MONEY MAKING ADVANTAGE THERE WAS.<p>This is why, I feel, that the high end strip casinos NO LONGER PAY 3-2 for natural blackjacks...an outrage if ever there is one!  Strip casinos now pay 6-5 for a blackjack.  I have had heated arguments with pit personnel that the game should no longer be called Blackjack, so &quot;Blackjack&quot; pay 3-2 for naturals.<p>Unsurprisingly, they never saw it my way.
