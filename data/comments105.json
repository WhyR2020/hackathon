Sounds like every other mission critical emergency project in dire need of leadership, design and development. Perceived need way ahead of actual need, and legacy hiring practices (degree Requirements for legacy coders with 10 years experience and a degree, ha) not realistic to effectively recruit talented resources.<p>Job interview should include - what’s the definition of a legacy system?<p>Has anyone ever seen an emergency mission and time critical project where the SDLC WASN’T the first thing sacrificed for expediency?  And the second is QA &amp; testing - their delivery date remains fixed while development slips and slips.<p>The point is, if you don’t have leadership that has been there done that, knows what is coming, is solving tomorrow’s issues (like finding and hiring resources) so when the project gets to that point, the resources are there and ready, then you are in the false start phase that will continue until you admit it, and begin again with refreshed plan and clear minds.<p>Most SDLC’s do not recognize the false start as a very important first phase that must happen when a time critical emergency project is the only thing that can save the day. How long that phase lasts is dependent on how long it takes you to bring in the right leadership team to take control and begin anew.<p>Since they are in panic mode with the Governor pleading for “COBALT” programmers you know this is in the Coming off the rails &#x2F; false start phase.<p>Some things you can’t short circuit around and luck out. not on really important stuff.<p>It takes some good minds with excellent experience to noodle out what needs to happen, how to make it happen, line up the political and technical ducks and make it happen.<p>This is a technology project using a rock solid mainframe programming language, COBOL. Don’t belittle it. Many of the nation’s largest banks still use COBOL based systems to process their mission critical applications, so quit whining about old mainframe technology being so obsolete.<p>Those of us who have been there fully understand there are no longer many or any users who understand what entire systems do anymore - because those legacy systems have evolved over the years, projects all justified by headcount reductions in the user community. That means all that knowledge is now encapsulized within that cobol code in those legacy systems.<p>So. If someone needs help responding to critical needs that were not anticipated (like an increase 100 or 1000 or 10,000 times the workload - New Jersey?), technology alone is not going to solve your problem, not quickly enough. You need many more people to do the processing of paying the unemployed until technology can catch up and take over.<p>Pay me now or pay me later I always say. \nIf you don’t believe my predictions, Call me when you become enlightened and I can help you then.<p>Until then, good luck. \nPS: A legacy system is every system in production!"],"time":["2020-04-05 09:11:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22783109],"kids":{},"parent":[22782097],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-05 03:54:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["ellius"],"id":[22783578],"kids":{},"parent":[22782097],"text":["This reminds me of the article &quot;COBOL and Legacy Code as a Systemic Risk.&quot; Like the pandemic itself, this was a foreseeable risk:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nakedcapitalism.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;cobol-and-legacy-code-as-a-systemic-risk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nakedcapitalism.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;cobol-and-legacy-cod...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-05 05:42:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xyst"],"id":[22784161],"kids":{},"parent":[22782097],"text":["Companies and government agencies need to “ante up” on the refactor of their old systems.<p>I hope the position goes unfilled.

It was my main composition tool for many years, before I started building my own system. The score&#x2F;orchestra paradigm is incredibly powerful. It&#x27;s something I miss quite often in my current system. When I was in music school, I learned how to program by writing programs in Python to generate scores that could then be played by Csound. Scores are so trivial to generate, that you actually don&#x27;t need to learn that much programming to generating very satisfying algorithmic compositions.<p>I appreciate that the title of this post calls it a &quot;sound and music computing system&quot; rather than a &quot;musical programming language&quot;. In truth, Csound is more of a text-based modular synthesis environment than a programming language.<p>As others have said, the orchestra syntax is a bit strange at first, but you do get used to it. Writing Csound code feels more like patching a modular synthesizer rather than writing a computer program. It&#x27;s basically a DSL for connecting small sound&#x2F;signal modules (called opcodes) together. Most of the time one thinks about things in terms of signal flow and not computer logic. A common mistake I see new Csounders make is to immediately reach for the conditional statements and loops. They often don&#x27;t behave the way you expect, so people get frustrated.<p>The Csound dev team has a very strong emphasis on backwards compatibility, to the point where the older opcodes do not get bugfixes in case someone is exploiting the bug in the compositions. The programmer in me groans a little bit, but the composer takes great comfort in the fact that pieces I write now will be playable for many years or even decades (some of the Csound test pieces, like Trapped In Convert by Richard Boulanger or Xanadu by Joeseph Kung, are over 30 years old and still run).<p>I&#x27;ve been told that many works written in MusicN languages (a precursor to Csound) have been ported to run in Csound, which means that the legacy of Csound includes computer music written in the 60s!

My first three blog posts talk about 1) why I chose Csound over Max&#x2F;MSP, SuperCollider, and ChucK, 2) how mysterious the online presence of Csound is, and 3) what resources have been most helpful for me as I’ve learned Csound.<p>I love Csound, but it has been very challenging to learn.  The first two or three months were an uphill battle where I thought about quitting a few times.  Admittedly, I was brand new to both computer programming and digital audio generation.  I’m sure if I had more experience with those then picking up Csound wouldn’t have been as painful.  The biggest early challenge for me was understanding how the three variable rates (initialization rate, control rate, and audio rate) work.  I felt like I had to hit my head against a wall for three weeks before that clicked.  But once you become familiar with the basic principles and syntax of Csound you start picking up other topics and opcodes quicker.<p>I’ve used both CsoundQt and Cabbage as Csound development environments.  They each have their pros and cons and best use cases.  I’ve been using Cabbage more because it has an ingenious way of controlling the instrument interface within the Csound code itself.<p>There are a ton of opcodes available to do many sound design techniques out of the box, or you can code your own opcodes to do anything you’d like.  The user community is very responsive and helpful on the Csound listserv (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csound.1045644.n5.nabble.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csound.1045644.n5.nabble.com&#x2F;<\/a>).

In the XO platform, two basic ways are provided:<p>Through the Python programming environment: eg. programmed in Activities.<p>Through its &#x27;classic&#x27; command-line frontend, directly invoking it from the Terminal activity.<p>Further information about Csound can be found on its official website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csounds.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csounds.com&#x2F;<\/a>.

In 1986 my soon-to-be mentor and Interactor collaborator Mort Subotnick had just come from a residency at MIT where he was using a program called Hookup created by a student there named David Levitt. Hookup was the first program I know of that used the &quot;patch-cord&quot; metaphor, i.e., modules that manipulate data are linked by virtual wires, the connection of which is determined by the user. For those in the world of early analog, patch-cord programmed synthesizers, this was a familiar interface. Mort was using David&#x27;s program to do tempo following of MIDI instruments -- this allowed him to lock hardware MIDI sequences to the tempo of the live performers. I was a composition student at CalArts at the time, and word had gotten around that I was a good programmer. So Mort contacted me to see if I could hardcode some of the ideas he had implemented in Hookup on a Mac, so that he could use them in his next performance. That program (used in Mort&#x27;s 1987 multimedia work &quot;Hungers&quot;) would eventually become Interactor. Mort designed the functionality of the early versions, but I became more influential in the design as time went on. [...]<p>&gt;Mark: Yes, that&#x27;s true and importantly a kind of creative intuition was creeping back in through the development of these new visual interface possibilities for software. Part of the thing I reacted to in Hookup was the way you could easily drop modules into the program and try things; a lot like you could do with the patch-cord synthesizers. I may not have realized it explicitly then, but this ability to program improvisationally allowed for that kind of artful playfulness that is so important. So I set out to make a similar user interface for Interactor. The creation of Isadora was a natural outgrowth of Interactor. In 1996 Troika Ranch had a two-week residency at STEIM, where I first saw Tom Demeyer&#x27;s real-time video processing program Image&#x2F;ine. I first started using Image&#x2F;ine in concert with Interactor, because Image&#x2F;ine didn&#x27;t allow the kind of complicated interactive decision making that I was used to having in Interactor. So, Interactor would process the MIDI data from my interactive sensors, and then tell Image&#x2F;ine what to do. By 1998 I was using Image&#x2F;ine in a major way in my performances with Troika Ranch. [...]<p>&gt;Mark: Isadora and Max both inherit the modules linked by the patch-cord metaphor from Hookup. But unlike Max, each Isadora module shows the parameter names and current values for all of its inputs and outputs, and many modules give real-time graphic feedback about their operation. This is important from the perspective of helping new users understand what&#x27;s going on right away. But perhaps the biggest difference is that Max is a very powerful, open-ended programming language in which you could solve any number of problems. Isadora isn&#x27;t that. It is a lot like Interactor in that each module is essentially a macro that accomplishes some specific function. This approach helps people who are just beginning to do this kind of work, as it means that useful functionality is already embodied for you and it&#x27;s very easy to start doing things and getting interesting results quickly (like with Image&#x2F;ine). Max allows the most flexibility, but may be somewhat more difficult to program because more things have to be built up from scratch. Isadora offers somewhat less flexibility, but is still open-ended enough for the user to imprint his or her aesthetic on the result.<p>While working at VPL, David also integrated the MMP library into Body Electric (below) to make Bounce (also below). The MMP player plug-in is what eventually became Macromedia Shockwave once it was plugged into the web browser (which wasn&#x27;t nearly as fun as plugging it into a full fledged real time interactive visual programming language).<p>Body Electric is a real time visual programming language for VR and music and hardware control, developed at VPL by Chuck Blanchard, which Jaron Lanier and others used to create virtual reality simulations and virtual interactive musical instruments.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jaronlanier.com&#x2F;vpl.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jaronlanier.com&#x2F;vpl.html<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?JaronLanier\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?JaronLanier<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrs.org.uk&#x2F;virtual-reality-profiles&#x2F;vpl-research.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrs.org.uk&#x2F;virtual-reality-profiles&#x2F;vpl-research...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20050228021115&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.well.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;jaron&#x2F;vr.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20050228021115&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.well.c...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20040414174418&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.well.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;jaron&#x2F;instruments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20040414174418&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.well.c...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20050211182929&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.well.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;jaron&#x2F;knittalk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20050211182929&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.well.c...<\/a><p>Body Electric supported all kinds of interesting input and output devices, including MIDI, sending and receiving UDP packets over Ethernet, loading Swivel3D 3D skeleton files and animating them, sending their state over the network to a pair of SGI workstations for rendering with the Isaac rendering engine to the VPL &quot;EyePhones&quot; VR headset (one SGI workstation per eye, with a Mac to run the simulation), VR input devices like VPL&#x27;s DataGlove and Body Suit, 3D input devices like the Ascension Flock of Birds, Polhemus, and Spaceball, 3D audio output devices like the Convolvotron, and lots of other cool stuff.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;est-kl.com&#x2F;manufacturer&#x2F;ascension&#x2F;flock-of-birds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;est-kl.com&#x2F;manufacturer&#x2F;ascension&#x2F;flock-of-birds.htm...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polhemus.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polhemus.com&#x2F;<\/a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cdr.stanford.edu&#x2F;DesignSpace&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;Convolvotron.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cdr.stanford.edu&#x2F;DesignSpace&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;Convolvotro...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;253921765_The_Convolvotron_Real-time_demonstration_of_reverberant_virtual_acoustic_environments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;253921765_The_Convo...<\/a><p>Bounce is a derivative of Body Electric, that David Levitt integrated with the MMP player, and that I helped him develop, and used for some fun projects.

Aaron’s first taste of audio programming was writing computer music in CSound while in graduate school at University of Notre Dame (when he was supposed to be doing astrophysics research). Realising his true calling, he left physics to study procedural and interactive computer music, audio synthesis, and audio analysis with Dr. Curtis Roads at the University of Santa Barbara. His first game audio experience was writing procedural music on Spore where he got to collaborate with Brian Eno and Maxis’ audio director Kent Jolly on writing much of the game’s truly procedural music. His next game audio gig was a sound designer on Dead Space 2 where he wrote much of the games interactive audio systems in Lua along with accomplished audio director Don Veca. He made the leap from technical sound designer to audio programmer at Sledgehammer Games where he worked on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. His next audio programming gig was at ArenaNet where he got to wrangle with the unpredictability and scale of game audio in the context of an MMO and developed some pretty cool tech around for player-created music and musical interaction. He’s currently working on a new multi-platform audio mixer backend for UE4 and developing new tech and approaches to game audio for VR.<p>&gt;Aaron speaks to Oliver about all things Game Audio and Procedural Audio and his unusual entry into the industry.<p>GDC Vault: Procedural Music in SPORE, with Kent Jolly, Aaron McLeran<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gdcvault.com&#x2F;play&#x2F;323&#x2F;Procedural-Music-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gdcvault.com&#x2F;play&#x2F;323&#x2F;Procedural-Music-in<\/a><p>MAKE YOUR OWN KIND OF MUSIC IN &#x27;SPORE&#x27; WITH HELP FROM BRIAN ENO (LISTEN TO THIS)<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2456432&#x2F;make-your-own-kind-of-music-in-spore-with-help-from-brian-eno-listen-to-this&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2456432&#x2F;make-your-own-kind-of-music-...<\/a><p>THE BEAT GOES ON: DYNAMIC MUSIC IN SPORE: Audio engineers Kent Jolly and Aaron McLeran unveil Spore&#x27;s procedural music generation.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moredarkthanshark.org&#x2F;eno_int_gspy-feb08.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moredarkthanshark.org&#x2F;eno_int_gspy-feb08.html<\/a><p>Will Wright and Brian Eno - Generative Systems<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UqzVSvqXJYg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UqzVSvqXJYg<\/a><p>Pure Data<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pure_Data#Projects_using_Pure_Data\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pure_Data#Projects_using_Pure_...<\/a><p>&gt;Projects using Pure Data<p>&gt;Pure Data has been used as the basis of a number of projects, as a prototyping language and a sound engine.

If you&#x27;re new to his content, I&#x27;d recommend starting with that video; it&#x27;s currently his second most popular video on YouTube with 2M views. After watching that series I became interested in how display capabilities are communicated in modern systems and I learned a bit about DisplayID [1], which is a superset of an older (and apparently rather dysfunctional) standard.<p>A bit tangential, but I recently discovered the incredible Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components series (here&#x27;s Vol 1 [2]) and immediately fell in love. It&#x27;s one of those things which you don&#x27;t know you need until you learn of its existence, and then you can&#x27;t live without it. The topics covered by this series go far beyond what you learn as part of a computer engineering or electrical engineering undergraduate program, at least based on my experience and those of my friends.<p>Some commenters are asking about getting started with electronics. My standard suggestion is Make: Electronics [3], which is written for learning by discovery rather than learning by explanation. Read the first page of the Preface [4] for an explanation of what that means; consider picking up a copy if that resonates with you.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20375702\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20375702<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DisplayID\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DisplayID<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makershed.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;make-encyclopedia-of-electronic-components-vol-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makershed.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;make-encyclopedia-of-elec...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makershed.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;make-electronics-2ed4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makershed.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;make-electronics-2ed4<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;ZR3anzQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;ZR3anzQ<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-05 08:26:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["soneil"],"id":[22783501],"kids":[22785438],"parent":[22782282],"text":["I&#x27;ve built a z80 system on a breadboard.

I have to judge the dough at each step and not proceed until it is ready. This is especially true in that I like trying new things, making tweaks, fermenting at different temperatures, and this alters the timing. The timing depends highly on temperature, where in the refresh cycle the starter is at (still rising? fallen and foamy?), but also very much on your particular starter. Some starters run slow (especially newly created ones). Others are fast. Using someone else&#x27;s timing just never seemed to work for me. Early on when I started baking sourdough I made some absolute bricks because I followed the timing that the recipe specified, even though their descriptions of the dough seemed very different to what I was seeing. And if they said two hours, then eight hours must certainly be enough... but it wasn&#x27;t enough. Yes, it really can be off by that far (especially with a new weak sourdough starter that wasn&#x27;t refreshed properly).<p>Nonetheless, you have to have some sort of plan. Turns out that I can always make it work within a certain set of bounds if I am home all day on some given day. And that has driven me into the following pattern:<p>1. Remove sourdough starter from refrigerator the night before, and refresh.<p>2. Build dough in the mid morning with active starter<p>3. Bulk ferment (with stretches and folds) in a proofer until it is ready<p>4. Pre shape. Then shape. Then refrigerate in bags.<p>5. Bake the loaves (I always do two boules) early the next morning.<p>This is by no means the only pattern that can be made to work, but it&#x27;s robust and flexible enough for anything I&#x27;ve ever thrown at it."],"time":["2020-04-05 10:28:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["guidedlight"],"id":[22784111],"kids":[22785233,22784461,22784281,22784349],"parent":[22783597],"text":["I’m from Australia, and this site uses a weird imperial mix and metric measurements.<p>Weights are in grams, but temperature is in fahrenheit (I think, doesn’t actually say).<p>Please use one measurement system make it consistent, as well as switchable.

Regular store bought bread is created with the Chorleywood process, whereby substandard wheat and carbon dioxide can be mashed together to make some dough that can be baked into something that resembles bread.<p>These loaves of bread-style-wheat things are not made with just the basic ingredients needed for bread. There are the E numbers for preservatives and whatever else is &#x27;needed&#x27;. Often the additives are added to the flour rather than the dough and therefore do not have to be listed. Stuff derived from human hair can get in there as an &#x27;E number&#x27;. Often people self-diagnose themselves as having gluten or other allergies when there could be problems with the additives rather than the core product of what bread is supposed to be.<p>Chucking out store bought bread and joining the sourdough club is a popular reaction to the industrial nonsense that poses as &#x27;bread&#x27;. However, there are economic factors at play here. Sourdough keeps and it can be sold at a premium.<p>Actual fresh bread made with yeast and zero additives does not keep and cannot be sold at a premium. It is also less trendy and not on the radar of the hipster crowd. However, if one is sorting out one&#x27;s bread properly then a bread machine and the ingredients for bread making is a shrewd investment. It takes five minutes to load the machine with 500g of flour, 360 ml of water, 25g of some type of fat,  a teaspoon of yeast, a teaspoon and a half of sugar (to make the yeast do its thing) and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt. You can then press the start button to have the freshest bread you could wish for in four hours. Or you can set the timer so it is ready in the morning or when you are back from work.<p>By taking this approach you have the benefits of pure, fresh bread with none of the downsides of lengthy preparation times. You don&#x27;t need an app to manage your sourdough. It is also energy efficient as a bread machine is a small rather than large appliance. The Panasonic machines are best as you have recipes based on that machine plus you can get spare parts and the beginners manual uses metric rather than obscure &#x27;cup sizes&#x27;.<p>With home-machine, properly bakes bread you don&#x27;t need to be chewing on some sourdough rusk that is essentially stale, you can fire up the machine and keep the fresh loaves coming every 2-3 days. You can mix and match the flours to keep your bread varied. You can also focus on what you eat your bread with rather than try to forever by adding ingredients to the bread such as tomatoes, olives, nuts etc.<p>If you can maintain the routine then you never need join the sourdough club, you can cut your own way with the innovative &#x27;yeast&#x27; ingredient used properly rather than thrown out."],"time":["2020-04-05 12:26:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["awinter-py"],"id":[22787156],"kids":{},"parent":[22783597],"text":["love the gantt charts"],"time":["2020-04-05 19:59:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thendrill"],"id":[22784519],"kids":{},"parent":[22783597],"text":["This is the exact type of tooling that current electronic media needs to leverage itself beyond just.... &quot;news paper on a TV screen&quot;.<p>Great job great execution, and very nice and clean design!"],"time":["2020-04-05 10:38:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["barry27"],"id":[22784543],"kids":{},"parent":[22783597],"text":["&quot;3:38am<p>Cut and Enjoy\n&quot;<p>Honestly this site is everything that&#x27;s up with the world these days.

Single Founder: Plenty examples of successful bootstrappers on Indiehackers. There are also plenty of failed bootstrappers, but you likely won&#x27;t hear about them obviously. The reasons pg listed for single founder failure is still valid for a bootstrapper though - it&#x27;s a very lonely journey.<p>2. Bad Location: this is important for a different reason: as a bootstrapper relying on their own savings, I&#x27;d say location with low cost of living and fast Internet is the most ideal.<p>3. Marginal Niche: bootstrappers target niches since they&#x27;re not focused on hyper-growth like conventional startups do.<p>4. Derivative Idea: not that big of a deal. Derivative ideas are pretty common amongst bootstrappers. You spend less time finding product&#x2F;market fit if you work on popular&#x2F;derivative ideas - but of course you&#x27;ll also run into plenty of competitors.<p>5. Obstinacy: yeah, big killer. Be willing to adapt is sound advice regardless of your situation. The question is when do you know things aren&#x27;t working well, or you just need to push a little more? Talk to users.<p>6. Hiring Bad Programmers: Definitely a killer. For bootstrappers who work alone, the question becomes am I skilled enough to build the product within a realistic scope and timeframe?<p>7. Choosing the Wrong Platform: people tend to use whatever they&#x27;re most skilled at&#x2F;comfortable with. It&#x27;s still important that you do a survey of what&#x27;s available out there before you commit, and always have a realistic migration plan when your success outgrows your initial scope.<p>8. Slowness in Launching: bootstrappers are big on the idea of MVPs and launching fast, but in practice, this is hard. Perfectionism is the bane of those who failed to launch.<p>9. Launching too Early: valid, but I imagine this is less of a problem for bootstrappers since you likely don&#x27;t have much attention at the initial launch anyway.<p>10. Having No Specific User In Mind: totally valid.<p>11. Raising too little money: irrelevant.<p>12. Spending too much: I can&#x27;t speak for all bootstrappers, but if you&#x27;re bootstrapping from your own savings you&#x27;re likely to be more careful with your spending.<p>13. Raising too much money: irrelevant.<p>14. Poor investor management: irrelevant.<p>15. Sacrificing Users to Supposed Profit: bootstrapped companies have to be profitable from day 1. There&#x27;s no investor money to keep you going. I believe a good trade-off can be achieved here.<p>16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty: yeah, arguably the most important one. Only way to deal with this is to constantly reach out to people and talk to them.<p>17. Fights Between Founders: totally valid, but irrelevant to single founder bootstrappers (plenty of these).<p>18. A half-hearted effort: a killer, for sure. But you don&#x27;t necessarily have to quit your day job. Ideally, work part time as a consultant&#x2F;contractor, and work on your business the rest of the time. It comes down to self (and time) management."],"time":["2020-04-05 21:14:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bze12"],"id":[22788661],"kids":{},"parent":[22766760],"text":["this still holds pretty true, but you know the essay is dated when he calls it &quot;The Facebook&quot;"],"time":["2020-04-05 22:55:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ablekh"],"id":[22789173],"kids":{},"parent":[22766760],"text":["Here are relevant thoughts from 10 years later by another well-known venture capitalist (and 2x founder) Mark Suster: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bothsidesofthetable.com&#x2F;how-to-decrease-the-odds-that-your-startup-fails-e0fc13213792\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bothsidesofthetable.com&#x2F;how-to-decrease-the-odds-tha...<\/a>."],"time":["2020-04-06 00:12:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jimthrow"],"id":[22788848],"kids":{},"parent":[22766760],"text":["Most software startups die due to lack of demand for their product."],"time":["2020-04-05 23:23:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacknews"],"id":[22785357],"kids":[22785446],"parent":[22766760],"text":["messages from a bygone era"],"time":["2020-04-05 14:58:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dbcurtis"],"id":[22786495],"kids":[22790033,22786930,22788828,22789453],"parent":[22785015],"text":["How antennas work, very high level:<p>1.

These waves would be transmitted all around that point distributed as sphere. All points of a sphere will have the same power. Now, an antenna has a different geometry than a point that helps somehow &quot;focus&quot; the EM waves, so their power is not distributed around the sphere uniformally but some directions get more power depending on the antenna design.<p>Now the thing to keep in mind is that an antenna is a passive device. It does amplify the signal but it does not add any power to it, it just collects the power to specific points. This may be easier to understand with a receiving antenna (which collects the signal).<p>For example, consider the satellite dish which is of course an antenna. Due to its design it should be conceptually easy to understand that the power of the transmitted field is all gathered in a very small area in the front of the dish. The largest the dish, the smaller the point where all the transmitted power is pointed, so less power would be needed to cover largest distances (and more difficult finding where the dish needs to point)."],"time":["2020-04-05 19:45:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["supernova87a"],"id":[22788284],"kids":[22789767,22788726],"parent":[22785015],"text":["One thing I have always struggled to understand about antennas --<p>Of course I know that an antenna is most efficient at radiating power when its length is some fraction&#x2F;multiple of the emitted wavelength.

It uses an embedded parenthesis syntax similar to Lisp or Scheme, with prefix functions.<p>I couldn&#x27;t see (other than reading the code) if you have an expression (foo bar quux) if foo is first evaluated before\ncalling the result. I seem to recall Scheme follows this approach.<p>Alternately, the name foo could be looked up in a global symbol table and the result (presumably a lambda expression) is applied to the list of evaluated arguments (bar quux). I associate this approach with Lisp.<p>I didn&#x27;t see any error trapping mentioned in the documentation, so I assume if you try to do something like divide by zero, that Fe will crash.  How much work does it take to implement a simple error trap strategy ?<p>I didn&#x27;t see if the language supports a fluid let (any variable name is looked up at run time when the reference is encountered thru the stack levels until the name is found.  Presumably each time new variables are created with let, they would be added at run-time to the symbol table.<p>The other choice would be that the variables are lexically scoped.  Thus when reading in the code, variables are &quot;found&quot; in the order the program is written on the page, and there is no searching of the run time stack frames to find the &quot;innermost&quot; version of the variable name.<p>From what I can see, Fe is a good language to use if you are happy with the capabilities the implementor defined initially.\nThere is a set of functions, named after mathematical operators, like &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot; etc. and logical operators like &quot;AND&quot; &quot;NOT&quot; etc.   The doc says these functions take a variable number of arguments, evaluate them, and then the operator takes each of the results, and does some operation using them, such as adding them together, or returning false if any of them are false (AND)<p>I see nothing in the docs suggesting how a programmer would create his own functions that function in this way.<p>It&#x27;s not clear if the logical operators &quot;short cut&quot; on evaluation of the arguments.  ie: with (or bar quux qide)\ndoes the value of quux even get evaluated if bar is true ?<p>Is there a short and sweet checklist to help describe a programming language you have never seen so you know how these types of issues are addressed in the implementation?<p>Thanks for sharing your code.

I wonder if anyone else feels that virtual museum tours are so far from ideal that it isn&#x27;t worthwhile investing the time to browse? I can&#x27;t seem to get into them -- not because of trivial reasons like &quot;oh it&#x27;s not like the real thing&quot;, but more like no one&#x27;s been able to produce the right UI for enjoying a museum. Even Google&#x27;s Art and Culture indoor maps of museums is only good for 5 minutes of amusement and not worth bothering with again. I clicked on several links in the comments and was like, eh -- doesn&#x27;t really hold my interest (though if I were physically at the museum I&#x27;d be spending hours).<p>I wonder if these are factors:<p>1) Lack of good photography. Most museums tend to be dark, so you need professional photographers who know how to work with low-light photography. Also most pictures&#x2F;videos tend to be low res for some reason, which takes away from the enjoyment. I wonder if most museums are loath to make high-res photography available for free because it cannibalizes their admissions.<p>Google Arts and Culture has some high-res artwork, but the selection is extremely limited.<p>2) Unwieldy ways to move in space. Google indoor maps, which has a FPS (first person shooter) interface, isn&#x27;t the most natural to navigate, because it doesn&#x27;t match how people actually experience a museum. I wonder if instead of an FPS perspective, an adventure-game orthographic view might make more sense? It would let you walk around the museum and click on objects to interact with them. Also let&#x27;s face it -- professional museum goers will tell you that they are extremely selective and don&#x27;t interact with all exhibits, so a frictionless way to preview and skip exhibits is key.<p>3) Limited&#x2F;non-comprehensive collection. Usually only the less interesting collections are online. (not always true, but generally true). This is likely due to the cost of putting entire collections online, and there not being a lot of payoff -- unless it was possible to create a UI good enough to support monetization.<p>4) Lack of a cohesive story. Because only select pieces are on display online, the experience is disjointed,  vs browsing a physical section of the museum which groups like objects together.

So it seems to me that time cannot exist without movement which makes me think that time is a byproduct of motion (a history of motion)."],"time":["2020-04-05 21:04:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Razengan"],"id":[22787972],"kids":[22788097,22788808,22788057],"parent":[22787020],"text":["Maybe I’m not smart enough to find time as confusing as these things try to point out:<p>Time is the sequence of states every time the rules are applied, or am I missing something?"],"time":["2020-04-05 21:38:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saagarjha"],"id":[22787623],"kids":[22787707,22788347],"parent":[22787020],"text":["This is a pretty awful Wikipedia article.

Angle brackets are also not <i>uniformly<\/i> superior. <i>Technically<\/i>, I think it’s fair to consider them uniformly superior, but social aspects are important too; there was reasonable concern that Rust had exhausted its weirdness budget. (Of the most common languages people may be familiar with when coming to Rust, I think Scala is the only one that uses square brackets for generics; the likes of C++, C and Java are much more common and use angle brackets.)<p>2. For Rust specifically, it wouldn’t actually have been just a syntactic change—if you want to change array indexing to use function call syntax, you’ve got to sort out more technical challenges there, things that would be approaching trivial in full-GC languages but which are actually rather difficult in Rust. Specifically, function calls are rvalues only (`… = f()`), but array indexing can be an lvalue also (`a[i] = …`). So you need to more or less unify the Index and Fn trait families, auto-ref&#x2F;-deref might cause trouble, and placement might make an appearance in it too for best results (and that’s something that still isn’t resolved). Now I’m inclined to believe that these changes would have been a really good thing and resulted in a more coherent and incidentally slightly more flexible language (and not in a dangerous way), but it would now be even more difficult to achieve (though <i>not<\/i> impossible; the edition system could be used for the syntax side of things, and Fn&#x2F;Index implementations are still mutually exclusive, because you can’t implement Fn manually on stable, so you could blanket-impl Fn traits for types implementing Index traits without breaking backwards-compatibility).<p>I’m simplifying the story a bit.
