The last one was the biggest and most egregious. There was clear prior art, at least to anyone with a solid understanding of the field (in this case, adding state to otherwise-stateless HTTP interaction).<p>I remember looking the jury in the eye during my testimony and thinking &quot;these people are tired, they are bored and they don&#x27;t really have a clue about any of the technology involved here&quot;. Sure, it&#x27;s the lawyers job(s) to try to make sure they do, and that they decide in the &quot;right&quot; direction.

I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but I did manage to get a patent a few years ago. It was for something obvious (math in fact!), but my business partners at the time thought it was worth getting. Haven&#x27;t used it to troll anyone, and I don&#x27;t like the idea, but the process did get me thinking a lot about whether patents are a net positive to society.<p>I think they aren&#x27;t.<p>Having a patent system gives people the wrong impression that there&#x27;s some special nugget of knowledge that is crucial to creating value. You often hear people who aren&#x27;t in the entrepreneurial space talk about how they just need a &quot;good idea&quot;. In practice, there&#x27;s very few things that work that way. Every time I&#x27;ve started a business, there&#x27;s been a lot of work that isn&#x27;t so much developing &quot;the idea&quot; as much as finding ways to connect it economically the rest of the world. Whereas the naive view would be something like &quot;once we invent fusion, it will be easy to sell&quot;.<p>For similar reasons, exclusivity is not necessarily a good way to reward innovators. Essentially my thinking is that innovating is actually only half the work, if even. Say you invent the cure for coronavirus. How useful is that actually, without a plan for making it at scale and distributing it? And what is the chance that the guy who spent his life building cures for viral diseases is also the guy who can build factories and delivery networks? The retort to that may be that the innovator can outsource those things, but why would we give them the exclusive right to do that, when he&#x27;d only gotten one piece of the puzzle?<p>Patents also allow incumbents to create costs that deter new entrants. They seem to be so loosely defined that any suitably large corporation that feels threatened can throw them at any other player and the lawyers win, like this article is talking about. It&#x27;s great that they are fighting but there&#x27;s a problem if the troll has deep pockets.<p>One big issue that is mentioned is that the troll doesn&#x27;t need to produce anything working. So basically they don&#x27;t need to show that they are making anything of value. No customers needs to ever have benefitted from the patent. So somehow the system would still punish an honest player who tries to be useful to other people.<p>Finally, the thesis itself of how patents are supposed to work needs evidence to support it. I don&#x27;t see any evidence other than thought experiment to say that something was invented because the patent system existed. All I see is that if you can patent something, you do. Not that you try to invent something because patents exist."],"time":["2020-02-08 11:15:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["glangdale"],"id":[22274674],"kids":[22277377],"parent":[22262291],"text":["We once got spammed by Columbia Universities&#x27; IP arm when we were a tiny startup.

If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”\n\n  18 “Which ones?” he inquired.\n\n  Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you\n  shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, \n\n  19 honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’”\n\n  20 “All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”\n\n  21 Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and\n  give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow\n  me.”\n\n  22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great\n  wealth.\n\n  23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for\n  someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\n  24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of \n  a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”\n\n  25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked,\n  “Who then can be saved?”\n\n  26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God\n  all things are possible.”\n\n  27 Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you!

My purpose is not to change anyone&#x27;s mind, nor is it to defend the LDS church in this particular case (actually I think they&#x27;ve got it quite wrong). Instead, it is to inform people what the culture of the church is like, and maybe if I&#x27;m really successful to help you understand how we can produce members like Clay Christensen on the one hand, and own 2% of Florida on the other.<p>One thing to understand about the LDS church is that the leadership is drawn from the membership, but is really <i>really<\/i> not representative of that membership. In order to become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the highest leadership body in the church, you essentially have to have spent decades serving full-time as a church leader at lower levels. This means that all the members of the quorum are old men (and yes, they are all men - that&#x27;s another discussion). We have been accused - correctly - of being a gerontocracy.<p>There are two implications of this. One is that on social issues, the church leadership lags the membership by at least a generation, usually two. Furthermore, the upper membership of the church leads by consensus, ideally unanimous consensus. It takes a long time to get more than a dozen people on the same page about almost anything, much less something like the theological implications of homosexuality (to name one topic of the day). This goes some way to explaining why the leadership keeps getting caught flat-footed when regarding issues of transparency, LGBTQ relations, race, and so on. They aren&#x27;t the internet generation and it shows.<p>But it has a second implication as well. Church leadership often remembers and understands church history completely differently than the lay membership does. In particular, for this issue, in the early part of the 20th century the church nearly went bankrupt. They ended up calling several people with strong business backgrounds to the Quorum of the Twelve, and one of those went on to become President. They managed to put the church&#x27;s finances on a firm foundation. For obvious reasons, none of this tends to get discussed in Sunday School, and most of the membership of the church no longer remembers it. But the leadership most certainly does. In addition, it led to more and more church leaders having business backgrounds instead of pastoral care backgrounds, and as a consequence they tend to view achieving a good ROI on &quot;the Lord&#x27;s money&quot; as being a primary good. I personally disagree, but it is what it is.<p>Next, one thing to note is that none of the church leadership is personally getting rich off of tithing funds. The leadership draws a salary; that salary lets them live comfortably, but it isn&#x27;t 7 figures. Nobody lives in a mansion or flies a private jet. So, then, why are they sitting on an enormous cash pile? In my personal opinion, it isn&#x27;t primarily about the money. It&#x27;s primarily about increasing commitment to the institution. Paying tithing is &quot;faith promoting&quot;. It gives the membership skin in the game. They aren&#x27;t just showing up to a church building for two hours on Sunday. They&#x27;re actively participating in building the Kingdom of God.<p>Of course, you can take the phrase &quot;commitment to the institution&quot; two different ways, depending on your going-in assumptions. For the faithful, building the faith of the membership is a primary good and indeed a principal goal of God. For the skeptical it looks like brainwashing with a nice side benefit of extra cash in the coffers.<p>The next obvious question is, even if you&#x27;re one of the faithful, and you assume that paying tithing is indeed a good way of building a faith community, can&#x27;t they come up with ways of using the money that are more in line with Christ&#x27;s teachings than buying up 2% of Florida? And I wholeheartedly agree. There are. And, of course, owning large tracts of real estate and a mall in downtown Salt Lake City and your own private securities investment firm don&#x27;t make a lot of sense if nobody in the leadership is living like a sheik. So why not spend all of (or at least a lot more of) that cash on charitable works? Why not just go in and rebuild Haiti, or cure cancer, or something?<p>And I honestly don&#x27;t know. I go back to the leadership&#x27;s business background and their recollection of the church nearly going bankrupt, and I can sort of see it... but then I read the Sermon on the Mount, and I can&#x27;t again. I have to chalk it up to a lack of imagination, combined with a loss of pastoral care instincts in the church leadership.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think it will change... eventually. The time constant of change in the LDS church is something like 20 years, so don&#x27;t expect it to happen tomorrow.<p>Finally, for those of you who have left the church and felt like it tried to take your dignity when you left, I&#x27;m sorry. My wife left, and that wasn&#x27;t our experience. Your experience with the church is almost completely due to the culture and local leadership in your local congregation, and in a lot of cases that can be quite good, but it can also be fairly toxic if you&#x27;re unlucky. I&#x27;ve experienced both, but more of the former. Of course, my experiences don&#x27;t help you if yours are different.

Colab uses Google Drive which is convenient to use but very slow. For example, training datasets often contain a large amount of small files (eg 50k images in the sample TensorFlow and PyTorch datasets). Colab will start to crawl when it tries to ingest these files which is a really standard workflow for ML&#x2F;DL. It&#x27;s great for toy projects eg training MNIST but not for training more interesting models that are popular in the research&#x2F;professional communities today.<p>- Notebooks are fully persistent. With Colab, you need to re-install everything every time you start your Notebook.<p>- Colab instances can be shutdown (preempted) in the middle of a session leading to potential loss of work. Gradient will guarantee the entire session.<p>- Gradient offers the ability to add more storage and higher-end dedicated GPUs from the same environment. If you want to train a more sophisticated model that requires say a day or two of training and maybe a 1TB dataset, that&#x27;s all possible. You could even use the 1-click deploy option to make your model available as an API endpoint. The free GPU tier is just an entrypoint into a full production-ready ML pipeline. With Colab, you would need to take your model somewhere else to accomplish these more advanced tasks.<p>- A large repository of ML templates that include all the major frameworks eg the obvious TensorFlow and PyTorch but also MXNet, Chainer, CNTK, etc. Gradient also includes a public datasets repository with a growing list of common datasets freely available to use in your projects.<p>Those are the main pieces but happy to elaborate on any of this or other questions!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gradient.paperspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gradient.paperspace.com<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-08 23:54:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["freediver"],"id":[22278546],"kids":[22280228,22278849,22283693],"parent":[22274938],"text":["Good idea, but it&#x27;s the first premium product that I&#x27;ve seen where the pitch is &#x27;you <i>may<\/i> get certain features if you subscribe&#x27;.

Floppy disks were terrible: slow and prone to developing errors if you looked at them disapprovingly. If you wanted something, you better make two copies because looking at a disk wrong would lead to corrupted sectors. Wares was a slow business back then.<p>4. 10Base2 was awesome so long as no one disconnected the line between nodes or either terminator.<p>5. There wasn&#x27;t much open source back then. In fact, the prevailing paradigm led to pointless code hoarding for things that weren&#x27;t ever going to be products.

I put together a project writeup[1], and have been doing a little bit of development on my fork of the firmware in order to significantly speed up raster &amp; fill engraving, and to and put in some quality of life software mods.[2]<p>Unfortunately the original creators have abandoned the project, but fortunately it&#x27;s completely open source so it&#x27;s still buildable. Mine cost about $7k for the parts and all the accessories I had to get along with it, but I think that there&#x27;s a lot of low-hanging fruit in someone going through and updating a lot of the more expensive parts in the BOM. I saved about $2k by doing so and put together a spreadsheet linked to from [1], but there&#x27;s definitely still room to upgrade the steppers to something cheaper and more powerful, etc. There was a good discussion in the mailing list[3] a few weeks ago about whether it still makes sense in 2020 to build a Lasersaur. I&#x27;m personally of the opinion that if you want a laser cutter for the purpose of creating stuff with it, the best option is going to be getting a Chinese cutter, doing a few upgrades, and buying Lightburn as your software interface. But if you want the experience of building &#x2F; intimately knowing the machine and find that rewarding in and of itself, go for it.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theshamblog.com&#x2F;a-tour-of-the-lasersaur-laser-cutter&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theshamblog.com&#x2F;a-tour-of-the-lasersaur-laser-cutter...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scottshambaugh&#x2F;driveboardapp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scottshambaugh&#x2F;driveboardapp<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!topic&#x2F;lasersaur&#x2F;Ieu6aAG_0sc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!topic&#x2F;lasersaur&#x2F;Ieu6aAG_0s...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-11 20:16:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["misthop"],"id":[22275809],"kids":[22276470],"parent":[22275311],"text":["The 7000 price point is an interesting middle ground.

The magic was always in the \nnew pair of shoes. The magic might die by the first of September, but now in late June \nthere was still plenty of magic, and shoes like these could jump you over trees and rivers \nand houses.

To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise—and verify—conditions under which a hardware design is free of timing variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open source hardware designs in seconds and with little developer effort. IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module."],"time":["2020-02-08 15:41:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["reagent_finder"],"id":[22275429],"kids":{},"parent":[22268067],"text":["&gt;“Soon, my colleagues started to complement the experiment by adding some LEGO trees on top of the structure,” recounts Michael. “I had to write a message asking them not to do so.”<p>Proving yet again, that given ANYTHING that is efficient engineers will eventually try to improve it."],"time":["2020-02-08 13:36:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["m4rtink"],"id":[22275842],"kids":{},"parent":[22268067],"text":["This kinda reminds me how Otto Wichtrle created the first contact lense on a machine build from the Merkur construction set (known as Mechano in the West):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Soubor:Merkur_based_apparatus_for_centrifugal_casting_of_contact_lenses_by_wichterle.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Soubor:Merkur_based_apparatu...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;soft-contact-lenses-were-created-with-a-toy-construction-set&#x2F;381070&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;soft-...<\/a><p>Even saw the actual mashine on an exhibition once - cleverly done &amp; powered by a bicycle dynamo. :-)"],"time":["2020-02-08 15:25:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xenonite"],"id":[22275573],"kids":[22275639,22276264],"parent":[22268067],"text":["This gives snother example where the old-generation Lego Technics bricks shine.

We encode complex algorithms in static, abstract text descriptions that are hard for humans to understand and reason about. We have to imagine the behavior in our heads from these illegible descriptions. The behavior and internal workings of their programs are invisible.<p>Not to mention that when trying to modify other&#x27;s programs there is often a huge communication problem, trying to construct a mental model of what the program does is a tedious and often impossible endeavor because of missing context. Just think, how is it even possible to make &quot;write-only code&quot;, code that was understood when written but is now completely unintelligible. To me, that should be impossible. Or think about how open source software is open in that its code is available, but closed in terms of being easily understood — there&#x27;s the formidable cognitive challenge of understanding the program well enough to be able to modify it to one&#x27;s ends. For most people, this is a significant and unreasonable effort.<p>What to do about all this? To me, the answer is redesign programming so that it is primarily about communicating behavior to humans.

But most of the systems in place focus either on static graphs or on entire graph snapshots if they consider dynamic (time-evolving) graphs.<p>However, to minimize the effect of malicious activities and start recovery as soon as possible, we need to detect anomalies in real-time or near real-time i.e. to identify whether an incoming edge is anomalous or not, as soon as we receive it. In addition, since the number of vertices can increase as we process the stream of edges, we need an algorithm which uses constant memory in graph size. Moreover, fraudulent or anomalous events in many applications occur in microclusters or suddenly arriving groups of suspiciously similar edges e.g. denial of service attacks in network traffic data and lockstep behavior.<p>In this work, we propose MIDAS, which detects microcluster anomalies, or suddenly arriving groups of suspiciously similar edges, in edge streams, using constant time and memory. In addition, by using a principled hypothesis testing framework, MIDAS provides theoretical bounds on the false positive probability, which earlier methods do not provide. Also, we are up to 644 times faster and 48% more accurate than previous state of the art approaches.<p>For more details, read the paper at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.comp.nus.edu.sg&#x2F;~sbhatia&#x2F;assets&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;midas.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.comp.nus.edu.sg&#x2F;~sbhatia&#x2F;assets&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;midas.pdf<\/a><p>If you are in New York, you are welcome to attend the talk at AAAI in New York Hilton Midtown on 11th February at 2pm."],"time":["2020-02-07 20:04:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ZhuoCai"],"id":[22342330],"kids":{},"parent":[22268436],"text":["Before I read your paper, I didn&#x27;t realize the power of hypothesis tests.

I would agree that for me at least some modern day comforts tend to dull me down rather than fire me up. Here&#x27;s a personal experiences:<p>- Netflix and TV -\nI really love watching movies,and series. I&#x27;ve binge watched a crazy amount of Netflix TV series. At my worst I&#x27;d stay up until 3am on a binge, and would sometimes combine this with drinking whiskey. Doing so would interfere with my sleep, the alcohol would affect my mood within the next few days, and of course living this way means I&#x27;m not spending time on more productive or worthwhile activities.<p>These days I hardly ever watch TV, and instead of watching movies at home I like to go to the movies instead. It&#x27;s much more enjoyable and makes watching movies feel more special.<p>- Coffee -\nI tend to think of coffee as the equivalent of little kids drinking hot milk - except we&#x27;re adults now and our hot milk has been combined with coffee. One thing I noticed drinking coffee is that the caffeine increased my general anxiety levels. Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that consuming lots of dairy products makes me feel a bit sick and yuck afterwards. So I switched to a combination of herbal tea and sometimes have decaf coffee - I did get some headaches after I did this, so would recommend slowly weaning yourself off caffeine rather than going cold turkey.<p>- Food in General -\nA lot of food these day is made for convenience. Cereals, bread, high in sugar products etc. I&#x27;ve slowly been getting a more nutritious diet and cooking a lot more. As mentioned with coffee, milk makes me feel a bit sick after so I don&#x27;t buy any kinds of milk anymore. Sugar is something I&#x27;m still working on and is super addictive (also non-dairy milk usually has ~10% sugar in it!), so I&#x27;m working on weaning myself off that as well. I find that having a better diet has allowed me to recognize more easily what foods make me feel yuck. I believe diet is huge in affecting how you feel.<p>- Exercise - \nIntense exercise makes you feel sick when you first start doing it, but over time the sick feeling goes away and it can lead to a much healthier lifestyle and feeling better about yourself. If I eat something bad or drink alcohol on a Friday, during my intense Saturday workout I know instantly what I did wrong. Creating a routine out of this has helped change my behavior because on a Friday I will intentionally not do certain things in order to avoid the sick feeling on the Saturday. Not comfortable at all, but totally worth it.<p>- Sleep -\nI&#x27;ve been working on getting to bed much earlier (around 9-9:30pm). It&#x27;s a work in progress but I feel much better for it.<p>- Following your Dreams -\nOver the past year I&#x27;ve sacrificed a cushy salary and tried new things to support my dream of being a successful entrepreneur. I spent thousands of dollars on courses, and had a crack at phone sales. It hasn&#x27;t always been easy, but I&#x27;m proud of myself for giving it a go. I believe that a big reason for feelings of depression or anger in life is because we&#x27;ve forgotten our dreams, and aren&#x27;t being true to ourselves. Recently I found the book Think and Grow Rich and have been reading that, and have also had friends that have been supporting me with their words and thoughts. In particular I have a friend I&#x27;ve made in recent years who is actively encouraging me, and I can tell you that having just one person that encourages you can make the world of difference.<p>- The Mind&#x27;s Focus -\nA work in progress for me is where I focus my mind. If I can actively do something to make a situation better, then I think of what action to take to improve that situation. If I&#x27;m unwilling to change that or if I&#x27;m powerless to do so then I do my best to let it go, or to remove myself from that situation. Sometimes this is difficult. Sometimes I have to take a big action, let people down, or there might be things I want to care about that I&#x27;ve realised just aren&#x27;t worth spending the emotional energy on. This is a big one when it comes to comfort - it may be more comfortable not to step up and do something, but you&#x27;re worse off for it."],"time":["2020-02-09 06:28:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["silenussays"],"id":[22280221],"kids":{},"parent":[22277414],"text":["Get a load of the author&#x27;s profile photo.

The trait is clearly biological: it is widespread and has a strong additive genetic basis, but how SSSA has evolved remains a subject of debate. Of itself, homosexual sexual behavior will not yield offspring, and consequently individuals expressing strong SSSA that are mostly or exclusively homosexual are presumed to have lower fitness and reproductive success. How then did the trait evolve, and how is it maintained in populations? Here we develop a novel argument for the evolution of SSSA that focuses on the likely adaptive social consequences of SSSA. We argue that same sex sexual attraction evolved as just one of a suite of traits responding to strong selection for ease of social integration or prosocial behavior. A strong driver of recent human behavioral evolution has been selection for reduced reactive aggression, increased social affiliation, social communication, and ease of social integration. In many prosocial mammals sex has adopted new social functions in contexts of social bonding, social reinforcement, appeasement, and play. We argue that for humans the social functions and benefits of sex apply to same-sex sexual behavior as well as heterosexual behavior. As a consequence we propose a degree of SSSA, was selected for in recent human evolution for its non-conceptive social benefits. We discuss how this hypothesis provides a better explanation for human sexual attractions and behavior than theories that invoke sexual inversion or single-locus genetic models.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6976918&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6976918&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-08 18:08:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["diroussel"],"id":[22276782],"kids":{},"parent":[22275957],"text":["Not sure it&#x27;s the same angle, as I can&#x27;t open the paywall.

In order to fix things so that we can iterate a table in a consistent manner, this is my fix (public domain [1], if those who want to copy and paste it):<p><pre><code>  function sorted_table_keys(t)\n    local a = {}\n    local b = 1\n    for k,_ in pairs(t) do -- pairs() use OK; will sort \n      a[b] = k\n      b = b + 1\n    end\n    table.sort(a, function(y,z) return tostring(y) &lt; tostring(z) end)\n    return a\n  end\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThen we iterate the table like this:<p><pre><code>  for _, key in ipairs(sorted_table_keys(foo)) do\n    local value = foo[key]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n(In Lua, two dashes indicates a comment.)<p>Note that this code will not always sort in the same order all tables.
