We provide a ton of features: an API registry, API autocomplete, code generation, serverless hosting for your APIs, an in-browser execution engine for your workflows, observability + logging, complete revision history.

Not only bg services are killed off from memory by aggressive memory managers of crappy phone vendors, Google themselves push developers to rely on proprietary FCM services. The writing is on the wall, and one day background services in Android will simply cease to work, all in the name of better battery life and  customer care. So this OpenPush service will be short lived, it&#x27;ll likely be disallowed to work in this form in Android 12 or 13.<p>The only proper long-term solution here is an anti-monopoly legislation, that would make Google allow Android users to subscribe to a third-party push notification service. Such service is, actually, a relatively simple: current FCM is just a modified XMPP connection that a phone keeps, and it will be easy to replicate and deploy.<p>Apple is guilty of this, too. A proper anti-monopoly legislations should target them as well, and not only make them allow third-party app stores, but third party push notifications as well.<p>This control of push notification services and restriction creep that occurs on both platforms makes Google&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s grip on their respective OSs much tighter than Microsoft&#x27;s grip on Windows ever was.

For example, with Project Fi you&#x27;d use $NUMBER@msg.fi.google.com [0]. You can use this as a super simple alert or notification system for scripting and small self-hosted apps without having to setup any additional services or tools. However, it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that both email and text messaging are unencrypted by default, so you should be careful with what you send.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a situation in which this might be useful: You have a 15 to 30 minute task running, such as downloading a large file (e.g. Linux ISOs) from a remote server or compiling a small C++ project. Instead of sitting around waiting you could go outside for a short walk in order to get a bit of exercise and sunlight, which helps you get to the recommended minimum of 10k daily steps. Once the task is finished you receive a text message which prompts you to head back inside.<p>If you just want to send yourself notifications then you can actually get pretty far only using email and text messaging. However, I&#x27;m aware that OpenPush solves a few different problems, and I love that we&#x27;re finally getting an open-source self-hosted alternative to GCM.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;fi&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6356597?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6216184\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;fi&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6356597?hl=en&amp;ref_topic...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-12 12:31:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gdeglin"],"id":[22306774],"kids":[22306845,22306835,22307122,22307685,22307232,22307224],"parent":[22306174],"text":["This is an interesting idea.

It is scary to make your &quot;learn a new language&quot; task to port 14,000 lines of code, but with that in mind, this all seems to have gone well.

It is absolutely not for things like &quot;timeout waiting for webserver&quot; or &quot;no rows in the database&quot; as other languages use exceptions for.  For those, you return an error and either wrap it with fmt.Errorf(&quot;waiting for webserver: %w&quot;, err) or check it with errors.Is and move on.  Yup, you have to remember to do that or your program will run weirdly.  It&#x27;s just how it is.  There is not something better that maybe with some experimentation you will figure out.  You have to just do the tedious, boring, and simple thing.<p>I have used recover exactly once in my career.  I wrote a program that accepted mini-programs (more like rules) via a config file that could be reloaded at runtime.  We tried to prove them safe, but recover was there so that we could disable the faulty rule and keep running in the event some sort of null pointer snuck in.  (I don&#x27;t think one ever did!)<p>&gt; Pass-by-reference vs. pass-by-value<p>I feel like the author wants []*Type instead of []Type here.<p>&gt; Absence of sum&#x2F;discriminated-union types<p>True.  Depending on what your goals are, there are many possibilities:<p><pre><code>   type IntOrString struct { i int; s string; iok, sok bool }\n   func (i IntOrString) String() (string, error) { if i.sok { return i.s, nil } else { return &quot;&quot;, errors.New(&quot;is not a string&quot;) }}\n   func NewInt(x int) IntOrString { return IntOrString{i: x, iok: true} }\n   ...\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis uses more memory than interface{}, but it&#x27;s also very clear what you intend for this thing to be.<p>I will also point out that switch can bind the value for you:<p><pre><code>   switch x := foo.(type) {\n   case int:\n      return x + 1\n   case string:\n      i, err := strconv.Atoi(x)\n      return i + 1\n   }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnd that you need not name types merely to call methods on them:<p><pre><code>   if x, ok := foo.(interface { IntValue() int }); ok { return x.IntValue() }\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYou can also go crazy like the proto compiler does for implementations of &quot;oneof&quot; and have infinite flexibility.  It is not very ergonomic, but it is reliable.<p>&gt; Keyword arguments<p><pre><code>   type Point struct { X, Y float64 }\n\n   func EuclideanDistance(a, b Point) float64 { ... }\n\n   EuclideanDistance(Point{X: 1, Y: 2}, Point{3, 4})\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt; No map over slices<p>This one is like returning errors.  You will press a lot of buttons on your keyboard.  It is how it is.<p>I personally hate typing the average &quot;simple&quot; for loop:<p><pre><code>   func fooToInterface(foos []foo) []interface{} {\n       var result []interface{}\n       for _, f := range foos {\n           result = append(result, f)\n       }\n       return result\n   }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBut it&#x27;s also not that hard.  I used to be a Python readability reviewer at Google.  I always had the hardest time reading people&#x27;s very aggressive list comprehensions.  It was like they HAD to get their entire program into one line of code, or people wouldn&#x27;t think they were smart.  The result was that the line became a black box; nobody would read it, it was just assumed to work.<p>I really like seeing the word &quot;for&quot; twice when you&#x27;re iterating over two things."],"time":["2020-02-12 03:09:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["luord"],"id":[22312580],"kids":{},"parent":[22304131],"text":["I liked this summation because the migration happened for a truly valid reason: Python <i>really<\/i> was a bottleneck.

I&#x27;ve heard explanations from y&#x27;all about how handshake tries to solve the squatter problem. As far as I understand those explanations:<p>- Names are released at a trickle, meaning no one can buy all of them in one go.<p>- Names have to be constantly renewed (it&#x27;s not a buy-once-keep-forever scheme), and (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), you can&#x27;t buy 10 years out in advance.<p>- A large portion of the initial names are reserved for Open Source developers, under the assumption that squatting won&#x27;t be so much of a problem if they get first pick.<p>It&#x27;s still not clear to me how this solves resource scarcity.<p>- If names are released at a trickle, does this mean I might want to register a domain for a project and there literally won&#x27;t be any able available for me to choose from?<p>- If names have to be renewed on a year-by-year basis, is there any mechanism for archival? Won&#x27;t this be strictly worse for link rot?<p>- If names are released at a trickle, doesn&#x27;t this create an even greater incentive for both good and bad actors to grab them as soon as they become available?<p>I&#x27;m mildly interested in Handshake because based on very limited research it seems in general to be an improvement over what we have. I get that perfect is the enemy of the good, I would take almost any improvement over the existing system. But at the same time, I still just don&#x27;t understand how this helps solve the squatter problem -- every once and a while I ask and get an explanation, and then think about it for a while and end up having more questions.<p>My perspective is, we want everyone to be online. We want everyone to have their own blog, we want people to be able to create websites on impulse. And we want resilient, long-term links that can serve as permanent addresses for content. The idea of combating squatters is based on the assumption that domain names will continue to be a scarce resource. But you fundamentally <i>can&#x27;t<\/i> have domains be a limited resource that are difficult to hoard if you also want random&#x2F;poor elementary school kids to be able to buy them.<p>Handshake talks about solving Zooko&#x27;s triangle: human-meaningful, decentralized, or secure. But the way I originally heard Zooko&#x27;s triangle explained to me (which may have been wrong) was: human-meaningful, secure, high-availability. Am I correct in assuming that in the second version, Handshake is optimized for human-meaningful and secure at the expense of high-availability? That domains will continue to be a limited, scarce resource that are susceptible to hoarding by people with lots of money?

About 15 years ago I recall some considerable effort was spent at a company I worked at for the Quality Engineering team to build a visual regression tool for a video game UI I was working on. Using some Windows api magic it could detect buttons and click them to navigate through a UI and then take a screenshot to do a visual diff. It was the most broken useless thing ever and after 2 or 3 months of development it was scrapped.<p>Last place I worked had a team that built a similar system using Selenium and some image diff. It worked 90% of the time. It was even integrated into their CI pipeline and the system would email you when it failed. You could make a change to one area of code and get an email from the system for a completely separate area that for whatever random reason failed. I once submitted some code to that project and when I got the email I asked one of the project maintainers what I should do to fix it. He told me to just ignore it. Their process was to check the output of the tool on those failures to see if there was any legitimate problem. When I checked the output myself a large amount of the output was garbage (about 100 application states tested and at least 10 in a garbled state).<p>My own team even tried to integrate Selenium and we even found an external vendor where you can ship your Selenium tests along with your app and they will run it against a matrix of browsers of various versions. We barely got a Chrome version running - no hope of Safari, Firefox or IE&#x2F;Edge. It was a blackhole of time just fighting to get an equivalent of hello world running consistently as a test in all browsers.<p>One day someone will prove me wrong and get this kind of UI testing working reliably.

Likewise, when he means &quot;attacking the enemy&#x27;s strategy&quot; he didn&#x27;t mean &quot;undermining the long term grand strategy of the enemy&quot; but actually &quot;acting to neutralize the immediate battlefield plan&quot; (as in &quot;if the enemy tries to lay a siege, provoke him into attacking&quot;).

Game theory explains all of this quite well.<p>Money is desirable because it makes transactions and economic calculation so much easier. As a pure abstraction, money is simply a ledger (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minneapolisfed.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;sr&#x2F;sr218.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minneapolisfed.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;sr&#x2F;sr218.pdf<\/a>). When humans live in small groups related by blood, they just keep the ledger in their heads (if at all) because the penalty of cheating is so great that no one will defect (exile from the tribe and a lonely death).<p>When humans need to transact with people and there is uncertainty about (a) whether they will be able to punish cheating, and (b) whether they will ever meet this trading partner again, then they will use a more explicit and trustworthy form of money to reduce the risks. For most of human history the only real option here was some kind of physical token, which had to approximate the ledger abstraction: uniform in quality, easily divisible, easy to authenticate, with as inelastic a supply as possible.<p>The modern sovereign state allows for fiat money, since the state can simply declare that its official currency is the ledger that everyone will use. It&#x27;s quite efficient, since you can do things like maintain a banking system that exists primarily as numbers in a spreadsheet rather than vaults full of dusty gold bars. Our fractional reserve system also mingle debt and money, and for most of us the two are equivalent.<p>This makes perfect sense when you consider that money is a claim on the future output of everyone who agrees to use the money. It&#x27;s an EOU: everyone owes you. Thus, if you issue fiat currency against public debt, it&#x27;s effectively an EOU as well since everyone in the economy is indirectly responsible for the eventual repayment of that debt. Of course, sovereign currencies have borders, so looking at the ledger used by governments to keep score amongst themselves is quite telling.<p>However, when there is no socially accepted authority to dictate consensus, how do mutually disinterested individuals agree on a form of money? This was a pure thought experiment until the invention of Bitcoin, because the options were exceptionally limited: precious metals were so much better than anything else that had been tried, for reasons I won&#x27;t go into here, that there really wasn&#x27;t a choice. But with Bitcoin, you have a protocol for digital cash that can be used to create an infinite number of ledgers with the same desirable properties.

Murphy [1]: &quot;Finally, we have actual case studies of communities developing money prices from scratch: namely, prisoners who end up using cigarettes as the common medium of exchange.  The classic work here is Radford&#x27;s 1945 article, &quot;The Economic Organization of a P.O.W.

The prisoners certainly weren&#x27;t giving each other things from their Red Cross kits as gifts or as loans. No, they first were trading (in a state of direct exchange) and cigarettes quickly became the money in their community for all of the reasons that economists typically cite.<p>And to reinforce the point we made earlier, Radford explains that the prices (quoted in cigarettes) of various items were posted on a board. If Graeber and his colleagues stumbled upon the ruins of this P.O.W. camp, they would presumably conclude that there was never a preexisting state of barter, because they only found boards listing prices quoted in terms of cigarettes. There were no boards listing the thousands of pairwise permutations of direct-exchange ratios, and so clearly the Mengerian story must have been wrong — so would go the erroneous reasoning of Graeber.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;have-anthropologists-overturned-menger\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;have-anthropologists-overturned-me...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-12 15:51:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["protomyth"],"id":[22311793],"kids":[22312513,22313431,22314366,22314737,22314531],"parent":[22308701],"text":["<i>The first group that benefits from large tech company acquisitions is end users.

Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power.

Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>162 page PDF [last updated: February|4th|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

Ideally, this rationale would extend to quantum dots, and quantum computation could be performed by merely controlling the outer-shell electrons of dot-based qubits. Imperfections in semiconductor materials disrupt this analogy, so real devices seldom display a systematic many-electron arrangement. We demonstrate here an electrostatically confined quantum dot that reveals a well defined shell structure. We observe four shells (31 electrons) with multiplicities given by spin and valley degrees of freedom. Various fillings containing a single valence electron—namely 1, 5, 13 and 25 electrons—are found to be potential qubits. An integrated micromagnet allows us to perform electrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR), leading to faster Rabi rotations and higher fidelity single qubit gates at higher shell states. We investigate the impact of orbital excitations on single qubits as a function of the dot deformation and exploit it for faster qubit control."],"time":["2020-02-12 08:10:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pauljurczak"],"id":[22306617],"kids":[22306655],"parent":[22297621],"text":["Nice work, but &quot;infinitesimally small space of only around 10 nanometres in diameter&quot; really rubs me the wrong way.

Each ecosystem is different and the scientific justifications need to be done for each, and the papers for one do not necessarily apply to the other. The Yellowstone program may have been a success, but other places are not Yellowstone, and it is a mistake to use it as a way to handwave away criticisms. Also, sometimes the justifications are pretty weak, and could easily be made up with by increase in hunting tags or adjustment of hunting time windows and area restrictions.<p>Second, there are jurisdictional and public control issues at the heart of the matter. There are people who actually have to live in these areas and they are major changes. I strongly dislike the attitude of some that locals should have no say. The people in our area voted against the reintro program and it was done anyway, with the governor saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the people want, the reintro program is happening&quot;. That is a problem. I have also seen the effects of fresh Forest Department&#x2F;BLM phd types ignore the locals wisdom and advice and pay the price for it, and the same &quot;We know better than you back country bumpkin&quot; condescension tends to be at play in the reintro programs. These things have real consequences. For example, as a kid my grampa who was a logger in the area in the 70&#x27;s and many other loggers were saying the Forest Service needed to let the loggers thin the forests out and to do more control burns. I being young thought the old loggers were just old-fashioned and the PhD&#x27;s knew what they were doing, until reality happened. The holier than though attitude of the credentialed people prevailed, then the pine beetle infestation hit, and within a decade we had two ~500,000 acre forest fires that the forests are still recovering from.<p>Third, there are often claims that wolves never attack humans, and those claims are blatantly false or are using very carefully selected statistics (North America only, etc) to craft a narrative. Beyond that, it vastly changes the safety profile of being in the forests, in a way that discourages people from experiencing it. Many locals from my area have posited that this is an intentional side-effect. Even more so when the rumors of a grizzly reintro program started floating around (I don&#x27;t know if these are just rumors, but who can blame the locals for being afraid of an unelected unaccountable bureaucracy who already ignores them from doing something else against their wishes). We used to be able to only have to worry about bears or mountain lions, who both have pretty easily avoided confrontational profiles, but now locals don&#x27;t go anywhere without being armed.<p>Fourth, the dismissal of the cattle ranchers is far overrated. Cattle ranching, especially in this day in age, is a science in itself, and in the forest is a vital part of forest maintenance. Silviopasture&#x2F;agroforestry is also often studied by the kids of the old ranchers who then come back and apply that knowledge. Thoughts of the ranchers as dumb hicks is a foolish and insulting stereotype. Not only that, but often the forest service and BLM are underfunded and undermanned, and many of the ranchers who are paying public land leases do a good job assisting in maintaining the forest, and unlike the new kid who just got shipped in from across the country after getting a degree, they live there and have passed down local knowledge for decades if not longer.<p>I know it&#x27;s easy to see something like a wolf reintro program and assume it&#x27;s a great thing and just jump on the bandwagon, but maybe a perspective from someone who grew up in one and have heard out the locals on the issues might help color your view on the topic a bit.<p>Otherwise you just end up with a bunch of locals that around the campfire say &quot;It&#x27;s all about the three S&#x27;s... shoot, shovel, and shhhhh&quot;."],"time":["2020-02-12 21:34:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dmitryminkovsky"],"id":[22311615],"kids":[22314419,22311634,22311918,22317139,22313002,22311868,22311679,22312965,22313790],"parent":[22297677],"text":["So much for anyone trying to raise sheep or cattle.

Only established companies with a name that corresponds to the domain name would be able to bid. Bidding would only be open for a pre-specified time frame. The domain name owner would be free to notify everyone with an established company that goes by that name to get in on the bidding action. Users would be able to flag websites operated by dead&#x2F;zombie companies, and an independent committee would convene (digitally) to vote on whether bidding should be re-opened.<p>Naming is actually an issue with startups. We should reduce friction as much as possible for entrepreneurs because it&#x27;s already hard to start a company as it is.

It had a very simple interface, that focused largely on moving stuff around visually. Its timeline was easy to understand: one row for each separate object, with a keyframe that would store whatever changes you made. You could draw directly in it. You could import art from other programs and move that around. You could combine the two. Wanna do full, traditional animation? Flash could do it. Wanna do paper-doll stuff? Flash had you there, too.<p>Artists loved it. It got used for the web. it got used for games - it was really easy to animate some little critters moving around and start attaching behaviors to them, especially in Actionscript 2. It got used for animation. It&#x27;s <i>still<\/i> being used for some animation - my former co-worker who&#x27;s now heading the animation on Teen Titans Go used it to crank out a feature film alongside one of the last few seasons.<p>Then Apple killed it. The Flash plugin was a giant security hole, what with the animation files having no less than three possible types of code embedded in them. It didn&#x27;t draw very efficiently, and it burned through battery like there was no battery. Apple didn&#x27;t want any of these things on their brand new iPhone, and they captured enough of the market that &quot;Flash&quot; is now considered a dirty word.<p>Now we have SVG. Which you can animate via CSS. And we have people <i>starting<\/i> to try and make editors that can be used by non-programmers. But all of them seem to insist on exposing separate controls for every separate property, each with their own timelines hidden inside an object&#x27;s timeline. After Effects is the model, and it&#x27;s a slow, stiff, fiddly model versus Flash&#x27;s ability to just lay down a keyframe and draw some stuff, or move a symbol around with a nice little free transform tool that lets you scale, rotate, and skew everything right there on the canvas.<p>You wanna make SVG attractive? You wanna see people playing with its potential? Go find some people who remember using Flash, who made cool animation and&#x2F;or games, not programmers or designers. Get a copy of their favorite version running in a VM (me, I think it peaked at 5, I think TTG is currently on CC2015 [aka version 15]). Pay them to make a short animation, and watch how they use it, and make your editor able to act like <i>that<\/i> instead of like After Effects.<p>And then make it easy to export this stuff and put it on the web. One file to upload, please. One simple tag to dump into your HTML.<p>(But first check if Adobe Animate can export animations as SVG, because that&#x27;s what Flash got renamed as once they had a working HTML5 exporter.)<p>(and also yes I am intimately aware of Flash&#x27;s many flaws, don&#x27;t bother listing them, I&#x27;m mostly glad to see it gone, but there were some things it did <i>really<\/i> well.)"],"time":["2020-02-12 00:36:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nearmuse"],"id":[22303892],"kids":{},"parent":[22297461],"text":["Obviously good for maps and graphs, and any dataviz in general."],"time":["2020-02-12 00:00:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fnord77"],"id":[22306032],"kids":{},"parent":[22297461],"text":["6.  animated things on the screen are annoying"],"time":["2020-02-12 06:18:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["miguelmota"],"id":[22305799],"kids":{},"parent":[22297461],"text":["Wish there was Linux support to try it out"],"time":["2020-02-12 05:30:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gugagore"],"id":[22303172],"kids":{},"parent":[22297461],"text":["I can probably clarify my ignorance on wikipedia, but I am interested in the hackernews personality, and hope that I&#x27;ll learn more about it here.<p>Does all of this apply to HTML5 animations, too?
