Here are my thoughts<p>1. The more defined and mature the problem space is, the more the assumptions that underpin that field are taken as a given.<p>2. These assumptions may become so deeply ingrained that people become effectively blind to the entire range of possibilities.<p>3. These assumptions frame how the problem&#x2F;solution space is looked at. Therefore the solution space is constrained by the set of assumptions (about what the problem is , how to solve it, what to do)<p>4. These assumptions are recursive, in that they are contained within other assumptions. It is turtles all the way down. At some level, someone working in the space may not even understand what the core assumptions are. We have to have these assumptions though. See the next point.<p>5. The interesting thing about this is: The constraining of the problem&#x2F;solution space is actually a <i>positive<\/i>. It enables co-ordination and incremental improvements and refinement. It allows people new to the domain to quickly get productive.<p>I like to think about it this way:<p>Picture yourself in a massive area that is pitch black. You are grasping around and can not see much. Someone figures out how to get a tiny fire started. With this tiny fire you get to see a little bit. Using this you can build a bigger fire illuminating more of the area (but still leaving the entire space unexplored). This eventual results in the ability to build a permanent light illuminating a specific corner of this space.<p>This specific space with light illuminating it becomes highly productive, people can do all sort of things. Like read etc. Yet, there are still areas left unexplored. The light cannot simply be taken across. It takes work, and it takes turning your back towards the current &quot;lit&quot; up space, and taking a step back into the dark. A scary thought for some.<p>5. Importantly: These assumptions have been inherited from the past. So they existed and were relevant at a specific point in time. They may or may not be relevant as of today. We would have to peel several layers to get to the core.<p>6. While 4 is a positive, it is also a negative. The idea&#x2F;areas greatest strength (maturity, constant improvements, efficiencies) is also its greatest weakness (constraining the search space)<p>To take a step into the dark, is to turn your back to the lit up parts. You have to question the underlying assumptions and see if they are still relevant. If you discover an assumption about the world that is no longer accurate, then you found a new space to illuminate.<p>To put it in another way, to explore the dark is to shift your perspective on the problem&#x2F;solution. It is to see with &quot;new eyes&quot;. Initially it may be dark, but slowly  with diligent work, and passion you could light up a completely new and novel area."],"time":["2019-12-22 22:39:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bdotdub"],"id":[21859216],"kids":{},"parent":[21858962],"text":["Area man write blog post saying things are great and just so happens to overlap exactly with what he does"],"time":["2019-12-22 20:50:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gist"],"id":[21859245],"kids":[21859488],"parent":[21858962],"text":["&gt; Even the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on.

Every 10 seconds this file is serialized to json and dumped to a cache.json file. This is going to be very inefficient as the number of web pages indexed grows since you are rewriting the entire cache every 10 seconds even if only a few pages have been added to it. It also will eventually exceed the memory of the computer running the app if the content of every page ever visited needs to be loaded into memory.

They relied on an outside consultant to rewrite their application in a fundamentally flawed way. The lack of eng leadership resulted in both poor technical decisions being made and bad engineering processes for how the app was developed.<p>Etsy&#x27;s biggest technical mistake building an application using a framework that no one understood. This led to the predictable result that when they deployed the application to production, it didn&#x27;t work. Even if the application had worked, Etsy still would have needed to maintain the Twisted application indefinitely. Maintaining an application written in a framework no one understands sounds like a recipe for a disaster. Sooner or later you are going to run into issues that no one will know how to fix.<p>Process wise, Etsy made the mistake of not properly derisking the Twisted application. They only found out that it didn&#x27;t work when they were deploying it to production. They made the same issue a second time when they tried to deploy the replacement. When I&#x27;m building a new service, the first bit of code I write is to test that the fundamental design of the new service would work. Usually this only takes a few days instead of the months it takes to implement the full service. It sounds like Etsy could have setup a simple Twisted app that did a fraction of what the final version did. If so, they would have found a number of fundamental flaws in the design before having spent a ton of time building out the service.<p>To be honest, this story shows how a business can succeed even with a bad engineering team. It would be one thing if this sort of incident killed off Etsy. Instead Etsy has gone on to become the $5 Billion company it is today. I&#x27;m not saying engineering doesn&#x27;t matter.

Can&#x27;t imagine that going well. The problem was that they spent too much time doing reviews for simple SQL patterns for CRUD + operational issues like debugging database performance issues or watching devs perform migrations. Of course they have other things to do in their job.<p>My opinion was the root of the problem is database choice and practices. If all I want to do is simple CRUD, then give me good scaled Redis cluster (AOF enabled), dynamo or something that constrains the query model.

Change a few key words here and there, and this tweetstorm could describe most engineering leadership failures I’ve seen.<p>Nearly every tweet describes scenarios that can only happen when engineering management is M.I.A. or too inexperienced to recognize when something is a bad idea.<p>- Attempting to solve problems with a rewrite in a different programming language. This can be the correct long term decision in specific scenarios, but it’s rarely the correct answer for bailing out a sinking ship. You need to focus on fixing the current codebase as a separate initiative rather than going all-in on a rewrite to fix all of your problems. Rewrites take far too long to be band-aid solutions.<p>- Rewriting open-source software before you can use it. If Django doesn’t fit your startup’s needs, the solution is never to rewrite Django. The solution is to use something else that does fit your needs. Your startup’s web services needs are almost never unique enough to merit rewriting popular open-source frameworks as step 1. Pick a different tool, hire different people if necessary, and get back to focusing on the core business problem. Don’t let the team turn into open-source contributors padding their resume while collecting paychecks from a sinking startup. Save the open-source work for later when you have the extra money to do it right without being a distraction.<p>- Hiring consultants to confirm your decisions. Consultants can be valuable for adding outside perspective and experience, but the team must be prepared to cede some control to the consultant. If you get to the point where you’re hiring a “Twisted consultant” instead of a web store scaling consultant, you’re just further entrenching the team’s decisions.<p>- “Nobody was in charge”. Common among startups who pick a “technical cofounder” based on their technical skills, rather than their engineering leadership skills. When you assemble a team of highly motivated, very smart engineers, it’s tempting to assume they can self manage. In my experience, the opposite is true. The more motivated and driven the engineers, the more you need explicit leadership to keep them moving in the same direction. Otherwise you get the next point:<p>- Multiple competing initiatives to solve the problem in different ways. Letting engineers compete against each other can feel like a good idea to inexperienced managers because it gets people fired up and working long hours to prove their code is the best. That energy quickly turns into a liability as engineers go full political, hoarding information to help their solution succeed while casually sabotaging the competing solutions. In a startup, you need everyone moving in the same direction. It’s okay to have disagreement, but only if everyone can still commit to moving in the one chosen direction. If some people can’t commit, they need to be removed from the company.<p>- The “drop-in replacement” team. This is just a variation of having engineers compete against each other. Doesn’t work.<p>- Allowing anyone to discuss “business logic” as if it’s somehow different work. This leads to engineers architecting over-generalized “frameworks” for other people to build upon instead of directly solving the company’s problems. At a startup, never let people discuss “business logic” as something that someone else deals with. Everyone is working on the business logic, period.<p>I have to admit that when I was younger and less experienced, I plowed right into many of these same mistakes. These days, I’d do everything in my power to shut down the internal competition and aimless wandering of engineering teams.<p>Ironically, these situations tend to benefit from strategically shrinking headcount. It’s not a fun topic, but it’s crucial for regaining alignment. The key is to remove the dissenters, the saboteurs, the politicians, and the architects creating solutions in a vacuum. You need to keep a cohesive core team that can move fast, commit to one direction even when they disagree, and not let their egos get in the way of doing the right thing.<p>The real challenge is that those employees tend to fly under the radar. The people quietly doing the important work and shipping things that Just Work can be overshadowed by bombastic, highly opinionated “rockstar” engineers. Founders need to be willing to let those rockstars go when they no longer benefit the company, no matter how good their coding skills might be in isolation. A coordinated team of mediocre but diligent engineers will run circles around a chaotic team of rockstars competing against each other."],"time":["2019-12-22 14:56:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["etxm"],"id":[21857666],"kids":{},"parent":[21849977],"text":["&gt; an infamous incident where one of the investors had to drive to Secaucus to physically remove the other engineering founder from the cage.<p>I really want hear this story."],"time":["2019-12-22 16:37:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21855803],"kids":{},"parent":[21849977],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-22 08:34:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["celim307"],"id":[21858972],"kids":{},"parent":[21849977],"text":["I’d love to hear more stories like this"],"time":["2019-12-22 20:10:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["durnygbur"],"id":[21856459],"kids":[21857877],"parent":[21849977],"text":["Get a blog, mate."],"time":["2019-12-22 12:00:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["paxys"],"id":[21855759],"kids":[21855817,21855832,21855999,21855761],"parent":[21849977],"text":["Does anyone have a version that isn&#x27;t 37 Tweets?"],"time":["2019-12-22 08:18:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["allard"],"id":[21857153],"kids":{},"parent":[21849977],"text":["&quot;Interesting&quot; &quot;feature&quot; of their platform that I see monthly, and more recently given the season.

I am also a grandma so I know what pleasure it is. I had a son and a daughter, my son died when he was in his early 20&#x27;s, he had one daughter that I do not get to see. I was blessed with a daughter that shared her kids with me, I always thanked her and I knew without a doubt I was very blessed. 14 and a half years I pretty much raised these kids, I didn&#x27;t ask to but was more than happy to do so. Mom and dad were good parents until my son died then the second child was born and something happened. They weren&#x27;t interested in the kids at all, they were consumed with computer games. Then came a third child, my daughter kept getting more and more violent toward me but as long as it was toward me we were fine I just wanted the kids to be safe. Long story short, after 14 and a half years of being with these kids daily, living with the girls the last 2 years my daughter turned into someone I didn&#x27;t recognize anymore, she was violent toward me and the kids. We lived in the same house I was in the basement they were upstairs, I kept the payment up on the house and other bills because they wouldn&#x27;t they took my money but didn&#x27;t pay the bills. It got very dangerous with my daughter so I tried to help my grandkids. In the emotional state of mind I was in everything I did turned out backwards.My daughter lied of course to everyone said I was controlling and wouldn&#x27;t let her raise her kids. I am sure she looked this stuff up on line. I fell apart because of what my daughter was saying. I ended up seeing a councellor trying to get back on track, dfs gave the kids back to mom and dad, mom and dad high tailed it out of the state with the kids leaving behind loans they took out and never repaid. With the help of DFS and other people my son in law and daughter were able to change the kids, immediately I hesitate to put this in here because I have been accused of so many things in order to make me look bad. Mom and dad left the state and I have tried to talk to the kids on pinterest but they told on me. Im guessing that&#x27;s how they get their attention. I worrt about them daily how is this going to affect them, I have had the hardest time understanding how you could turn one human against another, the parents and others told the two girls that grandma didn&#x27;t want them, they made the girls feel like I didn&#x27;t love them and I never did. They have somehow convinced these two girls of this. I have not been allowed to see these kids in two years, this has actually been harder to deal with than my sons death. My sister is on GitHub here and she creates hacks to watch me constantly. The harrassment has been horrible. Its been very heartbreaking and eye opening. Parents can have mental problems but if they have never been arrested for drugs then they are good people. My heart has just been shattered, I used to sit along the bus route hoping to see their bus go by just to get the tiniest glimpse, I meant no harm I was just so homesick for them. Lately I have been needing to hear their voices. Im deemed as a bad grandma but I never lied I never did anything against my daughter I didn&#x27;t even bye presents for them without asking. So the point of this post don&#x27;t always assume grandma has done wrong just because mommy said she did, maybe mommy has some problems of her own.

Also, after reading it I&#x27;ve found APL and J more approachable, which is encouraging.<p>If you&#x27;ll forgive the style, I took a swing at implementing k-means clustering in Klong a few months ago [1].

It’s an amazing language that has made me reconsider what a language and programming should be. I come from a FP background and have always considered abstraction the heart of powerful and expressive programming.<p>In Q, abstraction is wholly unnecessary. Libraries are unnecessary. I can fit the entire language in my head and all code in the language is built out of the fundamental building blocks of it. There’s no layer after layer of abstraction, just a small base of operators and functions.<p>One might be tempted to compare it to other small languages, like Scheme. But for Scheme it’s intended that you build higher and higher levels of abstractions. With Q it’s both small and compact, and one rarely if ever feels the need to actually build a library of utility functions or anything really: it renders unnecessary the false prophet of code reuse.<p>I got interested in Q because some of my friends at other financial institutions were using it for HFT and research on historical tick data. I found it surprising at the time I that their software stacks could be so simple, essentially just a single small executable that entirely fit in the CPU cache that managed both the runtime and their entire database. At the time I thought this was impossible, but now I realize how possible and eminently reasonable this was. Instead of Kafka and Redis and SQL Dbs and Kubernetes and god knows what else, you just have Q. No DevOps bullshit, no containers, no complex shit to manage.<p>In the past 3 weeks I’ve had to rethink my philosophy of what software needs to be and have concluded that most of us are doing things very very wrong: we’ve created this unnecessary world of complexity that is tantamount to masturbation.<p>Now let’s talk about the language itself. It may look complex, but it’s actually quite simple. The only real data types are lists, dictionaries, symbols, and numbers. And surprisingly, that’s enough. When programming in it I have no desire for classes or objects or trees or whatever, in fact, just using lists and dictionaries can usually solve the problem in a better way.<p>Also, while Q is interpreted, it’s so goddamn fast. I’ve done some benchmarks against C and Q is about as fast, sometimes even faster. The optimizations the interpreter does are just insane. Not even joking, a single line of Q can accomplish somewhere between 100 to 1000 lines of what the equivalent C code would look like.<p>Another plus is that editor tooling is unnecessary, I have no need for autocomplete or inline docs because I can literally remember the entire thing. And since Q is so compact, I can view an entire program on a single screen, no scrolling, no jumping between files.<p>I’ve also noticed that I can remember the verbatim definition of my code. I can almost perfectly remember my exact code for each Advent of Code solution.<p>Anyways, good luck on Klong, I’m going to check it out. I don’t like J and wish there was a good open source K&#x2F;Q like language. I don’t actually like K because the overloads on function arity creates a lot of complexity (Q does away with this), so Klong might be right up my alley!<p>For anyone who hasn’t tried an array based language, I highly recommend it. Q has expanded my mind more than I thought possible at this point in my career. My last really mind expanded experience in programming was when I picked up Scheme and Haskell in high school.

This was career-retrospective speech be a new-commer to the field. I think the existing community was surprised and bemused.<p>Certainly your regular function programminger would have chuckled at all the &quot;point-free&quot; style FP. This was a decade before Haskell mind you, and at least a decade before lots of function reuse became popular (being blocked on better strictness analysis and a lack of type classes and instances). Remember in then-cutting-edge Scheme, (define ...) has an implicit (begin ...) rather than single-expression body, and don&#x27;t get me started on the other imperative lisps. APL before FP just  made the existing community laugh harder.<p>So fast forward a while, and even today implicit parallelism is not happening much in production in Haskell. Applicative is much more popular than Arrow, and thus everyone is still writing Von Neuman code even if its dressed up functionally.<p>Well, let me tell, that thesis puts a lot of the pieces together:<p>The real genius of point-free isn&#x27;t getting rid of the names. We have debruign indices for that. Nor is it allowing other modules of computation. Computer scientists found good ole&#x27; 1970s Category Theory (In principle, Backus could have done this too!) and now we know about (symmetric) monoidal categories and their internal languages and all the stuff we need to point-free-ify the programs in lambda-calculus-influenced calculii.<p>The real genius is dealing with dynamism &#x2F; higher-order programs. With the raw lambda calculus, you are in a fun house of higher-orderism and it&#x27;s hard to jump out of the substitution &#x2F; term-rewritting mindset. CPS, which occupied much of the functional research community for at least a man-decade, only further serializes and higher-order-ifizes things. Monadic programs bind promiscuously; every step is potentially dynamic af, one again also serializing and higher-order-ifizing things.<p>With arrow-like things, however (and Control.Cateogry.* and Profunctor is really much better at distilling the concepts than the legacy Arrow class, thanks Ed), suddenly we have a decently expressive form of computation with no lambdas in site. We&#x27;ve lifted the &quot;fog of war&quot;, freeing the first order &quot;90%&quot; of the work from the higher order &quot;10%&quot;.<p>Arrow notation as implemented in Haskell today, however, abuses `arr` for the structural rules of the guest language (weakening, contraction, and exchange per Wikipedia [1]). This reshrowds everything and ruins all the promise of Arrows. Yuck.<p>Back to the thesis, there are 2 big contributions:<p>1) A practical version of Arrow which doesn&#x27;t need arr for structural rules. (Control.Cateogry.* since does this better and with more faithfulness to the math, but had to start somewhere.)<p>2) A theory of heterogenous metaprogramming so the first order and higher order bits don&#x27;t even have to be the same language. We&#x27;re talking things like and FPGA that computes its own re-flashing.<p>There is also a protoype implementation of various lambdas so humans can still use names, but I hear its bitrotted and so I can&#x27;t vouch for it.<p>So, back to John Backus. The thing is programmers are lazy. They rather write in the language they know, or learn the language their teachers know. Also, humans need at least the option of some names (even if we have to name too many things today), so mandatory combinators will cause problems as long as we struck programming in shitty, 1-dimentional text. Finally, without at least the <i>taste<\/i> of actually compiling to other programming models, along with scaling programs with the Von Neumann model, the economic and curiosity incentives just aren&#x27;t there. And in 1978 the Von Neuman model was still fucking killing it. Wires were fast, and components be they spinning disks, ALUs, or DRAM were all kinda slow but in similar and predictable ways. Programming DOS was a shit-show, of course, but so were non-trivial compilers. Nothing was ready.<p>Now we know how to do program better, have the power to run the compilers, and the legacy machines have a cost model I like to think of as &quot;molasses in capillaries with huge bottlenecks&quot;. We&#x27;re ready.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Structural_rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Structural_rule<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-22 16:40:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["segmondy"],"id":[21859980],"kids":{},"parent":[21855249],"text":["I love this paper, I believe it will be.

His &quot;Probabilistic Logics and the Synthesis \nof Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components&quot; is the first work \non probabilistic automata, that is, automata in which the transitions \nbetween states are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Whenever \nhe discussed self-reproduction, he mentioned mutations, which are \nrandom changes of elements (cf. p. 86 above and Sec. 1.7.4.2 below). \nIn Section 1.1.2.1 above and Section 1.8 below he posed the problems \nof modeling evolutionary processes in the framework of automata \ntheory, of quantizing natural selection, and of explaining how highly \nefficient, complex, powerful automata can evolve from inefficient, \nsimple, weak automata. A complete solution to these problems would \ngive us a probabilistic model of self-reproduction and evolution. [9]<p>[9] For some related work, see J. H.

However, the best feature of MegaZeux is the\n    World Editor.\n    \n    Using the World Editor, ANYONE can create the world of their\n    dreams. Make it as simple or complex (well, almost), as easy\n    or difficult, as long or short as you please. We aren&#x27;t just\n    talking about worlds made up of petty, pre-programmed enemies\n    and objects; MegaZeux has its own, easy-to-use PROGRAMMING\n    LANGUAGE called Robotic that allows you to create objects,\n    engines and worlds that do almost anything you desire. Not only\n    can you make your own game with the editor, but every world\n    MegaZeux can play can be opened in the editor. Take a look at\n    how other games tick!\n    \n    For the newest user, it&#x27;s recommended that you play Caverns,\n    the first ever MegaZeux game, to get the feel of simple yet\n    well-designed games in MegaZeux. You may wish to read the help\n    section entitled &quot;Controls&quot; to learn how to play MegaZeux.\n    \n    If you&#x27;re more adventurous, start with a more complex game like\n    Demon Earth or Bernard the Bard, or a prettier game like &amp; or\n    Fritz Blitz to see what kind of graphics functions, bells and\n    whistles MZX can offer.\n    \n    Once you have the feel for the game, feel free to dive into the\n    World Editor and get messy! You should probably read the help\n    section entitled &quot;The World Editor&quot; first.\n    \n    To go to one of these sections now, hit Enter after aligning\n    the arrows with one of these choices. Press ESC now to exit to\n    the game.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n[1]:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ZZT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ZZT<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-22 20:18:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["acheron"],"id":[21859238],"kids":{},"parent":[21858188],"text":["I was into ZZT and so I got the first version of MZX back in 94.

It becomes a political thing that new leaders can use to “make a statement”.

Preceding a downsizing of a business that has fixed costs, like x number of human beings need to support y number of users. Chasing away users to reduce y so you can reduce x as well, and getting the lower paid users out is where you want to bleed userbase.<p>All of that said — these are all functions of poorly conceived lifetime plans. Lifetime plans where the rest of your model is based on monthly recurring revenue should be treated for what they are, which is marketing.

You just have to configure a DMA channel pointing at two memory addresses, and then the data moves in the background while the CPU goes off to do other things. You can send data from memory to an external device, or vice-versa, or within the chip&#x27;s internal memory. You can usually wire two peripherals together to implement &#x27;dumb pipes&#x27; which require almost no intervention from the CPU to keep working. Most chips will also let you trigger DMA transfers from arbitrary signals such as hardware timers, so you can also &#x27;set and forget&#x27; things like sending audio data to a DAC at a specific bitrate.<p>I can see how it would be inadequate for the enormous bandwidth required to host multiple devices like GPUs and Ethernet ports, but DMA is still fun.

You have the APL family, which are a very high at level of abstraction but perform even faster than C. Especially because od using vectorized processing. When you work on vectors of 1000s items in one instruction, you amortize language interpretation cost away and since working with vectors is actually the only natural way to work with computers you get massive performance from those instructions using vectorized instructions or even running on gpu.

That&#x27;s only about 10% of the total instructions. The other 90% are considered interpretation overhead. Once we vectorized this function, its performance was improved by nearly nine times. See PR #12543.<p>This is a misleading way to present this data. If I understand this correctly, most of the 90% &quot;interpretation overhead&quot; are time spent evaluating the operands to the multiplication, and this is <i>also<\/i> vectorized. So it&#x27;s not just that vectorizing the 10% can give you a 9x speedup overall, although in my opinion the text tries to suggest this.<p>In any case, there must be even more going on here. The data being processed here seem to be Float64. On an AVX-2 processor like most of us have, you can only fit up to 4 64-bit floats into a vector register. This means that, even if your entire computation vectorizes very very nicely, you should only expect a 4x maximum speedup. Even if they have an AVX-512 server (they don&#x27;t say) with twice the vector width, 8x would be the expected limit. In practice it would be considerably less because the processor reduces its frequency to avoid overheating on AVX-512-heavy computations. I&#x27;m not aware of hardware that uses even wider vectors.<p>So an end-to-end 9x improvement for the entire function here seems impossible to achieve using vectorization alone. I question both the measurement and the suggestion that vectorization is the <i>only<\/i> thing that changes here. Maybe they accidentally (? they don&#x27;t seem to understand in detail what&#x27;s going on) stumbled upon a much more cache friendly version of the computation they were trying to do, or maybe previously they caused the GC to interfere, or... something.

I almost <i>never<\/i> use my debit card in person. This simple thing changed my relationship with what I buy. Obviously my mortgage and other monthly payments are direct debit but unless the purchase is several hundred Euros or more I will pay in cash.<p>I always have €200 in cash on me which is enough to cover me at least a week. Then whatever I have left over at the end of the week I roll over. So if I have €60 left I take out 140 and transfer the difference into a savings account. I have saved a shocking amount doing this. It may seem strange but budgeting myself 800 for the month and only using cash has really helped me appreciate how much the money is worth to me. The short of it is on pay day each month I transfer 800 to my &quot;cash account&quot;, I transfer the exact amount I need to cover my bills into my &quot;bills&quot; account (I also have a &quot;buffer&quot; of 100 in this account as a &#x27;just in case its more than I calculated&#x27;). Everything else goes into savings. Everything.<p>Obviously some things fall outside the 800 cash allocation for example I bought a new coat a few weeks ago which was €230. I tried it on in store but bought it online as there was a discount I couldn&#x27;t use in store annoyingly. However I have a separate budget allocation for key clothing items like coats and boots which I generally replace every other year. However I don&#x27;t bother with multiple savings accounts anymore. I never found I benefited from the added complexity. If in a month or two I ruin my coat and have to buy a new one unexpectedly I will just take 230 from my savings rather than juggle things around.<p>I should say though that all of our expenses come from a single salary. Every month my wifes automatically goes into savings. Generally we never need to touch it. This is great for many obvious reasons but it also helps us (well me!) feel less guilty when I suggest we buy something we don&#x27;t really need such as an OLED TV we got a few months ago."],"time":["2019-12-22 12:58:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ioblomov"],"id":[21856310],"kids":[21858627],"parent":[21853636],"text":["1.

As much as product makers would like to believe there solution works for everyone, it depends on their circumstances. I have to be brief to make the train but here are some tools (US Focus):<p>1) Are you trying to get in control? This is where you are constantly living paycheck to paycheck, and bouncing checks. Than I would do the following\na) Get in the habit of saving where it is painful to spend. So start putting any percentage of money into a 401k if your company offers it. Ideally target to get the maximum match. But whatever you do start.\nb) Start documenting all, let me re-iterate, ALL your spending big and small. I recommend Quicken, but an Excel spreadsheet, google sheet works as well. The act of becoming conscious of your spending makes you reflective.<p>2) You are in control and saving a little bit and bonus you pay your credit card balance in full each month. Here the goal is becoming more optimized (I didn&#x27;t say optimized). \na) Choose a bank that tracks your spending and look at it and automatically pays bills. \nb) Start putting away money in something like wealthfront or betterment (I prefer the latter). Put it in a 401k or tax deferred vehicle to start since it will reduce your taxes.\nc) work on eliminating leakage (services you don&#x27;t use, unnecessary fees etc).<p>2) You are in control, think more in terms of building wealth.\na) Start thinking in terms of applying savings to appreciating assets (homes and eventually second properties for cash flow). Zillow and Redfin allow you to understand the market.\nb) Look at becoming more aggressive with investments. Look at a percentage to go to growth or dividend funds. But look for a goal of secondary sources of income. Both Schwab and TDA have good platforms to see this.<p>jonahbenton is right, there is no set it and forget it, but there is get the max out of the time you do when you have to look at it.

For example, last year I paid $50k for a 6000sqft commercial building that was going to be torn down, I negotiated the price with the owner based on the vacant land value, and then after a construction permit was opened on it the building is no longer going to be torn down, then i refinanced it a year later for 400k which is what it was worth, and the rental income on this property alone is 15 bedrooms times 160&#x2F;week or $9600&#x2F;month, which paid back my initial investment in less than a year but i also got the refinance money..."],"time":["2019-12-24 00:57:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["deedubaya"],"id":[21857266],"kids":[21858649],"parent":[21853636],"text":["I’m currently demoing Tiller.

I&#x27;m currently planning to open up a second checking account with the same credit union to split my income stream into fixed and variable expenses as some have mentioned here.<p>General idea is as follows:<p>1) Deposit income check each month into checking account #1. Draw from this account for monthly and yearly expenses. Add some buffer so as not to over draw.<p>2) Initiate an auto-transfer from checking account #1 to checking account #2 after check is deposited each month. Work within the budget set by checking account #2 for variable expenses.<p>Why use a credit union? A for-profit bank does not share the same incentives as their clientele. If they can separate you from your money, they will. I&#x27;m generally wary of any industry that is rewarded financially for stealthily screwing their customers, e.g. insurance industry. Credit unions are also known for having very reasonable loan terms.<p>Why two checking accounts? It&#x27;s nice to know what I&#x27;m spending each month on stuff like gym membership, streaming music, cellphone bill etc, versus things like coffee and dining out.<p><i>Investing setup<\/i><p>I&#x27;m young. I&#x27;m willing to incur risk for better long term returns (on average). I also recognize that I am not Rentec. If I were to outperform the S&amp;P500 picking stocks, it would be almost entirely due to random chance.<p>I keep enough money in checking to survive an emergency that requires immediate access to funds. Everything else that I earn above what I need for the month goes straight into an S&amp;P500 index fund. Both Vanguard and Fidelity are essentially fungible.<p>I&#x27;m open to others convincing me that this is a stupid strategy. It is entirely possible the S&amp;P500 tanks, and I lose a large fraction of my money. Few counter points though. First, it is by definition a diversified portfolio of stocks. Second, it has performed very well historically. Third, it has enough people invested in it that it couldn&#x27;t just &quot;go away&quot; without serious repercussions for the US and the world.<p>Perhaps the largest concern, is that there is way more wealth in the S&amp;P than there are people actually trading it on a day by day basis. If there was a flash crash, there simply wouldn&#x27;t be enough people on the buy side of the equation to drink from the firehose of people selling. This is really beyond my depth though so I&#x27;ll stop here.<p><i>Other principles<\/i><p>I&#x27;m trying to avoid debt like the plague. Mostly for my mental health; I know it can be important to your credit score to carry some continual debt. Be wary what you sign up for (college, grad school, etc).<p>Keep in mind though, you always want to maximize your net effective interest rate. If your student loan rate is 4%, consider paying the minimum on your student loans and put the difference (what you would have paid) into the stock market. Only do this if you can automate the process as you will be inclined to spend the money and not save it."],"time":["2019-12-23 17:10:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kick"],"id":[21855827],"kids":{},"parent":[21855821],"text":["This is an amazing piece of computing history.

Lack of universal healthcare means if you’re poor and mentally ill, you can easily end up on the street if you don’t have family to care for you. Since Prop 47 passed, heroin and meth are basically decriminalized and openly used on the streets in front of police. Likewise, Prop 57 decriminalized theft up to $950&#x2F;day so now we have an epidemic of car break ins and theft from stores and no real police response. So I think the people we see on the streets would have been in prison before prop 47 and 57 passed.

No one has any illusions that existing anti-vaxxers will in any way be cured by steps like this, but the point is to reduce and slow the numbers of new people who will be infected by anti-vax thinking. Anti-vax thinking is like a disease itself, multiplying and spreading through regular human channels and exploiting our existing frameworks and thinking. Just as quarantines or vaccines themselves do not cure somebody who is already infected with a real world disease, quarantines and &quot;vaccination&quot; won&#x27;t themselves cure somebody with corrupted thinking. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t useful tools, because real lives are on the line, and the system does have a certain amount of give and take in terms of what the critical level is for herd immunity (fortunately, since there will always be a small fraction of people with genuine medical issues like compromised immune systems). It&#x27;s not necessary to keep everyone in the population vaccinating, with many it&#x27;s only around 90-95%. It&#x27;s understood that anti-vaxxers will mutate in response to new efforts to resist them, and in turn containment steps must also adapt. Nothing odd about that. It is and will always be a <i>process<\/i> as with many things in life.<p>Just as in the real world concentrated groupings of people, faster travel, and faster shipping systems can accelerate the spread of existing and new strains, social media which brings together many people and accelerates their exchanges could also be a vector. Success for any given effort comes from how much is slows things down for a time, that&#x27;s all.<p>To the second, for various reasons many people have gotten the odd notion in their minds that &quot;Free Speech&quot; is about ideas being equal, or about it being free. It isn&#x27;t, and never was. Quite the contrary, free speech is important precisely because ideas are <i>not<\/i> equal, and in fact most of them are trash. The goal is to try to make a process that, over long periods of time, will tend to eventually sift out better ideas and adapt to changing conditions that make older discarded ideas worthy of consideration again. Further, centralized power inevitably faces pressure to crystalize and serve smaller interests. So if the coercive centralized physical power of government (or equivalent entities) is used to control actual thoughts and expressions, the result long term has tended to be poor.<p>However, that very much does not apply to social pressure, or to whether individual private people&#x2F;entities choose to associate with given ideas and&#x2F;or lend them their own private economic support. <i>Not<\/i> doing so is a critical part of Free Speech as well. If somebody thinks ideas are truly awful, they can and <i>should<\/i> deny any support, lobby others to deny support, ostracize those with such ideas, etc. Fighting such pressure and bearing the consequences is itself part of the gauntlet that ideas must face, and always have faced. None of this is new. People have the right to go create their own services, groups, and put their own soap boxes out, but others have the equal right to have nothing to do with them. The arguments back and forth are at the heart of the process, and the process is never, ever done."],"time":["2019-12-22 13:57:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["williesleg"],"id":[21856932],"kids":{},"parent":[21856355],"text":["Holy fuck, I&#x27;d let anyone inject mystery material into my body without question.

That can be somewhere between hard and impossible though.<p>Failing that, and if you need to go out and just evaluate contractors you find through other means, the most qualified person for evaluating a contractor is another experienced contractor who is not competing for the work.<p>Hire somebody experienced, for a nominal but fair fee, to help you review your project plan and advise you through the sourcing process for its fulfillment. This is a different role than a recruiter, and in fact, be wary of anyone who wants to simply hand you off to someone they know without assessing other options. You want a personal advocate, not some contractor&#x27;s sales agent.<p>Then, consider retaining them after the contract begins to double check the work as it proceeds, and to bring issues to your attention if things smell fishy.<p>Basically, if you are asking this question on HN and don&#x27;t have access to a good referral, you&#x27;re about to throw a huge bunch of money at a stranger that you don&#x27;t know how to evaluate. Written guidelines won&#x27;t be enough help. Because of your own inexperience, you&#x27;re almost certain to either trust them too much, or distrust them too much, and either one is going to strain your project and cost you money and time.<p>Having an experienced advocate on your side, who has a different incentive structure than your contractor, can make all the difference. And unlike the implementing contractor that you&#x27;ll eventually hire, you can successfully evaluate the advisor yourself. Their role is about communicating things to you, and advocating for you, and these are actions that you are totally qualified to judge. Plus, it&#x27;s a smaller and more ad hoc role that doesn&#x27;t have the sunk cost issues that you&#x27;ll face with your implementation contractor. If you find that they&#x27;re not doing a good job being your advisor and advocate, you can drop them without sending the project into crisis.<p>Besides myself, I don&#x27;t know a lot of people who advertise this role directly, but I think many independent contractors would take it on if you pitched it to them. I think many working developers and development managers would too, as a side gig, although they may not know the norms and pitfalls of contracting quite as well. They&#x27;ll at least be able to vet your project plan, review candidates for technical merit, and perform code reviews.

I&#x27;ve had some fantastic hires from the platform, but I&#x27;ve also had lots of duds that wasted my time and money.<p>There’s one underlying maxim that governs my hiring philosophy for any skilled position:<p>* Talented people choose their employers selectively<p>Some employers force freelancers through tedious and time-consuming hoops without pay. They assume that contractors are so desperate for work that you can demand anything you want from them by dangling the mere potential for a job, but they&#x27;re actually just filtering out talented candidates.<p>Maintain expectations that <i><\/i>it will take you several months to save time<i><\/i> by hiring a contractor. The more complex the work, the longer it will take before you come out ahead on your time investment. The easiest jobs I&#x27;ve outsourced have been for UI tasks, where it&#x27;s either correct or not. Finding a general skills developer is much harder. Outsourcing requires a lot of up-front effort in the form of writing job postings, writing thorough, clear specifications for what you want, interviewing candidates, and reviewing work. Once you find someone good and find a good rhythm with them, it&#x27;s a great way to save yourself time, but you&#x27;re likely to find a lot of bad candidates first.<p><i><\/i>The #1 thing I look for in any candidate is communication<i><\/i>. Miscommunications are extremely expensive. Avoid candidates who ask vague questions or need re-explanation of things you&#x27;ve explained clearly. The best people I&#x27;ve hired tend to be people who are highly specific and detailed in their communication.<p><i><\/i>Take ratings with a grain of salt<i><\/i>. On platforms like Upwork or Fiverr, most of the people are hiring for things they don&#x27;t know how to do themselves, so a terrible freelance programmer might have a 4.9 rating because their clients can&#x27;t tell that they produce code that&#x27;s hacky and unmaintainable. Similarly, some legitimately good freelancers have dings on their record from unreasonable clients who gave them a 1.0 rating because the freelancer refused to do extra unpaid work.<p><i><\/i>Resist the temptation to hire cheap contractors<i><\/i>. You&#x27;ll always get bids that are tantalizingly low (like $12&#x2F;hr for &quot;senior-level&quot; Python development), but they often can&#x27;t deliver what you ask for with reasonable quality. The freelancers who are good can command a good wage. With the bargain basement freelancers, you&#x27;ll spend so much time managing them and fixing their work that you won&#x27;t save time overall.<p>Finally, <i><\/i>start small<i><\/i>. Don&#x27;t hire someone to build an entire mobile app from scratch; it&#x27;s far too complicated. Start with a job that should take a few hours (and set a cap on their hours so there are no miscommunications). As you get into a groove of working well with your freelancer, gradually give them more hours and more complex tasks."],"time":["2019-12-22 20:35:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mooreds"],"id":[21858940],"kids":{},"parent":[21858813],"text":["Have solid requirements, and expect them to change.

But here are a few advices.<p>Do not pay by day&#x2F;hour if you can avoid it.<p>Define small deliverables then objective tests to validate them and attach fixed price to each piece.<p>You don&#x27;t have to come up with it out of thin air, the contractor is supposed to do that with you.<p>You don&#x27;t have to define all of them up front neither. In fact, they will probably change during the project and the contractor will adjust the price knowing better about the project after the first few deliveries.<p>Do not let the definition of success be blurry. But don&#x27;t set everything in stone.<p>Do include a clause about the code license.<p>If you have zero IT skill, get the help of somebody who does to do so, as well as set your expectations and filter the contractors. Sometimes it&#x27;s best to hire a contractor... to hire a contractor. I know, I know.<p>In my book, a good contractor will:<p>- not sell you the moon, but will tell you what&#x27;s possible, what&#x27;s not given your constraints, and the relative cost of it. I regularly tell my customers to chose a better, cheaper solution than hiring me.<p>- help you set a priority list rather than a schedule. I&#x27;m not an oracle, I can&#x27;t give you an exact delivery date for each component. But I will make sure we get them in the most valuable order.<p>- not give you answers right away, especially deadline and price. I can take several (sometimes billable) hours up to several days with a customer to understand the project and assess this.<p>- will tell you honestly &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, &quot;I will have to look it up&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s not in my skill set, I&#x27;ll need the help of X&quot;. I may tell a customer I&#x27;ll need a designer, and a week to research a topic before starting to code.<p>- communicate clearly. Bad communication is a red flag. There are very good coders that are bad at communicating. As a contractor I don&#x27;t just code, I extract your needs, wants and constraints to adjust the work regularly. This is what &quot;agile&quot; mean. Not tooling, scrum, or other gimmick. Regular proper communication, and adjustments.<p>- will not talk about good and bad, but cost&#x2F;benefit ratio. You can request everything you want, the question is can I build it under your conditions.<p>- will talk about his preferences and specializations and advocate them when relevant. But will understand if a different technology is needed for the job. I love Python, and will advise you to use it. I don&#x27;t like JS. I will code in clean proper JS for a Web UI.<p>- will be honest about their needs: schedules, payment, communication, ethics, channels or technology use. E.G: I don&#x27;t do military&#x2F;banking related contracts and refuse missions that use some languages such as  Lisp, Haskell or PHP. You have the right to want them, there are other contractors that will do it for you just fine.<p>- not be cheap. Well, just like with lottery, you may be incredibly lucky. But I would not base my life choices on such hopes. I&#x27;m often booked for months in advance and know the market prices I can expect. I won&#x27;t bother negotiating.<p>- will be interested in your project itself. Even when I don&#x27;t work on something, I&#x27;m always happy to hear about what the project became 6 months later. I like my job.<p>You are not committed to anything until you sign something. So go shopping. Change your mind. We are used to talk to many customers, and only land a few jobs.

I try to single out politicians with records that are antithetical to basic values Google employees share, or that the company advertises (like its ostentatious committment to #pride), not just things I politically disagree with.<p>To head off some comments that always come up:<p>1. Like most corporate PACs, Google gives fairly evenly to politicians in both parties. I don&#x27;t think donations to Democrats &quot;cancel out&quot; donations to indefensible figures like Scalise, or Nunes, any more than giving money to the NAACP cancels out a donation to the KKK.<p>2. Google&#x27;s giving is not indiscriminate, but tactical and highly targeted. In particular, they don&#x27;t just give to everyone across the board like the sugar lobby.<p>3. The dollar figures are small because they are capped by statute. At most, Google can give one politician $10,000 in an election cycle. This is absolutely dwarfed in size by Google&#x27;s D.C. lobbying operation, which can&#x27;t contribute directly to campaigns but finds many ways to be influential.<p>4. This money is donated by employees who opt in, but is allocated by the company. Googlers have no input into the targeting and timing of these donations; it&#x27;s decided by the office of public policy.<p>5. An American corporation can do fine without a PAC. Apple and IBM don&#x27;t have one.
