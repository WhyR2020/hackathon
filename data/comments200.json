Emphasize synchronization over imperative API calls. <i>Imperative APIs encourage data silos.<\/i> They are the underlying technical part of the problem that Zapier and ITTT try to solve. See [0] and [1] for some ideas.<p>2. Allow users to submit &quot;agents&quot; rather than &quot;requests.&quot; An agent is a small program given extremely limited resources (limited process&#x2F;memory&#x2F;runtime budget) that you can safely run on your server. It is a possible answer to many of the standards&#x2F;protocols that wouldn&#x27;t exist if frontends were running on the same machines as backends. [2]<p>3. Emphasize composition over integration. Functions compose (nest, recurse). Event emitters don&#x27;t. As long as APIs are built to be integrated rather than composed, making them work together is a full-time or full-company job (eg. Zapier).<p>4. Make things immutable. Immutability allows APIs to &quot;play&quot; with one another without fear of setting off the nukes (ie. side effects). It&#x27;s possible that this approach would make it so that integrating two APIs becomes a job for ML&#x2F;AI rather than humans.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;braid-work&#x2F;braid-spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;braid-work&#x2F;braid-spec<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.quilt.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;distributed-systems-and-the-end-of-the-api&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.quilt.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;distributed-systems-an...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23900749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23900749<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-31 19:54:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jayd16"],"id":[24333402],"kids":[24334057,24338728],"parent":[24332418],"text":["Enjoyable read but not much here.

Your smartphone stays black while you swipe at it and press the various buttons. Has the battery gone flat? You could have sworn you left the house with a full charge. Now you start to wonder how you’ll get your car out of the parking structure without a working mobile. That thought hadn’t occurred to you before.\nIt’s the least of your worries.\nStill fussing with your smartphone, you gradually begin to realise you’re not the only one having this problem. In fact, it would seem that everyone waiting at the pick-up area is in various stages of agitation with their own smartphones. Some are pressing odd combinations of buttons, trying to reset the little beasties. Others, who have clearly had rough days now made worse, start to swear at their dead screens, as if cursing might shock them into life.\nIt’s weird, and almost a bit funny. For a brief moment.\nThe first smashing can be felt more than heard, a subsonic strike something like a vast drumhead being struck with a metre-wide mallet, but so quick, you barely even notice it until it’s over. The second one, however, isn’t far behind, and it’s a bit louder. That second thump gives away its location — whatever it was seems to be happening quite close by — in the direction of the parking structure.\nAt just this moment a car cruises through the pick-up zone at full speed, barreling along at least 100 kmh. It’s only because of some very fast reactions that no one gets hurt as it passes by. As it zooms past, you notice there’s no one behind the wheel.\nBefore you have any time to process that, another huge thump nearby causes a section of the barrier wall of an upper floor of the concrete parking structure to shear off.

For example, a function may modify a list you pass in and also return it, when your chain assumed it would return a copy. A sort function may be unstable when the calling code assumed it was stable. A function may move to another thread when the calling code assumes that locking is unnecessary.<p>All of these would be easier to catch if the code were inline, instead of abstracted behind a function signature. Of course, this has to balance somehow with not rewriting sorting procedures in every function of your code base.<p>I think that the answer probably lies with some idea of separating library code and application code. Library code should be composed of many small functions, well documented and well unit-tested. Application programmers should all be familiar with the library and its semantics. In contrast, application code should probably favor larger functions and avoid ad-hoc abstractions.

I&#x27;d expect that effect to go away once one is asked to debug the same code again.<p>Second, the article asserts more bugs are found in shorter functions. However, this is only taking lines of code into account, not functional complexity. As code lives, bugs are found and corrected; often those bugs are to do with unforeseen runtime circumstances. Joel Spolsky covered this memorably a couple decades ago [1]. Again, taken as a static snapshot, I am not surprised that short code correlates with bugs, but I don&#x27;t think that tells us any meaningful information about how to code. A codebase is not a static entity.<p>As pointed out by several people already, the point of short functions is abstraction and comprehensibility - we want one and only one place to talk about reading a file, one and only one place to talk about handling a particular message type. Similarly, we want to know when we look at a function that it does one and only one thing, and we want to know when we look at our code that what it says it&#x27;s doing is what it&#x27;s actually doing.<p>I think this is one of those studies similar to the &quot;judges sentence harsher before lunch&quot;[2] study - the type of effect discussed fails under any reasonable comparison to commonly-experienced reality. Consider your own personal experience working in codebases and how this article aligns with that - phenomenological reporting can indeed be suspect, but when it contrasts starkly with experimental results it often indicates poor study design.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;things-you-should-never-do-part-i&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;things-you-should-...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nautil.us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;impossibly-hungry-judges\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nautil.us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;impossibly-hungry-judges<\/a><p>(I hope I can use this level of motivated reasoning to critique the next study I agree with, too.)"],"time":["2020-08-29 20:05:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jake_morrison"],"id":[24330330],"kids":{},"parent":[24315032],"text":["This post describes a process of decomposing code into very simple functions: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gar1t.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;solving-embarrassingly-obvious-problems-in-erlang.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gar1t.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;solving-embarrassingly-obvious-pro...<\/a><p>This results in functions which are, I feel, a bit too small for comfort.

But when you use short functions, you try to abstract things and make these functions usable in general cases. Who thinks, that simply splitting up a long function with zero changes fixes any bugs? Hopefully very few people. The only advantage in that case would be, that one can think in the context of that smaller function about what it is doing and that might help to find a bug _and then fix it_ by changing the logic. By then we have done already more than simply splitting up the long function though.<p>Long functions usually do more than one thing to achieve a more complex thing, which requires doing multiple steps. That makes them less reusable. They become too specific in what they achieve. If ones naming skills (those are very important) are not up to the task of naming long functions precisely, then perhaps one will forget, that this long function does something very specific inside to reach its goal. It will silently have lost composability. Other developers for sure will not know, unless they read all the code. I have seen atrocious 300+ loc functions, which serve exactly one purpose and interact with so many parts of the system, that I can read them 10 times and still do not get what they do in their entirety.<p>By not using small functions, one gives away readability as well. Every function is a chance to give a name to some short program. Short functions can be looked at separately, if written well. Of course, if you modify a lot of global state in your short function then no one can help you any longer.<p>&gt; All of the studies measuring defect density found increased defect density for smaller functions. One possible explanation was suggested by [2], who proposed that the increase in errors was due to what they called “interface errors” – that is, “those that were associated with structures existing outside the module’s local environment but which the module used.” This would include errors such as calling the wrong function.<p>Well, that happens usually, when the naming is off or difficult to remember or follow. That is why naming things is an incredibly important skill. The name of a function should, if possible, give a good picture (by convention if there is any) of what the function is doing. Do not tell me, that the 100 loc function can be described in a single verb. It is most likely doing much more than one thing.<p>So in general I am not convinced by how the title and intro of the article put it. If we look at the article, the title is also actually different than here. It says &quot;Very short [...]&quot; not &quot;short&quot;.<p>They would have to limit the scope of their study a lot, to make a good point. For example:<p>(1) procedural code &#x2F; mainstream &quot;every noun is a class&quot; code &#x2F; functional code<p>(2) the kind of expertise of coding people allowed to take part (Was the code written by capable people?)<p>(3) the programming languages they look at<p>It seems that this research might be biased by what code they looked at. Some programming communities are not as well known for keeping code clean as others. They are often associated with &quot;only learned one programming language ever, never widened their horizon to a different methodology or paradigm&quot;. Those are mainly found in languages, which are very widely used and up at the top of the programming language usage lists like TIOBE. The reason is, that being at the top of the list is used by many as a justification to not needing to learn a different tool. Many people stop learning. Here I quote the article:<p>&gt; However, nowadays the vast majority of functions are under 50 lines. A quick analysis of Eclipse, a popular open source IDE, reveals it averages about 8.6 lines per method in its source code.<p>Relating to an IDE, which is mainly used for Java.<p>&gt; This shift in function sizes is perhaps partially due to changes in programming languages. In the 80s a Fortran “module” was commonly considered a function and some variables  (see eg. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tutorialspoint.com&#x2F;fortran&#x2F;fortran_modules.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tutorialspoint.com&#x2F;fortran&#x2F;fortran_modules.htm<\/a>) and function was the basic building block of software, whereas nowadays most Java or C++ programmers would define “module” as a class consisting of multiple functions.<p>They do that, because for a long time their languages were so limited, that they did not have any other means of expressing a module. This also discouraged a style which does not use objects, but only functions. Add to that, that Java (and I think neither C++) does not have TCO and you have yet another reason, why Java or C++ code is not a good argument, when talking about short functions. Java got modules now, as far as I know. Not sure developers make proper use of them.<p>I would like to see the same research being done on a language like Haskell or Scheme, one language at a time."],"time":["2020-08-29 12:52:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mikl"],"id":[24330837],"kids":[24330969,24330962,24336312,24336375,24330889,24338433,24332969,24331097,24331104,24335935,24335246],"parent":[24329485],"text":["From my understanding, to adopt Smalltalk, I’d have to give up my editor, my SCM, my code review practises, my deployment strategies, my whole way of working.

Now Honeycomb itself makes you pay by the event so Slack&#x27;s internal buffer and collection system really lets them use it effectively for just the data they need.  The low adoption of tracing is also due to the high cost of application level integration, which they are deferring by using the existing tracing systems service layer integration.<p>So if you come at this as a Honeycomb user Slack has not really re-invented any wheel so much built their own backend to funnel data to Honeycomb and use it&#x27;s excellent trace viewing and light weight analytics UI [0].

This error happens multiple times in the article.<p>&gt; While the current APIs work very well for their intended use cases, using those APIs in contexts where there is no clear start or end for an operation can be confusing or not possible.<p>I don’t understand this part. At Klarrio, we are using Jaeger to trace a multi-tenant microservice system. We ingest data over mqtt and forward to kafka. Contexts are created on ingest and forwarded via kafka to further services. Each service adds its own spans to the trace. A message can be sent from one tenant to another, we don’t know when the trace is completed as the tenant can add spans at any time in the future. There isn’t clear end to the process. Traces can span over days. We use it to report latencies in a real time environment to a governmental body.<p>&gt; whose event loops call into application code (inversion of control), we need complex workarounds in existing APIs that often break the abstractions provided by these libraries<p>I’d like to know more how a custom solution solves this problem. At the end of the day, the trace id and parent span id still has to be somehow forwarded to the next service.<p>* edit: there is an example of a curl query towards the end of the article. Jaeger has a built in reporter and it’s already possible to send a context over http to another service. It’s just data?<p>So it also has to somehow plug into the mentioned frameworks&#x2F;IoC? What’s different?<p>In worst case, this is a perfect example of where a contribution for opentracing support would be probably appreciated.<p>&gt; Further, we also found that in those use cases there may be multiple request flows (producer-consumer patterns via kafka, goroutines, streaming systems) happening at the same time or we may want to track a single event across multiple request flows. In either case, having a single tracer for the execution of the entire application can be a limiting factor.<p>It’s possible with Jaeger. We do this at Klarrio. Span context can be sent over the wire. Furthermore, one is not limited to a single tracer per application.<p>&gt; Raw spans are internal implementation details in tracing systems.<p>Yes, implementation detail.<p>&gt; These internal implementation details are hidden from users, who interact with these spans via an instrumentation API at creation time and via the trace UI at consumption time.<p>Consumption, how? In the UI? Yes, they are visible. Through an API? They’re in tags and logs fields. They’re definitely not hidden.<p>&gt; For example, I’d like to be able to ask a question like “Am I missing my SLA because of slow DB queries on a specific http endpoint?” Even though traces contain this information, users often have to write complex Java programs, a multi-day effort, to answer their questions. Without an easy way to ask powerful analytical questions, users have to settle for the insights that can be gleaned from the trace view. This drastically limits the ability to utilize trace data for triage.<p>Jaeger has pluggable storage back ends. One of them is kafka. With kafka, it’s one step to such a solution. Either store them in a database allowing for such query (presto, druid... hello?) or write a kafka app managing alerts. Why reinvent the wheel completely?<p>I’m not convinced but if it works for Slack, great.

May i tell you that  out of 100% of people or companies advertising investment, just like 2% can guarantee the outcome. The rest are mere scorn artists who just want to take your money. Thread with caution!<p>This is also a signal to all regulatory authorities to buckle up. You must know that if cryptocurrency is prohibited in your jurisdiction you do not have business with it. The reason being that when there is a problem or abuse, the investor lacks government protection.<p>If you sense that you are being defrauded by an investment company there are few steps listed below which could help you to recover them if you have all your proof of investment and conversation history. The following are the process:<p>Firstly, if cryptocurrency is regulated in your jurisdiction like in the United States, File your complaint with the SEC. Why file with the SEC? Some of these companies are registered and it is the duty of the SEC to regulate them. Filing will make the SEC investigate and bring down the company. This is usually not the case as we have experienced in our quest to recover money for victims of fraud. Virtually all the companies are unregistered and are usually operated by fake individuals with fake identities. So reporting to the SEC may not really do justice.<p>File a report with any Law enforcement agency in your jurisdiction, like the FBI in the US. The essence of this is for investigation but this usually is not an easy one since most of them operate with fake identities and FBI’s investigation is usually very slow. Making it that before the investigations concluded the scorn would have emptied the wallet.<p>The next is that if the amount lost is what you can bear, please bear it and invest no more.<p>The last option is that you should try using virtual asset recovery companies. However, i must strongly advise you to thread with caution because most of these investment companies now pose to be recovery companies and they are out there to steal from you. This is owing to our experience in the recovery industry.<p>Some people have been defrauded twice because they went to the wrong place to seek help. Do not be desperate. When you send your complaint to contact@activebonorum.com the firm will review your claim to ensure that you really invested with these companies and if the same turns out to be successful, the firm would proceed from there.<p>Finally, I must advise you to inform those around you that you have been defrauded due to the trauma that comes with this. Also to recover all, log on to www.activebonorum.com"],"time":["2020-09-04 00:44:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["toossmm"],"id":[24369723],"kids":{},"parent":[24334150],"text":["I JUST TRIED THIS NO UPFRONT PAYMENT !!!!!

Also, namespaces were (and still are) a massive pain for little to no gain.<p>But over time I&#x27;ve come to really appreciate XHTML, again for that exact same reason. It forces you to write correct XML, and there is no possible ambiguity or multiple ways of representing a tag like there is in HTML5. `&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;` will always be `&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;`, not maybe `&lt;br&gt;` or `&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;` or even `&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;`. An XHTML document from someone else will be both human-readable (after pretty-printing) and easily machine parseable.

I remember using CSS was extremely painful because of IE5, which was the default on my Win98 machine, so I didn&#x27;t bother really trying till hearing about Firefox - I mean Phoenix.)<p>I also remember that centering any block element within another block element with CSS was somewhat absurd. The trick was to do something like<p>.centered {\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n}<p>And of course, there was no way to vertically center an element within another without hacks and HTML detritus that served no semantic purpose. It was almost worse than the table-based layouts.<p>That&#x27;s the only other painful thing I vividly remember behind what Eevee posted.<p>Flexbox and Grid have made things a lot better, but I still run into weird inconsistencies and exceptions frequently.

A traditional compiler front-end is usually organized as a progression of phases, where each phase takes an unstructured input, checks the input for validity, and, if it is indeed valid, adds more structure on top. Specifically, an error in an early phase (like parsing) usually means that the latter phase (like type checking) is not run for this bit of code at all. In other words, &quot;correct code&quot; is a happy case, and everything else can be treated as an error condition. In contrast, in IDE code is always broken, because the user constantly modifies it. As soon as the code is valid, the job of IDE ends and the job of the batch compiler begins. So, an IDE-oriented compiler should accommodate an incomplete and broken code, and provide IDE features, like completion, for such code.<p>This has been one of the most frustrating things about Rust&#x27;s development experience. A piece of code looks error-free, then you fix an error somewhere else, reach the next compiler phase, and an error pops up where you just were.

The piece makes an urgent point that needs to be appropriately acknowledged.

I do recall Amartya Sen making a definition of poverty along these grounds (in the sense of dignity, or lack thereof, in what one perceives as their social environment) some years back but haven&#x27;t been able to trace it down since or see if any further work was done on it. (If someone reading this happens to know more about such work, I&#x27;d appreciate being directed towards it).<p>The point made about Trump expressing a liking for poorly educated folk is also noteworthy. Even if the more sensible in the political class come to acknowledge the paradox we face, the matter of articulating and expressing it appropriately arises.

I had a great job working as the number 2  at a small business that I lucked into, but for various reasons beyond the control of the corporation, had to close. I’m in my late 20s, and as this article puts it, merely a high school graduate. I can code and do IT work, coordinate problem solving between businesses, read scientific texts, understand statistics and am very capable of managing others, amongst many other skills.

As the article mentions, I feel very depressed with my life and reading people who say that a degree is a golden indicator is genuinely depressing.

As publicly funded institutions, they have funded this expansion with a kind of Ponzi scheme where more and more full fee paying international students are required to sustain the machine. At the same time there has been a lot of training institutes and vocational colleges popping up, some with dubious quality and intent. The stimulus for this seems to be that young people can&#x27;t get enough quality work, and so they try and educate themselves.

You should not make treatment decisions based on articles like this one recounting Mike Tyson&#x27;s psychedelic trips as told to podcast host Joe Rogan for the sake of entertaining their audience.<p>Psychedelics are no doubt an interesting area of research and potentially very powerful agents in the context of comprehensive, professionally-guided treatment strategies. However, it&#x27;s important for everyone to acknowledge that these powerful drugs are not guaranteed to produce unilaterally positive changes in all people who use them. Ordering some psilocybin, LSD, or 5-MeO-DMT off of the darknet and dosing yourself in your home is a completely different experience than the MAPS style treatment protocols, which involve many intense sessions of pre-trip preparation, active guidance by professionals during the trip, and multiple post-session therapy sessions for integration and monitoring. It&#x27;s a mistake to assume you can replicate these procedures by yourself, alone, with questionable substances purchased on the darknet.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that internet comment sections are actively hostile to any negative experience reports from psychedelics. Whenever psychedelic research related topics hit the front page of Reddit, it&#x27;s fascinating to read the variety of anecdotal experience reports in the comments. They range from glowing endorsements of life-changing positivity like this article, to horror stories of multi-year depressive or psychotic episodes that were difficult to recover from. However, the negative anecdotes tend to be so aggressively downvoted that you can&#x27;t see them unless you switch to &quot;Controversial&quot; sorting some times. Worse yet, the negative anecdotes draw attacks and victim-blaming from people who don&#x27;t want to believe that psychedelics can be harmful.<p>It&#x27;s common to dismiss the negative reports as failures of &quot;set and setting&quot; or &quot;latent pre-existing conditions&quot;, but the truth is that the outcomes of these substances are very unpredictable. Everyone assumes that their own experience will be positive, or that their preparation and research will save them, but that&#x27;s not always the case.<p>I&#x27;ve even witnessed positive psychedelic outcomes turn dark as people become fixated on their tripping experiences. In psychedelic research the drugs are a part of the therapy. A means to an end. However, I&#x27;ve seen more than a few casual psychedelic users put too much weight into their hallucinations, or become fixated with the false belief that they are just one or two more trips away from a major breakthrough. Or they think enlightenment will come if they just double the dose next time. Or they become obsessed with trying the next research chemical or trendy mushroom strain. Or their first response to every difficult situation in life is to reach for psychedelic drugs.<p>Fascinating topic, but I urge everyone to please watch from a distance rather than self-experiment. If you have serious medical conditions, please engage with professionals for a monitored treatment strategy. If you absolutely must have your fix of psychedelic medicine, you can always engage with a ketamine treatment facility."],"time":["2020-02-02 23:08:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["npo9"],"id":[22219581],"kids":[22219697,22221816],"parent":[22218645],"text":["I greatly prefer the longer lasting psychedelics — a six hour mushroom trip feels a bit rushed for me.

Ralph traveled all over Europe and in the United States, visiting these groups that were using it, using some illegal loopholes or doing a kind of underground research and he wrote this book where he collected that information in a way that could become the basis of scientific research.<\/i><p><i>&quot;Now, what is fantastic there is that this substance creates a very short, within an hour, which is within the time of one psychoanalytic session, you can experience significant transformation, even spiritual opening.  The substance is methoxy-DMT.<\/i><p><i>&quot;I have in my book<\/i> When the Impossible Happens <i>a chapter which is called &quot;The Secret of the Toad of Light&quot; -- there are churches in the American Southwest that are actually using it as a sacrament, called the Church of the Toad of Light.<\/i><p><i>&quot;I took a fairly large dose, one that is more than is usually used.  My first time I really didn&#x27;t know the dosing.  It was estimated 25 milligrams.  Today you would use 5 or 10.  This was by far the most powerful psychedelic experience I&#x27;ve ever had.<\/i><p><i>&quot;Within seconds it took me out of my body.  There was nothing biographical, no birth experiences, nothing archetypal.  I was just facing this incredible source of light, for the lack of a better description.  It was beyond anything I could imagine in terms of the brilliancy and incandescence that it had, but also a sense that there was incredible intelligence, creative intelligence going beyond any dichotomies.  I couldn&#x27;t say if it was daemonic or divine.  It was just off the scales that I had.<\/i><p><i>&quot;Coming down from that experience, I had the feeling I was dying -- not from life in to dying but from a place beyond death into a dying body, and after a while it became clear that this was not really dying, it was an experience of dying, and for quite a while I was in a situation where I was an absolutely blissful state and I was having visions of streams of my past life experiences where I had the feeling of dying and being killed in different situations.  My body was acting out the agony.  It was shaking, twitching, but psychologically, emotionally I was in absolute bliss.<\/i><p><i>&quot;Then coming down for a week I was in a state in which I would like to live.  We were at the time living at Esalen.  We had a deck overlooking the ocean.  This was the time I was handwriting my manuscripts and giving it to a secretary and having to edit it.  In that week I had to do editing of my manuscript, which I could do perfectly lying in the sun there, and I would take a little break and within seconds I had the feeling of oneness with the whole environment, oneness with the world.  Then I would open my eyes and I could continue editing.<\/i><p><i>&quot;But then of course, the consciousness of the industrial civilization came back to do workshops, travel, so I didn&#x27;t stay in that state but my meditations became much, much deeper and it was not difficult to get into some version of that state just through meditation.<\/i><p><i>&quot;So I think this would be an amazing substance to try for practical reasons.  Because you will not find psychiatrists like my self, in the 60&#x27;s and so on, sitting for six hours with their patients but they could certainly do a one hour session with the methoxy-DMT and I think signifcant therapy could be done within this very short time.<\/i><p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s also, according to Ralph Metzner&#x27;s observations, it&#x27;s a substance where the experience ends very cleanly.  There&#x27;s no lingering on.  So there is a very powerful experience but also a good closure.<\/i><p><i>&quot;So this is my experience with methoxy-DMT.  Now it&#x27;s very very popular.  For example, we had the Tranpsersonal Conference in Prague and there were lectures about it and of course there were people who had access to the toad material, to the excretions or secretions of the glands.  So it&#x27;s becoming a very popular substance right now.&quot;<\/i>[1]<p>[1] - From about 38 minutes in to Tim Ferris&#x27; interview with Grof here:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3mdYUmvTeig\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3mdYUmvTeig<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-02 23:57:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mapcars"],"id":[22222461],"kids":[22233428,22222502],"parent":[22218645],"text":["“Experiencing 5-MeO-DMT is this amazing feeling of ‘oceanic bliss,’” she says. “By experiencing this profound connection with the universe and all living beings, one gets the feeling that we’re incredibly lucky to have even been birthed on this beautiful planet.”<p>One can achieve this through yoga, and not for 20 minutes trip but as a constant state of experience."],"time":["2020-02-03 09:35:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neonate"],"id":[22218961],"kids":{},"parent":[22218645],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;FptCi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;FptCi<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-02 20:48:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crmrc114"],"id":[22226151],"kids":{},"parent":[22218645],"text":["Trimread link if you despise the auto-playing video on forbes <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.trimread.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;4010\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.trimread.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;4010<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-03 18:05:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ada1981"],"id":[22223293],"kids":{},"parent":[22218645],"text":["I went through a breakup 8 months ago that brought up a lot of old patterns, including some suicidal thoughts.<p>A shaman was coming through NYC to work with vets with PTSD and I was invited to sit in a ceremony with him.<p>I was afraid I was going to loose my mind &#x2F; be sent to hell.<p>And I did.
