The basic summary is that modern reverse-osmosis distillation plants require on the order of 7 kJ&#x2F;l to get freshwater from seawater (which works out to about 50 kJ of sunlight per liter with a cheap 16%-efficient solar panel) while multistage distillation requires a few hundred kJ&#x2F;l.<p>The number given by the paper abstract works out to 623 kJ&#x2F;l if we assume one sun is 1000 W&#x2F;m² (a common figure for the solar constant at the surface).  So if you use those square meters to run photovoltaic panels which you then use to drive a reverse-osmosis machine, you can get dozens of times as much fresh water from the same solar energy.  But you need to build or buy a reverse-osmosis machine, and then you need to defoul it, so this device might be a good choice in some circumstances.

If you&#x27;re getting no feedback, you might start to worry that you&#x27;re not someone worth taking the time to give feedback to.<p>That&#x27;s why companies and people don&#x27;t bother giving feedback.   Until you turn into someone they care about, what benefit would there be to them to spend resources to do this?  And with uncertain reaction from the person (as pointed out by many stories here)?<p>So that&#x27;s why, if you really want meaningful feedback it&#x27;s a challenge to find -- you have to pay someone to do it (which is hard, because casual acquaintances don&#x27;t know your deeper job-related behavior or performance), someone close to you (which is hard, because it&#x27;s not easy to give friends honesty), or someone who has the time and interest to do it (rare to find).

By churn I mean: take Overwatch. Sure there are people who stay with the game for a long time but many many players play for some time and drop off as they move on to different games or other things in life. In a high churn environment just staying for a long time gives you advantage by practicing, almost automatically. On the other hand, it is much harder to do in things that people practice for decades, like making money or being a doctor.<p>By compounding I mean that having some amount of something makes it easier to obtain more of it. Money and capital in general is the prime example of it. Fame maybe a subtler example but explain a lot of boom or bust success in industries like acting or pop music. Outside of your own motivation you don’t get much compounding from Overwatch skill.<p>Natural ability also plays a role in certain occupations.

He&#x27;s got some anecdata about what he views in overwatch, but you actually need some statistical techniques if you want to justify a statistical number. Of the players in the top 5% how many times was it observed that they committed obvious game losing gaffes? How did he screen the reported rankings for the arbitrary subset of players that he considered real competitors.<p>I don&#x27;t think the person who wrote this understands statistics because they&#x27;re not playing a game where randomness is a large influence in the game. If you talk to top poker players about their game they&#x27;re not going to talk to you about individual mistakes, they&#x27;re going to talk to you about constructing ranges. A top 5% poker player isn&#x27;t just going to beat a top 10% player in a single game or single hand, they&#x27;re going to have a higher expected return over a long period of time. THe point is to come up with strategies that are successful against a large range of opponents. So whilst you can look at a single event and identify whether it was effective in that particular situation, what you&#x27;re optimizing for is to get the best return over time.

It is very noticeable in most individual games and sports that as you go to the top the difference between skill level is huge, even between top 5 percentile of people or between top 1 percentile of people. So in a way not only 95 percentile is no good, a lot of times even 99th percentile may not be that good either in grand scheme of things.<p>If we take two examples of chess and boxing. In boxing there is huge difference between top 5 level fighter in a weight class, compared to top 20 level fighter, and huge difference between top 20 and top 100, and another huge difference between top 100 and regular pro boxers. And there can be 1000s of pro boxers for a weight class. And there is another huge difference between a pro boxer and random guy who trains boxing in a gym, and another huge difference between random guy who trains boxing and just a random Joe from the street.<p>The level differences are so huge that, if a top 5 fighter is fighting someone from top 20 it is generally considered a one sided beat down and a mismatch, with 10:1 odds for a favourite.<p>There is very similar situation in chess. A Fide Master can crush people who have studied chess and play as a hobby while just playing blind folded. (Not even talking about average Joe, even I can beat most average people playing blind folded, and I am not any kind of Master). International masters (IM) crush Fide Masters like its nobodies business. At next level, Grand Masters are a level above most IMs. Being a Grand Master is considered a huge accomplishment, not just top 1% but probably top 0.001%. No matter how hard you work and how dedicated you are, unless you are also an exceptional talent, you can&#x27;t become a GM in chess. However top 10 players will crush below average GMs with ease. That is how crazy the level difference is in this sport.<p>I think this type of phenomenon is more prevalent in individual sports&#x2F;games compared to team sports. (Especially larger team sports). I think that is another reason why this phenomenon is not always as visible in &quot;real life&quot; situations, because most of the real work is done in groups and sometimes in very large groups which averages out potential huge differences between individual abilities. In a team&#x2F;group environment there are faster diminishing returns on how much more a single individual can do as part of a group. Of course there are still big differences but in that case top 95th percentile is probably good enough to get you in the top team, especially if you have other skills to complement your abilities (like better communication, better team work, etc)"],"time":["2020-02-07 16:35:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lpolovets"],"id":[22272527],"kids":{},"parent":[22265197],"text":["I fully agree with this.

It&#x27;s pool because I&#x27;ve done some league. Your typical 7 level player (in APA) typically wins most matches. In fact the ranking system is basically how much you win, even with handicaps. Here&#x27;s a good list of things to think about when playing each and every shot.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supremebilliards.com&#x2F;51-pool-tips-every-player-must-know&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supremebilliards.com&#x2F;51-pool-tips-every-player-must-...<\/a><p>The top level players keep all of that in mind automatically. It&#x27;s practically part of their training data at this point. They barely lose even when a level 2 player needs to just win 2 matches and they need to win like 7 matches.<p>The &quot;equalizer&quot; system of the APA says that&#x27;s roughly a fair fight. But it&#x27;s not. When playing a 7, you know that not only are they going to get pretty much every easy shot, when they don&#x27;t have a more than 90% chance of making a shot, they leave the 2 a bad bad bad shot, like something the 2 will have a 1% chance of making. They also put the cue ball in a special place - a place where either the 7 will get a ball in hand OR strategically a good shot on their next run.<p>It&#x27;s all extremely interesting to watch a true 7 play anyone else. The only fair match-up against a 7 is anyone of rank 4 or above, mostly because they know the tricks. They still make rookie mistakes all the time though, hence the 4.<p>You&#x27;re probably in the 95% if you&#x27;re a 5 or above in APA. People that are six hate being a six. They get kicked off teams because of skill caps in favor of keeping a bunch of 2,3,4 players and their 7.<p>I was a 4, played in the bay area, south bay APA. Represent. I moved.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.southbayapa.com&#x2F;bapl_hostlocations.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.southbayapa.com&#x2F;bapl_hostlocations.htm<\/a><p>That list used to have like 8 places when I played. Sad. Good to see lucky shots is still around my home team from there.<p>Anyway, your typical 4 thinks he&#x27;s a 7 inside - but doesn&#x27;t say it out loud because of the inevitable laughs. They have honed every pool stance. Bridge is near perfect. A decent 4 can hit the cue ball from one side of the 8-foot table to a ball that needs exactly a 30 degree. These crazy 4s think they have a 80% chance of hitting a ball across that table into a pocket (a long shot, with or without angle). Either the cue is travelling a long way to the ball or the hit ball will. Unless the target is &quot;in the pocket&quot;, like giving the player a huge degree of error and still make it in. No I&#x27;m talking more of a looks hard, is hard, but the 4 is so HONED on these shots they nearly always forget their defense, so silly. The major difference between a 7 and a 4 here is the 7 will try 30% making the ball in, and 70% leaving the cue in a disastrously bad place for the other player (maybe even 10&#x2F;90). And the funny shit is, the 4 probably is better at hitting the ball in, even if they both put in 80% effort to do so... but that&#x27;s not the game for a long shot. The game for a long shot is to leave it bad. There are lots of calculations, but that&#x27;s the gist. The top players win because they get ball in hand, typically planned of course, but you won&#x27;t even see the smirk on the face when it worked.<p>What does this have to do with 95%, I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s somewhere in there.<p>Ok now you&#x27;re pumped up, go contact APA and get on a team.

In other words, the differences in ratings are not statistically significant; they are just as well explained by pure chance.<p>Building a system where you incentivise and promote on a random draw of cards is bad in and of itself, but doing it and then labeling it as being based on merit is actively hostile to anything you&#x27;re trying to accomplish. You are building a culture of people stabbing each other in the back in desperation to win your lottery, and not a healthy environment of cooperation and focus on productivity.<p>Yes, sometimes you have a worker who performs off the charts in either direction. That&#x27;s a great opportunity! If they perform much better than someone else, put them in a position where they can coach and train others in how to do things that well. If they are much worse, try training them or otherwise find them a different job they can do better.<p>Other than that special case, the only way to improve the performance of the system is to give the workers better tools, better information, better understanding, more cooperation, better ability to do their job. The manager is the only one standing in the way of the workers doing a better job.<p>But then how do you assign bonuses and raises when everyone performs approximately the same? Split them across everyone. That simple. Think in terms of incentivising the team, not the individual.<p>And things like promotions that can&#x27;t be shared among many people? Ask the workers themselves who they think are a good fit for the position. Chances are they know that hell of a lot better than a manager will. And it is abundantly clear how to get a promotion: make a good impression on your team. Cooperate, teach, help out, be nice, do good work.

The recent Meltdown stuff has really blown up the cost of privilege transitions, because now people expect non-architectural data not to leak across privilege boundaries. System calls are about twice as slow as they used to be. Meanwhile, I&#x2F;O is faster than ever, with PCIE and NVME. Io_uring offers the opportunity to avoid privilege transitions through asynchronous calls based on writing to a memory buffer shared between user space and the kernel. That has the potential for fundamentally changing the basis system call interface. As the article hints at, the trick is designing the API so you can construct as large a block of work to be done asynchronously as possible. At the limit, you could really push down the core of your I&#x2F;O loop into the kernel, hence the suggestions that BPF programs could be submitted through the ring to chain operations all within the kernel.<p>(Incidentally, this is a good illustration of the flexibility of UNIX’s model of describing everything with a file descriptor.

We could increase CO2 100x in the atmosphere and it wouldn&#x27;t change a thing temperature- or climate-wise (other than inducing more plant growth).<p>2. The reason we see CO2 increases associated with warming in the geological record is because the oceans sequester CO2, and the amount they sequester depends on temperature. As the Sun heats up the Earth, the oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere. As the Sun cools the Earth, the oceans re-sequester the CO2 they previously released. That&#x27;s why CO2 concentrations are linked in the geological record to temperature.<p>3. Thus, the Sun is what heats and cools the earth, not CO2.

I think Ionic moved to it for example. If we already have our own code for loading and rendering components, using Handlebars templates, what would we need to do to make them into web components instead, or make all of ours compatible with the latest React or Angular?<p><i>The specifics for anyone who cares:<\/i><p>When we began our own framework, way before React and Angular, we built our own, kinda “sane” reusable component engine. We called them “tools”. One tool on an element is a component. But you could also add multiple tools on a component, to add or remove behaviors:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;guide&#x2F;tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;guide&#x2F;tools<\/a><p>Basically, we figured it would be easier to just  let Templates, HTML, CSS and JS each do what they were intended for.<p><i>HTML side<\/i><p>1. We had &lt;div class=“Q_Tool Streams_chat_tool” data-streams-chat=‘{“foo”: bar, ...}’&gt; easily exporting json from php or templating engines, very readable and completely standard (no JSX or custom components). It was just slightly longer to write but provided useful metadata. It used to be called <i>microformats<\/i> back in the day. Multiple tools can be added on same element this way. The element didnt have to be a div.<p>2. We had handlebars helpers like {{&amp;tool “Streams&#x2F;chat” foo=bar}} and Q.Tool.setUpElement(“div”, toolName, options), or pass an element instead of “div” to add a tool on an existing element. We also had a jQuery fn method like $(“foo”).tool(“Streams&#x2F;chat”, options).activate() .<p>3. Our users just called var element = Q.activate(Q.Tool.setUpElement(“div”))) in vanilla JS or $(“&lt;div &#x2F;&gt;”).tool(...).activate() if jQuery was loaded.<p>* CSS side*<p>1. We namespaced our CSS by Modulename_toolname_<p>2, Some tools took advantage of shared CSS classes defined in the module or a module they depend on<p><i>Javascript side<\/i><p>1. We just had Q.Tool.define(toolName, constructor, defaultOptions, methods) and the tool.state would be the options merged over the defaultOptions. It was all customizable and merging was done via a smart Q.extend() function that we tweaked to eg combine Q.Event handlers in the best way.<p>2. Ways to access tools on an element would include Q.Tool.byId() and element.Q.tools etc. The tool ids would be autogenerated so as to establish a hierarchy of which tool was a parent. Then you could do tools.children([filterName]) and tools.parents() and so on. Traverse faster without touching the DOM.<p>3. We had Q.activate(container, options) to activate tools within a certain container. Javascript for tools would be loaded on demand, and tools would be added&#x2F;removed on demand. We had Q.Event.prototype.add(callback, key) take a String key or a Q.Tool, so events would be automatically removed when a tool was removed.<p>4. You could also do Q.Tool.define([toolName1, toolName2], toolName, constructor, defaultOptions, methods) to have tools require that previously named tools already be activated on the element. This is for composability of tools, something more general than inheritance. Let’s say you have a chatroom and you want to add support for @mentions to it and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkscraping.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkscraping.com<\/a> as you type. So you’d make tools that work in top of Streams&#x2F;chat.<p>It seems to me that ANYWAY your user will have to load a Javascript file that defined your web components. And ANYWAY they will have to load javascript on demand. And ANYWAY this javascript may be packed into a single file so you’ll have to actually check whether a variable has been set before loading modules <i>dynamically<\/i> so you dont want static loading. And ANYWAY your tools may want to use shared css so you may as well namespace your CSS. And ANYWAY your default options may include event handlers or other things you can’t serialize easily into attributes of an element. And you may want to compose tools or find them with CSS so what’s wrong with using CSS classes instead of the element name for that? And ANYWAY you will want to render your tools in a readable way so why not stuff JSON into data attributes which were allowed for exactly such purposes? And ANYWAY you may want to use a powerful templating engine like Handlebars. The only part I am not sure of is the last one.<p>Seems to me - but I am biased - that we have the optimal approach. If something else comes out we can just turn Q.Tool.define into a wrapper around window.customComponents.define. But our users won’t have to change a thing. They can continue to use Q.Tool and Q.Page and Q.exports(arg, arg) and Q.requires(module, callback) without worrying what’s underneath. Isn’t it better and more stable?<p>But everyone got into Angular and React with its JSX etc. I think the main sell was the dirty checking (the model in Angular, the DOM in React). So you can just render a large chunk. I never saw the benefit of that. You <i>should<\/i> reason about mutations imho. Components are views with their own viewmodel, that’s all. You can update a bunch of state parameters and then call stateChanged(“a”, “b”) which would requestAnimationFrame() and update stuff. Is it so hard to call stateChanged() after changing state.a and state.b ? Do you really need to instead grok digest cycles or a virtual dom??"],"time":["2020-02-07 15:40:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DonHopkins"],"id":[22263925],"kids":[22264583,22264504],"parent":[22260303],"text":["I&#x27;ve been going down the long road of learning Angular recently, and I love it and want to learn more, but I have a couple naive newbie questions whose answers I thought should be obvious, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out:<p>Is there a standard way to define local variables in an Angular template so you don&#x27;t have to repeat the same redundant expression again and again (or so you can at least give an expression a self documenting variable name so it&#x27;s not so mysterious)? Or do you have to define an instance variable on your component and figure out how to initialize it to the right value before the template gets executed, with no way to lazily (or repeatedly) evaluate it by putting the calculation inside conditionals (or loops) in the template so they&#x27;re not run if they&#x27;re not needed (or to calculate the local variables independently for every loop iteration)? Is there an angular hook or technique that&#x27;s meant for that, and efficient, and hopefully doesn&#x27;t involve much arbitrary non-JavaScript gobbledygook syntax, and is at least somewhat standard and well supported? Please don&#x27;t tell me I shouldn&#x27;t ever want to do that for some reason of ideological purity or separation of concerns (as if a templating language could ever be called &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;elegant&quot;). The common legitimate use case is ngIf=&quot;some expression is not null&quot; then {{some expression}}, and also ngIf=&quot;some expressions&quot; ... ngIf=&quot;not some expression&quot;.<p>I googled for it, and the solutions of &quot;abuse ngIf&#x27;s special goofy syntax to name the result of the condition and pray to God it&#x27;s truthy or don&#x27;t bother&quot; and &quot;abuse ngFor to loop over an array of one item to give it a name&quot; are not acceptable answers. There were also a few competing and possibly out-of-date &quot;install this non-standard ngLet directive that I hacked up but don&#x27;t support, but don&#x27;t call it with an &quot;ng&quot; prefix because that&#x27;s reserved for the Angular team&quot; -- but isn&#x27;t there a standard way of doing such a simple essential thing, that the Angular team already thought of and included, such that other people will have some clue what&#x27;s going on when they see it? And it would be nice to be able to define more than one variable at once per begin&#x2F;end tag, if you know what I mean. Maybe even without using any begin&#x2F;end tags, perchance to dream?<p>Also, is there a way to easily define simple light weight macros (&quot;snippet reuse&quot;) so you can repeat the same pattern in one or more components, without defining a whole component in all its glory and splendor with multiple files that other multiple files need to import and declare? Or even a global file of shared macros that a bunch of other templates can import, like the globally shared css declarations you can include in local css files? I&#x27;ve seen &quot;ng-template&quot;, but I am having a hard time getting my head around it, compared to the simplicity and power of Genshi&#x27;s py:match, that&#x27;s based on xpath, and py:def, that precisely follows Python function calling conventions and that you can easily call from any normal expression. And py:match is quite useful for defining concise custom tags (or xpath patterns) that can wrap embedded content. In comparison, ng-templates seems quite clumsy and limited, and confusing about calling and scoping and passing parameters and content, which is nothing like standard JavaScript calling conventions, and reminds me more of the abomination that is Zope METAL templates.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zope.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;zopebook&#x2F;AppendixC.html#metal-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zope.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;zopebook&#x2F;AppendixC.htm...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template_Attribute_Language#METAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template_Attribute_Language#ME...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zope#Zope_Page_Templates\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zope#Zope_Page_Templates<\/a><p>I&#x27;ve been using and loving Genshi with Python for more than a decade (and before that, Kid, which Genshi is almost the same as, and before that Zope page templates, TAL, and METAL templates, which inspired Kid and Genshi, but totally sucked), and I love its ability to drop into Python with &lt;?python ... ?&gt; to define some variables or import some functions locally in the template that you can use, with real honest to god multi-line indented Python &quot;if&quot; statements for logic (and Python comments for, err, commenting) instead of Christmas trees of deeply nested ternary ? : operators (or rather postfix conditional &quot;foo if bar else baz&quot; Python expressions). Genshi also has &quot;with&quot; for defining scoped local variables with tags, like   &lt;py:with vars=&quot;y=7; z=x+10&quot;&gt;$x $y $z&lt;&#x2F;py:with&gt;.<p>And I also love Genshi&#x27;s py:def for making locally defined or libraries of includable imperative &quot;code snippet&quot; templates you can call just like Python functions (with glorious optional named defaulting args, etc), and py:match for declaring xpath pattern matching templates that can wrap html content as a parameter (so the macro can cherry-pick out and transform different parts of the passed content with xpath), as well as taking attribute parameters.<p>Another nice feature of Genshi is that for all directives it supports both the attribute form like &lt;div py:if=&quot;condition&quot;&gt; ... &lt;&#x2F;div&gt; attached to an element that you want to keep, or the element form that dissolves without leaving an element, like &lt;py:if test=&quot;condition&quot;&gt; ... &lt;&#x2F;py:if&gt; . You can also attach multiple directive attributes to the same element, thanks to the way it executes them in a well defined ordered hierarchy that makes practical sense (like &quot;for&quot; above &quot;if&quot;, so each iteration of the &quot;for&quot; loop can be conditionalized with its own &quot;if&quot; evaluation), and &quot;def&quot; above all else, so you can define a single tag macro that loops over something then conditionalizes each iteration, then sets attributes on and adds content to the included elements.

High-speed rail works best when it connects robust local transportation networks that already exist: between cities that they themselves have robust temporal and spatial transport coverage. It works best when faraway cities can be brought within commuting range, or further leisure destinations within daytrip range. Similarly, it works best when it extends the catchment area of an airport, rather than a service positioned to compete against point-to-point flights.<p>But major infrastructure projects often suffer from messy political and public relations approaches that play up the project&#x27;s impressiveness and prestige in isolation, while neglecting to emphasize or champion synergistic improvements to other parts of the network. Frequent and punctual &quot;normal-speed&quot; rail isn&#x27;t as politically energizing, and local transit networks that serve the specific transport needs of a town are hardly exciting to regional audience, but without it, high-speed rail is just an expensive showpiece that doesn&#x27;t serve a genuinely identifiable transport need.

To be sure, he sought also to do well for himself while doing good for others, but there was nothing wrong with that. In the end, however, he and the Ecuadorian lawyers he led corrupted the Lago Agrio case. They submitted fraudulent evidence. They coerced one judge, first to use a court-appointed, supposedly impartial, “global expert” to make an overall damages assessment and, then, to appoint to that important role a man whom Donziger hand-picked and paid to “totally play ball” with the LAPs. They then paid a Colorado consulting firm secretly to write all or most of the global expert’s report, falsely presented the report as the work of the court-appointed and supposedly impartial expert, and told half-truths or worse to U.S. courts in attempts to prevent exposure of that and other wrongdoing. Ultimately, the LAP team wrote the Lago Agrio court’s Judgment themselves and promised $500,000 to the Ecuadorian judge to rule in their favor and sign their judgment. If ever there were a case warranting equitable relief with respect to a judgment procured by fraud, this is it.<p>Subsequently, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that the Chevron judgment was procured by fraud and should not be enforced: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;michaelkrauss&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;dutch-high-court-finds-for-chevron-over-ecuador&#x2F;#68208c1b6723\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;michaelkrauss&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;dutch-...<\/a><p>&gt; And last week, on April 12, 2019, the Dutch Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision.

Can you read his personality?  If you barely know the person and think he might be a stickler for detail and protocol, then keep your agenda to positive topics. Focus on your accomplishments and anything you plan that has a direct contribution to the company. Avoid anything negative, it might come back to haunt you. This is the safest path.<p>If you have reasonable rapport then I would suggest to still stick to being positive, but you could very diplomatically raise any issues that might be negatively impacting the company. What I mean is that instead of saying something like &quot;This open plan office is too noisy and I can&#x27;t concentrate&quot; say: &quot;Sometimes the office gets quite noisy. Perhaps these conditions could be distracting for some of the staff and impact upon productivity.&quot; If you get asked how it affects you then you could say: &quot;I use noise cancelling headphones to minimise the impact and maintain my workflow.&quot;  Of course that presumes you have such headphones. The above is merely an example of how to recast comments so that you don&#x27;t look like a complainer.

There are a lot of different ways to use, many of which involve data binding that is not evaluated till runtime. There are ways to make some databinding type-checked at compile time, but it is not built in. WinForms data binding is pretty limited, so generally it is easier to track down what piece of code is causing something to display on the screen.<p>WinForms (and the Win32 resource scripts that can before it) are more limited in what they can easily express. So the resulting UIs tend to be a bit visually and behaviorly similar. This is nice for devs because you have a design already laid out for you. It&#x27;s also nice for users since the apps are more consistent and predictable. WPF gives you a big blank canvas where it is hard to make something look decent.

Broadly speaking, I think there are three categories of hidden, but segregated nonetheless, socioeconomic groups in London, and this has a dramatic effect on quality-of-life and also general conditions within startups.<p>- The wealthy owners and marshallers of capital: these are your VCs and investors, as well as everyone else that isn&#x27;t in tech but are closely related including foreign oligarchs. Some startup founders could probably be categorised in the lower-end of this group, as well as staff at financial service firms (investment banks, private equity funds, hedge funds etc.) including investment bankers and others. Quality-of-life is stellar due to very high compensation and&#x2F;or acquired wealth.<p>- Support staff to the above: software engineers including many CTOs fall under this category, as well as people on the lower-rungs of the financial and insurance industries. Quality-of-life is generally good, but you are basically detained under golden handcuffs, and you will never earn the same kind of compensation as the marshallers of capital. Software engineer salaries are generally capped at around £150k if you&#x27;re a lucky, with very few exceptions (HFT firms etc.). Entry-level salaries start at £30-40k, which is atrocious for a <i>very<\/i> expensive city like London and you will probably have to flatshare with others to make ends meet.<p>- Everyone else.<p>What is important to note here is that there is a very implicit status-ranking in these groups, and software engineers particularly are not respected any where close to the level they are in the United States as they are not considered members of the first group. This, as you can imagine, has very severe effects on the level of compensation and the general working conditions that you can expect as an engineer as you are not deemed deserving of more compensation since you are after all &quot;just an engineer&quot;. This is also why stock options and other equity compensation schemes are not as popular in London as they are in the Bay Area. Software engineers are considered support staff rather than integral contributors to the success of a technology business.<p>This social segregation, as you can imagine, also has effects on the social cohesion of the city, and I think the recent increase of crime in London is a direct consequence of the alienation of the third category of people due to the flood of liquidity from the first category, which drives up salaries for the second group of people (and thereby cost of living in London), and prices everyone else out.<p>Most of Europe suffers under this kind of segregation, and I presume it is partly a consequence of antiquated social structures that were more prevalent during the 20th century but haven&#x27;t really modernised to align with the interconnected and meritocratic reality of today. I believe this is the primary reason why compensation for software professionals is so low in Europe compared to the meritocracy of America (but even this is changing with implicit filters such as Ivy League degrees etc.).<p>Most global cities have elements of this as well, but I feel the divide and indeed social inequality is very pronounced in London and is becoming worse by the year, which is among the reasons as to why I left the city for greener pastures."],"time":["2020-02-07 18:07:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brm"],"id":[22268087],"kids":[22272509,22268400,22269285,22269573],"parent":[22266722],"text":["Random aside but this seems like a decent place to ask it...<p>Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on with the Startup and Innovator Visas?

If this is the case, they will fight tooth and nail against any expansion of manned space exploration (because it will be both private and military in nature), the will fight against innovation that doesn&#x27;t spring from their own workshop(s), and they will use Cape Canaveral (and their heritage facilities&#x2F;infrastructure) as a way to bully &quot;adversaries&quot; into submission.<p>I hope this isn&#x27;t the case, and if it is, I hope they can reverse whatever practices and policies that have led us to where we are. As it stands though, it appears NASA is more like OSHA then it is like its historical instance."],"time":["2020-02-07 01:06:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ittan"],"id":[22262588],"kids":[22263987,22263787,22266273],"parent":[22259563],"text":["I highly recommend the Rossman repair group channel for his recordings of public right to repair bills and the hearings he attends.<p>Some of the testimonies make no sense<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;rossmanngroup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;rossmanngroup<\/a><p>Edit: someone already posted below, sorry for the double posting."],"time":["2020-02-07 03:06:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neuralRiot"],"id":[22260689],"kids":{},"parent":[22259563],"text":["Apple clearly doesn’t want this to happen, they only want to be able to say they’re making progress in the right to repair issue.

I found it quite illuminating so here it goes.<p>Silicon Valley has turned us into software subscribers. Now, they are essentially trying to turn us into hardware subscribers.<p>=============<p>Bless you Louis; you&#x27;re doing important work. I think you need to widen the scope of your argument.<p>I&#x27;ve been working in Silicon Valley for Fortune 10 corporations for 30 years and I&#x27;ve been privy to &quot;business model&quot; conversations for decades there.<p>Here&#x27;s my take (pardon the length): If you take a step back the essential reality behind what Silicon Valley corporations are trying to do, is disenfranchise consumers and abolish private property; more specifically and more importantly, the means of labor. They&#x27;ve already managed to pull it off for software; now they&#x27;re essentially all subscribers. The current attitude as it pertains to hardware reeks of this being the intent for hardware too. Everything in software is SaaS today and the next step is to do SaaS for hardware.<p>They also see that this is a prevalent model in the auto industry : Most people don&#x27;t really own their cars, they lease them and under the leasing contract all maintenance is done by the dealership. In general, the whole &quot;sharing economy&quot; (Uber and the like) is also going down that business model — you no longer own your means of labor; they&#x27;re owned by the corporation.<p>They don&#x27;t want consumers — and especially workers, to own anything — they want you on a leash, forever in debt, a brick in a huge Ponzi scheme where the entire life of the worker&#x2F;consumer belongs to business model and you are nothing else than a credit line.<p>Keep this in mind when you argue the Right to Repair: It goes well beyond &quot;repair&quot;; it goes into the very fabric of what it is to be a citizen, a worker and consumer in a market society. Companies don&#x27;t want you to repair what you purchased from them because they don&#x27;t really consider you&#x27;ve ever acquired the goods; you&#x27;re a hardware subscriber and they want you to be tethered to them as a dependent; a predictable source of revenue for a publicly traded industry that needs to predict revenue and growth each quarter.<p>How do you ensure predictable revenue when you&#x27;re Apple ? You lock consumers in. What does &quot;locking-in&quot; mean ? Alienation, subservience, dependence. I&#x27;m not even a libertarian, nor a marxist, and there&#x27;s no hidden anarchist agenda in my arguments — I simply believe in private property as an essential pillar of civil liberty.<p>If what this industry does is not &quot;abuse of dominant position&quot; and wilful distortion of market forces to benefit nobody else but tech industry shareholders, what is it ? If you&#x27;ve studied the past, you&#x27;ll recall the economic model of plantation owners relied on the slaves&#x2F;workers not owning the tools of their labor. You were strictly forced (or allowed) to work under the monopoly of the plantation owners. Ironically the same model was instated by the Soviets, although they pretended to make it legitimate by claiming nothing belonged to any individual. Both the Bolcheviks and the plantation owners abused their lucrative monopolies.<p>The foundation upon which the republic and civil liberties are built, is private property. If many in the tech industry have their way, the US will become one large plantation where a class of owners can shut you off your job, your communications and your access to education and culture, simply by remotely turning your devices into bricks.
