Deep down this road. Let me just give you a heads up on something I didn’t consider at the time: Most template languages do not parse every single node, one by one. In a sense they are just doing string concatenation. Not so with server side rendering and React. I’m not saying it can’t be done but just realize it is going to take a lot more compute power. Caching is great of course but won’t help you if you plan to customize user content during the server side rendering as well. My recommendation is that you don’t do any user authenticated stuff during SSR.<p>Also consider how you are going to handle cookies if you do plan to make authenticated requests to server side rendering. Also solvable but for some reason people had the hardest time understanding why we had to forward cookies to the domains we controlled in an API request and definitely not to any other servers.<p>I’m not sure I would pick React for an SEO driven website. It is hard to get a competitive “time to first byte”. Unless of course you can pre warm a cache of every one of your pages.<p>Lastly, you’re going to need Node for the SSR.

Use the same database schema, front-end HTML&#x2F;JS, test suite, and so on. To whatever extent possible, use the same names for classes and functions. Check the reimplementation correctness by using a comparison tool that calls both the Python and Go version of a page&#x2F;function&#x2F;search and making sure that they produce the same results.<p>2. Change the production code over to the Go version, perhaps using a ramping strategy where X% of servers are running the Go code, and you gradually increase X, while monitoring vital statistics like server load and response time.<p>3. Now that the production site is running Go, incrementally split off components into their own services.<p>This approach leads you to the same destination, but with a lot less risk.

I see Twitter threads hosted on HN all the time, and I kind of wish more of the posters would link to Nitter&#x27;s public-facing instance instead of Twitter. I think its interface is just objectively better than Twitter&#x27;s for browsing.<p>Invidious is an Open Source alternative to Youtube that is also really good and requires zero Javascript, but unfortunately it suffers from a lot of performance problems and videos will occasionally refuse to load -- Youtube is I think more hostile about throttling&#x2F;blocking that kind of stuff, and proxying videos is probably harder than proxying tweets. You can donate to Invidious though, which might help them afford more powerful hardware.<p>In regards to Medium -- if you disable Javascript those popups will all vanish, and for the most part all you&#x27;ll be missing out on is comments and occasionally a lazy-loaded image. It&#x27;s amazing how much of the web (particularly news) works fine without Javascript, and getting rid of it gets rid of a lot of these annoying popups and requests. Use uMatrix, it makes it really easy to turn Javascript off by default and whitelist as necessary.

So she logged in to that account on her phone, using the newest Facebook app on a brand new phone, provided real name, birth date and photo, and linked a real phone number, never used before. She got permanently banned within a week, by just chatting on Messenger and sending friend requests on Facebook. I suspect some of her IRL friends reported the friend request they received.

The modern web really is becoming an unusable, user-hostile wasteland, and also is very slow, very complicated, very messy, etc. The web developer tools help a bit, at least, but not quite. But better configuration for web browser should also be better. (Of course, there are also some good web pages too, but they are making a lot of bad ones too.)<p>But (as another comment says) documents should not be apps; they are should be separate. (Although there is the case where sometimes you want to embed apps in documents, such as to make an interactive demonstration of some algorithm, or to include inline currency conversion, to validate or autocalculate a form, or whatever. But the document needs to be readable even if the code doesn&#x27;t run, and the code probably shouldn&#x27;t run by default. Also, I think such embedded apps should perhaps be separate frames even if enabled, and do not need to do as much stuff as is now exposed to JavaScript interfaces.)<p>The modern web is also overused.

So a 747 pilot can also fly 737s but not other commercial airliners. That&#x27;s a problem because if the new boeing isn&#x27;t a 737, existing pilots can&#x27;t fly it without giving up one of the other two.

I think that over the course of my research career, I&#x27;ve only visited the library twice.

It&#x27;s also signed by many more publishers than just the ACM.<p>&gt; Dear President Trump:<p>&gt; The undersigned organizations represent the leading publishers and non-profit scientific societies in the United States. We write to you with deep concern regarding a proposed policy that has come to our attention that would jeopardize the intellectual property of American organizations \nengaged in the creation of high-quality peer-reviewed journals and research articles and would \npotentially delay the publication of new research results. The role of the publisher is to advance \nscholarship and innovation, fostering the American leadership in science that drives our \neconomy and global competitiveness. As copyrighted works, peer-reviewed journal articles are \nlicensed to users in hundreds of foreign countries, supporting billions of dollars in U.S. exports \nand an extensive network of American businesses and jobs. In producing and disseminating these \narticles, we make ongoing competitive investments to support the scientific and technical \ncommunities that we serve.<p>&gt; As noted above, we have learned that the Administration may be preparing to step into the \nprivate marketplace and force the immediate free distribution of journal articles financed and \npublished by organizations in the private sector, including many non-profits. This would \neffectively nationalize the valuable American intellectual property that we produce and force us \nto give it away to the rest of the world for free. This risks reducing exports and negating many of \nthe intellectual property protections the Administration has negotiated with our trading partners.<p>&gt; We write to express our strong opposition to this proposal, but in doing so we want to underscore \nthat publishers make no claims to research data resulting from federal funding.<p>&gt; To be clear, publishers both support and enable “open access” business models and “open data” \nas important options within a larger framework that assumes critical publisher investments \nremain viable. Under a legacy regulation that is still in force today, proprietary journal articles \nthat report on federally funded research must be made available for free within 12 months of \npublication. This mandate already amounts to a significant government intervention in the \nprivate market. Going below the current 12 month “embargo” would make it very difficult for \nmost American publishers to invest in publishing these articles. As a consequence, it would place \nincreased financial responsibility on the government through diverted federal research grant \nfunds or additional monies to underwrite the important value added by publishing.<p>&gt; In the coming years, this cost shift would place billions of dollars of new and additional burden \non taxpayers. In the process, such a policy would undermine American jobs, exports, innovation, \nand intellectual property. It could also result in some scientific societies being forced to close \ntheir doors or to no longer be able to support the publication of U.S.-sponsored science that is \nkey to ensuring that the U.S. remains the world leader in science and technology.<p>&gt; In addition to financing and managing a world-leading peer review process, publishers make \nextensive investments in education, research, and innovative digital platforms that advance \nAmerican competitiveness and help ensure the quality and integrity of American science. \nUndermining the marketplace is unnecessary, counterproductive, and would significantly harm \nthe system of peer-reviewed scholarly communication that fuels America’s leadership in \nresearch and innovation.<p>&gt; We urge you to oppose this proposed policy, and we look forward to working with the \nAdministration on this matter."],"time":["2019-12-21 08:28:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["AmericanChopper"],"id":[21849994],"kids":[21850000,21850003,21850008],"parent":[21849935],"text":["Industry pushing back against Trump for doing something that is close to universally supported on HN.

Not to say there is no value in its OO-side (I still see some value there mostly pertaining to modules). But I just mean that not every language needs to aim to be a top 5 language.

With Scala you get the same stuff done with 20 people.<p>The people that hate Scala are either Java devs that didn&#x27;t get it because they wanted to write inheritance based OOP code and would still be bad devs in any other lang, or are hiring managers that struggled to get the right people.<p>This is actually an advantage when you have the right hiring process as you end up with better developers - they don&#x27;t need to know Scala, but need to be open minded to new ideas and motivated to learn.<p>With all that said, the church of FP and the hascalator community is a problem for Scala.

Moved on to better designed languages. Which are not hard to find.<p>There are a few big issues with Perl 5 but the biggest is easily the mess of references vs flat values. Python, Ruby, JavaScript and many other dynamic languages do not make the programmer think about whether you are going to pass a data structure like an array or hash as a reference or direct value. Perl does. A lot of built in operators expect direct values, eg array ops like join, push. This is because the ops existed before Perl added complex data structures — arrays of arrays, hashes of arrays, etc. References were bolted on in Perl 5 to support such structures. And any code using them will handle references not direct values. So you have a split.

Our app continues to be in great health and we continue to ship hundreds of times a day with a constant stream of features that our customers love [1]<p>Octane is a huge leap forward for Ember. Its APIs are extremely well designed, composable and cohesive. The new Glimmer components and @tracked properties have resulted in waves of negative diffs as we refactor parts of our app to Octane and, IMO, are an advancement in the state-of-the-art component state tracking &#x2F; reactive UI.<p>If you&#x27;ve tried Ember before and were turned off by some of its slightly weird APIs (computed properties, component APIs like tagName, classNames &amp; event handling, the ember object model), you should take a second look.<p>With Octane, Ember is a framework for rapidly building high quality web applications that will remaining healthy over time as the web platform and JS ecosystem rapidly changes.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;changes&#x2F;en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;changes&#x2F;en<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-21 00:35:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chancancode"],"id":[21848182],"kids":[21848688],"parent":[21848107],"text":["For those of you aren&#x27;t particularly interested in Ember or frontend development in general, here is a tidbit that may be of interest to you.<p>While revamping the tutorial[1] to showcase the new features and idioms, I worked on this tool[2] to automate the generation of the tutorial.<p>Every page of the tutorial you see is the output from markdown source files (like this one[3]) which contains executable instructions for the steps. The build[4] system will run these commands and edits the same way an end-user would, capture the output of the commands and put them in the tutorial. It also takes the screenshots by opening a real browser (via puppeteer) and navigating to the actual app that we are building as part of the tutorial.<p>All of these ensures that the tutorial content and screenshots are up-to-date with the latest blueprints (the files used by the generators), config files, etc, and that everything really works as-expected. It makes it much easier to maintain and QC the teaching materials, but also servers as a very useful end-to-end smoke test to ensure all the moving pieces in the ecosystem (including external components like npm, node, etc) are all working together.<p>Right now the tool and the tutorial content are in the same GitHub repo, but the code is actually written to be completely agnostic to Ember.js (or JS even). It just runs shell commands, edit files etc. My intention is to separate out the tool to its standalone thing, so more communities can benefit from this approach.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.emberjs.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.emberjs.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ember-learn&#x2F;super-rentals-tutorial&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ember-learn&#x2F;super-rentals-tutorial&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;ember-learn&#x2F;super-rentals-tutorial&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;markdown&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;part-1&#x2F;05-more-about-components.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;ember-learn&#x2F;super-rentals-...<\/a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ember-learn&#x2F;super-rentals-tutorial&#x2F;commit&#x2F;785115a55168b2871d76072a465b9acbfeb6e0c8&#x2F;checks?check_suite_id=367677990\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ember-learn&#x2F;super-rentals-tutorial&#x2F;commit...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-21 00:07:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sudders"],"id":[21848925],"kids":{},"parent":[21848107],"text":["We have been using Ember for the last 5 years, and have been continuously shipping new features and updates on a daily basis.

(I have 6 biggish apps that are still under active development today)<p>At the time — there was no router,   Ember.View was a thing, there were multiple types of views and controllers, JSON:API wasn’t a thing, ember-data was wild, etc.   Most of the contributions depended on tomhudakatzdale, as well as a number of other core contributors (dgeb, tchak, and others I’m leaving off — sorry!).  The framework frequently had breaking changes, patterns were moving around rapidly (we had to rewrite one of our pre 1.13 apps), it was a bit of a mess.  (Then again, at the time, a lot of other frameworks were in the same state.). I think these times gave Ember a bit of a bad rap.<p>The thing that stood out to me then, and still holds true today, is that the community has been committed to bringing in the best ideas forward in a community-driven way.  Even though much of the initial framework had growing pains, it was able to do a few significant things:  establish a community model for managing changes (RFC&#x2F;RFP process), delegate core responsibilities to a broader team of people (not based on corporate interests), create consistent release intervals, follow semantic versioning, establish json:api as a specification, and really take community feedback in as development priority &#x2F; direction.<p>Octane is the cultivated result of years of decision making by the community.

There are a lot of similarities between the two.<p>One thing that Aurelia are doing in Aurelia 2 is an option to shake it down to a tiny app. The problem with frameworks like Angular, Ember and Aurelia 1 is they ship a lot of code to the browser and startup time can be quite slow. In Aurelia 2 they&#x27;re working on quite a nice and promising AOT compiler. I really wish the Ember team would focus on bundle size, what I have seen with Octane, the bundles are huge.<p>My money is on Aurelia 2 when it launches in 2020, so it is nice to see Ember firing back as well, great timing given the recent State of JS survey yielded people are really frustrated with Angular."],"time":["2019-12-21 05:35:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["liketostayanon"],"id":[21848622],"kids":[21848825],"parent":[21848107],"text":["Like the decorator syntax for tracking observables.

I really didn&#x27;t realize it was so close! I&#x27;ve just today finished up what took me away from my Ember project.<p>Ember has been freakin&#x27; amazing to use, and Octane really, really, makes it shine. I love ember because it includes everything you need to manage state in your application, install and you&#x27;re ready to go. I don&#x27;t have to pick my view renderer, state&#x2F;history management, storage system, networking stack etc... I also don&#x27;t have to maintain the dependencies between them, like I would with something built using React.<p>Ember also favors convention over configuration; which, I find to be a godsend when visiting the world of JavaScript. Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit painful sometimes not knowing the convention, but that&#x27;s just good ol&#x27; fashion learning. I also think the opposite, configuration, is incredibly painful in JavaScript, because the ecosystem moves so fast.<p>The Ember team (and community) also have fixed, and continue to fix, a ton of issues from making module loading easier to better support of Typescript.<p>I&#x27;d like to give a few getting started tips for anyone about to jump in (as I did the same a few months ago):<p>* Glimmer templates give you nice HTML-esque looking components while separating the HTML from the JavaScript itself (which I like versus embedding it like JSX does)<p>* Use the decorators. Seriously, they&#x27;re awesome, they&#x27;re a MUST if you use typescript.<p>* Ember modifiers are really a big improvement over the previous hooks&#x2F;lifecycle management. It&#x27;s just the constructor and willDestory (I think), it also to me, makes it a lot easy to commit to ol&#x27; &quot;data down, actions up&quot; philosophy.<p>* Ember Concurrency [1] is a brilliant tool and can pretty much prevent any UI blocking you ever find yourself doing.<p>* Some things are automagically created for you unless you explicitly create them (with the right names) like the application controller and application router. Use the Ember debugger browser plugin to see what controllers and routes are being rendered if you&#x27;re at all unsure.<p>* Ember CSS modules [2] helped me quite a lot encapsulating css (and wiring it up correctly for that matter).<p>* Use Mirage [3] to mock out your data from the beginning, don&#x27;t hard code things you intend to query for later. You&#x27;ll have trouble, plus Mirage is super easy to use.<p>* Make sure guides you&#x27;re reading are relevant to the current version. Octane has been coming for a while so there&#x27;s a fair bit of information, it&#x27;s just something to be aware of (especially from results in google).<p>* If you&#x27;re reading an older article that&#x27;s relevant, but using older syntax try reading this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emberjs.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;26&#x2F;emberjs-native-class-update-2019-edition.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emberjs.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;26&#x2F;emberjs-native-class-upd...<\/a><p>This series of articles is also immensely helpful: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pzuraq.com&#x2F;coming-soon-in-ember-octane-part-1-native-classes&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pzuraq.com&#x2F;coming-soon-in-ember-octane-part-1-na...<\/a><p>Finally, I&#x27;ve found the Ember community to be incredibly nice and welcoming.

And I did them both differently.<p>I lucked into a situation with one product where basically a client needed a tool to do a job but it was something we had solved like 6 times in the past couple of years, so we knew there was a market for it.  So we did team up with him on it essentially.  He had no interest in the product part, just needed his problem solved, but he liked the idea of a discount on his dev fees.  So what we did is cut our dev fees to him (still covering our costs), he got a worldwide non-exclusive license to use the product but not to resell, and we kept the rights to resell.  So in the end, he got a product &amp; free support for a period of time (at a steep discount) and we got a money maker, not great money but real money.<p>The second time I just sucked it up and used off-time and down-time from consultants and myself to build the product.  While it took us much longer, and nearing launch we had to dedicate more time to it which meant me funding a couple of people full time (versus just down time hours), I would say I preferred this route.  It meant we didn&#x27;t have to compromise on features, or develop a feature we felt&#x2F;knew had no basis to be in the product. What I liked was we could focus on making a product first, which is hard to do when you are essentially solving someone else&#x27;s problem.  I&#x27;d do this route again over the other just for the simplicity, yes more risk, yes longer time to market, but much less of a compromise which you then turn around and spend months fixing later."],"time":["2019-12-20 14:31:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lefstathiou"],"id":[21851726],"kids":[21852034],"parent":[21842979],"text":["We bootstrapped our SaaS company.

Opinions about every little thing in the world.<p>Now I&#x27;m seeing that deconstructed in my dad. I stopped being able to talk to him about adult stuff some time ago. Science, politics, history.

What are the statistics around actual damage done by false positives from discretionary screening?  This is clearly a potential case, but obviously we won&#x27;t ever know for sure.<p>My immediate family has two cases in which discretionary screening did or could have potentially have changed outcomes.<p>First case, I had purchased a $20 glucometer off of Amazon to just test my blood sugar.  Device was stuffed in a drawer only to be found a year or two later.  I gathered the family &#x27;round to make a blood offering to medical science, and it turns out my youngest was over 2x the standard range.  Follow up the next day and same, take her to the endo and she has Type I diabetes.  The fact that it was detected before she went to the ER in full diabetic ketoacidosis was so unusual that I bet we told the &#x27;discovery&#x27; story 20 or more times to nurses, two endocrinologists, her primary care physician and the folks at Medtronic.  What the hell?  This is a $.50 test that has good specificity and selectivity for something being wrong. +1 for discretionary screening.<p>Second case, my wife was complaining of abdominal pain for a few months.  Her entire family hates going to doctors, but after much urging from me she heads to urgent care.  They send her away with basically nothing.  She develops a cough, goes back a month later, says the pain is from the cough and here is some cough medicine.  Another month goes by and we end up in the ER because urgent care is closed.  They do a CT and find softball sized masses on her ovaries.  Two days later she is diagnosed with stage 3C ovarian cancer.  Had someone taken the time to do an ultrasound or do her CA-125 tumor marker early on, this could have been detected sooner and possibly before she was stage 3.  Two years later we&#x27;re now probably a million dollars into medical treatments and she&#x27;s still in the thick of it.\n Again, in my estimation this is a +1 for discretionary screening.<p>The part that confuses me is that if you look at articles, papers and interviews with doctors, you&#x27;ll find what seems to be a prevailing attitude in the medical community that discretionary screening causes stress, over-treatment and negative outcomes.  Not only that, it happens so often that the benefits really need to be studied closely before any action is taken.  Then, of course, these studies fall behind treatment studies in priority and as far as I can tell, don&#x27;t get prioritized or completed.<p>My pet theory is that, in the US anyway, the medical community has an innate sense that there isn&#x27;t nearly enough capacity to handle all of the incoming cases that would result, and because you can&#x27;t blame a doctor for someone getting diabetes or cancer, they are off the hook.  I&#x27;ll stop short of saying it&#x27;s a conspiracy, but in my opinion there is clearly some parallel thinking going on.<p>Happy to be proven wrong, though.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s an example.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3873201&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3873201&#x2F;<\/a><p>Summary of four large scale ovarian cancer screening trials &gt;20K participants starting as early as 1987.

Reading through this it seems the perfect is the enemy of the good, and it&#x27;s extremely frustrating.  At $40 per TVS and $50 per CA-125, my wife&#x27;s treatment so far could pay for 40 years of screening for 250 women."],"time":["2019-12-21 17:06:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["herodotus"],"id":[21851779],"kids":[21852950],"parent":[21850993],"text":["This article is paywalled.

All the concepts of SDR are straightforward and fairly intuitive, but it&#x27;s the software stack and actually using the tools that&#x27;s hard.  The whole field is niche enough that you end up stubbing your toe with every step you take in that world.<p>Googling around and trying to figure out where to even begin comes up with so many fragmented, unhelpful pieces of information.  You either end up being pointed at Gnu Radio, which amounts to an incomprehensible behemoth for a newbie, or you find the numerous lighter weight pieces of software which aren&#x27;t very clear on what exactly they&#x27;re good for and are often unmaintained.<p>Luckily my first project was rather simple; ceiling fan remotes don&#x27;t exactly use the most advanced protocols.  Once I found CubicSDR and fiddled around with it enough I was able to dump the radio signals to an audio file and just tease the rest out in Audacity.
