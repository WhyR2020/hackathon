Google provides a free service and in return gets a view into your traffic. Very fair point, but not terribly controversial IMHO<p><pre><code>  It’s a bloated script that affects your site speed\n<\/code><\/pre>\nUm, not really. I&#x27;m a big web performance advocate but 45.7KB of JS is small for the service provided. You do not need to use Google Tag Manager either so if you care you can reduce the JS footprint to 18KB.<p><pre><code>  It’s overkill for the majority of site owners\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYes. I&#x27;d agree with this. You probably do not need it if you are not a business.(Given the source of this point I&#x27;m guessing they do not offer most of the features of GA)<p><pre><code>  It’s a liability considering GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations\n<\/code><\/pre>\nHard disagree. You can limit PII in GA to large degree like not gathering full IP address, and reduce logging.<p>If GA is your only reason to have a Consent option then fine, its a burden to do. However if you have any other analytics or services that use cookies its a minor check-list item to cover this.<p><pre><code>  It uses cookies so you must obtain consent to store cookies\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThey are repeating their previous claim in a  different form here... skipping.<p><pre><code>  It’s blocked by many plugins and browsers so the data is not very accurate\n<\/code><\/pre>\nTechnically correct, but you don&#x27;t need highly accurate data to make product decisions. GA does sampling after a certain threshold anyway.<p><pre><code>  It requires an extensive privacy policy\n<\/code><\/pre>\nNo. It does not. You should acknowledge it and talk about why you use GA and you can link to GA&#x27;s privacy policy. Plenty of boilerplate text you can copy to cover this if you really care.<p><pre><code>  It’s abused by referral spam that skews the data\n<\/code><\/pre>\nMaybe your experience if different but this is hardly a problem worth noting. Certainly not a GA specific issue.<p><pre><code>  It’s a proprietary product so you need to put your trust in Google\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYeah. Same with any service you use, but ok.<p><pre><code>  It worsens the user experience due to the necessity for the annoying prompts\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAgain, most 3rd-party services on your site mean you need to go this path.

Here&#x27;s some more context:<p>I&#x27;m Mike, co-founder at Zapier and head of Zapier Labs. Today our Labs team is launching a public version of Zappy: a fast, free screen capture tool that we built for our remote team. At Zapier, we have 300+ teammates working from across the globe with no central office—we&#x27;ve been fully remote since day one. We&#x27;ve learned that increasing communication bandwidth is crucial when you&#x27;re working remotely.<p>I wanted a tool for screenshots&#x2F;GIFs to supplement apps like Slack, but nothing on the market had the mix of speed and features we were looking for. So, built it internally. Zappy is a cornerstone of how we work at Zapier, nearly everyone at Zapier uses Zappy every week (voluntarily)! And we want to share it.<p>Why share now? People around the world just experienced a sudden shift to remote work—and we know life sans-office comes with unique challenges. We want to share our experience and make that transition a little easier.<p>Our goal with Zappy was to provide a screen capture experience that was so fast, people would actually want to use it to communicate. To capture something, you hit a keyboard shortcut, draw a square, and press enter. Zappy copies the image to your clipboard so you can paste it anywhere (or provides a path to your GIF&#x2F;video).<p>You can draw annotations, record a selfie view, and stitch shots together. Captures support image, GIF, and MP4 formats. One of my favorite features is being able to grab past captures from the Mac menu bar, instead of digging through folders.<p>We&#x27;re working on more features, too, like self-hosted captures on S3, sharing permissions, and a Zapier integration. :-)<p>Zappy is free to download and use for anyone (you&#x27;ll need a free Zapier account to log in once). And, for paid Zapier customers, you&#x27;ll get free capture hosting while it&#x27;s in early access.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and ideas. I hope you find Zappy useful!"],"time":["2020-04-08 20:36:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chelmertz"],"id":[22815565],"kids":[22818839,22816325,22816509,22818107,22816434],"parent":[22815227],"text":["If you&#x27;re looking for a Linux alternative, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flameshot.js.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flameshot.js.org&#x2F;<\/a> (which I invoke with the print screen key).

It&#x27;s about correctness. People have been quick to make the comparison between storage and compute cost. The high cost of development and bug-fixing time trumps both of them by an order of magnitude. The guarantee of referential-integrity alone that SQL offers helps eradicate an entire class of bugs for your application with no added effort. This article glosses so blithely over this critical caveat. Whenever this discussion comes up I&#x27;m quick to refer back to the yardstick of &quot;Does your application have users?

On the other hand, top-level evaluation rules are often glossed over, and seem to mess up this elegance. I feel like there is a set of braces missing at top level, for s-expression concept to be complete. I don&#x27;t really know enough about specific rules or reasoning why they need to be introduced. My mental model of top-level execution is an implicit `(do ...)` block. In rest of clojure code the `do` is a special form that is frowned upon because it is used only when side-effects are necessary.<p>As it is, the &#x27;module&#x27; concept is strictly tied to a file, which feels unnecessary. If top-level was enclosed in braces and evaluated with same rules as the rest of s-expressions, maybe we could move away from concept of files and, for example, store our code in a graph database. This would allow for IDEs that can collapse and expand code tree as needed.<p>Rich Hickey uses expression &#x27;place oriented programming&#x27; as derogatory term (PLOP) for relying on exact memory addresses as places for our data. It would seem to me that same term would apply to our coding practices - we tie code implementation to specific locations inside files on disk. This seems like accidental complexity that introduces mental burden. If location of implementation could be divorced from specific location inside specific source file, we could concentrate on implementation that is always in context where code is actually used.<p>Is there any decent discussion of such concepts, or some other language that explores such direction?

It’s precise, but its eagerness can lead to prohibitive storage requirements (combinatorial explosion is very easy to achieve, and now you must store every computed state, not just the wrapping and the data) and cost of editing if the change has to propagate far (e.g. if you put a list of the five most recent blog posts in a sidebar of a site, making a new blog post now requires that <i>every single page<\/i> be regenerated). Also it’s conceptually more difficult to get right—doing no caching is far, far easier.<p>Pull caching: responses are generated on demand and cached for typically a limited time, meaning that you may serve stale data for up to your cache lifetime. But the laziness (that it doesn’t generate everything possible) works in its favour for many situations.<p>Hybrids are possible. Your cache may have the ability to programmatically invalidate entries, so that if you can calculate which pages <i>would<\/i> need to be regenerated, you can tell the cache, supplanting time-based caching and potentially yielding the most database-efficient result (no extraneous content generated, but pages cached exactly as long as they will be valid).<p>Build pipelines like Make are similar: you pull by specifying the resource you require, but its validity is determined by the dependency tree, and the tool essentially pushes things, materialising the necessary resources, until the requested resource is complete.<p>Push caching has an elegance that pull caching lacks (and I much prefer it, when feasible), but there <i>are<\/i> reasons why it’s not the standard model of the web any more. It’s tougher to implement well, and has scaling limits that can constrain your design.<p>----<p>As a practical application of this: in the article itself, it speaks of the reduced costs and better scaling of the static approach. But it doesn’t take into account the possibility that you generated a bunch of pages that weren’t ever requested (e.g. everyone read the blog post about widgets, but no one opened the list of posts tagged “widgets”, even though you had gone to the trouble of generating it), and so could easily have made more requests than you would have if you had instead had regular pull-based caching in place."],"time":["2020-04-08 16:56:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ealexhudson"],"id":[22812404],"kids":[22816408,22812569],"parent":[22812032],"text":["To be honest, if you dynamically generate a site and include the relevant headers, a web cache in front of the site will do all the &quot;compilation&quot; without any of the headache of a specific ahead-of-time process.<p>If you get a really large site (= in terms of pages), it&#x27;s often easier to invalidate an entire cache and allow it to rebuild lazily than go through and linearly reprocess every page, and you don&#x27;t get any examples of pages having both &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; content as you browse the site while republishing is taking place (although you can also accomplish this with content-switching once the full rebuild was done)."],"time":["2020-04-08 14:47:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["siscia"],"id":[22813949],"kids":[22815725,22814176],"parent":[22812032],"text":["I am quite deep into this idea of static website and I had a little of experience building one ( now defunct ) and I provide tools targeted to static website developers ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simplesql.redbeardlab.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simplesql.redbeardlab.com<\/a> )<p>The experience of creating one with python and netlify was superb, you just push out all the pages that you need and you call it done.

You would need years of follow-up of recovered patients to even be able to test the hypothesis.

They remained out of the wild until 1998, when 11 wolves raised under a captive breeding program run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were released in the mountains of eastern Arizona.<p>Since then, the Mexican gray wolf has been on an upward trajectory—reaching a record 163 in the Southwest in 2019, 24% higher than the previous year and the 10th straight year of increases, according to the Mexican Wolf Interagency Field Team, a task force of various government agencies.<p>Federal wildlife officials say the higher numbers come after recovery efforts that have included placing captive-born pups in dens to be raised by wild adults and expanding areas where the animals are released. The wolves now mostly inhabit a mountainous region on the border of Arizona and New Mexico, living in 42 different packs.<p>“This is really encouraging news at a time when we all need some encouraging news,” said Bryan Bird, Southwest program director for Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental advocacy group. “It’s a pleasant surprise to see the population increase by this much.”<p>But ranchers in the region say the wolves have decimated their herds, taking down hundreds of calves and other livestock over the past two decades. “They have had a catastrophic impact on ranchers in the wolf recovery zone,” said Caren Cowan, executive director of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association. “One rancher reports losing a cow or calf every other day.”<p>Ms. Cowan and other advocates for ranchers have argued for limited hunts of the wolves and higher payments by the federal government for the loss of a cow or calf.<p>“If they could hunt the wolf, it would change their behavior,” Ms. Cowan said. But environmentalists say the Mexican gray wolf numbers remain far too low for that.<p>Should the Mexican gray wolf be taken off the endangered species list? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.<p>Mr. Bird said environmentalists have worked with ranchers to come up with techniques to deter wolves, such as having hired riders chase them off—but Ms. Cowan said many of those are ineffective.<p>“Generally, the Mexican gray wolf has become identity politics,” Mr. Bird said. “You get the entrenched camps on both sides of the issue.”<p>The conflict reflects the tensions that have played out in the northern Rocky Mountains since a related species, gray wolves, were reintroduced there in 1995. The predator’s population has grown to more than 1,500, expanded their range across much of the Pacific Northwest and wreaked so much damage to livestock that hunting seasons have been opened in states including Idaho and Wyoming.<p>Even with their resurgence, the Mexican gray wolves are in a far more tenuous position, wildlife biologists say. One threat they face is inbreeding, because their numbers are so concentrated geographically, Mr. Bird said.<p>As a result, he and other advocates are pushing for federal authorities to relocate the wolves in more dispersed locations, such as northern Arizona and the southern Rockies of New Mexico."],"time":["2020-04-08 22:27:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["vgq"],"id":[22814562],"kids":[22816320,22814620],"parent":[22802462],"text":["I live in a European country where the eco-dictators [1] go to extensive lengths to protect wolves.

From everything I&#x27;ve know to date, the absolute normal, standard thing is that yes, being sick with something viral that doesn&#x27;t cause your death gives you at least a certain period of months or usually years of immunity to it unless it mutates enough to re-attack without being recognized immediately. Is this not correct? For smallpox it applied, for chicken pox it does, for measles it mostly does for many years, likewise for many viruses for which there are vaccines. We even get immunity from the flu once we&#x27;ve had it for at least some months to a year or two.

So if you have a very serious or life-threatening infection you can apply to the FDA for what&#x27;s called emergency investigational drug application and you can get convalescent serum, which means serum from someone who&#x27;s recovered from the infection, is checked to make sure there&#x27;s nothing else -- no other viruses -- in it, and it can be given to you and we know from previous experience with other infections that this can work.<\/i><p>Rich Condit: <i>The idea here is that someone who has recovered from the disease has antibodies to the virus, in this particular case the SARS-CoV-2, and so if you give them intravenously this preparation that has these antibodies in it, presumably that can latch on to virus that&#x27;s infecting you and those pathogen antibody complexes will be disposed of appropriately in your body.  This what&#x27;s called, comes under the general umbrella of passive immunization, which you&#x27;re giving antibodies from some other source which will last you for some period of time and it can be up to weeks or months, actually (we&#x27;ve been through this before), as opposed to active immunization where you mount your own.<\/i><p>Racaniello: <i>Rich, you had some correspondence with Ed Niles.  Why don&#x27;t you...<\/i><p>Condit: <i>Yeah, he&#x27;s obsessed with this. [laughter] Ah.. let me see here, we haven&#x27;t highlighted this but I&#x27;ll clip through it.  This came to me, I forwarded it to everybody.  &quot;I listened to the first part of TWiV today, through the passive transfer comments,&quot; passive transfer being what we were just talking about, passive immunization, &quot;It was claimed that passive transfer was first used in Lhasa in 1968.  Smallpox docs shouldn&#x27;t be short-changed in this regard.  VIG, which is vaccinia immunoglobilin, was used a decade earlier.  I went to a meeting in 2009 where several smallpox docs talked about their experiences trying a host of putative anti-pox drugs and the impact on their patients.  One had tears recalling the impact treating sick patients with untested and unproven drugs.  I understand the urge to try something, but there are limits.&quot;<\/i><p>Condit:  <i>Ok.  So Ed, as background, worked for BARDA for a while.  I forget what the acronym stands for, but it&#x27;s a government agency that was born out of the...<\/i><p>Alan Dove:  <i>I think it was Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Agency, or something like that.<\/i><p>Condit: <i>There you go.  And, he, so he saw a lot of grants having to do with smallpox, anti-pox viral drugs and etc, so he&#x27;s pretty up on this, and the vaccinia immunoglobilin would be part of that.  He&#x27;s referring to the 60&#x27;s and before when the global smallpox eradication campaign went forward, and one of the things that was used was the vaccinia immunoglobilin.  VIG is, was, prepared by two companies under contract with the US government from pooled serum taken from vaccinies, mostly military at this point.  We have 100,000 doses in the stockpile.  However, 25 doses have been used in some cases to clear vaccination complications.  Provides a link to an article which provides some background for the practicalities of preparing and using coronavirus immunoglobilin if we get to that.  &quot;It helped remind me of what we were thinking about 15 years ago.  Seems like a lifetime.  On another note, pooled monoclonal antibodies have proven to be effective against pox viruses in animal models.  Unfortunately this is an expensive way to go,&quot; and suggest contacting our friend Mike Bershlinsky (sp?) for looking in more detail.  He attached an article from an old friend of ours, Rico Wittick (sp?), since deceased.  It summarizes the prep and use of vaccinia immunoglobilin over the decades.  Ok.  So this is like a review.  He correctly refers to a handful of reported anecdotal applications of vaccinia immunoglobilin against smallpox.  &quot;I don&#x27;t know that true controlled studies have been done at this point.  By 2011 there were none, even with the compassionate uses of vaccinia immunoglobilin ST-246,&quot; which is, was, an experimental anti-pox drug, now approved, &quot;and Senovavir.  It was never clear which, if any of them had a positive effect.  You need controlled trials.  In each case the patient cleared and survived.  Controlled studies are hard to come by.  So I&#x27;m not a big fan of VIG, vaccinia immunoglobilin, and if anyone wants an antibody approach to SARS-CoV-2 they may as well go directly to monoclonals and do the right set of studies.  Of course this will take time.  Alternatively, if you have other tools in the toolbox, maybe a convalescent serum study is warranted.  Any volunteers?  Keep the faith.&quot;<\/i><p>Racaniello: <i>Well, that&#x27;s exactly what the FDA is doing.  They are doing a convalescent antibody study in case, for prevention.  The emergency use is not for prevention, it&#x27;s for very sick people.<\/i><p>Dove: <i>Right.<\/i><p>Racaniello: <i>Because.. So, Brianne, what could go wrong if you gave someone anti... SARS-CoV-2 antibodies?<\/i><p>Brianne Barker: <i>Well, if we are imagining that there are no other viruses and nothing else there, there are some situations where antibodies and antigens can bind together and get sort of stuck in places, like in some cappilaries and some areas of the skin and kidney and lead to something that in class I call a type-3 hypersensitivity reaction, but really it&#x27;s something called serum sickness or it&#x27;s kind of similar to farmer&#x27;s lung that we see in a few different people.  So sometimes we can see some issues there where people will make a response to those antibodies that they&#x27;re getting from other people, because they are technically foreign proteins that you are injecting in to someone.<\/i><p>[1] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-594&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-594&#x2F;<\/a> (about 23 minutes in to the program)"],"time":["2020-04-08 19:21:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jusmakingapost"],"id":[22813850],"kids":[22813918],"parent":[22813679],"text":["Is this how we get zombies?

In most cases, the first Musth lasts significantly shorter in individuals, in older animals the average is two to three months. Some bulls come in Musth once a year, others more frequently. There is no preferred season, so Musth bulls can appear all year round.

ADHD researcher Dr Russell Barkley links Vygotsky’s theories of childhood development to the mechanism by which ADHD interferes with executive function [0]. An ADHD brain would be less capable of imagining things and holding those images, which would lead to failure in development of self-directed action via those imagined images. Is this ”aphantasia”? I’m not sure, but I find it plausible.<p>The prevalence for ADHD has been cited at 5% in children and half of that in adults. A commenter here says aphantasia has been guessed to be at 1-3% [1], which would be a rough match. Another commenter describes their ADHD and aphantasia [2], and I am under the impression this has been reported often. If there was a causal relation I would expect to see these kinds of overlaps in the data, but it’s really the researcher’s description of a failure of imagination that makes this hypothesis especially interesting to me.<p>What do you think?

Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C&#x2F;T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes."],"time":["2020-04-08 16:27:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Jugurtha"],"id":[22811741],"kids":{},"parent":[22810639],"text":["Can you put the desired action and the solution in the first sentence, then back it up in the rest of the post?<p>The post has an academic style, and academia optimizes for <i>writing<\/i> articles, not for the articles to be <i>read<\/i> or impact the world.<p>If you rub a lamp and a genie appears, better get to the point."],"time":["2020-04-08 12:47:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["saadalem"],"id":[22821884],"kids":{},"parent":[22810639],"text":["You&#x27;re most likely not going to get a response from an email or a tweet.
