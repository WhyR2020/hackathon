The advancement of knowledge is now secondary to economic growth in a university.  Students begin as customers and turn into products by graduation.  Universities used to be gatekeepers to better economic opportunities but those opportunities have disappeared.  This is a relatively recent phenomenon in that Baby Boomers don&#x27;t have the student loan obligations that generations following them do.  Boomers changed the policies to suit their own financial interests, destroying the opportunities that they benefited by for future generations.  Massive student loan debt constrains major life decisions and limits access to credit.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to navigate life when you don&#x27;t carry inescapable debt burdens.  Government refused to limit access to credit and that allowed universities to constantly charge more every year.  You can&#x27;t escape student loan debt as you can business loans by declaring bankruptcy because of a fundamentally flawed logic about what the student loan enabled.  Higher education is an economic investment.  Yet, when the investment fails, the lenders aren&#x27;t exposed to the losses -- the borrowers are.

In the mid-1980s I shared a campus with some incredibly capable students (several have appeared in HN stories), granted with many who weren&#x27;t.  There were on-campus events, issues, and politics.  There were faculty, emeriti, and visiting lecturers who were notable in their fields, including more than a few recognisable names.  At least some of whom were patient enough to talk to a clueless undergrad for an hour or so.  The arts &amp; lecture series gave access to principle minds and creators.  I discovered the on-campus library with a collection in the millions of volumes, part of a multi-campus system numbering in the tens of millions, indexed (though not directly accessible then) via an at-the-time groundbreaking computerised catalogue system -- a preview of DuckDuckGo-like search engines of today.  And through the campus computing centre, free use of a shared Unix system, also with multi-campus connectivity, and access not only to such stunning tools as csh, vi, sed, awk, and troff, but email, ftp, and tin.<p>All of this (and more) has shaped who I am, how I think, and what I value today.<p>None of this appears in my (mediocre) grades, transcrpts, or degrees.

Today&#x27;s Internet ... makes a significant part of this experience far more generally possible, though there is still a tremendous element of being in the same space with someone, or a group, or access to physical infrastructure, equipment, and environment that online experience can still not match.<p>And the system in which I&#x27;d participated evolved out of a long train of policy decisions, backlashes, many quite political:  Thatcher-Reagan conservativism, 1970s eco-awareness and peace movements, 1960s Sputnik-fuelled space-race and nuclear techno-FOMO and -optimism, civil rights, and university expansion, RAND-UCLA Arpanet, 1950s anticommunism, 1940s Vannevar Bush endless frontier government-funded research, early 20th century industrial and energy monopoly funded endowments, late-19th century majors systems, mid-19th century engineering polytechnical schools and land-grant&#x2F;agricultural policies, the Prussian university model, Enlightenment, the Encyclopaedists, the classical university system, liberal &amp; mechanical arts,the Renaissance and emergence of the university, scholasticism, mediaeval and earlier philosp[hical traditions ....

History always provides such people.<p>But reusing old successfully is the thing you need crafty witches and wizards for, and they usually only reveal themselves when a dragon shows up and needs a talking-to.<p>In this case, the dragon is that tendency to push information towards a model of legibility by the state and for the populace to in turn aim to be inscrutable, a back and forth that has occurred throughout history. Sometimes this shapes spatial life, as with the story of medieval taxation based on the number of windows in the house. At other times it uses political theory and precedent to assert rights. Here we have the opportunity to be inscrutable by a rather direct escape from the norm, simply using some less popular alternative.<p>This is a crisis mostly in the sense that we still crave to have a popular, inclusive, fast-moving discussion while being inscrutable to power, and you can&#x27;t square that circle so easily. Rather, you have to look towards gradual redefinitions of reality and possibility to counter normalization. This is necessarily a slower process than simple surveillance and seizure.<p>With respect to the Web, it&#x27;s clear enough that it was built with holes in it, and much of the resulting stack was further distorted in turn. Why? Because it was a new thing -  and evolved defenses as it went along.<p>But now it is an old thing, and as a popularizer of concept has succeeded wildly. The concept is what we&#x27;ll probably use, and the specific tech only in parts."],"time":["2020-05-01 04:52:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dvt"],"id":[23027397],"kids":[23027803,23027481,23031985,23028023,23027427,23030798],"parent":[23026998],"text":["&gt; How do you put this genie back in the bottle?<p>You don&#x27;t.

All is not lost, not by a long shot. In fact I wrote an article about exactly how to do it last year: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-a-web-that-lost-its-way-can-find-a-new-one\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-a-web-that-lost-its-way-c...<\/a><p>This is just how things work in the early stages before open source alternatives. Look at videoconferencing. Zoom grew a lot in the past couple months. Facebook got in the game. Now Google.<p>Large corporations running the infrastructure to connect us and mediate our interactions. This is how it’s been from the beginning. It’s the first stage. Like we had with America Online &#x2F; MSN &#x2F; Compuserve.<p>But eventually organizations want to host their own software and own their own brand, database, relationships and so on. Maybe customize the experience and integrate it into their website.<p>In fact the Web itself came and replaced AOL and others with an open protocol (HTTP) where anyone can permissionlessly set up their own domain and host their own website.<p>The Feudalism of rentseeking corporations has been replaced with a free market of hosting companies, and trillions of dollars in wealth were unleashed.<p>Today, Wordpress plays that role for Web 1.0 (publishing) powering 34% of all websites. But what is out there that will power even Web 2.0 ... namely all the social networking and interactions we have come to expect from Facebook, Google, Telegram etc.?<p>Web browsers already have all the front end capabilities including Web Push notifications and WebRTC videoconferencing and even PaymentRequest for payments etc.<p>There just needs to be a platform that lets people take ready-made components, like wordpress plugins, but Web 2.0 (chatrooms, events, etc.) that are all based around the same standardized unified core (user accounts, permissions, etc.) and are user friendly enough.<p>That’s basically an operating system. For example before MacOS&#x2F;Windows developers all built their own buttons&#x2F;menus&#x2F;windows etc. Before UNIX people built their own file management etc.<p>These OSes standardized the layer 1 so developers can just use standard buttons and reason on higher layers. Developers of Photoshop for Windows did not have to implement custom menus and buttons. And because of the standardized components, the users across apps were used to a common language, they knew what buttons and menus did, and even if the app used a custom version it had to be close enough to be recognizable.<p>So in this same way we need a social operating system for the web. Like Wordpress for Web 2.0 — open source and let anyone build their own Facebook or Google Meet out of reusable components. Ideally the core should be all designed together, like BSD, so the underlying OS is a good extensive foundation and not a hodgepodge of components.<p>Ok. Hopefully you take the below as a “Show HN”<p>We built it over the last 10 years and we’re giving it away:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Qbix&#x2F;Platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Qbix&#x2F;Platform<\/a><p>We are still working on updating the documentation tob be as cool as for Angular and React. But it’s more than those frameworks. It includes a PHP backend with MySQL (pluggable) database support, with Node.js optional for websockets realtime updates and offline notifications to apple&#x2F;google&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;etc. On the front end it has integrations with Cordova for releasing native apps in the store, such as <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yang2020.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yang2020.app<\/a><p>Just as an example if you wanted to build videoconferencing into your website, you would just do:<p><pre><code>  Q.Streams.WebRTC.start(options)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt’s as simple as that. And if you want to have a secure user signup, forgot password, account management you just do:<p><pre><code>  Q.Users.login(options)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIf you wanted to have events and schedule videoconferencing for various apps you build (eg group dating or collaboration) you would use<p><pre><code>  Q.Calendars.addToCalendar()<\/code><\/pre>\nReusable tools are placed like this:\n  Q.activate(\n    Q.Tool.setUpElement(\n      element,\n      “Streams&#x2F;chat”,\n      options\n    );\n  );<p>or with jQuery:<p><pre><code>  $(element).tool(name)\n  .activate(options)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYou can have tools and subtools and pass options similar to React etc. Our goal is to build a growing ecosystem of well tesed reusable components that anyone can use, even if they are not very technical.\nCheck out the GitHub link. And especially the videos there. It’s totally free and open source. You can build something like Yang2020 in a day. We are using it for our clients, who want custom work done.<p>If you run into a snag or want to ask anything, just hit me up at greg at the domain qbix.com<p>Finally... if you are a PHP or JS developer, and want to contribute to the project, please first try to install it yourself and play with with it. (We have tutorials but we are making more.) And email me. We have lots of clients who want these custom online communities right now, and we are looking to equip developers in diff countries to build them using this platform.<p>Oh and last thing... it’s interoperable with everything else so you’re not locked in. You can take a wordpress site that uses React and drop a chatroom or videoconference in there and gradually start to build community features, an app in the store and reward people for inviting others etc."],"time":["2020-04-30 06:25:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["querez"],"id":[23028033],"kids":[23028251],"parent":[23026998],"text":["I disagree with both of the conclusion in this article.<p>1. Contact tracing is just a necessary evil, and I for one am fairly happy with the way Big Tech has handled this. Many nations in the EU preferred a centralized approach so they could follow the epidemiological development of covid-19. It was Apple &amp; Google who in the end decided that &quot;nope, not doing that&quot;, thus dictating a more privacy-preserving way of doing this. Likely because it&#x27;s in their interest to have this app&#x2F;data-collection being as privacy-preserving as possible, to avoid the type of FUD that this article is trying to disseminate. If you accept that contact tracing is necessary, then what we are currently seeing is actually the best possible scenario for preserving everyone&#x27;s privacy and the web&#x27;s openness. I&#x27;m all ears for better approaches. What would YOU have the smartphone producer&#x27;s do?<p>2. This brings me to the next point: censorship. It&#x27;s tricky. Not just in this instance, but in general in the current development. Personally, I&#x27;m seeing more and more that an entirely &quot;open web&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work out so well due to all the misinformation we&#x27;re disseminating, and something&#x27;s got to give. The example the article is citing is a very good one, I think the conclusion that are drawn in the article are wrong:<p>&gt; They were sharing their observations, and opinions. Right or wrong, is not the point.<p>In my opinion, this is EXACTLY the point! A medical doctor who uses his authority to spread what he thinks is the right message, but goes against what most informed scientists consider correct, is EXACTLY spreading misinformation. The same way we&#x27;re seeing this with anti-vax, homeopathy, chem-trails or whatever other nonsense: Yes, science is a discourse, but the right way of discussing is within the scientific community. So you don&#x27;t call a press conference to spread your observations -- especially if the implications of you being wrong are so dire. You write a paper (NEJM is publishing a lot of discussion-pieces these days, why not send it there, to reach the medical audience?) or maybe as a first step you call your friendly epidemiologists and talk it over with them. Given the circumstances, removing this video was absolutely the right call.<p>With that said, I agree that this is a much, much, much larger problem. Given how important Youtube, Facebook and Twitter are in disseminating information, it is concerning that they can pick what they want to publicize&#x2F;suppress (often w&#x2F;o chance of recourse to the censored). To me, this is one of the biggest issues we have in our current times. I hope we&#x27;ll be able to find good solutions. But given the current situation we&#x27;re in (not just Covid19, also populism and targeted misinformation), censoring might be a necessary first step to fight our way out."],"time":["2020-04-30 08:33:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["railing1650"],"id":[23062949],"kids":{},"parent":[23026998],"text":["So a nobel prize winning scientist giving his opinion is banned?\nKeep bending over buddy..<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23062531\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23062531<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-04 02:03:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["notadev"],"id":[23028265],"kids":{},"parent":[23026998],"text":["iTs OnLy cEnSoRsHiP wHeN tHe GoVeRnMeNt DoEs iT"],"time":["2020-04-30 09:14:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cryptica"],"id":[23028169],"kids":{},"parent":[23026998],"text":["&gt; I love free markets.<p>I think the author means that he loves the unfair markets which benefited him personally.

You add and add until the marginal cost of another ad&#x2F;hire&#x2F;whatever matches the marginal gain. It makes total sense for the charity to do this, but as a potential donor, now less of your dollars go to the thing you care about and more go to admin, advertisers, etc. It&#x27;s like friction in the system.

Your parent node also serves as a package manager for your vm(?).<p>- This system allows network nodes to ostracize branches of the network of ill-repute, in order to incentivize parents to &#x27;disown&#x27; bad actors, as well as good clients to transfer to parents that don&#x27;t vouch for bad actors.<p>- your vm is just that.

AMA.<p>It&#x27;s very disappointing to see all of the knee-jerk reactions about urbit here.<p>I bought my galaxy from Tlon a couple of years ago before Curtis left the project.  I don&#x27;t know Curtis, only met him once for a brief lunch.  I used to browse his blog, and honestly found it thought-provoking but ultimately wrong.  To say that I don&#x27;t share his political and philosophical views would be an understatement.<p>And yet, I find that the structure of the Urbit network means that it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I have my galaxy and I can do what I want with it, which will definitely at times not be what Tlon wants me to do with it, and if you are a planet or a star under my galaxy and you don&#x27;t like it you can move to another.  There are 255 other galaxies and 64,999 other stars.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the criticism of this being digital feudalism. I mean, if you want to call a planet a &quot;peasant&quot;, and you want to say that stars and galaxies are some sort of feudal lord, then okay, but specifically what do you mean? As opposed to Facebook, or Google, as a galaxy owner I don&#x27;t have your data, can&#x27;t look at your traffic, and can&#x27;t monetize your personal information.  I can&#x27;t spam you.  The only thing I can do is block you, and in five minutes you can switch over to another galaxy.  As long as there is one independent galaxy out of 256, then every person on the network can switch over to that galaxy.  There&#x27;s no monopoly power here unless you own all 256 galaxies, which would basically amount to a failure of the whole system and frankly I don&#x27;t see how that could happen.  I&#x27;m not selling mine.<p>There is also a lot of criticism about selling address space.  Well, of course there are 4 billion addresses, and at $10 a piece, that&#x27;s a lot of money some day if the network succeeds. But if the network succeeds, we are talking about a new Internet, and I think $40 billion is modest.  It&#x27;s also important to be clear that for everyone who bought address space already, we certainly didn&#x27;t pay $10 per address, so Tlon isn&#x27;t laughing all the way to the bank.  And as a galaxy holder, I&#x27;m figuring that planet prices go down and maybe go as low as five dollars each or free as a loss leader.  The money will be made in providing hosting and value added services on top of the network, and what exactly is wrong with that?  Right now, OS1 has a built-in blog application, a chat application, a slack clone, and a reddit clone.  Short on features, sure, but if all of that isn&#x27;t worth a one time fee of $5, then I would argue you&#x27;re just being a stubborn polemicist.<p>I&#x27;m also a critic of the tendency to be obscure.  Curtis&#x27; trollishness, without a doubt comes out in the programming language.  Again, I don&#x27;t really care.  I don&#x27;t know Hoon.  Maybe i&#x27;ll learn it at some point.  Hoon school classes are constantly full.  People will learn it.  For those who don&#x27;t want to, there will be APIs, so that I can write in my native language.  That&#x27;s totally possible, and the whole thing is open source.<p>Finally, the whole &quot;I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it argument&quot; is not unique to Urbit.  Yes, the documentation needs to be improved. Yes the sign-up process needs to be improved.  That is priority #1 from the team.  But really, how easy is linux to use?  In my opinion, not. I&#x27;ve been a mediocre developer for 10 years, and I still can&#x27;t maintain my own box. I set up a server 10 years ago, and I went to set up that same server, with the same software today, and running the same commands doesn&#x27;t give me the same thing.  All new versions, with all new dependencies, some of them conflict.  I break out in cold sweats every time I have to do a security update or upgrade, afraid that everything is going to break.  The only thing to do is learn the new magic phrases to make the box do exactly what I want it to do.  For me Linux is totally opaque, obscure, and I&#x27;ve given up on understanding it.<p>I am assured by the team, and I believe them, that we will have easy, non technical installation and hosting by the end of the year.<p>And that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m excited about Urbit.  It&#x27;s an IOS and app store that I own and control 100%.  It&#x27;s a VPS that (soon) will just work, that maintains itself, that keeps my data under my control.  It&#x27;s a merciful exit from this horrible, dare I say it, feudalistic system in which the lords of FB, Google, and the like own and use (abuse) my data as they please.<p>So, I get it if you have impressions of the project based on how it was two or five years ago, but you are mistaken.  The core developers on Urbit are some of the hardest working, competent, and idealistic people i&#x27;ve ever met.  It&#x27;s a joy to be involved, which is not what I can say about a lot of projects.<p>The thing I love most about Urbit is it&#x27;s not blowing $1 billion on marketing, or trying to be the cool thing on the block. Ever since I&#x27;ve been involved, they have quietly kept their head down and shipped.  Even against all of the hate, and I have a lot of respect for that.  Go watch the launch event for OS1 and watch one of the core developers talking about how badly he wants to build the best e-reader ever, and tell me that the passion isn&#x27;t contagious."],"time":["2020-05-01 17:06:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justinmk"],"id":[23038777],"kids":{},"parent":[23034608],"text":["urbit &quot;why&quot;:<p>&gt; Each user runs their own node completely independently.

It is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. [...] Thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. These include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction [...]<p>&gt;For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). One indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. Thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more wealth. The scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. The long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. Many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the “mundane” business of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. More importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs <i>autonomously<\/i> but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. In contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities."],"time":["2020-04-30 18:49:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Pfhreak"],"id":[23031012],"kids":{},"parent":[23029486],"text":["The people&#x27;s policy project has a pretty decent writeup of some fairly straightforward changes we could make to increase leisure time here in the states: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peoplespolicyproject.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;the-leisure-agenda&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peoplespolicyproject.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;the-leisure-ag...<\/a><p>The changes we need aren&#x27;t that big, we just need to advocate for them."],"time":["2020-04-30 16:16:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["perfunctory"],"id":[23030443],"kids":[23030954],"parent":[23029486],"text":["Not only we don&#x27;t enjoy life we also destroy it (as in climate change)<p>[Reduced Work Hours as a Means of Slowing Climate Change] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecology.iww.org&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;misc&#x2F;climate-change-workshare-2013-02.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecology.iww.org&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;misc&#x2F;climate-change-workshare-20...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-30 15:16:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["reagular"],"id":[23029867],"kids":[23029969,23030497,23030428],"parent":[23029486],"text":["Of course we are too busy.\nEven the last century we didn&#x27;t work like today.<p>No electrical light?

I rented a spot in an old warehouse in the countryside for $100 a month and decided to build myself a sort of tiny home inside there. It started out rough; I won&#x27;t forget freezing on the concrete floor those first few nights, wrapped in one of those foil survival blankets.<p>The winter left quickly, and with it the last of my ambitions. I&#x27;d do a bit of work, here and there, but doing nothing was my primary occupation. I would lay in fields and watch horses in the distance, I would sit on the side of a stream and rest my feet in it. One of my favorite activities was to bike to the nearest town about a half hour away and buy ice cream, lying in the grass and tearing into it like a child.<p>Biking was always great fun. I would bike with no purpose, simply being free. There is no greater feeling than cruising the countryside with the wind in your hair and absolutely no idea of where you will go that day.<p>Occasionally a horse would match me for the length of its pasture. I got the feeling that the horses dreamed of my bike as a child dreams of wings.<p>Things always seemed to just work out. When my bike gave out, the friendly locals were happy enough to give me rides until I fixed it with some rope I found. When the seasons again changed and my tiny home grew colder I was offered a free room in a lovely old farmhouse.<p>But as the snow returned so did my ambitions. I planned to finish months of work in days, then grew frustrated when I didn&#x27;t. I grew crazier and crazier and at the end neglected all reason. Eventually, I accepted the advice of a local and decided to move to the city, get an apartment, and find work as a programmer. I did all of these quickly. The apartment lasted; the job did not. After so long doing nothing, I found myself nearly unable to work, paralyzed.<p>The next year I continued to do nothing. I had a flash of ambition, but it was quickly interrupted by falling in love early in the year: a beautiful girl far, far out of my league. We fled our responsibilities to the south of France. Perhaps the best single week of my life was there with her doing nothing: lying in the sun, swimming naked in the sea, smoking a joint on the windowsill, watching the boats go by.<p>We spent a wonderful year together, but the winter came as it did before to drive ambition: this time not mine but hers. We separated.<p>Now I find myself a normal programmer. Like most people here, I do an awful lot of something and get paid well for it. But you can bet that once I&#x27;ve stashed up enough of those paychecks my schedule will have a lot more nothing on it."],"time":["2020-04-30 21:34:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjc50"],"id":[23030478],"kids":[23030618,23031040,23030596],"parent":[23029486],"text":["This article could have been written at almost any time in the past 50 years.

They refuse to offer technical support of any kind if I’m not using their router, and it has to be the latest or second-latest generation. The current cost to buy that router outright? $300. Renting is cheaper because I’ll need to switch to a new model in a year. They even give me a hard time during installation—it’s not unusual for the technician to refuse to leave until they get a chance to test with an official Verizon router.<p>I keep a Verizon router on hand. When I need tech support—which is very rare and usually indicates a problem on their end, such as a chewed fiber line—I plug it in and call them up. I might need to do that once every 3 years; oftentimes I have to buy the latest model from them and wait for it to arrive.<p>Two days ago, I called about getting service in a new location.

It was often called &quot;a better C&quot;. This exposed Rob Pike&#x27;s lack of experience in the area (IMHO) because anyone who had done any systems programming at all knew that garbage collection made any systems language a nonstarter.<p>Where Go succeeded was completely unintentional (as as often the case): it was (and is, IMHO) a better Python. Go hasn&#x27;t attracted C, C++ or even Java programmers. It attracted Python refugees. So it&#x27;s no accident the touted use cases (&quot;cloud infrastructure&quot;) are <i>orchestration<\/i> problems.<p>But at the same time, &quot;cloud infrastructure&quot; here refers to what, exactly? Kubernetes? Etcd? I think those could&#x27;ve been written in anything. More to the point, users of those don&#x27;t really use Go as a result, right?<p>I think even Google found that internally Go was cannibalizing Python usage and little else.<p>Lots of Go newbies bemoan the lack of generics. I was never one of them. It&#x27;s not the problem people think it is (IMHO). I&#x27;ll be interested to see what this solution is even if simply means we can stop having having this conversation about Go not having generics. That alone is a win.<p>So I think there&#x27;s two areas where Go screwed up. two big and one small.<p>The small one is the lack of IDE support. You don&#x27;t need to write an IDE. You just need to have sufficient integration into Jetbrains IDEs (at a minimum).<p>The first big problem--and it still is a problem--is the dependency management, in that there wasn&#x27;t a solution to this out of the gate (unlike, say, Rust and Crate). Like I was shocked the first time I saw import &#x27;github.com&#x2F;some_random_user&#x2F;...&#x27; I dare you to go look at any even moderately sized Go project and unravel the levels of dependencies (including repeated dependencies, which may or may not impact binary size, I&#x27;m not sure). It&#x27;s kind of a mess.<p>The second is, oddly, on concurrency or rather multi-core and multi-CPU utilization. Aren&#x27;t we still in the GOMAXPROCS environment variable era? Really?<p>EDIT: adding this quote from Rob Pike in 2012 [1] as it&#x27;s a first-hand account of Go&#x27;s original design goals:<p>&gt; I was asked a few weeks ago, &quot;What was the biggest surprise you encountered rolling out Go?&quot; I knew the answer instantly: Although we expected C++ programmers to see Go as an alternative, instead most Go programmers come from languages like Python and Ruby.

I&#x27;ll note its worth reading through to the last paragraph and into the comments, the title is a bit bait-y and the article does a better job than the title gives itself credit for.<p>Broadly speaking, if you&#x27;re looking at Vault to solve a specific problem X for a specific consumption type Y on a specific platform Z, then it _probably is overkill_ (I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;overhyped&quot; :)). i.e. &quot;encrypted key&#x2F;value via env vars on AWS Lambda&quot;. &quot;X via Y on Z.&quot; The power of Vault is: multiple use cases, multiple consumption modes, and multiple platforms supported with a single consistent way to do access control, audit logging, operations, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t stress that &quot;single consistent way to do access control, audit logging, operations, etc.&quot; enough. Multiple security use cases dangling off that consistency is really important as soon as you hit N=2 or N=3 security use cases.<p>If you need say... encrypted KV and encryption-as-a-service and dynamic just-in-time credentials and a PKI system (certificate), and you need this as files and as env vars, and you need this on Kubernetes and maybe also on EC2, then Vault is -- in my totally biased opinion -- going to blow any other option out of the water.<p>That&#x27;s a somewhat complex use case but its something Vault excels at. For simpler use cases, Vault is making more and more sense as we continue to make Vault easier to use. For example, we now provide a Helm chart and official K8S integration so you can run Vault on K8S very easily. And in this mode, developers don&#x27;t even need to know Vault is there cause their secrets show up as env vars and files just like normal K8S secrets would.<p>Also, this article is from June 2019 and in 10 short months we&#x27;ve made a ton of progress on simplifying Vault so it gets closer to that &quot;X via Y on Z&quot; use case. Here are some highlights I can think of off the top of my head but there are definitely more, this is just from memory:<p>* We have integrated storage as an option now, so you don&#x27;t need separate storage mechanisms.<p>* Our learn guides went from basically zero to lots of content which makes it much easier to learn how to use Vault: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.hashicorp.com&#x2F;vault\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.hashicorp.com&#x2F;vault<\/a><p>* We have an official, feature-packed Kubernetes integration to do stuff like secret injection and rotation automatically.

Granted my perspective is from deploying Vault to the Cloud vs. on-prem.<p>1. Yeah, Vault needs a separate place to do its storage.  However, that&#x27;s a strength if you&#x27;re following an immutable infrastructure pattern.  You store the data in something like DynamoDB and still have the freedom of tearing down and re-creating the Vault servers themselves.<p>2. Vault may be more expensive right out of the gate, but if you&#x27;re trying to cover ALL of its functionality with cloud services, it&#x27;ll start saving you money eventually.  Furthermore, many of the cloud alternatives have service limits and quotas.  I mean geez, if you want an internal CA through AWS, you&#x27;re paying a flat $400 a month + costs per certificate.<p>3. Vault has a learning curve, but it&#x27;s not worse than having to memorize the buffet of CLI commands through your cloud provider.

Rather, it is the regeneration of practically-grounded trade schools and state-backed coordination that is needed to retrain a productive workforce.<p>Trade schools are great and all - but retraining efforts consistently fail when the jobs do not line up with an individual&#x27;s self-image.

Many humans don&#x27;t like being a cog in the machine, even if it&#x27;s a steady income. Many children of these manufacturing workers saw the harmful side of those types of jobs, and instead opted for college or service-industry jobs where they focus on developing soft skills and relationships with people. Yes they want good jobs and to not get abused by the gig job industry, but many Americans don&#x27;t want to go back to being treated as human machinery in factories either. The real thing Americans want is better opportunity to use those skills to start their own businesses, to put their skills and creativity to use.

This is the foundation of the professions: judges and lawyers do not keep their reasoning secret, nor do priests, nor do professors, nor do medical doctors — to the extent that the knowledge they create belongs to anyone, it belongs to the profession, not to the individual professional or their client.  When Silicon Valley started abandoning that principle in the 1990s and especially after 2000, the epicenter of innovation shifted to Shenzhen, where that principle was still practiced.  And today with the covid pandemic we see the fallout: the US has been left far behind technologically and is completely unable to deploy the measures needed to stop the pandemic.<p>That isn&#x27;t the only factor, of course, but it&#x27;s a big one.  The profession of engineering computing machinery has been subordinated to the quarterly goals of business, which can be more effectively promoted if information flow is controlled by management and money, not by engineers and sharing.

Realistically, a good chunk of them aren&#x27;t going to even use the product very often, despite paying for it. This is even more true since it&#x27;s cheap. You could easily end up with fewer than 100 of the 500 logging in and using the product on any given day. Of those, maybe 5-10 are going to actually need support, and you could easily cover half of that with an FAQ, training videos, etc. So on any given day, you might get 2-5 emails from your 500 customers. Even if it&#x27;s 10x that, you could probably churn through 20-30 support emails in 1-2 hours just by yourself, or you could hire someone for $500 &#x2F; month to do it for you.

Brave sells us the idea of decentralization, even though in practice there is no decentralization at all.<p>Other than that, you can&#x27;t compare Cliqz with Brave, and here&#x27;s the reason why Brave will not fail:<p>- First and firemost, they have a consistent monthly growth in their userbase for years\n- In contrast to Cliqz who pushes their own products via Ghostery, Brave acts as a neutral middleman, thus creating a direct competition with Google et al., who are also middlemen. In other words, Brave offers every customer the same opportunity to serve ads\n- An innovative and unique product: The monthly growth proves this point, as innovation leads to demand.\n- user first ideology: Even though Brave wants to be a middleman for a privacy-preserving money-flow between creators and users, they allow the user to chose whether to activate it or not. By default, Brave is just a browser that blocks annoying and privacy-infringing stuff. With Cliqz it is basically impossible to get the Cliqz out of the browser, with Brave I can change my browser in a way as to never see anything related to ads, crypto tokens, etc. and Brave actively respects that decision.<p>As long as Brave respects users like me who deactivate everything in the browser related to ads and crypto schemes, they will continue to have a loyal userbase behind them."],"time":["2020-04-30 19:09:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tpmx"],"id":[23033322],"kids":[23033425],"parent":[23031520],"text":["Wow.
