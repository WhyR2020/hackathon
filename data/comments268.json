A unit is a piece of the software with a clear boundary. It might be a whole microservice, or a chunk of a monolith that is internally consistent.<p>- What triggers writing a test is what matters. Overzealous testers test for each new public method in a class. This leads to testing on implementation details of the actual unit, because most classes are only consumed within a single unit.<p>- Behavior driven testing makes most sense to decide what needs tests. If it&#x27;s required behavior to the people across the boundary, it needs a test. Otherwise, tests may be extraneous or even harmful.<p>- As such, a good trigger rule is &quot;one test per desired external behavior of the unit, plus one test per bug fixed&quot;.

If a bug was put into code it could take months where subtle parts of the internet would be failing.  This wasn&#x27;t an option, so we had strict testing.  I think for every line of code we had 2 to 3 lines of equivalent test code.  From this experience I&#x27;ve found:<p>1) I found a natural way to write pseudo TDD I prefer.  When I&#x27;m mocking up some code in a project, I write interface code to run what I&#x27;m writing.  I run the code from time to time to make sure it&#x27;s working.  If I&#x27;m not doing that, how do I know my code it working?  You get a sort of dopamine high when running the code and seeing everything come together.<p>What I do is I take that interface code I wrote while creating the code and instead of deleting it, I create a test function (or multiple) and I copy paste it there.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry I&#x27;ll come back and write the assert_eq or equivalent later.<p>Writing a test is that quick.  You&#x27;re already doing 95% of it.  Just copy paste it into a function.  I know it&#x27;s not always that simple, but often times it is.  When approaching testing this way there is no reason not to write tests.<p>2) Systems tests catch far more than integration and unit tests, so if you&#x27;re serious about testing, these should be considered.  Systems tests go by many different names, so by this I mean a testing echosystem where the system is spun up and a mock client and mock servers are ran.  This simulates a real world client connecting to the software and tests the real world results they would get.<p>The reason system tests catch so much more than unit tests is in a large system not everyone knows every functionality and how it should work.  It&#x27;s easy to create a regression where a new feature is added but it changes the behavior of this old previously unknown feature.  This often results in going back to the drawing board as it&#x27;s a business issue more than just a software issue.  These kind of bugs can get pretty nasty in the enterprise space if unchecked so it&#x27;s a good idea to catch them.<p>Furthermore, systems tests catch nearly 100% of what unit tests and integration tests catch as well.  This is because if there is a bug in a unit caught, it will propagate out to the client affecting behavior.  If it is caught in a unit test and not a systems test, then there might be a hole in systems tests where it&#x27;s not testing every scenario, or you might have dead&#x2F;unused code in the code base or something similar.<p>Systems tests I&#x27;ve found are better at catching race conditions as well.<p>Systems tests act as a great source of documentation, because they document how every interface in the program is intended to act.  You get a quick high level view and can learn the ecosystem quickly from it, where unit tests are down in the weeds.<p>And finally, you don&#x27;t need to write anywhere as many systems tests as you do integration and unit tests.  You can test a lot more with a lot less work."],"time":["2020-08-26 20:17:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rerx"],"id":[24281774],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["(2014)"],"time":["2020-08-26 14:29:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24282235],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-26 15:26:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["TheRealPomax"],"id":[24283616],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["What&#x27;s the tl;dr of this article?

(I work with legacy corporate systems mostly so that&#x27;s how I am biased)<p>TLDR: it never had a chance of working<p>The basic problem of TDD is that it has a huge cost to it and therefore you have to do it right to not only get any benefits but to just get even.<p>In a perfect TDD utopia, all developers would start with a set of clear, complete requirements and then implemented each requirements with a clean and concise test and then ensured their code passes the test. Then later, with not much additional effort, these tests would be used to verify that whatever shenanigans you are doing to your project still cause functionality X to do Y when Z happens.<p>Unfortunately, this fails to capture whole diversity of the development reality.<p>- It is rare you get clear and concise requirements. Most corporate code is just something that a developer decided should happen in a situation, not a result of meticulous discussion and planning. As such, preserving these requirements in stone has much less value than one might think because now instead of preserving objective truths about how the application should work you are spending time to preserve what an intern Joe decided this should be doing with probably little regard for entire system.<p>- There isn&#x27;t a way to tell your tests are complete and good quality. Whereas an application must implement functionality and must be doing (something) right because otherwise your users would notice missing or faulty functionality (users are ultimate verification of your app), tests can be as incomplete as you want and as pointless as you like and will still &quot;pass&quot;. Thus, completeness and quality of tests is completely on a whim of developer. Guess what, if they can&#x27;t get the app right will they be able to at least get tests right? And if they can get the app right the lack of tests is the least of their problems. By having feedback on how teh application functions from their users the developers are &quot;forced&quot; to deliver something at some level of quality. By having no feedback on tests quality developers are not forced to deliver anything (other than to satisfy tests) and if they are not forced to do something no user or manager will ever look at they are most likely do only what is absolutely necessary (to pass automated gates).<p>- Most developers want to be done with a task and there is this bunch of stuff they have to do that is just annoying because it has no immediate bearing on how the application functions. That bunch consists of refactoring, documentation, code reviews and guess what, tests. Do you know why documentation is typically poor if at all? Do you know why code reviews mostly focus on little stuff and rarely attack big problems? Because overwhelming majority of developers don&#x27;t put their heart into stuff that does not bring them closer to achieving the goal (except reading HN, taht is, and other forms of procrastination).<p>- Management. While they will usually &quot;require&quot; tests, I have never in my life seen that a development was extended to get more time to &quot;get tests right&quot;. Usually tests is something you have to do as quickly as possible to meet the requirements rather than something that is seen as core to the project functioning.<p>- Developers. Most developers are already overwhelmed with stuff they need to learn to be able to functioning in increasingly complex technological jungle. Microservices? Devops? Full stack? Given choice to spend time learning skill of doing tests right and learning above not many developers will choose tests. Making quality tests is a skill that like any other skill require you to apply yourself.<p>- Refactoring functionality in a legacy system (which is theoretically exactly the reason you might want tests) requires that you know exactly what you are doing. This means understanding what changes are &quot;safe&quot;. When I refactor a piece of code I try to form a hypothesis that the change is not going to break functionality and then prove it by following code leads (how the function is used, etc.) until I am satisfied. Doing hundreds or thousands of refactorings one by one requires from me that I am 100% certain I know I am not breaking anything. If I were to use tests to help me do refactorings I would also have to have close to 100% trust in that these are correct. Unfortunately, there are no tests to test that tests are correct or complete. Therefore, I cannot use tests to replace my process of following code leads and this makes tests useless for my needs."],"time":["2020-08-26 14:53:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["calebm"],"id":[24286580],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["yes"],"time":["2020-08-26 21:57:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jpswade"],"id":[24284468],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["Betteridge&#x27;s law of headlines applies."],"time":["2020-08-26 19:03:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blargmaster33"],"id":[24285074],"kids":{},"parent":[24281195],"text":["100% Code coverage or go home!"],"time":["2020-08-26 19:48:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["PaulHoule"],"id":[24283459],"kids":[24283756,24283762,24284268,24286195],"parent":[24281195],"text":["When I hear &quot;Kent Beck&quot; I reach for my gun.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with &quot;Kent Beck&quot; as an individual but more than anyone else in software &quot;Kent Beck&quot; is a brand like &quot;Anthony Robbins&quot;.

Most of the Pollack supporter&#x27;s comments seem to assume that if a person doesn&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a genius of incredible technical ability, then that means that person is automatically an ignorant person that&#x27;s making wild, uninformed, random guesses about how art is created.<p>I think Pollack&#x27;s paintings are aesthetically pleasing. I&#x27;m not a professional artist, however I am an art and art history hobbyist. I have been for decades. I like his paintings. I don&#x27;t, however, think they are special or that he was an artistic genius whose paintings should have broken the record at one point for the most expensive work of art ever sold. That&#x27;s OK though, we all have different tastes and a guy with $100 million just happened to have different tastes from this guy with no millions.<p>However, my opinion isn&#x27;t random or uninformed. I know how a painting is created. How the surfaces are prepared. How preparatory drawings and smaller studies are done. How the final drawing is made. How the underpainting is done. My art is pretty bad compared to professionals. However, studying it for decades means I&#x27;ve watched actual masters do their thing for a countless number of hours. I know how the Italian masters created their works of art in great detail. I know how Pollack created his. The level of technical skill required to become a master of classical realism is absurd. Pollack&#x27;s strength was executing and publishing an idea no one had done before. In the grand scheme of all of art, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a particularly strong strength when compared to masters of classical realism.<p>My opinion is based on an intimate knowledge of what it takes to be that good. If you disagree with my conclusion that&#x27;s fine and reasonable but to pretend that everyone doesn&#x27;t consider him a highly skilled genius is ignorant is in itself pretty ignorant.<p>If I wanted to create a work like Pollack&#x27;s, there would likely be a learning curve, but we aren&#x27;t talking the same amount of practice and preparation that classically trained artists require to even be semi-competent. Like I said before, the biggest strength of the work he is known for was originality, not technical competence. He might have also been technically competent as an artist, but when I look at the works that made him famous I don&#x27;t see it.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to hang all kinds of abstract &#x2F; modern &#x2F; postmodern art on my wall because it adds color, sometimes has great composition, and is aesthetically pleasing. However, most of it just isn&#x27;t meaningful to me in the same way that other genres of art are like classical realism and impressionism. I don&#x27;t think anyone should feel like that&#x27;s a personal attack on their preferences. I&#x27;m not missing something, it just has a different effect on me.

It&#x27;s probably order of magnitudes lower if you factor in costs for running the advertising platform, that you really can&#x27;t show that many ads as Facebook (it can show a sponsored story every few stories, TV producers can&#x27;t inject an ad every few minutes), and probably have worse targeting."],"time":["2019-12-17 05:17:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["uptown"],"id":[21807933],"kids":[21808069,21808512,21810778,21808334,21811016],"parent":[21781481],"text":["&quot;The trade-offs for cheap TVs is that customers are themselves becoming the product for TV makers [...] For something to be as cheap as a great TV, people have to give something up — whether they know it or not.&quot;<p>Just never give the TV its own direct connection to the internet.

I don&#x27;t have the money to go buy a new car right now, but it&#x27;s pretty sad that saving up and paying for things is so discouraged now. Then dealerships in general people don&#x27;t like or even lie to people, I guess one told someone they were required to fill out a credit application by law even if it doesn&#x27;t get processed... So if your credit union or your own bank got you financing, then want to try to undercut that.

Seems like walking into a dealership is getting into a hostage situation.<p>People are just putting everything on credit, a car they probably shouldn&#x27;t of bought and sits parked most of the time, people refinance their mortgages over and over again so they&#x27;ll probably never end up paying off their house.

Some areas don&#x27;t even have sidewalks either, and some people have attitudes against cyclists too since they paid more for their car or SUV so they feel more entitled to the road.

I would also argue that the quoted sentence at the end here is a bit of a straw man, because taking away that power from the individual instance is - or at least should be - the <i>actual<\/i> design goal of a federated system.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, a network design should do what it reasonably can to prevent and mitigate abuse, but I believe advertising inflated privacy expectations to end users is fundamentally dishonest. What they get is <i>not<\/i> privacy. What they get is some degree of control and independence. Which incidentally is one of the reasons why no federated system has really taken off yet in the mainstream: those are not big enough selling points on their own, and they&#x27;re certainly not enough to motivate people into taking the huge social hit from moving onto an empty new platform. So far, only fringe groups have taken up these decentralized offers - groups who frankly almost nobody wants to have associations with.<p><i>&gt; Reliability &amp; Discoverability being the main two.<\/i><p>I agree very much with the problem being discoverability.

Mueller rapes and kills twelve boys. About roughly 00:55 Representative Adam Schiff who will also be leading an impeachment effort, also requests the same deal as Nadler, and then tries to make a case for getting more than Nadler and Mueller. Adam Schiff rapes and kills three boys. Mueller and Schiff all receive $3 billion dollars each for joing the group. Nadler came back to witness these two rape to make sure they were all bound together under one purpose: keep Trump in power, and also to confirm the payments to each, including his $10.5 billion dollar payment.<p>Between Mueller and Schiff turns, the group issues orders for ten women to begin prepping more boys for rape. They are former friends and family of Brian Schlenker, and also some long standing Illuminati members who include Elsa Hosk, Gigi and Bella Hadid. Again, the &quot;prep&quot; these females engage means they perform oral sex on the boys’ penis and anus, as a child rapist like Henry Porter would, while trying to remove fecal matter from the boy prior to handing them over to be raped and subsequently murdered.

I feel like I succumb to decision paralysis when I attempt parallel programming in Haskell; from a purely pragmatic perspective, I much prefer the Go approach, where there is a single canonical concurrency mechanism which is baked right into the language and is extremely well-documented."],"time":["2019-12-17 18:20:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mark_l_watson"],"id":[21815546],"kids":{},"parent":[21803965],"text":["Really nice paper, especially the bullet points near the end.<p>I applied for a job with Simon Marlow’s Haskell team at FaceBook about three years ago.

Mueller rapes and kills twelve boys. About roughly 00:55 Representative Adam Schiff who will also be leading an impeachment effort, also requests the same deal as Nadler, and then tries to make a case for getting more than Nadler and Mueller. Adam Schiff rapes and kills three boys. Mueller and Schiff all receive $3 billion dollars each for joing the group. Nadler came back to witness these two rape to make sure they were all bound together under one purpose: keep Trump in power, and also to confirm the payments to each, including his $10.5 billion dollar payment.<p>Between Mueller and Schiff turns, the group issues orders for ten women to begin prepping more boys for rape. They are former friends and family of Brian Schlenker, and also some long standing Illuminati members who include Elsa Hosk, Gigi and Bella Hadid. Again, the &quot;prep&quot; these females engage means they perform oral sex on the boys’ penis and anus, as a child rapist like Henry Porter would, while trying to remove fecal matter from the boy prior to handing them over to be raped and subsequently murdered.

She can easily be part-time, start a business for it and contract, as an &#x27;editor-in-chief&#x27; you&#x27;d think that is more involved. With the limit of 30 articles a month is about 3 per month and that is per company, other writers that write for many publishers will be fully fine with this. I doubt most writers that write more than 3 articles a month would mind if they got extra protections, the editor-in-chief is a different thing entirely.<p>I can understand why businesses are mad about this but not labor or contractors.  California makes it easier for contractors to work by not allowing non-competes [1][2].<p>Non-competes are the most anti-American, anti-business, anti-innovation, anti-labor things in America. Support California taking a stand against the powerful and authoritarians that want essential slaves in the worst form of this.<p>I have no doubt that SCOTUS will eventually have to deal with non-competes. With how a conservative leaning SCOTUS sided on the favor of business with arbitration, and denying access to the legal system for many, it doesn&#x27;t look good [3]. Having California as an example of a non-compete state is great to have in that it is innovative and contractors don&#x27;t have to deal with that in California. I have to fight non-competes in every project that isn&#x27;t based in California. Lots of these companies want developers to sign a 2-year non-compete for a 3-6 month project which is completely asinine.<p>California ultimately does more for workers and low&#x2F;middle class than any other state as well as business being a competitive and innovative magnet. With a market this large they are using their leverage for good.  But there will always be the haters and FUD from big business and occasionally some that disagree.
