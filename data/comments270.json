There would be no solid reactor component exposed to the radiation from the plasma (a thick layer of liquid lithium would be interposed in all directions), and the peak pressure could be much higher than structural materials could withstand (because the compression and reaction would occur on time scale short compared to the time required for a sound wave to propagate across the liquid.)<p>But it turned out this approach was fatally flawed.<p>While they had trouble with confinement, the big problem is that to get that fast a reaction, very high density, and therefore very strong magnetic fields (magnetic pressure goes as magnetic field squared) would be required.  Peak fields in their first approach would be as high as 700 T.   But this would imply very large currents would be flowing in the liquid metal compressing the magnetized plasma.   Beyond ~100 T, these current would be so strong that the surface of the metal would be vaporized, and non-conducting metal vapor would flow into and quench the plasma.   Game over.<p>So, they&#x27;ve gone to a slow scheme.  The implosion is now subsonic, and also there&#x27;s a metal post running down the center of the chamber to increase stability.   But this ruins the main attractive feature of their concept.  That metal post will be subject to orders of magnitude higher average neutron flux than the walls of typical fusion concepts, and will also be crushed with magnetic pressure from 100 T magnetic fields.    The engineering to make this work would be beyond heroic.    The subsonic compression also means the entire reactor vessel will experience very high pressures, even if the rest of it is shielded from the radiation."],"time":["2019-12-18 00:36:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Communitivity"],"id":[21806394],"kids":[21806827,21807310],"parent":[21806334],"text":["It will be interesting to see where this is based, and I am wondering if it will partly be in Singapore.

The justices explicitly noted that this doesn’t mean municipalities can’t enact and enforce significant restrictions on when, where, and how (for example, no multi-day camping or no erecting structures) this can happen, including when no shelter beds are available.

Here’s the footnote which explicitly carved out this stuff:<p>&gt; Naturally, our holding does not cover individuals who do have access to adequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or because it is realistically available to them for free, but who choose not to use it. Nor do we suggest that a jurisdiction with insufficient shelter can never criminalize the act of sleeping outside. Even where shelter is unavailable, an ordinance prohibiting sitting, lying, or sleeping outside at particular times or in particular locations might well be constitutionally permissible. See Jones, 444 F.3d at 1123. So, too, might an ordinance barring the obstruction of public rights of way or the erection of certain structures. Whether some other ordinance is consistent with the Eighth Amendment will depend, as here, on whether it punishes a person for lacking the means to live out the “universal and unavoidable consequences of being human” in the way the ordinance prescribes."],"time":["2019-12-16 20:20:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jdkee"],"id":[21806727],"kids":[21806926,21807073,21808341],"parent":[21805464],"text":["We did a great disservice to the mentally ill when we closed (rather than reform) our mental institutions.

Though their comments came later, Harold Bloom and James Wood were highly critical of Wallace, the former declaring him to have &quot;no discernible talent.&quot; It feels terribly one-sided to mention only the stack of positive reviews. IJ was by no means a universal critical success.<p>&gt;  ... both [The Broom of the System and Infinite Jest], most importantly, work up an elaborate – and elaborately digressive – plot which deliberately ends as unsatisfactorily as possible.<p>While I can&#x27;t speak for Broom. which I didn&#x27;t finish, I can say that my reading of IJ&#x27;s ending was that it was not at all deliberately unsatisfactory. In fact, I felt it was the opposite: it&#x27;s beautiful, and it marks the moment when Gately finally gets out of his recursive cycle of addiction. I think it&#x27;s where the book (whose structure is itself fascinating---a circle and&#x2F;or a Sierpinski Gasket) ought to have ended, and while some could say it was unsatisfactory for them, I don&#x27;t think they could claim it was deliberately so.<p>&gt; There is first of all Hal Incandenza, a teenage tennis prodigy and marijuana addict who during the course of the book plays tennis and gets high a lot, and then tries to stop getting high – that’s his plot.<p>Isn&#x27;t there a bit more to Hal&#x27;s story? What about the struggle the ghost of his dead father makes to connect Hal to the world and to feelings? To exit his head, as it were? What about Hal&#x27;s finding that same dad dead in the house up the hill from his school dorm? What about his recession into himself and his dislocation from language, his Kafkaesque inversion?<p>&gt; Then there’s Don Gately, a former housebreaker and narcotics addict who goes straight before the book even opens and merely attempts to stay that way throughout the course of the novel – that’s his plot.<p>Nothing of his struggles to pray daily to a God he doesn&#x27;t believe in, simply in an effort to stay sober for another 24 hours? Nothing of his role as a leader and mentor at the Ennet halfway house, or the scenes where he transcends his identity as a witless muscle-for-hire criminal upon whose head friends would close elevator doors for a laugh to connect with and care for his community? (The scene where he, in a joke apron and chef&#x27;s hat, he makes pasta for the housemates brought me to tears.) Still nothing of his falling in love with Joelle? Nor of his fight in the resident&#x27;s defense, his hospitalization, and his transition into a vivid memoryscape of his days as a junkie and crook?<p>&gt; All of which, I suppose, is just a polite way of saying that if the author of Infinite Jest shut off his word-processor and actually went to a wine-and-cheese party he might find out what the word ‘reading’ really means<p>He wrote it longhand and was a recovering alcoholic&#x2F;addict. No word processors or wine parties for him.<p>Yes, I have in certain ways fallen out of love with Infinite Jest, but I still refute the claim that there was nothing there in the first place. There was something in it for me when I read it alone in rural Thailand over a summer in 2013, and there&#x27;s been something in it for many other readers I know, too.

In this dynamic, the differences in inherent effectiveness between one method and another can be dwarfed by the power of one treatment having superior marketing and inspiring people to work harder, persist through greater discomfort, and eventually have a greater likelihood of achieving results — which will of course be credited to the theoretical ideas underpinning the therapy instead of the marketing."],"time":["2019-12-16 20:34:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["FailMore"],"id":[21806125],"kids":{},"parent":[21804988],"text":["My own experience with CBT is that the diagnosis of the correct anxiety is the biggest weakness. Too often we listen to our thoughts in our minds too directly (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m not good enough&quot;) instead of understanding that the current anxiety has a function, and that is to protect us from what we are really scared about (it is useful for me to feel like I&#x27;m not good enough because it stops me from standing up for myself &#x2F; risking a conflict with others). When I started to apply standard CBT techniques (face your fear) to the deeper anxiety, I found the surface anxieties vanished (i.e. practiced having and surviving conflicts got rid of &quot;I&#x27;m not good enough&quot; feelings).<p>Diagnosis of the deep anxiety is probably the biggest challenge. On a side note I found my dreams were very good at helping me find them by presenting situations which encouraged non anxious behaviour, which contrast to the anxious behaviour I would take in the dream - this disparity between what the situation demanded and how I behaved would highlight the deeper anxiety.

He should look up Bruce Wampold&#x27;s research, for example. The dodo bird effect is well documented: therapy works relative to all sorts of placebos, but therapist effects dwarf therapy effects, not everything works for everyone, therapist-client cohesiveness is paramount, and there are really no replicable superiorities of any given therapy with regard to general functioning and well-being, even if specific therapies might be more effective for specific behavioral problems.<p>To be fair to Alexander, therapy research and literature has the kind of weird duality he points out, and it permeates academics as well, where the problems he mentions are maybe even worse. Everyone does know about the dodo bird effect, but then people either embrace it or they ignore it.<p>A big problem is the exact same thing that&#x27;s permeating all of medical science, which is a huge pressure to obtain grants and notoriety for discovering a cure. There&#x27;s much more rewards for overhyping than being sober in science. You could replace therapy with drugs in his essay and it would read the same. In fact, I sincerely was confused for a bit by his figure because the exact same sorts of figures have been published about psychiatric medications, and it took me a while to be sure what he was talking about.<p>One thing that&#x27;s maybe not immediately clear to the general public is that with psychiatry and psychology there&#x27;s an additional pressure to &quot;be scientific&quot; which then often backfires in the way he&#x27;s witnessing. Both psychiatrists and psychologists are the targets of witch doctor labels, which then leads to this behavior where researchers and theorists jockey to outdo themselves in being &quot;real scientists&quot;. The good part of this is that then you get a ton of randomized controlled studies and so forth, but the downside of this is you end up with this additional reason to promote your drug or therapy as being somehow better than treatment as usual, or to denigrate other interventions as being &quot;unscientific&quot;. That is, certain things (e.g., CBT in therapyland, or arguably things like prozac in medicationland) become banners that you&#x27;re expected to carry if you want to be part of the &quot;real science&quot; club. Criticizing the efficacy of these interventions implicitly doesn&#x27;t just mean criticizing those particular interventions, or criticizing the specificity of their mechanisms, it means you get labeled as not being on board with the &quot;real science&quot; club. It is just one more reason for hype, in addition to the typical hype that is flooding biomedical research at the moment.<p>Alexander mentions that he feels like he&#x27;s never seen &quot;sudden, extraordinary, long-lasting&quot; effects of therapy.

This is a very nice book of stories (a work of genius, I may say) which is written carefully as to start from a limited vocabulary (smaller than Gerda, since it also aims at learners which started with other texts) and then to slowly add 8-10 new words in every chapter. I read one story per day, underlining words I didn&#x27;t recognize (not caring whether I had learned them before or they were actually new) and then looking them up in a dictionary. When I finished the story, I reread the sentences which contained the underlined words. Then, the next day, I reread the last day&#x27;s story before embraking on a new one. This way one slowly absorbs (almost without realizing it) a whole lot of new vocabulary. I would love to see someone doing this kind of project in a non-constructed language. After finishing that book, I started reading from Boris Kolker&#x27;s Vojago en Esperanto-lando, usually presented as an advanced reader, one chapter a day (I think it has three-four new words per chapter), which I abandoned somewhere in the middle.<p>At the end of it, I could read an advanced book written in Esperanto which felt enough like an achievement. I don&#x27;t know about conversational skills, since I never talked to anyone. But even if I initially hated culture-related motivations, I longed for having a country and a culture to read about and apply my skills. I found the same problems that wccrawford is complaining about in another comment - almost no media produced in Esperanto got my attention.<p>There is some stuff I like about it: it sounds very cosy (even the sentences I read on the blog post above); the fixed endings make it easy to parse a sentence even if you don&#x27;t know what the words mean; it has very powerful means of enriching its own vocabulary (when I was a child, I loved English because of this, let&#x27;s say in this regard English is to Esperanto as Unix is to Plan 9 with regard to the Unix philosophy, so it kinda rekindled that enthusiasm).

Of course it has to be polarized for DC, so something like ( - | ).<p>There is also the problem of breaking the arc in DC, so one prong needs to be longer and making contact further in so it can&#x27;t arc outside the plug. Or maybe it needs some internal mechanism such as plastic slot covers that close and break the ark (like child-protected sockets have now).

People setting up DC buses to run all their electronics should be able to accept the responsibility of frying something if they give it too much juice."],"time":["2019-12-16 20:57:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baybal2"],"id":[21804423],"kids":[21805191],"parent":[21803996],"text":["The telecom industry has 48 volt as a de-facto standard, bur never came to a mechanical standard.<p>Thus you see daisy chains of mechanical adaptors in telecom closets."],"time":["2019-12-16 17:47:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["unilynx"],"id":[21804763],"kids":[21805121,21805437,21804831],"parent":[21803996],"text":["If none of the current plugs are usable, can we have a low-power plug standard based on PoE?<p>Having both ethernet and low power from one socket would be perfect for IoT devices, save people from having to run Ethernet wiring themselves afterwards, and cut down on wireless spectrum use.<p>And your &#x27;smart fridge&#x27; would just plug into both outlets and use a relay to cut 230V if the motor doesn&#x27;t need to run."],"time":["2019-12-16 18:17:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["upofadown"],"id":[21806124],"kids":{},"parent":[21803996],"text":["Yeah, we are kind of running low on actual high power devices to plug into residential outlets these days.

Sometimes things can damage a society with good intentions at heart only to backfire miserably.<p>Especially considering the loss of the &quot;do no evil&quot; mentality. Everything moved heavily over to IPO&#x27;s where you have people buying chunks of tech companies who have no clue how any of this works, but they demand a return so we push things out without much thought about if it will have negative consequences.

A custom Renner action was added and outfitted with Abel Royal Blue grand hammers. Key weighting and fine voicing conducted in stages over the course of several months finished it off.

If this is a heavily discounted course due to the crippled way it is taught then I have no issue.<p>From the syllabus:<p>CS144 is taught using a combination of lectures and videos. In previous years, it was entirely “flipped”; i.e. all the lecture material was taught by videos. This year things are different and we are going to mix things up: Some weeks, including the first week, will be based on recorded videos that you are required to watch in your own time. We will call these Video Weeks. Other weeks, including the second week, are based entirely on in-class lectures, and you don’t need to watch any videos. We will call these Lecture-only Weeks. So why mix things up? We are teaching this way because we have found that some of the material (e.g. the basic principles you learn in week 1) are most efficiently learned by watching videos - the concepts are fairly simple and the material is descriptive; a video is a more efficient use of your time. Other material, such as when you learn about congestion control in week 4, is best learned in person, interactively in a lecture."],"time":["2019-12-15 07:07:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fauigerzigerk"],"id":[21796610],"kids":[21797382,21797106,21796651,21796729,21796664,21797958,21796675,21797460,21797155,21797877,21797023,21797622,21797506,21797446,21796705,21796982,21796894,21798112,21797398,21796731,21800550,21797343,21798664,21798144,21797878],"parent":[21796070],"text":["Yes Google spams search results with ads.

Ian Bogost&#x27;s piece in the Atlantic a couple of years ago, &quot;Video Games are Better Without Stories&quot; [1] argued that narrative in games can&#x27;t deliver on its promise--you can&#x27;t craft a story while also letting the player explore. To my taste, games like Inkle&#x27;s 80 Days and Heaven&#x27;s Vault, and Nicky Case&#x27;s games like the Coming Out Simulator [2], make effective use of the constraints of the medium. They do feel more like literature than games, which might feel overly conservative to folks primarily interested in the phenomenological possibilities of games.<p>My project, Unfold Studio [3], makes use of the affordances of Inkle&#x27;s Ink language for teaching CS in the context of students&#x27; existing identities and concerns. Here, the limitations of the format are again useful. Students can create small playable worlds in a way that&#x27;s still manageable and which makes CS concepts rhetorically powerful--they are immediately useful for creating particular experiences for the user.

Answer: you can recreate CodeCademy.com.<p>What happens when you allow for media to be played in parallel: you&#x27;re opening a can of worms that has a lot of implications on user experience and architecture of non-linear stories. You&#x27;ll see some of the implications later on.<p>Is ReactJS suitable as a framework for non-linear storytelling compared to vanillaJS? Answer: yes, because ReactJS is component-based, so the components will be based on media items for which you can tell a story. I also think it&#x27;s possible to make story&#x2F;content components.<p>How do you measure frustration in a non-linear story framework? Answer: you could do it via the webcam if the user consents. Since mouse clicks and watch time is not enough. Non-linear stories are not applications, but they can be (in XIMPEL at least), when media is passively consumed, you need facial expressions (and user consent).<p>Now that we have parallel media playing how to do time scrubbing? Answer: in my thesis I outlined multiple options. The biggest question is: do you want to have a time line or a time graph?<p>Now that we have parallel media playing does that mean that a subject point in the story should be able to survive subject point in the story that comes after it? If it makes sense, content-wise, then yes. If you wouldn&#x27;t have parallel media playback, this would not make sense. (ok, I&#x27;m butchering this answer, can&#x27;t summarize it well, you can always read my thesis ;-) [1])<p>Is XIMPEL Turing Complete? Answer: almost! If we allow for the user to disambiguate certain issues, then yes. What helps a lot with this is that XIMPEL allows the use of integer variables. And you can get very far with 2 integer variables, since you can represent 2 integer variables as 2 stacks, and 2 stacks makes a tape. Where it fails with XIMPEL though is knowing which story&#x2F;subject point to jump to."],"time":["2019-12-15 17:25:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ErotemeObelus"],"id":[21797716],"kids":{},"parent":[21771022],"text":["My best friend was writing a twine about his ordeal before he died.

Your browser doesn’t know <i>any<\/i> URLs at all (yes I know about the search engines but that’s configuration). What it knows are data types. It can be taught new data types (e.g. PDF) but not new URLs because it doesn’t know any. So if you want a REST API you need to be designing data contracts between client and server. URLs are a server side implementation detail and completely irrelevant to the discussion.<p>The advantage to this kind of architecture is that the server and clients can develop in a more more decoupled manner. They need only agree on data types. A new web site existing never requires rebuilding a browser. Only if a new kind of data (e.g. HTML5) is to be supported.<p>But one thing to be considered, as with all architectural patterns, is if it fits the domain you’re architecting. REST isn’t optimal for any possible problem. Sometimes HTTP-RPC (what the article describes) is an easier fit.

The BBC&#x27;s piece here is heavy on the human impact &#x2F; human interest elements of the story, which are a relevant <i>element<\/i>.  However it covers this aspect virtually exclusively, neglecting to identify the timeframe or previous history of the case, <i>including its own reporting<\/i>, but also of the relevant system and company names involved.  This strikes me as shoddy practice.<p>Listening to a recent podcast (which doesn&#x27;t much matter), a guest quipped regarding the decline of newspapers that they would often hear from people who would complain about the poor quality of newspaper coverage, but who didn&#x27;t subscribe to their own paper.  This strikes me as an extraordinarily shallow dismissal.<p>If you go through historical newspaper coverage, at least some of it (usually national coverage, though also many major city papers) was, at least at times, exceedingly good.  I do a significant amount of historical research and can attest to this.  I also live in a household which, not on the basis of my own support, <i>does<\/i> subscribe to a major city daily paper.  Whose quality is absolutely abysmal.  (The publishers themselves are something of an international joke.)<p>It&#x27;s almost certainly a self-reinforcing situation, but when front-page coverage is a mix of human-interest and international newswire coverage, when what little actual news that <i>does<\/i> exist is also largely hidden on inside pages and <i>also<\/i> almost exclusively news wires, when entire sections consist of graphic-illustration front pages and syndicated-content filler (Business, Homes, Living, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Autos, etc., with Sport being a possible exception), the value proposition becomes exceedingly questionable.  The exclusive realm of semi-original coverage is opinion and column pieces, though those too are lagely void of any material significance.<p>And when the writing style itself becomes so larded with stylebook syntactic candy that the reader must wade through hip-deep lakes of the stuff to find a single salient factual or contextual element ... what&#x27;s the use?  That&#x27;s above and beyond the near-total human-interest (or in politics, horse-race) elements of the reporting, rather than providing <i>any<\/i> level of background or context, let alone focusing on it.<p>All of which is well-illustrated in this BBC piece, nominally among the better journalistic sources remaining.<p>It&#x27;s sources available online -- blogs, interest sites, occasionally relic holdouts of higher-quality journalism (FT is ... pretty good, though even it was light on details in the item cited here), or often-mocked (with some justification) sites such as The Register, which actually deliver meat.  As well as the odd industry-specific outlet as with Computer Weekly.<p>One of the simplest, easiest, and most effective practices is simply to <i>list previous coverage on a topic.<\/i>  This is something <i>some<\/i> news sites do, but many do not. The BBC should absolutely adopt this practice.<p>Computer Weekly <i>does<\/i>, as noted in another comment on this thread.

I can’t really speak from a formal medical background but only really from an experience and results based perspective.<p>I see more and more people attending these types of activities because of “doctors orders”. And in many cases I see sports of any from just compliment whatever regiment the doctor has set out for the patient to begin with. I guess this is where physio has its place in the medical world as well, where patients need specific exercises to help with specific injuries.<p>Anyway, I want to point out the differences between the soft and hard approaches in the martial arts because I think it’s relevant. Not only are both approaches pretty much contradictory to each other but I find that what people find case-by-case within each practice can differ completely, which makes the whole thing quite subjective and difficult to measure.<p>The hard approaches are more fueled around explosive movements and repetitive training. From the students’ perspective the left to right body movement from this type of training is something that I’ve seen people with strokes or brain related illnesses use as a tool to help rebalance their motor coordination. In some cases I’ve heard people recommend dance because of the left right approach that comes with dancing, so not much to do with the style itself but rather the constant reshifting from the left to the right during training helps in this area, which has more to do with training methodology.<p>Where as for the softer arts, although you usually have to explain the advantages to the student, soft arts are more geared around slow movement and are aimed around longevity.<p>Personally I’m a bigger fan of the softer arts, simply because I prefer low resistance training myself, plus anyone with an injury who is looking for a sport, low resistance will be the better approach.<p>The issue I have with soft styles is that I have read a bit about Tai Chi and the medical studies surrounding Tai Chi. Sufficed to say the medical studies in this particular area have not gone well, in many cases citing little to no evidence that soft styles help with age reduction.<p>Although the evidence us martial arts teachers rely on are the case studies of our masters, for instance master x from martial art y lived until he was 100 and that’s because he practiced martial art y since he was 10, and so fourth. What I’d find interesting is if there are more substantial studies made in this area, I mean after all finding the fountain of youth is pretty much everyone’s dream."],"time":["2019-12-16 01:46:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21796948],"kids":{},"parent":[21796189],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-15 17:20:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["lngnmn1"],"id":[21796874],"kids":{},"parent":[21796189],"text":["Regular running or swimming would produce better effects.<p>Yoga is nothing but a regular routine of improving circulation.

Studies suggest that yoga practice may have an effect on the functional connectivity of the DMN, the activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while engaged in cognitive tasks, and the structure of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex- all regions known to show significant age-related changes [65, 66]. Therefore, behavioral interventions like yoga may hold promise to mitigate age-related and neurodegenerative declines. Systematic randomized trials of yoga and its comparison to other exercise-based interventions, as well as long term longitudinal studies on yoga practitioners are needed to identify the extent and scope of neurobiological changes.<p>With studies like this, my reaction is to assume that it&#x27;s not really about <i>yoga<\/i>, but rather just making a habit out of doing exercise and spending some time focused on something other than your cell phone or a computer.<p>There are plenty of good ways to get exercise and manage your attention, but you don&#x27;t need buzzwords to accomplish that.

I typed fast and didn&#x27;t edit at all. Writing succinctly and in easy to understand English is more difficult, for me.<p>---<p>I could predict that yoga has a good effect on brain health since I have the following hypothesis: whatever you do with a serious attentive concentration will be good for your brain in that specific area.<p>One question I have left is: to what extent will one be able to go beyond that area and use their cognitive benefits for similar but different pursuits?<p>I also have a hypothesis for that (I just don&#x27;t know to what extent it&#x27;s true, I read some research on it but it&#x27;s all quite tentative). It is: if one specifically focuses on an area, then the benefit will be specific. However, if one chooses a meta-topic (e.g. learning as fast as possible, increasing memory or increasing attention span), then that meta-topic will be trained and that person will be good in the meta-topic across all cognition. This presumes they are immersed in training this meta-topic though (i.e. it&#x27;s everywhere in their life).<p>Examples:<p>1 (normal topic). One chooses to be amazing at chess, and just at chess. Then, the brain benefits will only be helpful for chess.<p>2 (meta-topic). One chooses to learn as fast as possible, and chooses chess as the medium to measure progress. That person will be able to learn as fast as possible on many more domains. In part, also I presume that such a person is actively trying to use the meta principles from learning chess as fast as possible to solve other problems in their life.<p>So they&#x27;re not doing the same things. One is learning chess, and the other one is learning to play chess as fast as possible with the broader scope to learn anything as fast as possible.<p>One complicating factor is that the normal chess player can try to organize the meta-topics they have learned while playing chess. While this helps, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s simply less effective than what the second person would be doing.

Are any versions of the iOS or macOS kernel (or even user lands) utilizing this “across the board” now? I’d read papers and theory on strong pointer authentication to mitigate control flow attacks a very long time ago but I did not realize this was now “mainstream” in a consumer compiler (with support for multiple C-like languages to boot!); but it certainly is a tough sell without hardware support, both for security and (perceived) performance benefits. (I say perceived because it turns out that a lot of runtime safety checks are actually virtually undetectable as they are perfect fits for speculative execution and branch prediction, and very easily guessable with high success rates, as demonstrated by the rust benchmarks with and without runtime safety checks enabled having such close performance on modern x86_64 architectures.)<p>ARMv8.3 shipped with the instructions needed for this implementation of signed pointers in 2016, and presumably Apple played a good role in contribution this feature to the Clang codebase as no other hardware-accelerate authentication scheme is supported, per the document. I wonder if there are any plans to bring this to the desktop, by either of Intel or AMD. AMD is now in a position to actually develop new extensions rather than largely playing catch-up to Intel’s extensions (in recent years). (Then again, AMD remains the only one to really offer hardware acceleration for SHA [0], and that doesn’t seem to have really motivated developers to take advantage of that code.)<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neosmart.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;will-amds-ryzen-finally-bring-sha-extensions-to-intels-cpus&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neosmart.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;will-amds-ryzen-finally-bring...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-15 19:30:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["SCHiM"],"id":[21800111],"kids":[21800181],"parent":[21791269],"text":["Although nice in theory, contemporary implementations of the same scheme leave a lot to be desired.
