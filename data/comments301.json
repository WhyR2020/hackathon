That&#x27;s how labor economic works - it&#x27;s a market.<p>Investment bank and management consulting figured this out a long time ago. Example - when you new grad starts in i-banking, they&#x27;re in training for 4-6 weeks. Not doing anything productive, just training to do the job. Not the case in engineering, you are assigned user stories day one and your training is doing the work.

It&#x27;s click-baity. From the headline you&#x27;d think it would be a discussion about why engineers hop jobs so frequently, why in particular FAANGs seem to be so attractive, and what we could do to increase retention. Instead, the post just quickly summarises what we&#x27;ve known for ages (turnover is a big problem), very briefly goes off on a completely irrelevant tangent (that it&#x27;s more likely for an engineer to change the company than to be hit by a bus, which is true, but pointless) and then tops it off by the insane suggestion that &quot;just use Rails&quot; is the answer to all of your turnover woes (more on that below).<p>2. There is an interesting discussion here to be had: <i>why<\/i> exactly do companies suck so badly at retaining talent? My take on it is that we all (companies, developers, etc.) routinely emphasise the wrong things (office perks, showing off tech skills, etc., instead of a good understanding of the product) and burn people out, but as said: this is a much larger discussion. More importantly though I disagree with the received wisdom that &quot;developers are developers&quot; and domain knowledge is worth nothing. Of course, you always should be prepared for the worst (i.e. the proverbial bus), but it should still be the companies&#x27; priority to retain good people as long as possible because once somebody leaves, so much knowledge just goes to waste and has to be reacquired. At my last company, my whole team was fired because they thought that some other team would be just as good for the product, ignoring the fact that we&#x27;d built up the product ourselves and all the knowledge for two years. But to the higher-ups, the view was that developers are exchangeable.<p>3. The author just really comes across as immature and uniformed with their unilateral praise of Rails. I&#x27;ve worked on Rails apps so messy that they were almost impossible to understand. And, by now, Rails is by far not the only framework with strong conventions and a lot of out-of-the-box support for many common things - Spring Boot for example (whatever its faults) arguably supports even many more requirements. But more importantly, for any kind of non-trivial app, the complexity is not just in the technology: it&#x27;s in the (often contradictory) requirements, the different architectural tradeoffs, the little gotchas, the personalities in the team, etc. etc."],"time":["2020-08-11 20:39:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["catwind7"],"id":[24123699],"kids":[24123840],"parent":[24122265],"text":["&gt; Everything gets a lot easier if you select the right software and framework, primarily if you use Ruby on Rails.

Public CAs are unaffected, the only major service that broke was AWS RDS, and they&#x27;ve been awesome and fixed it in time for the release (but customers need to regenerate certificates). I honestly did not expect this change to make it and I am thrilled about it and what it means for keeping the Go X.509 ecosystem modern and secure. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;39568#issuecomment-671424481\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;39568#issuecomment-67142...<\/a><p>crypto&#x2F;tls Configs now have a spiffy VerifyConnection callback that runs for all connections (which is easier to think about than VerifyPeerCertificate) and that gets passed a ConnectionState. This was Katie&#x27;s idea to make the callback have access to SCTs and stapled OCSP (which makes it possible to write verifying callbacks for those, although we are working on built-in suppport!) but I also love how it delivers the parsed certificates and makes it trivial to customize verification. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;tls&#x2F;#example_Config_verifyConnection\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;tls&#x2F;#example_Config_verifyConn...<\/a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cl&#x2F;229122\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cl&#x2F;229122<\/a><p>What I should have started with: session ticket keys and session tickets are now rotated automatically without any impact on the application :sparkles:, greatly mitigating the main weak link in the forward security chain of TLS 1.2. :happydance: This is a. big. deal. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.filippo.io&#x2F;we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.filippo.io&#x2F;we-need-to-talk-about-session-ticket...<\/a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cl&#x2F;231317\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cl&#x2F;231317<\/a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cl&#x2F;230679\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cl&#x2F;230679<\/a><p>Besides deprecating Common Name, X.509 verification also now has a consistent story on how to handle invalid hostnames: they are matched case-insensitively 1:1 to certificate fields without wildcard or trailing dot processing.

I find that I injure myself less on the bike, probably because of my very flat feet and unwillingness to mix in the strength training that would make me less injury prone when running. Running isn’t bad for your knees (or any other body part) but doing it a lot and not paying attention to issues is a recipe for disaster. I ended up injuring myself repeatedly because I was chasing the feeling that I got from running.<p>I’m still chasing that feeling on the bike. I don’t get quite as zen on the bike. I think it’s because there is more speed involved (going into my mind at 20+ mph isn’t a good idea) and because I’m not getting the proprioception feedback (there’s just something about ambulating through space that’s hypnotic). I still get the post-exercise benefits and I’m hoping to chase down more of the zen as I go farther and farther on the bike.<p>I think the article has some dubious reasoning when coming up for justifications for why ultramarathons tend to attract rich white guys. I think the biggest elements in any endurance sport are time and overall nutrition. If you don’t have the time to train and the resources to fuel yourself consistently with high quality food you’re probably not going to enjoy training and participating in ultra endurance events, no matter how much you “yearn for a rawer form of human experience” or want to exercise your “control-and-conquer mentality.” Societal inequality means that the people who have an excess of time and money can participate, hence the rich white guys.<p>I’m grateful to be one of the lucky ones who can participate, even though I probably only qualify for one half of the “rich white guy” descriptor. I’m fortunate to be self employed, which gives me a lot of control over my schedule.<p>Final thought: The anecdote about the Kenyan professional is ridiculous. The “motivated” amateur calls out the professional for quitting the race when he injured his toe and says it’s because “he wasn’t there to suffer,” then goes on to insinuate that the professional only wanted to feel good. In reality the Kenyan professional relies on running as his profession (one which likely gives him a better standard of living than almost any other opportunity in his country) and rightly wants to protect his body as it needs to be in good working order to do his job. What kind of person puts down a professional for looking after himself so he can feel better about running a long distance?"],"time":["2020-08-11 21:34:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["762236"],"id":[24125073],"kids":[24126283,24126850],"parent":[24118718],"text":["The author is confusing pain and suffering --- they are not the same.  When you push your body to its limits, you will suffer, such as forcing yourself to continue running despite fatigue, but without damaging yourself.  If you are feeling pain, such as a hurt toe (like in the article), or due to a joint problem, then you have to stop to recover.  Pain does not scale when you push your body to its limits, and can&#x27;t be ignored.  A typical off-the-couch athlete can successfully ignore pain because they&#x27;ll go back to the couch and recover for weeks or so.  An endurance athlete that ignores pain will just cause a larger injury that needs even more recovery time in the long run, and since the catabolic destruction of fitness during recovery is exponential, you come out at a disadvantage by ignoring pain.  A couple days to recover vs weeks to recover.  If you are in the middle of an event and suffer some type of injury, you stop --- continuing despite the injury is stupid (and so many people are taught that they are losers if they stop, which is so dumb --- continue and hurt your performance at the next event)."],"time":["2020-08-11 21:44:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["01100011"],"id":[24124846],"kids":[24125084,24126682],"parent":[24118718],"text":["I&#x27;ve always felt that endurance activities, anything longer than a few hours, build a sort of toughness that you just don&#x27;t get from regular sports.<p>I&#x27;ve been on many hikes where it&#x27;s an all-out mental battle to keep going.

What happens when you have different doctrines in power? What do the prototypes of each model look like? What does the Big(O) of resource distribution look like (and where are the leaks).<p>In a government managed system, you have a MASSIVE amount pooled resources controlled by whoever activated (or coerced) the most voters. What is the worst case scenario? Whoever is in power has a narrow list of buddies with businesses. Lucrative government contracts with little oversight on spending are taken to people who have some favor with the elected officials or their family members (and pay officials back in insider stock trading, or planned small stock dumps, or some other form of laundering). Money accrues to the family tree of those in power and those in power make all important decisions, eventually draining the country. Read the news in Eastern Europe for a while to see a live simulation.<p>Foundations. Anyone can start one, fulfill a mission, work to make the world a better place. A lot of foundations are doing a lot of good out there, so where does that model leak? With stringent requirement to hold no profit at the end of the day, worst case scenarios with foundations look like this: Similarly to government, the distribution of large quantity of pooled resources can go to the team running the foundation. In some, the executives collect whatever money is left at the end of the day (can&#x27;t leave a profit after all). In others, a foundation on the side of a lucrative business gets the profits to reduce the tax burden on the business, but then distributes those to friends as contracts or generates sales from that business at increased margins, etc. How do you know this is happening? If you look at the ever increasing number of foundations, there are no incentives to create economies of scale in giving, despite the high fixed costs of running of foundation. Where are the foundation mergers that would make giving more efficient? Thus the tax incentives given by government can sometimes turn foundations south.<p>Where do Billionaires come in? A actually self-made billionaire has presumably lost the need to be corrupt. They have also proven themselves able to lead people to execute projects efficiently. The combination of resources, networks, and lack of misaligned incentives makes them more likely to focus on the impact of the work, than on self-enrichment with it. The down sides can happen if the original billions were a con-scheme and not actually acquired (Madoff), or if the billionaire is completely incompetent in the field they are giving in, or if they do it for the attention and ego boost, and social favors that may come from being asked for money. With all the attention paid to one person, however they can be more easily scrutinized than the other two models.<p>Please do feel free to contribute to this analysis tree."],"time":["2020-08-11 21:36:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bobthechef"],"id":[24125596],"kids":{},"parent":[24123546],"text":["1. The power of money depends on the greed or neediness (also when created through usury) of those receiving it. A billionaire doesn&#x27;t have any power to do any more than anyone else. It&#x27;s the willingness of so many to exchange their labor, etc. for money that allows billionaires to exert outsized influence on things they should not have influence over. Instead of blaming the cause of the temptation, take a good look at your own moral mediocrity and how you respond to the temptation to sell out. I know many people in tech who bitch and moan about this or that corporation, but suddenly become silent the moment they end up working for one of those corporations (such as through an acquisition).<p>2. Conversations about the 1% often betray an underlying pathology of envy. Many hate billionaires because they&#x27;re envious of what they have. Why would inequality of material goods be a problem per se? You can see that it isn&#x27;t when you compare someone with an upper middle class household income with a billionaire. Does that upper middle class family really have a reason to shake their fists at the billionaires when it comes to income? No, of course not. Who cares if some guy makes X times as much as you? (If you have a problem, then perhaps you ought to check your envy.) The problem isn&#x27;t inequality. It&#x27;s poverty. And the boorish worship of Mammon.<p>3. The belief in zero sum wealth is utterly false. Everyone who understands basic economics knows that the economic wealth of the world today far outstrips any other epoch in history. The idea that billionaires only have what they have because they effectively stole it from you is exactly the kind of agitation that communists would engage in in Soviet Russia and Maoist China and the tumultuous years that led to their creation. It&#x27;s the politics of envy and it&#x27;s a hideous affair.<p>4. There are of course problems associated with billionaires that is not intrinsic to the wealth they possess. For example, the influence billionaires have over politics and society through the media, through education, through lobbying, and so on. They may be dealt with in various ways, such as actual committed and personal involvement in improving your local community in some way instead of raging ineffectually on Facebook and Twitter. A lazy, effeminate populace that only knows how to complain, and yell, and emote deserves what it gets.<p>5. While socialism is a tyranny, a grotesque perversion (and no, the Scandinavian countries aren&#x27;t socialist), rapacious and ideological capitalism is likewise unnatural and perverse. By &quot;rapacious and ideological capitalism&quot;, I really mean one that is laissez-faire in a doctrinaire way, where the market is the dominant social institution and the consequent ethos one of consumerism and commodification of everything, one dominated by powerful corporations unanswerable to government or public opinion, doctrinaire about the minimalization or elimination of social welfare institutions even in the absence of a sensible private alternative, and globalist of a kind that is opposed to corporate and individual loyalties to the nation state.<p>6. Sure, billionaires can run self-serving philanthropies. I doubt it stems from a feeling of guilt, but I don&#x27;t know the individual consciences of billionaires (and conscience need to be formed to feel guilt, something that has been categorically discouraged by our culture along with shame and the concept of sin). Some may wish to genuinely do good. Some may be interested in their next conquest. Some may be afraid of the mob. Certainly, Zuckerberg&#x27;s &quot;free internet&quot; plan for India was a patently obvious move to magnify his own power. The guy seems pathetically oblivious to how transparent he is.

Let&#x27;s say that there is no filter, and every species that doesn&#x27;t destroy itself or get destroyed will eventually become technologically advanced to travel around meaningfully in space.  There is a certain amount of time it will take for this to happen.  Supposedly the universe is ~14B years old, and Earth is ~5B years old.   It takes a certain amount of time for abiogenesis, a certain amount of time for life to evolve, and a species to emerge &quot;victorious&quot; long enough to start conquering the universe before the next extinction event.  So we could be the &quot;first&quot;, or the top 20% anyway, and it&#x27;ll still take us a while for those top 20% to get anywhere where they can start detecting&#x2F;traveling anywhere.<p>2) What is the maximum distance any extraterrestrial life could observe our technology&#x2F;planet currently?  \nSpace is huge, like uncomprehendingly huge... even if we could go anywhere ourselves right now, would we go visit every single planet everywhere without a reason to?  And how long would that take?  Maybe there hasn&#x27;t been enough time for a civilization to a) detect us from 100s of light years away and b) travel to us.  Maybe detection of life from far away is impossible past a certain point, but traveling there isn&#x27;t (since it just takes time).<p>So I guess my thought is, yeah, we might not find life in our solar system, but we might.

Use associated with image post<p>Using images associated with your post is that the first and most vital step of image optimization, the program cannot see your images but it directly affects the user who visits your post.<p>The images utilized in the post tells about your post, after seeing the user photo, guess what he will get to read within the post. We get tons of clicks due to the image, which increases the CTR.<p>2. Image Name optimize<p>The name of the image utilized in the post should be chosen correctly. a bit like we&#x27;ve to use the keyword within the title of the post, similarly it&#x27;s necessary to use the keyword within the image name also.<p>The name of the image is often by default sjfirr1.jpg which isn&#x27;t correct from the attitude of SEO.<p>You have to vary the name of your images and use your keyword in it, this may help your post to urge ranked within the program.<p>3. Image Alt Tag optimization<p>An alt tag is extremely important as a part of optimization. The program runs the image space as a space which isn&#x27;t correct from the attitude of SEO. If we use alt tag text, then the program crawls alt tag.<p>4. Image size optimization<p>Image size features a direct impact on the speed of your website, you select the dimensions consistent with the theme.<p>Keep in mind one thing that if your blog is on Blogspot, then you&#x27;ve got to scale back the dimensions of images before loading them within the post, you&#x27;ll reduce the dimensions very easily by using a paint tool.<p>5. compression<p>The higher the quantity of the image file, the longer it takes to load. So you&#x27;ve got to compress your file. you&#x27;ll use an image compressor to compress online images.<p>I hope you&#x27;ve got read my post Image optimization and understand what image optimization is and why you ought to roll in the hay ..?<p>If you discover my post correctly, then you want to share and like my post."],"time":["2020-08-11 01:57:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["aamritri"],"id":[24116345],"kids":{},"parent":[24114206],"text":["Amir Articles is home for learning blogging, knowledge of Games, and Best Articles in different categories for free.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amirarticles.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amirarticles.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-11 03:38:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["yeswecatan"],"id":[24114527],"kids":{},"parent":[24114206],"text":["Interesting that Dara wrote this holier-than-thou opinion piece as this came out.

DjVu is relatively limited in scope. Postscript (as a document display format) has never been well-supported on Windows and is increasingly poorly supported on Linux due to rarity. XPS is perhaps the most direct &quot;PDF replacement&quot; but is nearly equally complicated (being based on the MS Office OOXML formats, giving it a similar cursed heritage to PDF&#x27;s basis in the Photoshop PSD format), and there was never really a compelling argument to switch to it.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is the suggestion that PDF should be replaced by HTML. The purposes of the two formats are basically orthogonal and replacing one with the other is doomed to failure. The author&#x27;s argument seems more akin to &quot;print-layout documents should be replaced by hypertext,&quot; and perhaps this is true in some cases, but it&#x27;s definitely a different matter and one that the author&#x27;s arguments don&#x27;t really support that well.<p>In my opinion, hopefully more humble than the author&#x27;s, PDF&#x27;s main downside is the remarkable unevenness of the quality of the creation and reading tools, considering its supposedly &quot;reads everywhere&quot; nature. The &quot;reference implementation&quot; is a commercial product and supports a huge list of features that are rarely or never supported by third-party commercial or open-source implementations. The Linux toolchain still widely used with PDF (e.g. Ghostscript) is decidedly outdated and hard to work with, but there&#x27;s not a lot of momentum towards development of more modern tools. All of these issues are likely rooted in the basic fact that the PDF format is extremely complicated, and so thoroughly implementing it is a massive undertaking.<p>The author&#x27;s complaints about performance in particular reflect the flexibility and complexity of the format. Web browsers have mostly switched over to using pdf.js to render PDFs, which is completely satisfactory for documents that consist of text or images (like scanned documents), but can be absolutely unusable when dealing with extremely vector-heavy PDFs like GIS exports.<p>Even printing PDFs can become rather frustrating as the complexity of the format means that parse-related printing issues are relatively common. Even Acrobat, for a long time, would munge certain characters when printing due to some sort of inconsistency with how different generators and readers implemented font embedding leading to Acrobat not being able to locate the embedded character font. This seemed most common with the letter &quot;l&quot; but maybe I&#x27;m imagining that... but also maybe it reflects some frightening detail of the format or implementation behavior.<p>One of the most common issues around PDF consistency comes down to file size... different PDF generators are prone to create representations of the same document that are significantly different sizes. Scanners are often an extreme example, some combination of not &quot;knowing the tricks&quot; for PDF optimization and a probably very low-performance compression implementation means that low-end network scanners often produce PDFs that are hilariously large. Opening them in Acrobat and using the &quot;optimize file&quot; tool can reduce file size by 90% without apparent visual impact... the whole fact that Acrobat has an &quot;optimize&quot; tool (and that Acrobat Distiller used to exist) speaks to the scale of this problem. Inspecting PDFs that are &quot;optimized&quot; by Acrobat can be an alarming experience, as well. You may remember that this played a strange role in Obama&#x27;s birth certificate some years back, as Acrobat seems to normally split PDFs into all kinds of different layers and apply strange transformations to them when it &quot;optimizes.&quot; It&#x27;s hard to know how much of this is actually &quot;best practice&quot; versus just a result of Acrobat accumulating decades of eccentricities.<p>So the bottom line is... PDF is too complicated for its own good, but then so are a great deal of other formats in widespread usage, like modern webpages which require complex parsing of multiple formats to render, and a great deal of historic cruft brought along with them. I&#x27;m not sure that there&#x27;s any sound technical argument that PDF or web pages are a &quot;better format,&quot; it&#x27;s all a matter of opinion over whether you prefer print-format documents or hypertext, and that&#x27;s going to be very application-specific."],"time":["2020-08-10 20:19:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GnarfGnarf"],"id":[24111952],"kids":[24113085,24119752,24112301,24118880],"parent":[24108950],"text":["Although I agree that PDFs (and screens in general) are not the best for reading, the PDF file format is a minor miracle.

PostScript was a Forth-like programming language that contained excellent 2D graphics primitives, including bezier curves, 2D transforms and most importantly, support for scalable fonts. PostScript was ground-breaking for its time and is the reason for Apple&#x27;s early success. If it wasn&#x27;t for PostScript and laser printers the Mac would not have been successful.<p>PostScript was implemented in laser printers and printer drivers output PostScript language programs when you printed from an application like Notepad in Windows. High-end illustration and DTP programs output their own custom programs instead of being limited by the program output by the printer driver.<p>Over time it became obvious that the programming language features of PostScript were not being used very much. Printer drivers typically output a fixed header containing some function definitions then they use these functions over and over for drawing the content of the page. What if these function definitions could be built in? Then the programming language capabilities such as loops and conditionals could be left out and we would still be able to do everything we&#x27;re doing with PostScript. In fact the resulting technology would be even more useful because rendering a page can be done without implementing a programming language interpreter. Thus PDF was born.<p>PDF made perfect sense in the early 90&#x27;s when it was designed. Page Description Languages didn&#x27;t need to be burdened with a programming language because no one was taking advantage of the language features. But then came the World Wide Web.

However, in PDFs, those techniques aren’t always used and content creators tend to favor quantity of content over quality and formatting. This leads to overwhelmingly long and inane PDFs.<\/i>&quot;<p>&quot;PDFs tend to lack real substance, compared to regular web pages.&quot; Really? Really?

Linear and limiting<p>Perfect for information discovery. Rich annotations and hypermedia features (external links, document-internal links, TOC) in PDF fix pretty much all issues stemming from this. All searchable (if the PDF has been constructed properly). Permanent, static structure vs everchanging, confusing messes of websites. The web is NOT QUOTABLE and unusable without advanced full-text search. Barely an URI remains stable.<p>&gt; 2. Jarring user experience. PDFs look completely different from typical web pages.<p>Typesetting on the web is a clusterfuck. Subpar microtype. Font rendering issues galore, tens of versions of popular fonts purchased at different points in time from different vendors with differently messed up CSS font configuration settings. Fonts are not embedded, but hyperlinked. I want a maximum fidelity reading experience for large portions of text and classic formats, because familiarity aids navigating a complex document. There is no need for fancy styles and whatnot.<p>&gt; 3. Slow to load.<p>Renderers differ in quality and speed. PDFs render lightning fast at acceptable settings and if you wanna tune for maximum quality, you can do so at the expense of slower rendering. Besides, it took 2.401ms to load the web page these points are writteen on, excluding content blocked by ublock origin. This point is delusional. A 700 page beautifully typeset PDF opens and renders in &lt;&lt;1s on my 7 year old laptop, and my reader will prerender pages to speed up navigation even more.<p>&gt; 4. Stuffed with fluff.<p>The entire paragraph is invalid because PDF has all those features.<p>&gt; However, in PDFs, those techniques aren’t always used and content creators tend to favor quantity of content over quality and formatting.<p>The same goes for most web content put out today.<p>&gt; 5. Cause disorientation. Because PDFs aren’t web pages, they don’t show a standard navigation like a website would.<p>Document structure is clearly presented in tree on the right side if the PDF is properly annotated&#x2F;hyperlinked and the reader has a TOC view (productivity tooling should have this). Websites lack this discoverability almost always, and if they have it, it looks different and works differently everywhere, creating disorientation.<p>&gt; 6. Unnavigable content masses.<p>This has nothing to do with PDF and everything to do with the reader in use. A semantic desktop would index all file content, allow cross-linking between files using file:&#x2F;&#x2F; or other protocols, and generally expose all content to a local or internet search engine. Google search indexes PDFs just fine! (Again, a badly constructed PDF may not contain text at all or broken text, but that&#x27;s a generation problem.)<p>&gt; 7. Sized for paper, not screens.<p>This is correct, and an advantage, because the web and most other screen content lack the fidelity of typesetting systems like LaTeX, ConTeXt, InDesign etc which each incorporate decades of digital best practice, and several decades more of typesetting knowledge.<p>It is an disadvantage in special settings, like on mobile, but even then, PDF text can be reflowed with appropriate software.<p>&gt; Users Strongly Dislike PDFs<p>It&#x27;s my favourite format for archiving documents, knowledge, and even website printouts."],"time":["2020-08-10 18:24:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["auggierose"],"id":[24114311],"kids":{},"parent":[24108950],"text":["PDF is great, especially for books and papers.

I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>Instead, they provide each page with a sidebar that links to other pages, turning the whole collection into a directed graph of pages full of dead ends and regions that have no links to other regions.<p>You reach some page where the sidebar links to X, Y, and Z, which are all things that depend on what you learned on that page and you are now ready to learn. If you follow the X link, you may end up learning all about X but may never again see the links to Y and Z unless you remember that a dozen pages back you saw them and purposefully seek them out. It&#x27;s very easy to not even realize that you missed a whole major subtopic.<p>In a linear format, such as an actual book, a PDF, an EPUB, or even a plain text file, the author or editor makes a decision on how X, Y, and Z should be ordered. Maybe they decide X, followed by Y, followed by Z. Maybe they decide X, then Y, then things that depend on both X and Y, then Z, then things the use X, Y, and Z.<p>Different authors might pick a different ordering, but they point is they have to choose something. Whatever they choose, you just keep turning the page and you&#x27;ll hit it all.<p>For a big subject, maybe you don&#x27;t want to hit it all. I&#x27;ve seen math books address this by having a list or diagram in the front giving you alternate orders to go through a subset of the book if you just want to learn just a subset of the subject.<p>In theory, HTML should be great for this, especially HTML with JavaScript. You could have a page that lets you select from different learning paths, and then the JavaScript would put &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons on each page that take you through all the pages on your selected learning path. You could still have the sidebar links, but if you follow one the JavaScript could add a &quot;Return to Learning Path&quot; button so you can always get back on track.<p>But until more HTML authors put in the effort to provide a linear path through the material that books&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;EPUB&#x2F;text formats force their authors to provide, PDF and to a lesser extend EPUB will remain the best option for most people trying to learn a long and complex subject online.<p>(I give PDF the nod over EPUB because most EPUBs do not have mathematical notation that looks as good as it does in PDF. I don&#x27;t know if this is a technical limitation of EPUB itself, or of the EPUB readers I&#x27;ve used, or of the authoring tools used to create the EPUBs, or simply the authors didn&#x27;t know how to do it right).<p>A good example of HTML authors putting in the effort is &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; online edition [1].
