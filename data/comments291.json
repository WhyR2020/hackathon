Attribution is the big, thorny problem in _all_ of advertising e.g. how do you know if Customer A saw Ad B and that they then went on to buy Product C.<p>In my experience this type of tech has two goals:<p>The first is measuring distribution with aggregate data about how many people saw the ad and when, then combining this with ethnographic data about the location (e.g. what proportion of people in this area fall into income bracket Y). This looks like &quot;1,293 people have seen your ad in the last 60 minutes and here some demographic information about them&quot;. This is done with video and gait tracking, or radar&#x2F;lidar for measuring volumes and people who &#x27;engage&#x27; with the ad by lookijng at it for &gt;N $TIME.<p>This is all perfectly possible and scalable and is what ClearChannel are currently doing, the product trick is to make it &#x27;real-time&#x27; so advertisers can adjust their buys and unit distribution more flexibly when combined with digital signage (e.g. I&#x27;m going to move our ad from this unit in this location to this other unit in this other location in &#x27;real-time&#x27; as there&#x27;s more high net worth people there today). This also nicely ups outdoor spend (people use it more, it appears more sticky) but they also charge more for these more &#x27;dynamic&#x27; outdoor units. There&#x27;s a bunch of seriously dubious data the the publishers use to justify this new way of buying outdoor.<p>The second (and WAY worse one) is doing direct attribution (e.g. Did consumer sKIFW3890 see ad sdoflij0934r and then did they buy product 029w3r29 from merchant 203ei2-309ir). This has been the holy grail of outdoor for a decade but no one&#x27;s been able to make it work. ClearChannel very clearly WANT to do it, which is creepy as all hell, but in my reading between the lines (and working in the industry a little) I don&#x27;t _think_ this is what their Radar solution delivers, at the moment.

Hundreds of companies and thousands of people have tried it, and it&#x27;s never worked.  People are different all over, they&#x27;re not the same, so they don&#x27;t all want the same thing.<p>I stopped listening to the BBC World Service when it stopped being about Britain and started being &quot;The world&#x27;s radio station™,&quot; because it just got boring and repetitive.<p>&quot;Centralcasting&quot; is what almost killed radio in America the 1990&#x27;s. Jacor&#x2F;Clear Channel ate hundreds of stations across the country and had a computer in Kentucky decide what music should be played for an entire nation.  It didn&#x27;t work.  People flocked to iPods and streaming to get away from the homogeny. Those stations that kept true to their local content survived, and some thrived.<p>Even Sirius learned this with its satellite radio stations, and the DJs no longer pretend to be some monolithic continental presence in the sky, and instead talk about wherever they&#x27;re broadcasting from, and some even bend the playlist to match their geography, so it changes through the day as they switch from a host in Detroit to one in Boston to one in DC to one in L.A.  When I was in broadcasting it was called a POD — Point Of Difference.  Why can DJ A give me that DJ B can&#x27;t?<p>KCSN&#x2F;Northidge and WXRT&#x2F;Chicago are both AAA radio stations, but they don&#x27;t play the same songs.  They&#x27;re tailored to what their LOCAL audiences like.  That&#x27;s a good thing.  Apple Global Mega Huge Music One has no local audience, and zero feedback other than a subscriber count.<p>When I listen to a pop station in London, I hear different music than when I listen to a pop station in Los Angeles or Melbourne.  That&#x27;s good.  I listen to music from stations all over the world, and in genres I don&#x27;t ordinarily like, simply because I enjoy the discovery of new songs and artists that I never heard of.<p>Apple has enough money to keep this online for a very long time, even if no one listens.

To eliminate the virus, China tested all 11 million residents of Wuhan for coronavirus in just 14 days [1]. That&#x27;s more than 500,000 people per day. Dozens of asymptomatic carriers were found, who were then quarantined. Wuhan hasn&#x27;t had new cases in weeks.<p>China used a similar mass testing strategy in Beijing. When an outbreak appeared at the Xinfadi wholesale market in June [2], the government had a short (several weeks long) lockdown and tested more than half the city&#x27;s population. Some days they did ~400,000 tests per day [3]. This was possible because they sent in testing resources from across the country to Beijing. The outbreak was eliminated within a month.<p>I believe mass testing is an effective way to reign in the coronavirus.

Although Rand would not agree with the following examples, I&#x27;ve become convinced that the terms &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;socialism&quot; are really anti-concepts of the package-deal variety.<p>&quot;Libertarians sometimes debate whether the &quot;real&quot; or &quot;authentic&quot; meaning of a term like &quot;capitalism&quot; is (a) the free market, or (b) government favoritism toward business, or (c) the separation between labor and ownership, an arrangement neutral between the other two; Austrians tend to use the term in the first sense; individualist anarchists in the Tuckerite tradition tend to use it in the second or third.[12] But in ordinary usage, I fear, it actually stands for an amalgamation of incompatible meanings.<p>&quot;Suppose I were to invent a new word, &quot;zaxlebax,&quot; and define it as &quot;a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument.&quot; That&#x27;s the definition — &quot;a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument.&quot; In short, I build my ill-chosen example into the definition. Now some linguistic subgroup might start using the term &quot;zaxlebax&quot; as though it just meant &quot;metallic sphere,&quot; or as though it just meant &quot;something of the same kind as the Washington Monument.&quot; And that&#x27;s fine. But my definition incorporates both, and thus conceals the false assumption that the Washington Monument is a metallic sphere; any attempt to use the term &quot;zaxlebax,&quot; meaning what I mean by it, involves the user in this false assumption. That&#x27;s what Rand means by a package-deal term.<p>&quot;Now I think the word &quot;capitalism,&quot; if used with the meaning most people give it, is a package-deal term. By &quot;capitalism&quot; most people mean neither the free market simpliciter nor the prevailing neomercantilist system simpliciter. Rather, what most people mean by &quot;capitalism&quot; is this free-market system that currently prevails in the western world. In short, the term &quot;capitalism&quot; as generally used conceals an assumption that the prevailing system is a free market.

Such confusion prevails because it works to the advantage of the statist establishment: those who want to defend the free market can more easily be seduced into defending neomercantilism, and those who want to combat neomercantilism can more easily be seduced into combating the free market.

I tip generously. Both of these statements are simultaneously true.<p>The vast majority of the countries in the world (that I&#x27;ve visited) do not believe in percentage based tipping as we do in North America [1]. A tip either involves rounding up to the nearest unit of currency, or takes the form of a small service fee added to the bill.<p>In North America, we&#x27;ve arrived at a situation where waitstaff actually prefer a tipped environment (due to high upside potential, especially where alcohol is served) and are also beholden to the tip (due to huge downside potential i.e. laws that mandate a lowered minimum wage for tipped workers).<p>Getting rid of tipping by instituting a living wage can sometimes result in lower upside, so many workers end up being against a fixed livable wage. The calculation is that stochastic&#x2F;high upsides (at bars, large groups) is preferable to stable but middling upside (i.e. living wage).<p>On the other hand, the laws of supply and demand still apply. Without high food prices and corresponding demand at those prices, a restaurant can&#x27;t sustain an untipped staff. So getting rid of tipping is a gamble and not many restaurants, especially low end ones, are able to swing it. Restaurants that are looking to get rid of tips are banking on the fact that the demand will remain the same at higher sticker prices (which in theory, should be true since the effective prices have not changed -- culturally a 15-20% tip is almost mandatory) but psychologically this often isn&#x27;t the case -- unless you have a sign at the door that says (no tips required).<p>It&#x27;s a little bit like Uber&#x2F;Lyft. The economics doesn&#x27;t actually work out, but there&#x27;s something propping it up. In the restaurant world, it&#x27;s tipping.

Palate Pal is a next-generation natural sweetener that not only sweetens foods, but also enhances flavor. It doesn&#x27;t have any bitter&#x2F;&quot;chemical&quot; aftertaste like all other alternative sweeteners and also a single serving will last you 30-60 minutes REGARDLESS of how much food you eat with it.<p>It is made from miracle fruit. This fruit has been used for centuries by tribes in Western Africa to make their food more delicious. It contains a protein that safely and temporarily binds to your tastebuds to make sour foods taste sweet as well as remove unpleasant bitter and tart flavors. For instance, bite into a lemon and it will taste like lemonade. It allows you to discover flavors previously masked by those unpleasant tastes. A strawberry tastes even more &quot;strawberry&quot; and a plain greek yogurt now tastes much more creamy.<p>It is the first miracle fruit product that is convenient for daily use. Whereas competing products take 5-10 minutes to dissolve, mine takes 10 seconds to dissolve and contains only NATURAL ingredients. I believe miracle fruit has the potential to take willpower out of the equation of a healthy diet by making nutritious foods taste as indulgent as the junk foods that are otherwise killing us. No one has the patience to wait 5 minutes in the morning while they are rushing to school or work, so I knew this is what needed to be changed in order for miracle berry to go mainstream.<p>Please check out my website for more information and demos.

It’s insanely expensive, quality of life has been on the decline for some time, and the types of companies that made real estate there so expensive in the first place are also likely to be the ones that adopt remote work quickly and wholeheartedly.<p>SF aside, my best guess at this point is that many American cities are and will continue to actually see some amount of people leaving for lower cost and more spacious markets, especially if remote work optionality sticks in the way it looks like it will. But cities have enduring appeal - proximity to people and culture and things to do is just as much a factor as proximity to work.

Went from California to Southern Texas, up to New Mexico, over to Arizona, Nevada, back to California, up to Oregon, Washington, hit the upper border, came back down to southern California.<p>What I saw astounded me. It was like the scene from Grapes of Wrath, crossed with the Beverley Hillbillies, crossed with Tokyo Drift.<p>I saw people leaving in droves but nowhere was it as bad as in California. There is a mass exodus of the state and no one seems to notice it.<p>People&#x2F;families are buying vans, even ford&#x2F;chevy service vans to live in due to them looking commercial(less hassle from people &#x2F;police), and having blacked out windows. They are also far cheaper than an rv.<p>Speaking of rvs some people are having to buy non running ones cheap and permapark somewhere. This includes families with pets, with no other recourse.<p>Every rest stop&#x2F;flying j was people leaving or homeless people permacamped. I spoke to them regularly and the stories were truly heart wrenching.<p>I also saw more paper plates (license plates) than regular ones (this is hyperbole but not far off the truth I&#x27;m sure even people not traveling have noticed this). Many of these people seemed to not know or care how to drive. I can&#x27;t begin to guess as to the reasons but people in cars with paper plates were 90 percent of the time a-holes on the road, and I saw many of them in accidents.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the rant, I just am trying to say I&#x27;ve traveled the US extensively over my 40 years, but this one broke me. We have failed as a society, we do nothing for our most vulnerable, and its hurting us all.<p>I advise everyone to (when its safe) go to your local rest stops and flying j&#x2F;pilot&#x2F;whatever rest stop and talk to some of these people. Those homeless people I see so many complain about here (they&#x27;re crazy, druggies, they stink!) &lt;-all can be true, but they are still human deserving of your understanding and empathy, and I say this as someone who had a homeless guy threaten to eat my dogs. Obviously he had issues so I just left, but someone called the cops. Thankfully Santa Monica has mental health professionals the local police can rely on for such issues, so when I told them he did not threaten me or my life, he was left alone until mental health services could arrive. But I&#x27;ve seen far worse from the police in regards to homelessness in say, Bakersfield.<p>Also you will meet regular families, many now homeless, who have children with them or grandparents. Who worked their whole lives, some were even approved for unemployment months ago but never got a dime. Most families in the US can&#x27;t weather missing a single paycheck and these folks were asked to wait indefinitely, and its already been what, 6 months?<p>Or just talk to the ones who are moving, but don&#x27;t know where. Did you know that many property rental companies, at least in California, now demand 3 recent check stubs and proof of work, unemployment does not count. We literally have families who have money and still have to move out of state because by the time they got their money its been months since they last worked?<p>The moratorium on evictions was supposed to help people but guess what? Just like everything else it was perverted into something to hurt the people it was meant to help. Now no one wants a tenant that even may possibly be a risk in the future. We will see how long their properties are vacant before they begin begging for those families back.<p>Im sorry, I&#x27;m done, just all of this is so heartbreaking.<p><i><\/i>super late edit to add- the sheer volume of people I&#x27;ve met who were absolutely convinced coronavirus isnt real was mind blogging, especially since I lost several people close to me and know many others who were sick.

We never knew the real reason why, or if it was bigger than just a random app reviewer trying to apply Apple policy, until May 2019.<p>That&#x27;s when Bloomberg interviewed Phillip Shoemaker, who ran app reviews from 2009 to 2016 - regarding how Apple systemically removes whole categories of apps. I subsequently spoke to Phillip Shoemaker, who confirmed that Apple executives ordered the elimination of apps that drove downloads to the App Store. He said &quot;Your app drove download volume. Apple doesn’t want any outside sources to drive ratings. So yeah, we got rid of all app recommendation apps.&quot;  He said he thought it was unfair, but this was something Apple set out to do, and even as Senior Director of App Store (person directly in charge of App Review), he could not stop it.<p>The other thing that was hard to understand, is we used to have a great relationship with Apple. We were not flying under the radar. Since the App Store first launched in 2008, we used to be invited to all Apple events to see the new product launches, we met with the iTunes team to discuss upcoming initiates for the App Store, our apps were featured on the devices inside of many demo units into Apple Stores. It felt like a complete 180, and until this day I never got a formal conversation on what they actually objected to, beyond being pointed to a vague rule which was applied arbitrarily. They became a brick wall in terms of communication, and this is why I resorted to emailing Tim Cook. I assumed nothing would come of it, but it was the last thing I could think of.I never received a response, and never knew if he even got it, so I was shocked to see it again today from his inbox."],"time":["2020-08-17 21:11:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["headmelted"],"id":[24190396],"kids":[24191025,24191389,24190717,24191129,24190641,24190431,24192321,24191939,24191209,24190789,24191572,24191352,24190681,24190838,24191220,24208581,24206505,24192081,24203200,24227311,24195647],"parent":[24189341],"text":["I mean, there’s a point to be made about how much monopoly power Apple holds, and it’s now clear these questions weren’t asked until now because lawmakers were really sweet on the maker of their shiny iPhone - but this letter ain’t it.<p>The author is grovelling to the point of it being honestly pitiful.

The cost of a replacement part does not make economic sense. I either let the product sit disused on a shelf hoping to find the part cheaper at a later date, hock the device on eBay for pennies on the dollar for a parts shark to snap up then part out, or throw it in the trash because I’d rather not sell my eight hundred dollar phone for a hundred dollars and this at least gives me the satisfaction of cursing at Apple while I do it.<p>(Yes, the Apple story is an amalgam of many different adventures with different endings over a decade with many different devices, the majority of which were either ultimately written off or else repaired at prices that didn’t make much sense.)<p>Oh, in addition to sometimes doing my own repairs, I’m also the final arbiter when it comes to all IT purchases for a school.

Would like to know your thoughts too.<p>0. Lower rate from 30% to 15%\n-Apple still has monopoly, nothing changes.<p>1. Side loading apps:\nNot good! malicious apps can run amok, eg. $BIG_CORP$ will say - you will get 20$ credits if you sideload our app, and then surveil everything that is possible on the device. Here, we expect an average user to give all the permission that the app requests for.<p>2. allow secondary app stores:\n-not good as it depends on the quality of enforcement in secondary app store. For Apple, it is in their interest to maintain app quality in their appstore to maintain overall good user experience in their device, but motivations are not same for secondary app store. May allow malicious apps which deteriorate the user experience&#x2F;privacy similar to 1. And there will be a state where you will have to install 10s of app store just to install specific programs which is also not ideal.<p>3. Allow secondary payment methods:\n-Average user will have to give up their payment info to everyone who asks for it. Most of them will not be trustworthy nor we can expect all of them to maintain good security standards for saving payment info.<p>The biggest culprit of all this drama is Apple does not allow secondary payment inside apps AND also, if you have secondary payment outside of app, they do not allow that price to be lower. There is no competition, thus Apple can get away with whatever it chooses to. Thus the monopoly.<p>4. SOLUTION:<p>a) charge a flat fee for reviewing&#x2F;serving apps. If necessary, linearly increase it based on daily active users if they need more resource to support that app.<p>b) allow secondary payment providers (whitelisted only).<p>c) allow secondary payment price to be lower than Apple.<p>With this solution, there will be competition between payment providers which will drive the price down. Only whitelisting few payment methods which are trustable eg applepay, googlepay, paypal, stripe, etc will maintain security of payment data."],"time":["2020-08-18 02:58:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ngngngng"],"id":[24189390],"kids":[24189979],"parent":[24189153],"text":["&gt; but the benefit [the App Store arrangement gave] to developers was much less clear cut.<p>I disagree, I think the fact that so many developers built apps for iPhone supports my point.

Proving a violation in one of these markets may be a lot more challenging than the other.<p>A. Monopoly Power<p>The first step in proving a monopolization offense under the Sherman Act is proving the company possesses &quot;monopoly power in the relevant market&quot;. In determining monopoly power, the courts start by examining market share, but &quot;but typically do not find monopoly power if the firm (or a group of firms acting in concert) has less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service within a certain geographic area.&quot; [1]<p>Obviously, with Apple&#x27;s current market share of 46% [2] in the United States, they are unlikely to be considered possessing monopoly power in the smartphone market.<p>B. The &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot; Market and Aftermarkets<p>Since proving Apple&#x27;s monopoly power in the smartphone market seems unlikely, Epic instead alleges Apple has monopoly power over a different market: &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot;. Since Apple has complete control over iOS App Distribution, problem solved, right? Not so fast.<p>Much like razor blades and razors or printers and ink, &quot;app distribution&quot; would be considered an aftermarket of the smartphone market. Aftermarkets are very common in antitrust cases, and in general, the US legal system does not allow you to define an aftermarket in the context of a single brand&#x27;s product unless very specific rules are met:<p>&gt; <i>Because it would be inappropriate to punish a firm for its natural monopoly in its own products, courts embraced a sweeping prohibition against analyzing alleged anticompetitive activity by focusing on single-brand relevant markets: &quot;[A]bsent exceptional market conditions, one brand in a market of competing brands cannot constitute a relevant product market.&quot;<\/i> [3]<p>A good summary on antitrust issues in aftermarkets can be found here. [4] Of particular relevance is that an aftermarket monopoly based on a customer&#x27;s voluntary agreement to a contract is not considered a &quot;relevant market&quot; for antitrust purposes.<p>In <i>Blizzard Entertainment Inc. v. Ceiling Fan Software LLC<\/i> [5], Ceiling Fan Software attempted to argue that Blizzard held monopoly power in the market of &quot;add-on software for WoW&quot;, and preventing them from releasing their own WoW add-on was a violation of antitrust law. Blizzard argued (successfully) that the &quot;WoW add-on&quot; market was not the relevant market because WoW users voluntarily agreed to a EULA stipulating they would only used Blizzard authorized add-ons when they initially purchased the game, and if they wanted to use third-party add-ons they could have purchased another game instead.<p>In <i>Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp.<\/i> [6], Psystar Corp attempted to argue that Apple held monopoly power in the &quot;Mac OS&quot; market and used it to unfairly block competition in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket. The court ruled that Apple&#x27;s monopoly power in the &quot;hardware that runs Mac OS&quot; aftermarket was based on the EULA that customers of Mac OS agreed when they purchased Mac OS, and was again not a relevant market for antitrust purposes, because <i>&quot;customers knowingly agree to the challenged restraint&quot;<\/i>. In other words, if they didn&#x27;t like the restriction of not being able to install Mac OS on non-Apple hardware, they could have purchased an alternative operating system instead.<p>Circling back to the iPhone and its app distribution aftermarket, it seems the same reasoning would apply here. If the iPhone EULA specifically states that customers can only install apps via the App Store, and the customer knowingly purchases the product knowing such limitations are in place, it seems very unlikely that a court would agree that &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot; is actually a relevant market for antitrust purposes.<p>C. The &quot;iOS In-App Payment Processing Market&quot;<p>On the other hand, the antitrust claims Epic makes regarding this market are much more compelling because unlike the app distribution market, customers have no information about the restrictions in the relationship between the developer and Apple, and they certainly did not agree to any such restrictions when they purchased their phones. Without a contractual restriction in place, the determination of whether the &quot;iOS In-App Payment Processing Market&quot; is a relevant market depends on multiple factors which I won&#x27;t go into too much detail here or this post will be even longer than it already is, but suffice to say they have a much higher chance of successfully making this argument.<p>Epic also has a strong argument here that Apple requiring in-app payments to go through the App Store and taking a 30% cut of each payment directly harms consumers by increasing prices, and lacks any justification other than to hurt competition. And the rebuttal that you can buy a different product without this restriction falls flat because the other major product on the market also charges the same cut.<p>The upshot of all of this is it seems unlikely that Epic will be able to compel Apple to permit third-party app installation on the iPhone, but they may be able to successfully argue against the restriction that all in-app purchasing must go through the App Store.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;tips-advice&#x2F;competition-guidance&#x2F;guide-antitrust-laws&#x2F;single-firm-conduct&#x2F;monopolization-defined\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;tips-advice&#x2F;competition-guidance&#x2F;guide-a...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpointresearch.com&#x2F;us-market-smartphone-share&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpointresearch.com&#x2F;us-market-smartphone-sh...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;metzler-v-bear-automotive-service-equipment-co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;metzler-v-bear-automotive-service-...<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;us-submissions-oecd-2010-present-other-international-competition-fora&#x2F;aftermarkets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;us-submissions-...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;blizzard-entmt-inc-v-ceiling-fan-software-llc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;blizzard-entmt-inc-v-ceiling-fan-s...<\/a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;apple-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;apple-2<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-18 01:59:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["williesleg"],"id":[24190177],"kids":{},"parent":[24189153],"text":["Epic = China\nLet the flame wars begin.\nAlso, please post first if you&#x27;re a CCP member first, so we all know."],"time":["2020-08-17 20:26:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sunkenvicar"],"id":[24195184],"kids":{},"parent":[24189153],"text":["I hope the federal government takes care of these rogue Chinese Companies."],"time":["2020-08-18 06:12:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["pier25"],"id":[24189721],"kids":[24190069],"parent":[24189153],"text":["Essentially, it&#x27;s a win-win for Epic.<p>If they win the lawsuit they will (probably) be able to have more control over how they want to distribute their iOS apps.<p>If they lose, they won&#x27;t have to deal with iOS anymore.

It opens up Google and Facebook to world of costly business dealings.<p>With little effort, I could start “Deco’s Local Newspaper” and publish a few issues online. This will give me a pathway to force Google to “deal with me.” This negotiation, mediation and arbitration could incur Google thousands of dollars in employee time, arbitration fees, and paying for half of the legal costs. Google cannot say “no” from the start. They can’t even ignore me without being in violation of the new legislation.<p>Relevant snippets:<p>“...  news media businesses can participate in the code if:<p>- They predominantly produce ‘core news’, and publish this online: [...]<p>- They adhere to appropriate professional editorial standards: [...]<p>- They maintain editorial independence from the subjects of their news coverage: [...]<p>- They operate primarily in Australia for the purpose of serving Australian audiences: [...]”<p>“If the parties have not reached an agreement for the inclusion of news on digital platform services within three months of negotiation, and the parties have attended at least one day of mediation, news media businesses can elect to commence arbitration.”<p>“Arbitration under the code would be performed through ‘final offer arbitration’. The digital platform and news media business (or a collective of news media businesses) must each submit a final offer on the remuneration to be paid by the digital platform within 10 days of the commencement of arbitration. Parties would then have a further 5 business days to provide comments on each other’s offer.”<p>“After receiving submissions and comments from the parties and the ACCC, the arbitrator would have 30 business days to choose one or the other of the parties’ ‘final offers’, which would form a binding agreement between the parties.”<p>Therefore: I can force Google to enter into an agreement with me (even as a small business) and incur thousands of dollars of overhead costs in the process.<p>I’m not one to use hyperbole, but this is insane. I would not be surprised if Google turns off Google Search entirely for Australia when this code passes.<p>Also, this legislation is specifically for Google and Facebook:\n“Digital platforms must participate in the code if the Treasurer makes a determination specifying that the code would apply to them. The Government has announced that the code would initially apply only to Facebook and Google. Other digital platforms may be added to the code if they hold a significant bargaining power imbalance with Australian news media businesses in the future.”<p>This also seems strange, though I’m not against legislation specifically for mega-corps.

Over time, such actions become less painful and future issues affect you less because you have the experience and maturity to deal with them swiftly.<p>This article just spins it all towards negativity. That last cop-out paragraph was a joke. A guided meditation app? I am all for a pro therapist to help people talk through their problems and help better explain their own thoughts and actions... but an app? Seriously? The whole point to meditation is for you to have better understanding of yourself. Not for someone else to dictate your own thoughts. A good therapist doesn&#x27;t guide you to a pre determined path. They push you to walk your own path.<p>Damn, these things piss me off so much.

Watching the self, knowing the self, and extricating the self, in order to be freed from the problems of self (which is thought to be causing the depression and anxiety).

It really refers to prolonged concentration on something. We do this all the time. Yogis or occultists refine the term further into 3 stages: a brief concentration, a prolonged concentration (i.e. meditation) on something real and tangible like a symbol, and meditation on the idea behind that something real and tangible. Knowledge workers are very familiar with meditation, although they don&#x27;t recognize it as a special activity. However that 3rd stage is unattainable for most people today: ideas are qualitatevily different. Mastering meditation on ideas switches mind into a special state. From that point directing mind at things like sun, moon, light or more abstract ideas like the relationship between space and sound produces significant effects or just summons ideas and thoughts about them. This is how great scientists make discoveries: they direct their mind at some topic and summon ideas about it (they don&#x27;t produce ideas with induction or deduction) and then they materialise ideas into more tangible math."],"time":["2020-08-17 23:16:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rvn1045"],"id":[24186951],"kids":{},"parent":[24185710],"text":["Meditation will make you more sensitive to whatever you are feeling.

The idea behind this is that depression manifests as distorted thoughts (e.g. &quot;Everyone hates me, I should die.&quot;), and the goal is to notice these thoughts and learn to substitute them (eventually automatically) with thoughts that are more productive&#x2F;positive.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, most meditation practices are very helpful for the &quot;notice the thoughts&quot; part, but, especially in non-religious settings, tend to neglect the &quot;substitute the thoughts&quot; part. Usually what I hear is something like &quot;notice the thought and let it go.&quot;<p>So if the thought &quot;Everyone hates me, I should die&quot; comes up during meditation, you just notice it and let it go. That often provides some relief in the short term (you&#x27;re no longer actively thinking about dying), but you&#x27;ve done nothing to prevent it from arising again later, and you haven&#x27;t learned any coping techniques for when similar thoughts <i>won&#x27;t<\/i> go away (which can be a symptom during severe episodes). If you have depression or anxiety and want to get into meditation, I would strongly suggest at the very very least researching the principals of CBT in case you find yourself in this situation. I would recommend an app called Woebot. Even better would be to try some actual CBT if you are able.<p>All that said, I think that for me joining a meditation group was beneficial for me because of the social aspect more so than the actual meditation. This group emphasizes community (sangha) and service pretty heavily. A lot of people get social benefits from other religious communities, but as someone who didn&#x27;t grow up in a religious household, I find Buddhists super easy to get along with. They tend to be very accepting, especially to newcomers, since they are taught not to make judgements of others.

The absolute worst period of depression I went through was when I was single, living alone, working a job I hated, in a city that was far too encouraging of drinking as the only viable past time (Philadelphia). I was very fearful of medication at that time. I had heard a lot of bad stories, not just about side effects, but about <i>effects<\/i>, like the medication removing both the lows <i>and<\/i> the highs of their emotional state. There were also stories of negative consequences for people&#x27;s jobs: losing security clearances and the like (which are very old stories by now, but such rumors don&#x27;t have a lot of respect for changing times).<p>I was able to get out of that state through career coaching. I was feeling bad because I hated where I was in life. Fixing that, I got a lot happier. It felt really good to put form to my woes, to put a target on them, and eliminate it, one by one.<p>I got married. I had kids. And then I hit another, big, depressive period. Work had been a mess going on 5 years by that point. My wife gently pressured me into going to see a doctor and get medication.<p>I did the medication for a while, and it helped at first, but I think it mostly just confused my own, internal understanding of my emotions. I started it about 2.5 years ago, in the middle of a hellscape of an office. After a year, it just stopped working. The doctor increased my dosage levels, but things never went back to square. I think what happened was that I just recalibrated my understanding of my emotions. I had physical cues before the medication: heart racing, running thoughts, a physical feeling of the floor dropping out from under me. Now, I lacked those feelings, but I actually recognized situations in which I should have felt them, and in some ways the lack of the feelings felt like stumbling, like taking a step for a stair that isn&#x27;t there. I spent another year on the medication, under the belief that things would be a lot worse without it.

Because the brilliance of this attack is how it &quot;jumps the blood-brain barrier&quot; between a developer&#x27;s machine and their canonical codebase. Usually, code review and auditing of what goes into a commit prevents this kind of attack from leaping to VCS. But Apple makes the pbxproj so inscrutable, and does such a good job at hiding all its complexity behind (usually well-designed) wizards and dropdown menus, that people take it for granted. If code shows up there, people <i>believe Apple intended that to be the case<\/i> even if, say, your last commit was a small change in Interface Builder (or whatever they call it nowadays). Your code reviewer might just skip the file entirely, because they&#x27;ve been trained to expect the same.<p>And that&#x27;s scary.<p>At the end of the day, this is just another way of exploiting the lack of a mature and centralized CI ecosystem in the modern package distribution world. There&#x27;s no organization running a security-minded linter on pbxproj files as a general rule. But, then again, there doesn&#x27;t need to be a linter on package.json or project.clj or Makefiles because there was never a history of hiding complexity - if that file changes, you&#x27;d better darn well know what you&#x27;re doing. What we have here is a perfect storm of move-fast-break-things package management, a file designed to slip through code reviews, and a pretty creatively designed malware payload.<p>EDIT: Perhaps another way to look at it is that having one file responsible for both compilation <i>logic<\/i> and non-compilation-related IDE-specific <i>file status<\/i> can be problematic. It&#x27;s like your Makefile also needs to be your .gitignore-but-only-top-level-is-allowed-and-all-files-need-to-be-whitelisted.
