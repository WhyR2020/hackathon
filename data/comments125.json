On the backend, our APIs are built in Scala, with Go and Java powering some of our custom services.<p>We are excited by people who want to constantly innovate; borrow from other industries, experiment with new tools and pool their knowledge with other solution seekers; people who have shipped entire projects with ownership and autonomy; people who take pride in what gets built, all the whilst balancing day-to-day pragmatism with building for the future.<p>Current open roles:\n- Backend Software Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4586921002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4586921002<\/a>\n - Systems Software Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002<\/a>\n - Security Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4629664002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4629664002<\/a>\n - Frontend Software Engineer (Performance)  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4363932002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4363932002<\/a>\n - Frontend Software Engineer (Design system) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4655086002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4655086002<\/a>\n-Site Reliability Engineer\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002<\/a>\n-Technical Support Administrator\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4675597002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4675597002<\/a><p>Tech stack: Scala, Go, GraphQL, ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, DynamoDB, AWS SQS, AWS Kinesis, Docker, Terraform, AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus, AWS &amp; Linux.<p>Apply: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tray.io&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tray.io&#x2F;jobs<\/a> or get in touch with london-talent@tray.io"],"time":["2020-03-24 16:20:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dmay1028"],"id":[22771374],"kids":{},"parent":[22665398],"text":["Zocdoc is hiring in NYC and PHX.

The cloud from IDC includes SaaS. Things like ERP and CRM.<p>And they even said this<p>&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS) will be the largest category of cloud computing, capturing more than half of all public cloud spending in throughout the forecast. SaaS spending,<p>Which basically makes the blog and ~60 comments on HN so far irrelevant. The absolute vast majority of growth are going into SaaS, aka Microsoft&#x27;s Exchange, Dynamic 365, Office 365, SalesForce etc....<p>What about IaaS?<p>&gt;IaaS...., will also be the fastest growing category of cloud spending with a five-year CAGR of 32.0%.<p>That is great. Until you look at the number closely,<p>&gt;China will experience the fastest growth in public cloud services spending over the five-year forecast period with a 49.1% CAGR. Latin America will also deliver strong public cloud spending growth with a 38.3% CAGR.<p>What that means is that the CAGR, while impressive, will mostly be focused on market that are not current well served, China, India, Latin America, South East Asia. Of Course Europe and NA are also growing, but likely at a comparatively lower pace.<p>All these are 3 years from now, a very short period of time in terms of infrastructure building.

One can look at Google Vs Microsoft as example.<p>It seems the money right now is on HPC, AI, Scientific Computing, Deep Learning, all these seems to have infinite appetite of computation power that even with 1.4nm by 2026 the performance still would not have satisfy needs.<p>But what about normal Web Server usage?

Smartphone sales, and user growth has slow down, IaaS usually being lagging behind in supply, are we nearing the end of the growth curve?

I was once sitting in a bar, and had a different challenge related to Bar TVs and Live Events.<p>My local brewery has 2 cable boxes, and on one particularly busy Thursday night a TV was devoted to some rerun of a college basketball game. I wanted to them to switch to a hockey match, but that took a lot more time than one might expect. Not only did I have to get the bartender&#x27;s attention, but she had to find the remote and figure out what channel it was on while awkwardly holding the controller close to the TV. While she was trying to take this action, there were other customers waiting, which clearly should take priority since serving them drinks would actually make the bar money while my request was just a courtesy.<p>It made me think about a hardware box and associated web site where patrons could upvote what they wanted to see on the TV. It would leave the mediation and decisions out of the staff&#x27;s hands and let them focus on what makes the bar money. Obviously, a bar could blacklist certain channels to prevent trolling and the bartender could have final say in case of big events.<p>Taking this one step further, the device could also be used to determine an ideal event. Rather than leave the channel up to one&#x27;s personal taste, the box would default to the most popular game&#x2F;event at a particular time (as gathered by other boxes on the network). This way, patrons who don&#x27;t know about the service are less likely to leave if they don&#x27;t see the game playing when they walk into the bar.<p>I think someone else commented that it could be hard to justify this purchase with the advertising feature alone.

So, the gain is lower for stronger signals, and very high when there is no signal at all.<p>Fun fact: B&amp;W TVs are more suitable as computer terminals because they have more bandwidth for the luma signal. Color TVs have to filter out the chroma signal, which reduces the bandwidth for the luma. If you are stuck with a color TV for your terminal, consider modifying it to accept a signal after the low-pass filter.

Stationary tints mean you need to demagnetize, random tints per pixel mean there is noise on the beam control.<p>&quot;I see color noise on a digital TV...&quot;<p>A digital TV has no noise, it works or not.<p>A rendered analog signal (from a VCR empty tape or from an analog tuner &#x2F; receiver) will be b&#x2F;w at the origin.<p>Then the analog signal is converted to a digital signal and here trouble can lurk in the detail:<p>Before the conversion from analog to digital, the above rules for analog signals do apply: no blanking period means no color signal went in.<p>Your analog inputs to a digital TV or monitor can come from<p>dual tuners:<p>even if there are no analog TV stations you might have an analog signal from some arcade games, from a camera abusing of an analog TV channel, or an old VCR you light into your digital TV via analog channel 2 or 3 (you need to know what a rotary dial phone is to understand this....).<p>Again: academically these should be strictly b&#x2F;w after conversion from analog to digital.<p>Some reasons how conversion imprecision can add color to &#x27;white&#x27; noise:<p>Bad converters used to convert from analog to digital can include &#x27;dust&#x27; in the rapidly generated digital pixel value.<p>That is a software issue in the converter. A 0 is not exactly zero, a one is a little less than all bits on, and some bits are picked sometimes in the middle. When I say here and from here on &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27; I am talking about &#x27;all bits 0&#x27; and &#x27;all bits 1&#x27; in the per pixel color depth value.<p>Bad video a&#x2F;d converter designs use FP units on fast and cheap general-purpose chips: again: 0 is not exactly zero ever and 1 is at most .999999. they do some mantissa tricking to process, e.g., a 24 bit pixel signal through an FP unit which is a general-purpose, cheaper (and faster, vectorized) chip than a real video converter chip.<p>This creates a hue that is different per pixel and per instance (the same digital pixel lights up in slightly different hues each time it is used)."],"time":["2020-03-24 03:03:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lifeformed"],"id":[22669047],"kids":[22669636,22670721,22671996,22669105,22672099,22669587,22669368,22669129,22672962],"parent":[22668208],"text":["I&#x27;m in Taiwan in day 6 of home quarantine right now.

The data could be stored more safely with something like Intel SGX, where only the application can access the data. In this scenario, the carrier (or healthcare worker), uploads the carrier’s path into SGX-based database. Then, individual users that are concerned about their risk could use the app to upload their location paths into the SGX-based system and learn if they are at risk as a simple yes&#x2F;no. (I have never built an SGX application, so I might be mistaken on its abilities.)\n2. I don’t think this is possible: “The solution is a ‘pull’ model where users can download encrypted location information about carriers” If the application is on my device, I can decompile it and get the decryption key or use other methods to dump the carriers’ location data to disk. \n3. It seems that the user’s data is also stored on the device. This data is then at risk of being stolen by malicious applications.

In 1979 I did a Post-doc with Rod Burstall. I helped implement the programming language Hope, which was the first functional programming language to use pattern-matching in function definitions. The implementation was written in an older language called POP-2. Robin Milner and his group were at the the time working on LCF and ML, and they eventually incorporated Burstall&#x27;s pattern ideas. Eventually, I recall there was a decision within the UK functional programming community to consolidate their efforts into what became Haskell. And of course we see how much Haskell has influenced the newest crop of imperative languages.<p>It is interesting (to me) to compare factorial in Rust with factorial in Hope:<p>Rust:<p>fn factorial(i: u64) -&gt; u64 {<p><pre><code>    match I {\n\n        0 =&gt; 1,\n\n        n =&gt; n * factorial(n-1)\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n}<p>Hope:<p>dec factorial : num -&gt; num;<p>--- factorial 0 &lt;= 1;<p>--- factorial n &lt;= n* factorial(n-1);<p>Note that, in Hope (unlike its own inspiration, Prolog, and, I think unlike Rust), the order of the rules does not matter: the most specific pattern takes precedence. Hope was primitive with respect to types, and did not use Milner&#x27;s type inferrencing ideas. I don&#x27;t think Burstall ever intended it to be a &quot;real&quot; programming language. When I left Edinburgh, Don Sanella took over from me, so I was not involved in writing the paper about Hope, but my contribution is acknowledged.<p>I implemented the pattern matching code, and the idea of pattern compilation occurred to me. I remember showing it to Rod.

This was great for usability, as one would expect from a language that was <i>designed<\/i> for natural language processing.<p>Later systems switched this to lists of character <i>codes<\/i>, denoting code points in the used encoding. For instance, when using ASCII or one of its supersets, &quot;hello&quot; would then mean [104,101,108,108,111], which is much less readable in answers.<p>Still other systems introduced their own <i>ad hoc<\/i> types that were not lists and therefore could not be handled with Prolog&#x27;s built-in mechanisms for reasoning about lists, most notably Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs), and thus even required their own dedicated and usually <i>moded<\/i> predicates for reasoning about them, thereby severely limiting their generality while increasing the complexity of application code.<p>Only the most recent Prolog systems, such as Tau Prolog and Scryer Prolog, are now doing what Marseille Prolog did, namely treating strings as lists of characters, and are also beginning to combine this with efficient internal representations to finally get all advantages at once: usability, generality, simplicity and efficiency.<p>Type checks are another example where Prolog systems are now going back to the solid foundations of Marseille Prolog, after decades of errands. For instance, to preserve monotonicity of Prolog programs, type checks must raise <i>instantiation errors<\/i> or delay the check if no decision can be made, e.g., the following would be a logically well-justified response because X can still <i>become<\/i> an integer:<p><pre><code>    ?- integer(X).\n    ERROR: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis is also what Marseille Prolog did, for very solid reasons that were very clearly outlined by Battani and Meloni. Prolog vendors soon found out that Prolog systems would sell better to customers who did not care about logical properties if such — to them strange and likely worrying — errors were not shown, and opted to instead answer such queries with <i>silent failure<\/i>, which is logically <i>wrong<\/i> and prevents for example declarative debugging techniques and different execution strategies such as iterative deepening:<p><pre><code>    ?- integer(X).\n    false.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nNow, logically sound type tests are appearing again in Prolog systems. For instance, Scryer Prolog already ships with library(si), where we have:<p><pre><code>    ?- integer_si(X).\n       caught: error(instantiation_error,functor&#x2F;3)\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis is <i>correct<\/i>: We get an instantiation error, because no definite answer can be made at this point. X can become an integer, or a term that is not an integer, so answering either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; would not be appropriate, because the type of X cannot yet be determined.<p>A third example for this are <i>constraints<\/i> like dif&#x2F;2, which is a relation with very desirable logical properties, denoting syntactic <i>disequality<\/i> of terms, i.e., it is true if and only if its arguments are <i>different<\/i>, and it <i>delays<\/i> checks until a definite decision can be made. This was present even in the predecessor of Marseille Prolog, Prolog 0, and then treated at best as a strange curiosity or not present at all in many later systems before it became more widely available again.<p>Using constraints also enables an even more elegant solution for the above cases. For instance, using CLP(Z), constraint logic programming over integers, we can constrain a variable to integers in the most general way:<p><pre><code>    ?- X in inf..sup.\n    X in inf..sup.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnother very interesting aspect is the commercial context in which these systems were developed. There was a <i>lot<\/i> of money involved, Prolog vendors would give you a licence for thousands and tens of thousands of dollars, and still do today. Not that long ago, when you did a research project as a university student in cooperation with one of the Prolog vendors, the vendor would personally fly over and hand you a hardcopy of the system manual. Then, after you finished the project, the vendor would visit you again to take away the manual."],"time":["2020-03-22 22:59:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["verdverm"],"id":[22660785],"kids":{},"parent":[22658770],"text":["I&#x27;ve been using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cuelang.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cuelang.org<\/a>, a new logical language.<p>It&#x27;s frickin awesome, logical + engineering = get things done<p>We just released an initial dependency tool for Cuelang based on go mods<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hofstadter-io&#x2F;mvs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hofstadter-io&#x2F;mvs<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-23 03:42:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pmcjones"],"id":[22659418],"kids":{},"parent":[22658770],"text":["Some background on the project: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcjones.org&#x2F;dustydecks&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;1064&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcjones.org&#x2F;dustydecks&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;1064&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-22 23:36:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Twisol"],"id":[22661036],"kids":{},"parent":[22658770],"text":["I&#x27;ve been fascinated by concurrent constraint programming (CCP) for a few years now, but it&#x27;s hard to find source code for any of the system from back then.

But there is no chance you could get the records onto a modern phone safely (or even legally under HIPPA) with the hours my father gave the project.<p>Sure.<p>&gt; We can have the LAN-like experience of the 90’s back again, and we can add the best parts of the 21st century internet. A safe small space of people we trust, where we can program away from the prying eyes of the multi-billion-person internet. Where the outright villainous will be kept at bay by good identity services and good crypto.<p>&gt; The broader concept of virtualizing networks has existed forever: the Virtual Private Network. New protocols make VPNs better than before, Wireguard is pioneering easy and efficient tunneling between peers. Marry the VPN to identity, and make it work anywhere, and you can have a virtual 90s-style LAN made up of all your 21st century devices. Let the internet be the dumb pipe, let your endpoints determine who they will talk to based on the person at the other end.<p>OK, but we have VPNs now. The problem with keeping your medical records on a modern computer isn&#x27;t that your modern computer isn&#x27;t connected to your other computers. The problem is that it is!

One of them died.<p>2) The metric used to test the efficacy is viral load. You can get a negative on this and still have the disease.

Doing so add absolutely zero information, e.g., from the top three current Duck Duck Go search results for “here are”:<p>1. <i>“Here Are All the Major Concerts Canceled Due to Coronavirus”<\/i> – could just be “All the Major Concerts Canceled Due to Coronavirus”<p>2. <i>“Coronavirus: Here Are 10 Misconceptions Being Spread”<\/i> – this listicle could simply be titled “Coronavirus: 10 Misconceptions Being Spread” or “10 Coronavirus Misconceptions Being Spread”<p>3. <i>“Have Children?

It is 110% not good to have any major corporation go into a technical default. We are talking about companies which have plenty of assets and strong businesses.<p>Thus the Fed and US Government are&#x2F;should be acting to avoid any such rapid deleverage. It took Japan 2 decades to reduce leverage in the corporations. Without intervention the US could undergo this same deleveraging in a matter of months. It would throw the American people into such a deep poverty the likes of which we&#x27;ve not seen since the great depression.<p>Which is to say: these bailouts are going to happen.

Most of the doctrine is available publicly. For a heavy weapons company, see Appendix D of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;armypubs.army.mil&#x2F;epubs&#x2F;DR_pubs&#x2F;DR_a&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;web&#x2F;ARN6672_ATP%203-21x20%20FINAL%20WEB.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;armypubs.army.mil&#x2F;epubs&#x2F;DR_pubs&#x2F;DR_a&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;web&#x2F;ARN6672...<\/a><p>Going against tanks as an infantry unit is a tough spot. Tanks are significantly faster, more lethal, and harder to kill than any light-infantry unit.  In a defense, light infantry uses engagement area development to attempt to even the odds. Engagement area development is similar to building a defense in depth. A quick summary:<p>0. Analyze the enemy composition and disposition to determine likely avenues of approach. After that, build your engagement areas on those approaches.<p>1. When the enemy is far away, attempt to disrupt or turn their movement into the engagement area. This is typically a combination of scouts, artillery, or obstacles to channel the enemy into the engagement area.<p>2. Once the enemy is in the engagement area, keep them there (fix) as long as possible. Use priority targets and sectors of fire to efficiently concentrate fires on the most valuable targets which almost certainly includes tanks.<p>3. Finally, you block the enemy with obstacles to move to secondary positions.<p>The author&#x27;s first tactic of a trial shot of engaging at range is part of step 1. The goal is to force the enemy to change their movement, slow them down, or disable the active protection measures. This is a bit more difficult with a TOW missile than with a Javelin. Modern tanks will auto-rotate if you laser range find them directly. Since a tank round travels significantly faster than a TOW missile, a tank can kill you before the TOW missile reaches them. Since a TOW is guided by an operator via a wire, the missle with then miss.<p>The second tactic of multiple missiles would go in step 2. To avoid firing excessive missiles at targets, one technique is to &quot;shard&quot; the engagement area so subordinate units are responsible for parts of it.<p>The third tactic of using grenade launchers and mortars is questionable. We were taught that tanks are basically invulnerable to indirect fire (mortars and artillery). I don&#x27;t think a 60mm mortar would have any significant effect on a tank unless you score a direct hit. The precision on indirect fire isn&#x27;t good enough to directly hit a tank.  Hoping to trigger the tank&#x27;s active defense measure is a long shot.  Also, if you&#x27;re using a M320 grenade launcher with a max effective range of 320m against a tank, you&#x27;re going to die soon unless you have some other significant advantage like urban terrain.  The MK19 automatic grenade launcher is a much better weapon for trying to prematurely damage the tank&#x27;s defense with a range of 1500m."],"time":["2020-03-23 20:57:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jeffrallen"],"id":[22664912],"kids":[22666072],"parent":[22661946],"text":["War is stupid."],"time":["2020-03-23 16:19:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jasode"],"id":[22663665],"kids":[22664965,22665318,22667007,22664182,22666052,22666564,22663874,22665793,22664253,22667233,22667320,22664376],"parent":[22661750],"text":["The <i>&quot;move fast and break things&quot;<\/i> is just a web app version of previous sayings in other domains:<p>- <i>&quot;A ship in harbor is safe but that&#x27;s not what ships are made for.&quot;<\/i><p>- <i>&quot;If I&#x27;ve made more shots than you, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve _missed_ more shots than you.&quot;<\/i> -- variations of this from Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, other athletes<p>- <i>&quot;All great writers got better by writing a lot of _bad_ sentences.&quot;<\/i><p>- <i>&quot;If you want to learn how to ride a bike, roller skate, ski, snowboard, etc you&#x27;re going to have to _fall down_ a lot.&quot;<\/i><p>All of them are trying to be provocative in the same way:  expect <i>repeated failures<\/i> when experimenting&#x2F;exploring what success looks like.<p>So MFABT when compared to variations of previous quotes is pretty standard advice.

I normally have an idea of what clients are asking for before they finish their sentences. Then I extrapolate to the fundamental problems and meta concepts around their specific problem. I’ve already formulated solutions and am solving them in my mind, until I isolate the unknown steps (the hard steps), whose odds of me being able to solve them are the basis of my estimate. Most of my work today goes into research, setup, glue code, infrastructure and maintenance. Solving the client’s actual problem constitutes perhaps 5% of the work I must do.<p>* We can always iterate faster in our minds than in the real world. With a proper architecture budget, we can take time in the beginning to brainstorm the complete solution before we ever start writing code. Then if we follow proper quality assurance practices like test-driven development, we can write code that is free of technical debt and bugs. All the while exerting substantially less effort than writing the same thing several times.<p>* Agile programming wasn’t really a thing until the rise of large internet companies and the marginalization of individual software developers. It’s curious to me that the people with the most say in writing solutions have the least clout in organizations. I feel that this is due to supply-side economics and wealth inequality. So today we cater to client first, then organization, then software developer. That’s what the specialization in agile is really all about. But we should be doing something more like movie production, so the client is the producer, the organization is the director (or movie studio) and developers are the actors. The industry should have more confidence in the process and have conventions which mitigate the churn caused by clients’ fickleness and low understanding of the problem domain. But right now it feels like the emphasis is on getting every scene filmed as fast as possible. We pretend that developers have no gravitas and are just interchangeable cogs in the machine. It’s no surprise to me that most productions bomb in the box office.<p>To use construction as an analogy: programmers used to be akin to architects, spending time in the beginning to draft a plan that includes all contingencies so that the building doesn’t fall down (a right-brained or politically-blue approach based on creativity, insight, seeing outside the box, etc). Today we’re being told to be framers, hammering out solutions as fast as we can over and over again in order to get things done until the building is finished (a left-brained or politically-red approach based on a strong work ethic, discipline, loyalty, not getting distracted, etc).<p>I think these are both important, and over the last year I have been working on my “getting things done” side to improve my execution ability. But I will always be a dreamer and value the intuitive side of software development. The idea that we can manifest solutions in the real world with the power of our minds is what got me into programming in the first place. The trend towards application and turning programming into just another job has soured me on the field in general. I’m actually not entirely certain that I can do it anymore. So to me, the true cost of move fast and break things is the loss of people like me who thought that this was all going to go a different direction."],"time":["2020-03-23 19:08:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brosinante"],"id":[22663490],"kids":{},"parent":[22661750],"text":["The HN crowd (and related ecosystems) have been using this as a mantra for a decade or more now.
