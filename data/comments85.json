Do you want popular &quot;fun&quot; accounts or &quot;serious&quot; historical scholarship? Heavy on technical specifics or lighter on details and stronger on the historical big picture? All of those are fine, but the answer will mean you&#x27;ll want to look in different places.<p>There is a active subfield of academic history of technology that deals with the history of computing. It&#x27;s generally populated by professionally-trained historians who rigorously employ archival sources and tend to focus on the bigger picture, i.e. linking computing to wider historical trends and events (examples: the Cold War, Capitalism, the rise of programming as a profession, etc.). Some notable historians in this area are Mar Hicks and Nathan Ensmenger. The field is still growing and has a lot of ground to cover, but if you seek a deeper understanding (as readers of HN tend to do) then this is the place to go. Writing accurate history that also grapples with the big picture is hard, and it shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise that it takes specialists to do it.<p>There&#x27;s of course an abundance of popular accounts of innovation, along the lines of Walter Isaacson&#x27;s _The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution_. Academic historians of technology generally dislike these accounts because they focus on a small set of &quot;heroic&quot; individuals at the expense of the bigger picture. To pick on Isaacson a bit, he&#x27;s generally most interested in personalities (Steve Jobs, say) and must less interested in digging deeper into the economic and social history that lies behind the &quot;Digital Revolution&quot;. Nonetheless, these accounts sell very well, there are also tons of articles out there written in a similar vein, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with enjoying them provided you are aware that you&#x27;re only getting one version of the story.<p>I also like some practitioner-accounts, really more memoir than history; they give you a nice sense of what it was like to live through a particular set of changes and to be part of building systems that we now take for granted. A good recent example, if you are interested in the genesis of UNIX, is Brian Kernighan&#x27;s _Unix: A History and a Memoir_. Some excellent journalistic &quot;on the ground&quot; accounts also fall into this category of giving you a sense of what it was like to be there. The Soul of A New Machine, by Tracy Kidder is a good example.<p>Finally, there is some very good general history of technology that doesn&#x27;t focus exclusively on computing. An example is the superb _The Shock of the Old: Technology and Global History Since 1900_ by David Edgerton (polemical, controversial, easy to read, and even if you disagree with his argument it will likely change how you see technology forever)."],"time":["2020-04-18 23:33:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scubaguy"],"id":[22910399],"kids":{},"parent":[22907211],"text":["The introduction to Clean Agile from Bob Martin has a history on software processes as he personally recounts it."],"time":["2020-04-18 21:29:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["btcnews"],"id":[22909087],"kids":{},"parent":[22907211],"text":["Killer news Bitcoin vs Ethereum<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarket01.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;bitcoin-vs-ethereum.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarket01.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;bitcoin-vs-ethereu...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-18 19:02:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["andrewthebold"],"id":[22909435],"kids":[22911323,22909995,22920497,22910042,22919933,22913810,22911254],"parent":[22909419],"text":["Hey HN!

It was superseded by the IIGS, a 16-bit machine that competed favorably (with respect to graphics&#x2F;sound&#x2F;etc) with the mac.<p>The later IIc+ was mostly a cynical ploy by apple to drum up some cash while assuring that the Apple II line didn&#x27;t compete with the mac. In most ways it was a downgrade from the earlier IIGS. Its only real advantage was a slightly higher clock rate, which could be solved on the IIGS with an accelerator like the transwarpGS.  Further, not only was it an 8-bit only machine, its major upgrade was the replacement of the 5.25&quot; floppy with the 3.5&quot;. Which meant it didn&#x27;t run most 8-bit apple ][ software which was overwhelmingly on 5.25&quot; floppies. A number of applications were Prodos based and could be simply copied to 3.5&quot; floppies, but most games were DOS 3.3&#x2F;etc and effectively bound to the 5.25 format. By the time the &#x2F;&#x2F;c+ was released, the much less expensive Laser 128 (a clone) was filling the &quot;portable&quot; niche in a much better way.

Nationalism, ethnicity, religion, atheism, capitalism, socialism (and many others) are all components that can be combined in different proportions to create a complete ideology. Like a cooking recipe. The interesting thought is that no matter how one combines the variables, they converge to the same point. Which is, you must think and behave like we do, or you will be cast out. The filmmaker presents societies as swinging between the extremes of pure capitalism to pure communism, with the wealthy always maintaining an advantage. Interesting stuff.<p>That reminded me of Jonathan Rees&#x27; a la carte menu of features or properties of &quot;object oriented programming&quot; ideology (or objectology):<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;reesoo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;reesoo.html<\/a><p>&quot;Because OO is a moving target, OO zealots will choose some subset of this menu by whim and then use it to try to convince you that you are a loser.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d love for Slavoj Žižek to do &quot;The Perverts Guide to Objectology”!"],"time":["2020-04-19 02:03:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["joe_the_user"],"id":[22911315],"kids":[22912277],"parent":[22910702],"text":["Just started. It&#x27;s a use of contemporary &quot;continental&quot; psychology (Lacanian and Zizekian psychoanalysis) to consider the irrational choices that go into programming language.<p>It&#x27;s kind of out-there but anything that gives a wider view of the choices programmers make might be useful.<p>Edit: Watching a bit.<p>I would view the quandary the presenter is discussing thus.<p>Human being are both power-seeking, ego-gratifying being and &quot;rational&quot;, logic-using beings.<p>Now, human communicate with language. And a given &quot;speech act&quot;, is not going to a pure exercise in logic or a pure exercise in power-seeking but some combination. \nThen, consider that humans interact with discreet &quot;speech acts&quot;. A given speech act is going have an overt logical structure (simplify whatever math-y logic you wish) and it&#x27;s going to involve some degree of power assertion. The power-assertion part by a fairly simple mechanism - identify yourself with a symbol and argue that symbol is &quot;good&quot; (and further associate symbols with each other, other symbols with &quot;bad&quot; and so-forth, all in dynamic process of power assertion). The most common example is a national flag but lots of judgements and colorations come in with this. \nMoreover, speech is a sequence of &quot;speech acts&quot; and first speech acts in a given context tend to &quot;set the tone&quot; - power is dynamic so the first speech act in a context to set the context the most.<p>So, with all that, I think it one can find a useful explanation why curly-bracket-semi-colon language and block-structured language have an apparently eternal &quot;holy war&quot;.<p>Also, I think evolutionary game theory is a more coherent context for this. Evolutionary game theory allows the contrast between overt logic and self-seeking to be more clear and not have to call any process &quot;irrational&quot;."],"time":["2020-04-18 23:38:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ncmncm"],"id":[22912049],"kids":{},"parent":[22910702],"text":["&quot;if new true friend not protected for explicit private union, break case and try using this&quot;<p>All C++ keywords (and one operator).

If digital is the medium, then basically either pixel art or vector art are the two &quot;most authentic&quot; expressions of that medium.<p>2) Economically, shapes in Illustrator&#x2F;etc. are infinitely easier to tweak. If the editor wants you to adjust your image, you might be able to spend just 10 minutes making the changes, rather than 6 hours drawing&#x2F;painting up a totally new version. (Yes I know painting programs can support layers and other fancy things to help, but it&#x27;s still going to be harder.)<p>Also, because flat art requires a good eye but very little learned &quot;technical&quot; technique (as opposed to, say, watercolor or oil painting), a lot more people can do it (just keep tweaking the shapes until it looks right), and it&#x27;s very easy to achieve consistency across images, even if made by totally different people."],"time":["2020-04-18 16:24:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["iamben"],"id":[22907240],"kids":{},"parent":[22890877],"text":["The pay thing is pretty interesting.

They save code at a cost of understandability, subtlety, and new rules.

I just wrote a class based component to cache the results of a hook, so I could wrap it into a function that would throw.  I am not proud.  5 layers of abstraction needed where the same thing in a class based structure would be 2.<p>3) The hard part of UI is and always will be state.

Even if the switch is bouncing at the moment of the check it will be either interpreted as previous state before the switch or the next state after switch.<p>If you have delicate switch with good (for example gold plated) contacts, to extend the life of the switch it is then possible to only apply potential for a brief period of the check which means that during actual bounce the contact is very unlikely to see any sparks, extending the life of the switch.

For years though, the numbers just refuse to add up in Strongtowns favor.<p>If cost of maintaining roads and utilities in typical American suburban pattern is so high that cities can’t afford it, where are all the cities that went bankrupt because of it? Strongtowns argues that early on, it’s covered by the developers, but after its useful life, it must be replaced by municipality. Ignoring the whole issue of the original residents actually covering the cost instead of the developer (clearly, the developer didn’t just donate the roads and sewers, it’s all priced in), how long do we actually have to wait for chicken to come home to roost? I live in a suburban development in Seattle, packed row to row with the single family houses with yards and garages that Strongtowns says is a bane to long term finances. The median age of the house is probably something like 50 years, with a good amount over 100 years old — it’s a relatively old neighborhood. When will the road costs will finally kill our budget?<p>If you look at the city budgets, there is no mystery: road maintenance is simply a very small part of municipality budget. It simply doesn’t cost as much as Strongtowns keeps implying. The infrastructure maintenance budget is dwarfed by everything else.<p>Just look at the numbers: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattle.gov&#x2F;city-budget&#x2F;2020-proposed-budget#&#x2F;sdot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattle.gov&#x2F;city-budget&#x2F;2020-proposed-budget#&#x2F;sdo...<\/a> Road maintenance is what, $150M-200M counting generously and adding some overhead? Even if you apportion all of that to suburbia, compared to total budget of over $6B, it’s not going to make a serious dent.<p>That the road costs are low in suburbia can even be seen with a simple back of the napkin calculation: assuming cost to repave a mile of suburban road to be $1M, house frontage of 100 feet, and useful life of road at 30 years, you’re looking at $20 000 per house over 30 years, or less than $700 per house per year. Sure, that’s not nothing, but how much do you already pay in property taxes?<p>In short, while I think many suggestions of Strongtowns are good in their own right, and would indeed improve many places in America, the infrastructure costs story simply doesn’t add up."],"time":["2020-04-18 19:18:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["formalsystem"],"id":[22909033],"kids":[22910865,22909329],"parent":[22908734],"text":["I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ve built in the US but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like we&#x27;ve built cities for people.

Thus, in the range of the first 5-10 years, local places often get a short-term influx of cash as new development pays local taxes spurred by infrastructure the city didn&#x27;t have to pay for. But it&#x27;s a bad deal, because the city is on the hook to maintain that infrastructure forever, and again, the long-term tax base is rarely adequate to pay for it.<p>This leads to a vicious cycle - which probably sounds familiar - where city officials are desperately chasing more &quot;growth programs&quot; from the state and federal level because they need the income to cover budget shortfalls -- but they aren&#x27;t stepping back to recognize that the budget shortfalls were actually caused by this same pattern played out over the last 50 years.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating, slow-moving train wreck, one of those things that is all around us, and once you see it, you can&#x27;t un-see.<p>Strong Towns exists to spread awareness of this situation.

There may be confounding variables that explain part of the effect and so turn the observed effects from being statistically significant to not being statistically significant.\n* The data on kills was self-reported, allowing bias to creep in.\n* All the cats were English-speaking.\n* Only 10 un-neutered pet cats were studied. I don&#x27;t know if being neutered would increase, decrease, or have no effect on the kill rate, but the subject is not discussed.<p>I also question the conclusion that cats have a significant impact on local fauna.<p>* The average kill rate for a pet cat was (roughly) less than two animals per week, which doesn&#x27;t seem very high. I&#x27;m left with the feeling that the authors had to resort to killings&#x2F;area to make the results impressive. \n* The authors did not report on the total size of the home ranges of cats compared to total area. So, for example, if the ratio was 1:1000, then so what? If the ratio was 1:20, then house cat might have a significant affect on local fauna.<p>Finally, I have a question about the presentation of the data: Figure 2b does not indicate that &quot;75% of cats spent 90% of their time in disturbed habitats&quot;. The graph indicates that 500+ (out of 875 cats) spent between 95% and 100% of their time in developed habitats.

The virus on the other hand is completely unwanted by both the user and the software- Its existence is threatened by all fronts.<p>However, a anti-cheat lives in a extremely adversarial environment. The cheater (and the cheat) wants the cheat on its computer. As such, the user will be willing to do extra steps to assist the cheat. This makes the anti-cheat software in this case, the &#x27;un-wanted&#x27; virus, so it has to exist in the most hostile of environments and somehow detect programs which have higher privileges than itself.<p>That said, Cheating is something that will not go away. Years and years ago, I developed with a friend of mine a completely undetectable cheat for all games on the HL2 platform. It involved a second computer, which man-in-the-middled all network data to the client computer. This second computer then would display a &#x27;radar&#x27; of where enemies were. As the anti cheat would have no possible way of knowing the existence of this second computer, there was not much they could do.<p>If you wanted to get more aggressive with the system above, you could have that second computer modify outbound requests as well. So if you shoot your gun and it would have hit the ground, it will now instead shoot a enemy in the head- as such even something like a aimbot is entirely possible with this setup.<p>However, there is indeed a anti cheat which can detect all known cheats and its basically what Valve did&#x2F;does for CS:GO - Allow users to report suspected cheaters and then have the community analyze the reports. This catches all blatant cheats, but unfortunately will never get rid of radar&#x2F;esp cheaters, only aimbots and the like.<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like there is a business model in the above. Years ago we had companies like evenbalance&#x2F;punkbuster, easy anticheat, etc.. which provided software based anti-cheat systems. As you would expect, most would by bypassed and a daily cat and mouse game would ensue. The solution imo is to create a SaaS where you essentially provide a reporting + monitoring tool. Users of your game can report suspected cheaters (which includes the demo file &#x2F; vod &#x2F; replay &#x2F; whatever) and your trained wet-ware staff would review all reports and take action where necessary.

During that time Nordic continually modified their developer API, completely changing it at least once.  They changed the chips themselves every several months also, and you had to match the API version to the chip.  They obsoleted old chips, so the code you had written would not run on the new chips, and it soon became difficult to find the old chips forcing you to upgrade to the new version of the SDK and change your code.  Example programs in new SDK&#x27;s often did not work because Nordic had not finished porting them.  None of the example programs were written to coexist with the others; if you tried to combine two examples the result would often fail.  The complexity of Bluetooth is also staggering; instead of writing code I could have probably spent those two years just reading the documentation, by which time substantial parts of it would have changed.<p>Before switching to Bluetooth we used the nRF51422 as an ANT+ radio.  The development experience was completely different, it was a joy to work with, example programs were simple and worked.  It was easy to code the things we wanted to implement.<p>My understanding of this extreme difference is (1) Bluetooth was designed to present a high barrier to entry, so that smaller device makers would have a hard time competing.  It is intentionally complex and difficult to deal with.  The standard for SD cards is similar (which is why almost all open source projects use the simpler, less functional SPI method of accessing an SD card.) (2) Nordic had a team for hire to write Bluetooth code for customers.  Some of the API turmoil might have been to make it difficult for customers to develop their own code so they&#x27;d have to turn to Nordic for software.  It&#x27;s difficult to prove either of those conjectures, especially since large corporations see a benefit in creating barriers to entry and will support them.<p>So basically no one reads the documentation, they try to work from the example programs, and stability and interoperability suffers because no one really understands what they are doing (the API&#x27;s completely obscure the underlying operations).  Hence Bluetooth is often unreliable, unless a company has a team devoted to it and spends a lot of resources on it.  The large gaps of undefined behavior don&#x27;t help either, the order of many API interactions is often absolutely critical, even when you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be.<p>Another factor is that Bluetooth subsystems are essentially real-time systems where timing is critical.  The chips are often sold as having spare MCU capacity for running your own code, but it&#x27;s not apparent in the advertising that your code needs to be pristine and flawless in handling interrupts and in how long running operations are handled.  Otherwise the Bluetooth firmware behind the API can easily lock up or start to do weird things.  So a device maker who tries to have the Bluetooth MCU do other things to save the cost of an external MCU can easily have bugs in their code that interfere with the operation of the Bluetooth stack."],"time":["2020-04-18 22:24:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["otabdeveloper4"],"id":[22905882],"kids":{},"parent":[22904442],"text":["Forget Bluetooth.<p>Why is Wi-Fi so unreliable?

I program in J[0], and dabble in Dyalog APL. Aaron Hsu&#x27;s work on the gpu compiler, he&#x27;s the implementor of Co-dfns, is nothing short of mind-blowing[1]. His arguments for using APL vs. more mainstream languages are cogent and persuasive. The paradigm shift from C-like or even Haskell (ML) type languages is too big a gap for most mainstream programmers to accept. My opinion is that aside from Python&#x27;s clean, indented syntax, the real reason it took off for DL&#x2F;ML, was Numpy and Pandas. Pandas was heavily influenced by the array languages per its creator Wes McKinney. Besides, I just like playing with J.<p>I have looked briefly at Futhark, and the apltail compiler[2], but I am trying to focus on the APL family, because my time is limited. I am a GPU dilettante who has tried basic CUDA in C. I tried Rust, but Zig [3] is working out better for me given I make more progress with less effort, using C APIs are effortless, but my Rust difficulties may just be my bias with PLs. I find Haskell easier than Rust.<p>I just read an HPC article today about a survey&#x2F;questionnaire about the languages used among 57 experts. It&#x27;s still predominantly C++, but with a lot pain expressed by the experts&#x2F;users. I agree SPIR-V sounds promising, and I hope to check it out. Just like DL, I think people don&#x27;t realize it needs to be knowledge domain and algorithms, or experts and software. Somebody has to setup the computation based on knowledge domain and software knowledge. This shows itself to me when I wind up running somebody&#x27;s program, because I don&#x27;t have my own specific problem I&#x27;d like to try and implement as a learning exercise and knowledge exercise.<p>Great talk!
