And one we’ve greatly under-explored, IMHO.<p>Probably mostly because people tend to be using either touchscreens that are mobile, or touch pads that are rather small, and so you can only fit one hand’s worth of fingers on the digitizer, and one hand’s fingers can’t (without training) do too many different things at the same time. So mostly we come up with gestures that move some or all the fingers of the hand in concert.<p>But if you had a digitizer surface that had room for <i>two<\/i> hands, you could do <i>a lot<\/i> with that. Moving a finger of one hand in a circle while the other swipes toward&#x2F;away from it; “unfolding” something by interlacing eight fingers in a line and sliding them to opposite ends of the digitizer; etc.<p>(I think Apple could easily introduce these for people who own both an iPad and a Mac. It seems their Sidecar support is already moving toward this, as it sends native touchpad input to apps—acting, in est, as a large Bluetooth multitouch digitizer—rather than just doing HLE emulation + transmission of the particular gestures possible in macOS currently.)<p>And sure, that all sounds a bit mystery-meat at first—no clear affordances. But it’s not any more mystery-meat than voice navigation is. Voice navigation is a “grammar” on top of regular spoken-language words; you expect the user to learn language at some point. Similarly, a “vocabulary” of multitouch gestures could all be taught to the user at some point—even practiced in an OS-shipped program resembling a typing tutor. (Back when mice first became prominent, OSes shipped with mouse-requiring games specifically to serve as mousing tutors!) Then you just have to teach the users visual&#x2F;symbolic mnemonics for these gestures; and then you can use those symbols as accelerator indicators in your regular menus and label text.<p>(Oh, and don’t get me started on what’s possible with a depth-of-field sensing camera, ala Windows Hello.

However, simulated QWERTY input in VR is significantly worse than it is on mobile, since unlike on mobile there&#x27;s no tactile feedback  at all; not even the rudimentary feedback of your fingers touching a flat surface.

Always be skeptical of the process, and ask good questions.<p>* Keep your experience in mind.  Mostly what software companies are looking for is experience.  Education is a nice to have, but it isn&#x27;t required to be a developer.  Education is never a certification no matter how much you wish it were or how expensive it was.  If you have no experience you should expect to start as a junior developer.<p>* You don&#x27;t need to be hired to obtain experience.  Nothing is preventing you from writing open source software personal project and making mistakes that you are learning from.  As somebody with a masters degree you are in a stronger position for advancing quickly compared to most other developers.

I think you&#x27;re better off using the Advanced Search function on LinkedIn Jobs to mass apply to recently posted jobs in your niche. Bonus points for having a coffee chat with the person who posted the job. Also, make a list of all the people who can vouch for your work, especially people that you&#x27;ve done research for&#x2F;with. Analyze their LinkedIn, find jobs at companies that they&#x27;ve worked with in the past, and ask if they can introduce you to someone at the company who can discuss the job with you."],"time":["2020-03-03 01:59:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["allovernow"],"id":[22468992],"kids":{},"parent":[22468924],"text":["Yes.

So consciousness is the hardware of reality and physical phenomena are the software, an inversion of the typical materialist view. (As a programmer, I&#x27;m not sure that metaphor really works, but I&#x27;ll allow it.)<p>The author presents this as an avenue for confronting the likelihood that even a perfect understanding&#x2F;modeling of the physical characteristics of a brain is unlikely to reveal anything about consciousness or subjective experience itself.<p>Seems plausible to me. Reality tends to make sense, so if it&#x27;s most likely impossible to make sense of consciousness by studying the brain, there&#x27;s probably some other way to look at it.<p>The idea that fundamental particles like electrons have some kind of subjective experience was hard to swallow at first, but then I thought about my cat. It&#x27;s safe to say that a cat&#x27;s consciousness is more primitive than a typical human&#x27;s. You can also say that cats (at least once you get to know them) are a lot more predictable than people and have a smaller set of possible behaviors and reactions. If my cat sees a bug on the wall, she&#x27;s going to do her weird hiss-snarl thing at it just about 100% of the time, and there&#x27;s 0% chance she&#x27;s going to roll up a newspaper and swat it.<p>If the consciousness of a particular entity can be ranked in comparison to that of other entities — like I would rank my consciousness as &quot;higher&quot; than my cat&#x27;s — and if entities with &quot;lower consciousnesses&quot; have fewer possible behaviors or reactions to stimuli (like my cat compared to me, or a broccoli plant in my garden compared to my cat), then it&#x27;s easy to imagine that something as elementary as an electron could be conscious in some way and still obey what appear to be totally deterministic rules. (Electron may have been a bad example since we can&#x27;t really observe them like we can cats, but the point stands.) Another way to state it would be that as consciousness rises, so does free will (or, at least, scope of behavior).<p>I&#x27;m also reminded of:<p>John 1:1-3 (NKJV) — &quot;In the beginning was the Word[0], and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Meanwhile they turn a blind eye to blatant racism, sexism etc..<p>Some other countries are beginning to wake up to this with their own economies as etc., but many wealthy, and powerful interests want to maintain the globalist status quo. Why? Because there is a lot of money to be made from slave labor. And the Chinese government is more than happy to help the wealthy quell this. While the progressive west is moralizing about perceived slights and hurt feelings, the Chinese are not worrying about that and eating their lunch.<p>Meanwhile western brands are censoring content etc. at the behest of the Chinese government and the actual cultural values that reject this are slowly being eroded away.

I&#x27;m working on a project now where I&#x27;m using it (I will make a blog or videos about it at some point):<p>- ECP5 is the lowest cost medium size FPGA.  Usually I would say that using a soft core is a waste of money vs. an external microcontroller unless you need to save space, but the cost of the added gates (say the next larger FPGA size than what you would need for a design without the soft core) is less than the cost of a microcontroller for the case where you are using ECP5 and you need video (a non-video micro is still cheaper).<p>- Mico32 is Lattice&#x27;s soft core solution.  You can argue about its quality, but the very stupid reason that I prefer RISC-V is that the Mico32 tool chain does not work in Ubuntu (or at least not without a lot of work- it is supposed to work in RedHat).  A lot of other people complain about Mico32 because it will not run Linux, but this is not so much of an issue for my design.<p>- PicoRV32 is designed for high clock speed.  This is probably not good for its own performance (multiple cycles per instruction), but it does mean that the RISC-V core is not the limiting factor for the rest of your FPGA design.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cliffordwolf&#x2F;picorv32\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cliffordwolf&#x2F;picorv32<\/a><p>- The barrier to entry is low (as long as you already know GCC linker scripts).

The documenting might be in adding code comments and API docs, writing separate text files, etc.  The person might not be able to document off-the-cuff, but have to work through a topic slowly, such as going through and re-understanding some old code themselves, going through a manual process that they do automatically and reflecting on the whys, etc.<p>* If some of the information is amenable to giving a talk to other employees, with a Q&amp;A section, that might work, too.<p>* Another option is to have another employee interview the person leaving about one or more topics, and either type notes as they go, or record it and get a transcription.  The interviewing person should be able to understand the topics.<p>* For tasks the person leaving does, you could have other people do the tasks <i>while the person leaving is available for questions<\/i>, and one of them documents as it goes.  Depending on the task, it might make sense to have the knowledge-holder right there, both answering <i>and observing<\/i>, rather than only available for questions on-demand.<p>Side suggestion about accessibility&#x2F;discoverability&#x2F;maintainability of all this new documentation: consider keeping the medium simple, and avoiding a proliferation of locations, formats, a dozen bullpoop communication SaaSes, etc.  For most software work, for example, inline embedded source code comments and API docs can be an easy way to try to keep a lot of information accessible in context and maintained.  Some other information that doesn&#x27;t fit well in source code, such as ops architecture and procedures, might be Markdown files in that same code repo, or another one.  The occasional video file you just can&#x27;t check into git might be a rare indispensible one, but can still be linked from a Markdown file that&#x27;s in your repo, but even then, maybe you also have a text transcript in the repo, or someone turns a talk into edited docs in the repo.<p>Incidentally, much earlier in organizational knowledge sharing, I vaguely recall a study by a consulting firm (sorry, no cite handy, and I&#x27;m not 100% sure I remember which big-name firm), in which they found that people were resistant to having their knowledge captured in a system, because that knowledge was an asset of the individual.  Your key people leaving might be more altruistic than that, want to help out their colleagues, want to have a good word-of-mouth reputation, have a sense of professionalism about it, have equity in the company, etc.  You might like them to do knowledge transfer to a degree that&#x27;s really above&amp;beyond the call, so consider how you might acknowledge and thank them for that.

Writing code for frontend and backend differ mostly just in the way that the different implementations access the host platform.

You can move code between frontend and backend at your leisure.<p>Is it really that good using Clojure across environments and runtimes?<p>I ask because I tried all of this with Scala years ago (I loved the language) and Ruby to an extent, but it was pretty miserable or rather there was really no reward but more effort on my part.

Like many projects that originate from Google, it always struck me as a solution looking for a problem.<p>The first &quot;problem&quot; was Javscript.<p>At one presentation about this I recall that Lars Bak (IIRC) took quite a beating about DArt, just in terms of the questions asked, to the point that someone had to point out just how much he&#x27;d accomplished (ie V8). This was, in essence, an appeal to authority.<p>I recall the Ads PA basically stepping in to save the project. I can only speculate why but my best guess is the AdWords TL woke up one day and decided to rewrite AdWords in Dart (as he allegedly had with GWT some years before). But all that&#x27;s pure speculation.<p>The second &quot;problem&quot; that Dart solved was using the same code on client and server, something Google is inexplicably obsessed with (eg GWT). I don&#x27;t know what caveats came with Dart but GWT had plenty (eg for many years it wasn&#x27;t possible to use the same protobuf classes on client and server).<p>I believe the intent with Dart was, at one point, to run natively within Chrome (the article mentions Dartium). This worked out really well for vbscript. No one wants to write different languages for different browsers. Again, I speculate here, but my strong suspicion is the Chrome team killed the idea of shipping a Dart VM in Chrome and that was the end of that.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me but TypeScript just seemed far more sane.<p>So... Flutter. I don&#x27;t know why a UI library needs to be language-specific but it strikes me as a bad idea.

We have just decided to try out flutter for our next app project. We are close to being done with the actual app development, and it looks like we are going to be done way under budget, so we are very happy with the technology as it currently is.<p>Before my time, we initially started app development using Cordova. It lined up well with existing expertise in the office as that what we work with most of the time. The apps turned out rather well except for reliability and building. \nThese are by contract applications, so we make them, release them and don&#x27;t revisit them unless we need to perform support on them. Changes in the web browser, particularity on iOS has broken these apps on several occasions where we have to go back and fix them. Some of these issues have been expected, such as when iPhone X came to market, but sometimes an update has broken something else, seemingly out of the blue.<p>We decided to try out some new technologies as we we&#x27;re not too impressed with Cordova and settled on Nativescript + Vue. Again due to expertise with vue as it is one of the technologies we utilize a lot in web projects. Pretty much all of the people who had been involved with the previous apps found it a better experience than Cordova. But in my opinion, it was also quite infuriating to work with. Hot module reloading never truly worked the way it should, we often had to quit and reload the app for changes to be correctly applied. It didn&#x27;t end up as cross platform as initially thought. \nWe had to make a lot of platform specific components for things we initially didn&#x27;t think we had to, mostly because the shared options of components in their standard libraries we&#x27;re not as good as we had hoped. We ended up spending way more time than initially thought wresling components into submission in order to get close to the design we initially envisioned, and we ended up compromising a lot on UI in order to make budget and deadlines. Performance was also something I we had to optimize a lot more for than initially planned. Animations and screen transitions would usually take a performance dive even though our views were very simple and did not really have much data in them at all. We struggled a lot to wrangle UI components into shape, hence why we felt we had to make so many components. And we encountered issues with very simple components such as images in list views not rendering if scrolled out then back in from views.<p>For this next project I suggested we try flutter before committing more to NativeScript, and we have seen immediate value from this technology over any of the others we have tried.<p>* We spend way less time on platform specific code, the reusable pieces look more consistent across platforms which means we spend less time tweaking them for either iOS or Android. I think that flutter using its own rendering technique is a serious boon to us who are just making cross platform apps as cheap as possible.<p>* Any non standard UI component is often way less time consuming to develop in flutter as you don&#x27;t have to write platform specific version of it. This has also let us cut down on external dependencies which we felt were necessary on Nativescript in order to implement some features in the allotted time available. This is something I think we will appreciate a lot over time, as NativeScript does not have the most active community and the potential work we will have to do to maintain components that may be abandoned by their original developer down the line.<p>* Tooling works a lot better for flutter. Hot module reloading actually works(most of the time). Statefulness and these reload is not as smooth. Actual breakpoints and debugging is very nice. We could get that with Nativescript too, but only in the javascript code, not for the templates which were written in XML. And if something went wrong on the &quot;native&quot; side, it would be like a black box to us which we could not truly inspect our way into. Flutter allows us to follow the stack deep into any widget.<p>* When you have to write native code for Flutter, you at least get the help of the tooling built for native platform development, as opposed to NativeScript where you declare that in javascript. It is very seldom needed for the kind of projects we&#x27;ve been doing however so I have no great insights here.<p>I&#x27;m very apathetic towards Dart as a language. It is entirely inoffensive. I felt like I could work in it without even trying to learn it, and I think I have spent at most an hour or two hours to look into and learn the more dart specific language features. I am not that much of a fan of how to deal with JSON data and the dynamic type in there. Dynamic feels a bit accident prone but other than that, Dart as a language gets less on my nerves than some of the more common and frankly way more tedious web related programming languages I have to use daily for work.<p>As far as the kind of work we&#x27;re doing, Flutter is great"],"time":["2020-03-01 14:49:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loftyal"],"id":[22456378],"kids":{},"parent":[22454115],"text":["I wouldn&#x27;t discount React Native.

It is a &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; containing several\ncomponents, some of which contribute to its use as a window system,\nothers which provide the networking facilities for implementing the\nclient-server model, all embedded in a programmable substrate allowing\nextremely flexible and creative combination of these elements.<p>During the initial implementation phase of the Macintosh LaserWriter\nsoftware, I temporarily transfered from Apple to Adobe working closely\nwith John Warnock and other Adobe engineers.  At lunch one day, I\nasked: &quot;John, what do you plan to do after LaserWriter?&quot;  His answer\nwas interesting:<p><pre><code>        PostScript is a linguistic &quot;mother board&quot;, which has &quot;slots&quot;\n        for several &quot;cards&quot;.  The first card we (Adobe) built was a\n        graphics card.  We&#x27;re considering other cards.  In particular,\n        we&#x27;ve thought about other network services, such as a file\n        server card.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nHe went on to say how a programmable network was really his goal, and\nthat the printing work was just the first component.  His mentioning\nusing PostScript for a file server is particularly interesting: Sun&#x27;s\nnext version of NFS is going to use PostScript with file extentions as\nthe client-server protocol!<p>This paper explores NeWS in this light: as a Programmable Network\nFacility, a major part of Sun&#x27;s future networking strategy.<p>NeWS Networking Components<p>NeWS has realized John&#x27;s notion of a programmable network facility.  It\nhas populated the initial PostScript mother board with several cards\nvital to netwoking:<p><pre><code>    -Device Independent Graphics Primitives: The key importance of the\n     PostScript graphics model for networking is that it is device\n     independent, able to represent with one file the same drawing on\n     *all* the network hosts.  The Folio fonts contribute to this: they\n     can be rendered at a given point size on all screens, regardless\n     of resolution.\n\n    -Host Independent Interpreter: PostScript is an interpreted language\n     that runs on all Sun workstations without recompilation.  The\n     significance of this for networking is that small code fragments\n     can run on any host without any knowledge of the host&#x27;s\n     architecture.  Thus one host sending a code fragment to another\n     host need not be concerned whether that host is a Sun-3, Sun-4, or\n     even Macintosh!  This extends to client programming languages as\n     well: all client languages have the same interface to the host.\n     As an illustration of this point, both C and Lisp clients use\n     the TNT toolkit with no special interfaces for each language.\n\n    -Network Socket Primitives: NeWS has added primitives for listening\n     for connection requests, for socket files, for host name and\n     internet number management, and for reading and writing on the\n     network connection.  In fact, the NeWS &quot;server&quot; code is not\n     written in C, it is written in PostScript.  The initial version,\n     and the one I run on my own machine today, is 10 lines of code!\n\n    -Light Weight Processes (LWP): A network host has many independent\n     activities taking place at one time.  Each of these uses a\n     separate LWP.  These activities need not be window oriented,\n     and in fact most are not.  Consider WUE alarms, for example.\n     A LWP could be created on each WUE NetStation whose only task\n     was to listen for activities on other WUE NetStations and to\n     cause a WUE Alarm to occur when an interesting event occurs.\n\n    -Garbage Collection: When data is allocated within NeWS, it is\n     returned to the free memory pool when no process references it.\n     This is needed in a multiprocessing network host because separate\n     LWPs can reference the same shared data.  (No process can safely\n     free data itself, because other processes might reference it.)\n     Garbage collection manages this problem for the processes, and\n     thus is an important Network facility.\n\n    -Programmable Events: NeWS has a flexible, very easy to use\n     event management scheme.  Processes fill out templates of events\n     they are interested in.  When these are matched by events occuring\n     within the system, they are delivered to the interested process.\n     Events are *far* more useful than simple keyboard and mouse events.\n     They can be artificially manufactured for any sort of inter-LWP\n     communication.  For the previous WUE Alarm, for example, the WUE\n     &quot;Listening&quot; process would communicate to WUE-Friendly applications\n     by filling out a WUEAlarmEvent and sending it.  The interested\n     applications would have filled out a template which would &quot;catch&quot;\n     the event.\n\n    -Programmable Error Handling: NeWS uses the standard PostScript\n     exception handling, extended to work within the context of LWPs.\n     Thus an error in one LWP is isolated to that process only.\n     Network programs can &quot;wrap&quot; incomming code inside of the special\n     &quot;stopped&quot; error handler which will catch errors occuring inside\n     the code fragment.  This is vital to safe network programming.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nWhat IS NeWS Anyway!<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;m glad NeWS has all these useful parts, but just what IS\nNeWS anyway; how do I get at and use all this stuff.&quot;<p>Well you may ask!  It does seem confusing.<p>Formally, NeWS is simply a Unix command, just like &quot;ls&quot; and &quot;cd&quot;.\nIts syntax is:<p><pre><code>    xnews [PostScript-code]\n<\/code><\/pre>\ni.e. it is a command that executes PostScript code fragment.  If the\nxnews command is given without an explicit argument, it defaults to\nexecuting &quot;(NeWS&#x2F;init.ps) run&quot;, which simply looks for the file\n&quot;init.ps&quot; in the &quot;$OPENWINHOME&#x2F;etc&#x2F;NeWS&quot; directory.  It is <i>this<\/i> file\nthat uses the NeWS components to setup the X11&#x2F;NeWS window system.<p>As a silly example of handing in your own commands to NeWS, we can\ndo this:<p><pre><code>        bigmac% xnews &quot;1 1 add =&quot;\n        2\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis simply tells xnews to add 1 &amp; 1 and print the results.  Oddly\nenough, I have written a somewhat more complex script to fill out my\nTraval Advance forms, adding up all the rows and columns and printing\nout a version of the form!<p>Now that we&#x27;ve gotten though the fundamentals, the rest of the paper\nwill look at individual examples of using NeWS in novel ways.  Although\nwe present programs to illustrate how things are done, the reader\nmay skip over them, the accompaning text will explain what the\nprogram does.<p>The Ten-Line Server<p>As mentioned above, &quot;xnews&quot; is simply a Unix command that executes\na PostScript program, defaulting to &quot;(NeWS&#x2F;init.ps) run&quot;.  Init.ps\nperforms several initialization tasks and executes the commands in\nvarious other files.  When its done with all of that, it defines\nand executes a small procedure called &quot;server&quot;.  This program\nuses the NeWS networking facilities to build a LWP which listens for\nconnection requests from &quot;client&quot; programs.  Whenever a request is\nheard, the LWP awakens and creates and initializes a new LWP just for\nthe client&#x27;s usage.<p>Here&#x27;s the ten line version of the server.  This actually works (I&#x27;ve\nrun it for quite some time!), and is explained in Chapter 10,\nNetworking NeWS, of the Unix Networking book published last year.<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;server { % - =&gt; -; create the NeWS client-server listner process\n        {   clear newprocessgroup           % -;    Clean stack, init process group\n            (%socketl2000) (r) file         % soc;  Open socket for listening\n            {   dup acceptconnection        % soc f;Loop forever creating clients\n                {   exch pop 200 dict begin % f;    Create userdict\n                    initmatrix newprocessgroup % f; Init graphics &amp; process\n                    cvx exec                % -;    Execute the connection!\n                    currentprocess killprocessgroup%Cleanup client &amp; children\n                } fork pop pop              % soc;  Clear process &amp; file\n            } loop                          % soc;  Loop forever creating clients\n        } fork pop                          % -;    Fork server &amp; toss process\n    } def\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe significance of this is that we can just as easily build other\nnetwork services with NeWS, using code much the same as the above.\nNeWSPrint, for example, uses a similar PostScript program to provide\nnetwork printing facilities.  NeWSPrint does not require a special,\nmodified version of xnews; it simply uses the standard OpenWindows\nproduct.<p>ps2bits: A PostScript to Rasterfile Program<p>A second use of running xnews as a Unix filter is illustrated by the\nps2bits probram.  This Bourne shell script reads a PostScript file\non its &quot;standard in&quot;, and emits the resulting Sun raster file on its\n&quot;standard out&quot;.  The shell script does this by having xnews:<p>-Read in a few standard PostScript initialization files,<p>-Initialize the PostScript environment (&amp; fix a Folio bug!)<p>-Build an 8.5 by 11, color, 72 dpi resolution &quot;page&quot; canvas<p>-Execute the PostScript stdin file to draw that page<p>-Write the resulting image to stdout as a raster file<p>Here is the program:<p><pre><code>    #! &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\n    xnews &quot;\n        (NeWS&#x2F;pack.ps)      (r) file cvx exec\n        (NeWS&#x2F;basics.ps)    (r) file cvx exec\n        (NeWS&#x2F;redbook.ps)   (r) file cvx exec\n        500 dict begin false setautobind () stringwidth pop pop\n        612 792 8 [1 0 0 -1 0 792] null buildimage setcanvas\n        (%stdin) run clippath (%stdout) (w) file writecanvas\n    &quot;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nNote: The line with the &quot;buildimage&quot; command may be modified to convert\nthe program to black &amp; white, or to change the resolution to 300 dpi,\nor to change the page size.  See Appendix A for a more general script.<p>Once the image is made, it can easily be looked at in SunView, XView,\nor NeWS using any of their raster file viewers.  Here&#x27;s a trivial\nviewer, &quot;bitwin&quot;, using the TNT toolkit:<p><pre><code>    #! &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\n    psh &lt;&lt;BITS\n        &#x2F;win [ClassCanvas] [] framebuffer &#x2F;new OpenLookBaseFrame send def\n        {   clippath pathbbox scale pop pop\n            (${1}) readcanvas imagecanvas\n        } &#x2F;setpaintproc &#x2F;client win send send\n        (${1}) &#x2F;setlabel win send\n        100 100 425 550 &#x2F;reshape win send\n        &#x2F;activate win send\n        &#x2F;map win send\n    BITS\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis Bourne shell script takes a single command line argument naming\nthe raster file.  It uses the NeWS &quot;PShell&quot; to sent a short program to\nthe running xnews server.  The program will put the file name in its\nheader, and will fill itself with the raster file image.  Stretching the\nwindow will stretch the image.<p>To use these on the demo file &quot;tiger.ps&quot; which was initially created\non the Mac using Adobe Illustrator, these two steps are taken:<p><pre><code>    bigmac% ps2bits &lt; $XNEWSHOME&#x2F;demo&#x2F;PostScript&#x2F;tiger.ps &gt; &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;bits\n    bigmac% bitwin &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;bits &amp;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe first command converts the tiger drawing into a raster file.\nThe second creates a window for viewing the raster file.<p>Although the complexity has been fairly minor in the previous examples,\nwe&#x27;ve illustrated some powerful capabilities:<p><pre><code>    -We can easily use NeWS to provide a simple Unix facility for\n     converting PostScript drawings into Sun raster files.  The\n     PostScript may come from any of the many widely available sources,\n     even the Macintosh.\n\n    -These raster files can be used by any toolkit, including SunView.\n     They can even be used by other raster devices such as printers.\n\n    -Using the networking primitives used in the 10-line server, we\n     could easily build a similar server for providing raster files\n     to anyone on the network.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nUsing these NeWS facilities in similar creative ways is exactly what\nNeWSPrint does.  The documentation folks use a similar &quot;filter&quot; to\nstrip out all the general header information in Mac PostScript files to\ngain an average 8-1 compression, vastly reducing their disk storage\nrequirements.  A homework assignment in our Usenix NeWS tutorial is\nto create a generalized Image Server for the network using these\nfacilities.<p>WUE Alarms with Programmable Events<p>WUE has the notion of &quot;alarms&quot; which can be used to alert applications\nof changes in status of network objects.  Applications can use this for\nanything from &quot;hot links&quot; to file status alarms.  One of the WUE\nexamples is on file status: I want to know when the monthy report\nreaches 90% completion.  Hot links are similar:  I want this graph to\nchange whenever the associated spreadsheet changes.<p>Here is one way to implement WUE file alarms using NeWS programmable\nevents:<p><pre><code>    -WUE provides a Property Sheet which includes a file completion\n     field holding a percentage quantity.\n\n    -When the Property Sheet is completed, it creates and sends a\n     WUEStatusEvent for the given file.  The network name of the object\n     is stored in the event&#x27;s Action field.  The event includes\n     auxillary information about the file in the ClientData of the\n     event.\n\n    -Applications following WUE object status changes use the NeWS\n     &quot;expressinterest&quot; primitive to catch all WUEStatusEvent&#x27;s for the\n     desired file.  It then looks at the ClientData to determine\n     whether or not further action should be taken.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe WUE Property Sheet would build and send the event this way:<p><pre><code>    createevent dup begin\n        &#x2F;Name   &#x2F;WUEStatusEvent def\n        &#x2F;Action (&#x2F;home&#x2F;project&#x2F;status&#x2F;january) def\n        &#x2F;ClientData 1 dict dup begin\n            &#x2F;Completion .70 def\n        end def\n    end sendevent\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe application builds an interest for its TNT event manager to\nhandle.  It does so by building a matching event template for\nWUEStatusEvent and the &#x2F;home&#x2F;project&#x2F;status&#x2F;january filename.  It also\nincludes a &quot;callback&quot; procedure which decides what to do with the\ncompletion information.  In this case, we want the alarm to occur\nwhen the file is more than 90% complete:<p><pre><code>    createevent dup begin\n        &#x2F;Name 1 dict dup begin\n            &#x2F;WUEStatusEvent { % event =&gt; -; check if complete yet\n                &#x2F;ClientData get &#x2F;Completion get .90 ge {\n                    AlertApplication\n                } if\n            } def\n        end def\n        &#x2F;Action (&#x2F;home&#x2F;project&#x2F;status&#x2F;january) def\n    end MyEventMgr expressinterest\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis results in the AlertApplication procedure being called when\nthe &#x2F;home&#x2F;project&#x2F;status&#x2F;january report is within 10% of completion.<p>Puny WOF (Workgroup Object Facility)<p>The above alerting works only for applications running on the same\nworkstation.  This is because the event that is sent is only visible to\ninterests expressed on the same workstation.  We can easily extend our\nmodel to include sending the event to many network workstations\nby using the same techniques as the 10-line server:<p><pre><code>    -WUE friendly workstations start a WUE event listening service when\n     they start up NeWS.  This uses exactly the same techniques as the\n     10-line server, but using a different socket file.  They also\n     regester themselves with a centralized list of WUE friendly\n     workstations.\n\n    -The WUE event listening service starts a second process which\n     expresses interest in all local WUE events.  When any WUE\n     event is caught, it is &quot;forwarded&quot; to each of the workstations\n     listed in the central list.  It does this by opening a socket\n     file to each workstation, and sending a small program down\n     the socket which sends the WUE event on the remote machine.\n\n    -The Property Sheet sends the WUEStatusEvent exactly as before.\n     Local applications running on the same machine operate exactly as\n     before.  In addition, however, the local WUE event forwarder\n     causes the same event to be sent on each of the regestered\n     workstations.  Applications on those machines would now catch the\n     forwarded event exactly as if it were local.  The application need\n     not be modifed!\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThis basically implements a Puny WOF (Workgroup Object Facility).  And\nit can be done very easily indeed!  Admittedly that this is quite puny\nand many details about robustness etc. have to be managed.  On the other\nhand, using xnews as a WOF prototyper is extremely appealing. (I plan\nto prototype a versions of Puny WOF as soon as I get a second host set\nup and running in my office.)<p>Multi-Media: NeWS Device Control<p>Multi-media devices can be managed by NeWS, using programmable events\nto interface to applications.  This provides a logical division between\nthe device &quot;driver&quot;, which may be implemented in any of several ways,\nand the application API to the device, which is via NeWS events.<p>As an example, consider a graphics tablet input device with an RS232\ninterface.  This device emits x,y data in a well-known format to the\nserial device when the tablet&#x27;s stylus moves.  As an initial\nimplementation, the driver half of the device was written in PostScript\nas a process which opens and reads the file &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tty.  When there is no\ndata on the device, the process blocks, pausing until data arives for\nthe device.  When the data arives, the read returns with the device\ndata.  This is packaged into an event as in the WUE Alarm example.<p>Typically the device data needs processing that is better suited to C\nprogramming.  The solution is to rewrite the device manipulation as a\nNeWS client using either CPS or the TNT Wire Service.  The application\ninterface, however, continues to be the same event interface.  The\nimproved performance incurrs no change in the application interface.\nThe notion of this variety of client &quot;daemon&quot; has been used in TNT for\nproviding shared text service among applicaions.  A voice interface to\nEMacs was also made in AD using the same technique.<p>Another significant advantage to this division of labor into a device\nlayer using an event interface to applications is that it gracefully\nevolves into sharing the single device among multiple applications.\nThe device is temporarily &quot;owned&quot; by one application, and is given to\nanother application using an agreed upon protocol.  Two common styles\nare used:<p><pre><code>    -The keyboard uses a &quot;focus&quot; model where certain UI events not\n     associated with the keyboard determine which application owns it.\n\n    -The mouse is typically owned by the application in which it was\n     last &quot;clicked&quot;.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIn the case of the graphics tablet, applications wanting to use the\ntablet would express interest in the tablet&#x27;s button being clicked\nwithin it.  From then on, that application will receive the motion\nchange events for the tablet.<p>Although device ownership may seem like a trivial problem, fairly\ncomplex systems are typically needed to solve it for a given device.\nThe VOX server from Olivetti for voice is used for just this kind of\nthing: negociation between applications for ownership of the voice\ndevice.  Because VOX is not integrated into a more general event\nsystem, however, it cannot manage the <i>user interface<\/i> for which\napplication currently owns it.  It can only provide the regestry.  When\nOpenLook defines the &quot;focus&quot; model for ownership of the voice device, a\nNeWS oriented voice service will much more easily integrate into the\nrest of the system.<p>Just as WUE Alarms had a network component, certain multi-media devices\nwill be expensive enough to warrent sharing on the network.  Scanners\nand fax machines will be attached to individual machnes, but we may\nwant them to be temporarily owned by other workstations.  The same\n&quot;server&quot; technology used by the 10-line server and the Puny WOF can\nalso be used here.<p>Summary and Vision<p>The interesting software architectures of the next decade will leverage\nnetwork technologies.  We will see WUE become the Net Finder, replacing\nthe simplistic Mac Finder in the network intensive workstation world.\nWUE will manage network resources among WUE-Friendly NetStations,\nworkstations with advanced, easily configured network software\nplatforms.  NeWS is such a network tool: a programmable network\nfacility.  Another is the newly proposed NFS which uses file server\nextended PostScript as its client-server language.<p>We hear far too many NeWS vs. X arguments based on window and UI\ntoolkit arguments alone.  These, in my opinion, miss the main strengths\nof NeWS.  It is a programmable network facility which can be used for\nmany purposes.  It can prototype new network services.  It can be a\nuniversal device controler.  It can be used to integrate multiple\nhosts.  All these elements also need to be evaluated when considering\nNeWS.<p>References<p>[1] PostScript Language Reference Manual, Adobe Systems, Addison Wesley, 1985<p>[2] The NeWS Book, Gosling &amp; Rosenthal, Springer-Verlag, 1989<p>[3] Unix Networking-ch 10: Networking NeWS, Owen Densmore, Hayden Books, 1989<p>[4] NFS-3 Design Document, Brent Calaghan, Sun internal document, 1990<p>Appendix A: A more general ps2bits shell script.<p><pre><code>    #! &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\n    # Parse cmd line args: ps2bits [-size W H] [-dpi X Y] [-color]\n    X=72; Y=72; W=8.5; H=11; Z=1\n    while [ ${#} -gt 0 ]; do\n        case &quot;${1}&quot; in\n            -dpi)   shift; X=${1}; shift; Y=${1} ;;\n            -size)  shift; W=${1}; shift; H=${1} ;;\n            -color) Z=8 ;;\n        esac; shift\n    done\n    # Run NeWS as Unix filter.

Never mind all of its practical flaws, all sorts of people held web browsers up as the better way and the bright future that could have been if only things had been different (by which they mean if people had made the &#x27;right&#x27; choice instead of settling for Gopher). One of the reasons people often give for liking web browsers is that it put much of the JavaScript libraries into the web browser instead of forcing every server to implement it separately.<p>Unfortunately for all of these people, history has fairly conclusively shown that web browser was a mistake. Specifically the core design of putting as much intelligence as possible into the web browser instead of the web server has turned out to be a terrible idea. There are at least two big reasons for this.<p>The first is parallelization. In the increasingly multi-core world you desperately want as much concurrent processing as possible and it&#x27;s much easier to run several web servers in parallel than it is to parallelize a single web browser. Even if you do get equal parallelization, separate web servers are inherently more resilient because the operating system intrinsically imposes a strong separation of address space and so on, something that&#x27;s very hard to get in server where everything is jumbled together.<p>(I believe that this is one reason that modern HTML CSS rendering has been moved from the web browser to the web server. WebFont rendering is increasingly complex and CPU-consuming, so it&#x27;s better to stick web servers with that burden than dump all of it on the web browser. After all, all Web Servers should have multiple GPUs for drawing and accelerating graphics and numeric computing for all their clients, but there is no rational reason anyone would ever want to program the GPU in the web browser, or push that processing off from the honking big accelerated server farms that you&#x27;re renting from Amazon by the minute, to the millions of web browsers run by your users whose electricity you don&#x27;t need to pay for. Plus, users enjoy waiting for their graphics to download over the internet in response to every mouse click and movement they make. It gives them time to think and reflect.)<p>The second is that if you put the toolkit in the web browser you make evolving the toolkit and its API much more complicated and problematic. The drawback of having everyone use the web browser toolkit is that everyone has to use the same web browser toolkit. Well, not completely. You can introduce a mechanism to have multiple toolkit versions and APIs all in the same web browser and allow web servers to select which one they want or need and so on and so forth. The mess of a situation with the current web browser and its JavaScript libraries make a very educational example of what happens if you go down this path; not very much of it is good.<p>(Some JavaScript libraries are in practice mandatory but still must be probed for and negotiated by the web servers, while others are basically historical relics but they still can&#x27;t be dropped because some web server somewhere may ask for them.)<p>JavaScript libraries in the web browser push the burden of dealing with the evolution of the library into the web server. It is the CDN and web browser cache that carries around old or new versions of the library, with various different APIs, and you naturally have old library versions (and even old toolkits) go away entirely when they are no longer used by any active web servers (or even any installed web servers, when things get far enough).<p>(I&#x27;m ignoring potential security issues for complex reasons, but they may be a good third reason to be unhappy with browser-side libraries.)"],"time":["2020-03-01 12:24:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[22456658],"kids":{},"parent":[22455722],"text":["Not at all, alongside NeXTSTEP, it made UNIX actually interesting as workstation OS."],"time":["2020-03-01 13:49:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mwfunk"],"id":[22459250],"kids":{},"parent":[22455722],"text":["&quot;X Windows&quot;"],"time":["2020-03-01 21:56:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Pfhreak"],"id":[22458394],"kids":[22459279,22458656,22461739],"parent":[22457338],"text":["I wonder if there&#x27;s a positive gain in drawing metals out with the plants, removing the metal content, and producing biochar with the waste.

Among her peers, you’ll hear, variously expressed, a very basic sentiment: finally, a First Lady who’s one of us. “It was just as if we’d known each other all our lives,” says Carly Simon, who has spent time at Martha’s Vineyard with the First Lady; when Hillary admired a naïve Haitian painting in Simon’s house, Simon made a present of it. “It was an easy, Ivy League kind of camaraderie. Like, ‘You went to Wellesley? Oh, I went to Sarah Lawrence.’ And, ‘Oh, you like that kind of art? I like that kind of art.’ ” But if you do not feel part of that “us”—if, indeed, the very idea of Haitian folk art on the Vineyard makes you shift uneasily—you may feel the tug of an answering sentiment: that this First Lady is <i>one of them<\/i>.<p>Both this <i>Quillette<\/i> piece and the <i>New Yorker<\/i> article are presaged and, in my opinion, upstaged by Hayek&#x27;s 1960 diatribe &quot;The Intellectuals and Socialism&quot;:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;Intellectuals%20and%20Socialism_4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;Intellectuals%20and%20S...<\/a><p>Hayek&#x27;s piece seems to me to be the founding treatise of modern libertarianism, with regard to the parts that are valuable at least.

Unfortunately, Hayek himself simply became increasingly cynical and decreasingly coherent towards the end of his life, after publishing his most famous works from a more moderate perspective, so we didn&#x27;t get to hear a conclusion to this train of thought.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious how to overcome this limitation; all ideologies need a base of support, and people on average tend to be selfish enough that we notice it. Andrew Yang&#x27;s proposal to give citizens money earmarked for political donations (<i>&quot;Democracy Dollars&quot;<\/i>) seems, to me, the most practical step currently available towards making politics more participatory and less hierarchical: it can foster the growth of competition among political campaigns for ordinary people&#x27;s support with floating prices, reminiscent of a system we usually think of as reliable.

Bear in mind, the impact on the domestic economy of failing to reign in an epidemic is as real as the upside of claiming it&#x27;s fixed to settle export income. Basically it&#x27;s not in any states interest, one party or otherwise. China&#x27;s domestic economy depends on people getting better.<p>I truly don&#x27;t get the assumption &quot;it&#x27;s worse than they say&quot; when the most likely outcome (putting Hanlons razor into play), is that mortality stats are nearly accurate and caseload is under reported due to lack of testing and self isolation. Death is hard to hide. I believe mortality stats. Any non reported mortality goes to under reported cases, so it evens out.<p>I know it&#x27;s optimistic thinking but I am drawn to a belief the effective cumulative death rate in China only drops, as better figures emerge unless unlike all other virus it becomes more lethal not less under mutation.<p>A different comorbidity outcome eg opportunitistic pneumonia or delayed onset COPD or something, that&#x27;s different. That would demand a massive change in view. Change in the long-term disease consequence will be interesting and important.<p>(For instance the effect some disease has on vaccine immunity across the board comes to mind: if this happens, bad news: but, that is in the future)<p>Well adapted virus mutate not to kill their hosts. Badly adapted virus self limit.<p>This is not about liking or disliking the Chinese state, I am asking on what grounds people walk to &#x27;under reports of death, over reports of caseload&#x27;<p>No other claim alters mortality into worse places.<p>Non Chinese deaths predominantly lie in old, lower immunity, comorbidity sick people. And, saying &quot;it&#x27;s too soon, wait for the wave&quot; is forward facing speculation. Cumulative infection and death rates are inherently backward looking. Explain to me how these a posterior figures get worse not better.<p>TL;dr it&#x27;s not smoke, this article is mis applied stupid maths.<p>Keeping people on a ship (think norovirus and cruises) or having a religious cult uncover huge transmission outcome.. that&#x27;s not a true reflection of societal risk under self isolation in the home.<p>I am told the CDC insisted on a home made test. NIH as in &quot;not invented here&quot; and not national institute of health.. bad move guys. Under testing in a US health system with patient cost recovery. That is a recipe for less successful disease control. The US is going to turn out to be under reported. Death rates will probably be right because dying in America is statistically well understood. People won&#x27;t front for expensive medical test or treatment. High rates of COPD and diabetes and therefore higher risk of death than many other economies.

You would think that there’s not much room for high margins there since it’s such a commodity technology. Good foam based mattresses for example can be mass-manufactured for around 30-50 $ according to industry sources. Shipping is also easy and cheap as they can be vacuum-packed and shipped as regular parcels. Yet, the top selling mattresses cost around 200-300 $. How can that be? I think there are multiple reasons for it but the gist is that price alone does not determine which product wins, psychological aspects play a central role as well.

Thank you for taking the time to document down your learnings along your journey of pursuing data science.

Some people attribute it to luck, but I guess in your case you really have made your own luck by taking actions to move towards your goal! Congratulations on your accomplishments thus far! I just have a few questions which would love if you can elaborate further on.<p>Firstly, it seems to me that the online course enabled you to reach top 3% of a Kaggle project which led to a series of career opportunities. However, I believe that being able to reach the top in Kaggle competition is not an easy feat. This kind of process is not really replicable especially for the people who are just starting out in Data Science. In that case, what would you recommend them to do?<p>And secondly, what is the end goal of a data scientist or at least for you as a data scientist? Would it be going into research? Continue to climb the ladder till you reach the top of the company? Data science and engineering in general are great as a form of intellectual challenge. However, personally sometimes I feel that there is a lack of meaning in the thing that I am doing as engineer&#x2F;data scientist (especially if the culture of the company is very bottom-line driven).
