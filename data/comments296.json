Management being against it is an unhealthy sign.<p>Just so you have some context. a Works Council has the following rights:<p>Right to discuss:  they will have a bi-yearly meeting with the employer, who will report to the employees the financial situation of the company<p>Right to give advise:  (This is the one startups find scary). When a company wants to do an investment round or any action that has economical or organisational impact, they _must_  ask for advice from the Works Council.  The employer _must_ take their advice into account. If he does not, there is a cool-down period of a month before the decisions comes into place. Within that month the employees can take the employer to court in Amsterdam to block the action. This basically means employees have the right to block investment rounds through court. The burden of proof is on the employee that this is not in interest of the company.<p>Right to vote: The WC has the right to vote on certain decisions regarding reduction of working hours or work conditions. Here the onus is turned around compared to the right to advise.  The WC makes the decision, and the _employer_ has the right to countersue.  This basically means the employees have the right to force the employer to court if they want to do a firing round.

But most deployed CPUs had memory semantics that made them work. Mostly.<p>On x86 multiprocessors, if, without taking any special measures, you set x=1 from processor 0, and processor 1 reads x shortly, but not too shortly, thereafter, it will see 1. If you try that on, say, an 80-core ARM CPU [1], CPU #53 might not see a 1 for a long time, if ever.[2] You&#x27;re no longer guaranteed that cache changes propagate unasked. As we get more and more CPUs, the cost of creating the illusion that there&#x27;s a single memory goes up. It&#x27;s now important that compilers know what&#x27;s shared so they can generate the proper fence and barrier instructions. Especially since the latest iteration of ARM has new features such as &quot;non-temporal load and store.&quot;<p>What used to be a theoretical problem, or at most a problem for OS architects, has thus acquired teeth and claws that can bite ordinary applications programmers.<p>This is where traditional C++ mutexes start to break down. From a theoretical perspective, it&#x27;s always been annoying that mutexes at the POSIX level have no tie to what they&#x27;re supposed to be protecting. Hitting a mutex has to mean &quot;flush everything&quot;. That&#x27;s inefficient. Rust has the advantage that its locks own data, so the compiler knows what has to be flushed. That becomes more important as the number of CPU cores becomes very large.<p>I&#x27;ve said for years that the three issues in C&#x2F;C++ are &quot;how big is it&quot;, &quot;who owns it&quot;, and &quot;who locks it&quot;. C++ now at least has abstractions for all of these, although they all leak.

It was thought that 65K characters was enough to represent all the characters in actual use across the languages and thus you just needed to change the from an 8 bit char to a 16 bit char and all would be well (apart from the issue of endianness). Thus Unicode initially specified what each symbol would look like encoded in 16bits. (see <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicode.org&#x2F;history&#x2F;unicode88.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicode.org&#x2F;history&#x2F;unicode88.pdf<\/a>, particularly section 2). Windows NT, Java, ICU, all embraced this.<p>Then it turned out that you needed a lot more characters than 65K and instead of each character being 16 bits, you would need 32 bit characters (or else have weird 3 byte data types). Whereas people could justify going from 8 bits to 16 bits as a cost of not having to worry about charsets, most developers balked at 32 bits for every character. In addition, you now had a bunch of the early adopters (Java and Windows NT) that had already embraced 16 bit characters. So then encodings were hacked on such as UTF-16 (surrogate pairs of 16 bit characters for some unicode code points).<p>I think, if the problem had been understood better at the start that you have a lot more characters than will fit in 16 bits, then something UTF-8 would likely have been chosen as the canonical encoding and we could have avoided a lot of these issues.

It&#x27;s usually positioned as an alternative to Adobe Lightroom. However, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that there&#x27;s very little left in Lightroom that Darktable doesn&#x27;t offer at least three or four alternatives for. This is not like The Gimp vs Photoshop but more the other way around. IMHO, around the 2.0 release, it more than caught up in features. Since then, UI polish, a crazy amount of features, etc. have widened the gap in terms of features and utility. There are quite a few features unique to Darktable that Lightroom simply does not have and that people would normally use things like the Gimp or photoshop for. Masking alone (which works on pretty much any of the dozens of modules) just unlocks a ton of creative possibilities.<p>Disclaimer, I&#x27;m not a Lightroom user and have used Darktable exclusively for the last five years or so. I actually use the mac builds, which is hardly ideal given that OpenCL support on Apple is not great. Darktable definitely has lots of rough edges that make it less than ideal for some less experienced users to switch over to. While the UI has improved with this release, it is still quite complex. Many of the modules are not for the faint of heart and have steep learning curves. Simpler to use alternatives are available (there are usually multiple ways to do things in Darktable); some of which are explicitly intended for novice users. Most of the complex ones are awesome once you figure them out.<p>The highlight in this release for me is the improved integration between the exposure and filmic module. Both existed in previous versions and they were always intended to be used together. However, in the new version they finally replace the base curve as the default way to do tone mapping. The new default scene referred mode is basically about these two modules being turned on by default and the base curve no longer being used by default. I noticed already with 3.0 where I manually configured my defaults to do the same that this reduced the amount of work I had to do. Usually, I do some minor tweaks to the grey point with the exposure module and then finish the job in filmic. In 3.2, these seem to do a better job out of the box than in 3.0; even for (deliberately) under exposed photos. If it is too dark, you simply add a few stops in the exposure module and filmic dynamically updates the black and whitepoints. So instead of blowing out your highlights, it actually brightens the grey-point while compressing blacks and whites in a way that makes sense. Unlike the base curve, this is dynamic and unrelated to pre defined camera profiles for what would constitute a good base curve for a camera that you get with the old basecurve module. I never really got usable results with that.<p>I ended up deleting my settings and presets to get the new defaults in 3.2. If you upgrade from an older version and want to benefit from the new &amp; improved defaults, you may want to do the same. I noticed when upgrading an old 2.x version on my Father&#x27;s laptop that doing this may also be needed if it fails to start because of changes in its internal db (he was still on 2.4). Unfortunately it did not fail gracefully and I had to drop to the command line and rm -rf the old files. Stuff like this is exactly the kind of rough edges that make this product still a bit of a hard sell for less experienced users."],"time":["2020-08-14 14:47:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["privong"],"id":[24159974],"kids":{},"parent":[24156113],"text":["Good news, it&#x27;s a great program.<p>It might be better to use the URL about the release: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darktable.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;darktable-321-released&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darktable.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;darktable-321-released&#x2F;<\/a> (rather than the &quot;news&quot; page)"],"time":["2020-08-14 18:31:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ketzu"],"id":[24158212],"kids":{},"parent":[24156113],"text":["Back in the day I bought a lightroom license because there was no stable version of darktable for windows.

I hate having a separate calendar and task list. With Tweek I can just scroll down and put unscheduled tasks in the &quot;someday&quot; category. I also love the simple interface which emphasizes canvas size. Honestly, great job. Ideally there would be a robust notification system on the level of Google Calendar.<p>Semi-related anecdote: This reminds me of those free calendar planner booklets you get in college, in a good way. Before college I didn&#x27;t use any kind of calendar. On my first day on campus, I got a calendar booklet from a random lady and it changed my life. For some reason at the end of syllabus week I had the impulse to put <i>all<\/i> the homework deadlines, assignments, exams, etc...from my syllabi into the planner. On <i>top<\/i> of that I put all the same stuff into my google calendar so that I get multiple notifications ahead of important deadlines.<p>I was a procrastinator in high school, but in college I had better foresight than most of my peers. I got homework done 1-2 weeks ahead of time. I would get a dopamine rush from crossing an assignment off of my planner. Each semester at the end of syllabus week, I would sit down for a few hours to fill out my calendar booklet and my google calendar. I wouldn&#x27;t stop studying until I was satisfied with the number of things I scratched off on my booklet - and if I didn&#x27;t feel like doing the hard stuff, I would do my reading for next week so I have more time for the hard stuff later on. Being productive was as easy as opening this booklet that I carried with me everywhere and just doing the next thing. I was super involved in campus activities because I always had my studies taken care of. If my friends wanted to hang out, I would open the booklet and see if I had enough things crossed off, otherwise they would be met with a prompt &quot;sorry I have stuff to do.&quot;<p>This sounds silly, but I am honestly not sure if I would have excelled so much in college if a random lady didn&#x27;t give me a calendar booklet as a freshman. To this day I have not found an app that <i>feels<\/i> the same way that that booklet did for me. It would be wonderful if Tweek can be that app, but I also wonder if there was something special about the dual analog and digital experience of writing on paper + Google Calendar notifications. I would also be able to star, highlight, circle, etc...different deadlines depending on the nature of the deadline and its importance. You can do a lot more than mere color coding on actual physical paper, but that is something that can be replicated in a digital format.<p>I know the greatest thing about the calendar booklet: the <i>forward<\/i> feeling it gave me, and the satisfaction I got with scratching off or &quot;defeating&quot; tasks. The ease with which it enabled to pounce on the next thing. The reason I speak about feelings is because hormones and feelings have as much of an impact on your productivity as logic.

I would like to call it locale-tainted.<p>Since The locale library is part of the standard library of the programming languages and many software relies on it. We can&#x27;t just avoid using locale library without massive refactoring of the source code which is impossible given the available resource for localization.  So if we, the unfortunate Japanese programmer, got a job of localizing locale-tainted existing software to Japanese, we have to come up some workarounds.<p>Modifying the source code to remove the locale library usage is the best but often not possible. Hooking locale library to replace it with Japanese-safe version are dirty workaround but it requires to reimplement most of the text manipulation which cost many man-monthes and rigorous testing, Imagine implementing a printf&#x2F;regex library to replace the standard library that satisfy all the use case in the wild. The worst workaround is let the stupid locale library do whatever the stupid Japanese breaking string binary transformation they damn want, then, reverse-transform after the string binary passing through the locale library to fix the mess. A mess that was unnecessary in the first place.<p>I was involved in C++ Standard Committee but people out there are so delusional they think it&#x27;s a good idea for a new standard library to depend on broken locale library because it help the localization. Those delusional people are also designing Unicode library now. They won&#x27;t fart out a good library under such delusion. I lost all hope for this industry.<p>So please. Don&#x27;t introduce stupid unnecessary language processing to the language you don&#x27;t understand.

A good portion of modern air navigation comes from that legacy. Elrey Jeppesen was an airmail pilot for Boeing in the 1930s, and during his routes, he began taking detailed notes and that later become the business of Jeppesen —- one of the most important aviation charting companies on the planet. And, coming full-circle, Boeing bought Jeppesen in the year 2000 and a year or so ago, Jeppesen bought ForeFlight.<p>The legacy of the postal service is extraordinary, especially in aviation. Town names on water towers for example, that was for the mail pilots. Light beacons (that later became radio beacons,) were also a result of the mail pilots. Jeppesen (along with Jimmy Doolittle) was a  pioneer of Instrument Flight Rules.<p>That being said, UPSP filling my mailbox with “to current resident” junk or pounds of unsolicited newsprint each week isn’t something I am sympathetic towards. I am ok paying $5 to mail a letter — I do it so infrequently as to make such an expense trivial. For poor people that still have to do things by post, it would be easy to provide a postal allowance tied to receipt of other government benefits (if you get food stamps, you also get actual stamps for example.) And the package side of USPS — they are profitable. But it doesn’t make a lot of sense to have 6 day per week letter service. If the argument is that USPS is subsidizing Amazon, I might argue they are subsidizing all of the junk mail senders as well. They shouldn’t be subsidizing anyone. The world isn’t going to stop turning with 5 day a week mail service and three day a week service to very rural areas. If a letter just has to get there quickly, normal mail isn’t the optimal way to do it anyway. It wasn’t until 1863 that mail was delivered daily so there is some historical precedence for less than daily service.<p>Reducing service days, charging correct rates that reflect cost, and improving efficiencies in both labor and processes would make the USPS both solvent while still being relevant."],"time":["2020-08-14 06:55:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jovial_cavalier"],"id":[24153431],"kids":[24153474],"parent":[24153311],"text":["Unless they offer a better service than private industry, they will be a money sink.

Some memories and observations, from a European perspective:<p>- A third to half of all the lab reports I graded every week sounded as if they had been written by grade schoolers, both syntactically and rhetorically. I, as a non-native speaker, frequently had to correct people&#x27;s English mistakes.<p>- I gave elaborate feedback on every single lab report, announced what things I&#x27;d like to see them do and what my scoring rubric looked like. All these remarks were largely ignored by at least half of the people time and again.<p>- The head of the labs, my boss, always urged us, the TAs, to grade fairly and to deduct points where students had clearly messed up. &quot;There must be a difference between the grades of good students and bad students,&quot; he said. Unfortunately, his actions spoke louder than his words: He had already assigned each of the lab exercises a certain number of points which left us TAs little room for our own scoring rubric(×). Basically, very easy and low-level exercises (like copying a definition from class) got them already 30-40% of the points and recording measurements correctly gave them another 30-40%. The actual evaluation of the experiments, where the students had to actually do some thinking, was practically optional.<p>- The course material was high school level. I had learned it back in 9th grade. This is clearly not the students&#x27; fault but it speaks volumes about the US high school system.<p>- There were many students who I would have given an F, had we been at a European university. But I couldn&#x27;t, due to (×). One of the aforementioned students actually had the audacity to ask me for an A instead of the already very generous B she was going to get.<p>- I will say that there was a small group of students who were extremely motivated and interested in the stuff I taught, asked questions all the time, took each piece of advise by heart and did extremely well overall.<p>- Side note: I had previous TA experience and had always gotten very good grades by my students. Judging by their comments, I know how to present and explain things well. So I can say with confidence that it wasn&#x27;t that I was a bad TA.<p>- I supervised the mid-term exam and not only were the exam questions very easy and multiple-choice (with every question having precisely one correct answer), students were also allowed to mark multiple answers: Assuming they managed to at least mark the correct answer, marking two answers would give them 0.75 points instead of 1 full point, marking three would give them 0.5 points and marking three (out of five) would still give them 0.25 points. On top of that, towards the end of the two-hour exam when some few students weren&#x27;t done yet, the professor extended the deadline multiple times so that they could all finish. In short: The exam was <i>designed<\/i> so that students could pass it and get good grades.<p>Here&#x27;s the kicker, though:<p>Towards the end of the semester, I noticed that practically all other TAs were simply giving their students full points for everything. After talking to some of the TAs, I came to learn that that they had realized in previous semesters that the grades us TAs gave didn&#x27;t matter at all (as they were going to get &quot;rescaled&quot; by the professor anyway), so why bother and put in so much work? At the same time, though, they encouraged me to speak up about it. So I emailed both my boss (the head of the labs) and the professor multiple times about it. They never responded.

You cannot make a man worth a given amount by making it illegal for anyone to offer him anything less. You merely deprive him of the right to earn the amount that his abilities and situation would permit him to earn, while you deprive the community even of the moderate services that he is capable of rendering. In brief, for a low wage you substitute unemployment. You do harm all around, with no comparable compensation.<p>The only exception to this occurs when a group of workers is receiving a wage actually below its market worth. This is likely to happen only in rare and special circumstances or localities where competitive forces do not operate freely or adequately; but nearly all these special cases could be remedied just as effectively, more flexibly and with far less potential harm, by unionization.<p>It may be thought that if the law forces the payment of a higher wage in a given industry, that industry can then charge higher prices for its product, so that the burden of paying the higher wage is merely shifted to consumers. Such shifts, however, are not easily made, nor are the consequences of artificial wage-raising so easily escaped. A higher price for the product may not be possible: it may merely drive consumers to the equivalent imported products or to some substitute. Or, if consumers continue to buy the product of the industry in which wages have been raised, the higher price will cause them to buy less of it. While some workers in the industry may be benefited from the higher wage, therefore, others will be thrown out of employment altogether. On the other hand, if the price of the product is not raised, marginal producers in the industry will be driven out of business; so that reduced production and consequent unemployment will merely be brought about in another way.<p>When such consequences are pointed out, there are those who reply: “Very well; if it is true that the X industry cannot exist except by paying starvation wages, then it will be just as well if the minimum wage puts it out of existence altogether.” But this brave pronouncement overlooks the realities. It overlooks, first of all, that consumers will suffer the loss of that product. It forgets, in the second place, that it is merely condemning the people who worked in that industry to unemployment. And it ignores, finally, that bad as were the wages paid in the X industry, they were the best among all the alternatives that seemed open to the workers in that industry; otherwise the workers would have gone into another. If, therefore, the X industry is driven out of existence by a minimum wage law, then the workers previously employed in that industry will be forced to turn to alternative courses that seemed less attractive to them in the first place. Their competition for jobs will drive down the pay offered even in these alternative occupations. There is no escape from the conclusion that the minimum wage will increase unemployment.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;As to the prices, wages and profits that should determine the distribution of that product, the best prices are not the highest prices, but the prices that encourage the largest volume of production and the largest volume of sales. The best wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the wage rates that permit full production, full employment and the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits, from the standpoint not only of industry but of labor, are not the lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to become employers or to provide more employment than before.&quot;<p>Henry Hazlitt “Economics in One Lesson.”"],"time":["2020-08-14 19:42:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["notwedtm"],"id":[24163805],"kids":[24164439,24164182,24163859],"parent":[24163303],"text":["Every time I see this product mentioned, I get a fleeting moment of excitement before I realize that I don&#x27;t really have any issues with YAML right now.

I always think, it can’t cost so little. Yet so many products come with excessive amounts of packaging, which adds to those costs, but no one seems to be overtly paying for it. If it were literally more expensive to buy a product with wasteful and excessive packaging, then maybe company’s would be motivated to invent more creative and effective packaging that wastes less, to compete on price.<p>Another is how most of our internet experiences are subsidized. It’s not like that doesn’t cost us more somewhere else? Advertisers have to cough up the dough for their ads and they’re going to build those costs into their price. However, if we lived in a different world where paying for apps and our online experience in general, then I feel like there’s a much more direct and efficient mechanism to connect the costs of the internet with supporting what you actually like about it.<p>Paying for stuff could probably save the world, and it wouldn’t even require invoking the scary words like “socialism”.

If you asked a typical PC buyer why they chose Windows, their answer would go something like this: &quot;All the software I need is on Windows. Windows has the REAL version of Office. Windows has IE6, the REAL internet. Windows has all my games, and my work software.&quot; Like the iPhone, the Mac was technologically superior in many ways, but that did not stop the Mac from shrinking to only a 5% market share, ceding its place in PC history to Windows.<p>Today, the iPhone enjoys the breadth of 3rd party software the Mac could only dream of. People pay $1000, sometimes every year, for a phone! This has transformed Apple&#x27;s fortune from a struggling company into the most valuable company in the world. Why are people willing to pay so much for a phone? Because it is so much more than a phone. And why is it so much more than a phone? Because of the all 3rd party software expanding what the smartphone could do beyond what anyone thought was possible. So, why on earth would you put a tax on something that helps you so much, that it likely made the difference between being the distant loser in the PC era, vs being one of two major winners in the smartphone era?\n---<p>There&#x27;s a lot of different angles people arguing about this, but this is my favorite: Which is that the FLOW OF VALUE GOES BOTH WAYS. I find the tone that Apple takes on this arrogant: They really believe they are doing developers this huge favor by creating the iPhone and the AppStore and the flow of value flows massively in one direction, from Apple-to-Developer. But I sincerely do believe that 3rd party software is what made the difference between the fate of the Mac and the fate of the iPhone, and the respective difference in Apple&#x27;s fortune. For as much as one could gush about iPhone&#x27;s incredible hardware and software lead, the Mac <i>had those same things going for it<\/i> and still lost to Windows because of the software.<p>For Apple to turn around an rent-seek against one of the core reasons why the iPhone is successful, is to me, an incredible betrayal, and made possible only because of the gross difference in power and market concentration."],"time":["2020-08-14 08:44:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Findeton"],"id":[24148096],"kids":[24149693,24148471,24148841,24148467,24148148,24150025,24149892,24148254,24149255,24149743,24148211],"parent":[24146987],"text":["I don&#x27;t think this should be regulated at all.

Ceiling Fan Software LLC<\/i> (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;blizzard-entmt-inc-v-ceiling-fan-software-llc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;blizzard-entmt-inc-v-ceiling-fan-s...<\/a>) would apply to the antitrust claims made in Epic&#x27;s lawsuits.<p>For those unfamiliar with the case, Blizzard filed suit against Ceiling Fan Software for selling a World of Warcraft bot against the WoW EULA. Ceiling Fan Software filed a countersuit claiming Blizzard&#x27;s monopolistic actions in the market of &quot;add-on hardware&#x2F;software for WoW&quot; violated antitrust laws.<p>Blizzard argued that Ceiling Fan Software could not establish an antitrust claim because WoW users voluntarily consented to their EULA and knew the ahead of time when they purchased WoW  that they would not be allowed to use third-party bots. The court agreed:<p>&gt; <i>Blizzard raises this argument in its motion, contending that Defendants cannot establish antitrust claims based on its users&#x27; voluntary consent to the EULA and TOU. (Mot. Br. 22–23.) Although Blizzard does not argue this point in the market power analysis, the Court finds that this discussion is applicable to whether the market power requirement is established. Blizzard cites Newcal, Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 441 (3d Cir.1997), and Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp., 586 F.Supp.2d 1190, 1201 (N.D.Cal.2008), to show that Defendants cannot base its claims on the aftermarket restrictions. ( See Opp&#x27;n Br. 17.) These cases explain that the law prohibits an antitrust claimant from asserting an antitrust claim “resting on market power that arises solely from contractual rights that customers knowingly and voluntarily gave to the defendant” when they purchased the initial tying product.<\/i><p>...<p>&gt; <i>Based on the allegations in the FACC, users agreed to the terms of the EULA and TOU during the initial contract they sign with Blizzard regarding the use of WoW. Blizzard is entitled to condition the use of WoW on such restrictions, and any resulting market power in the aftermarket cannot be the basis for antitrust claims. The only reason why Blizzard or its licensees allegedly hold market power in the aftermarket is because Blizzard users agree not to use any unauthorized WoW add-ons. It can be inferred that users therefore agree to only use authorized WoW add-ons that advance play, and agreeing to this inherently gives Blizzard power over any market for such products. Based on the case law discussed, it is clear that such a contractually mandated monopoly over an aftermarket is not a legally cognizable market. \nBecause the market power allegations fail, Defendants have not adequately plead antitrust counterclaims under the Sherman and Clayton Acts.  Moreover, since Defendants&#x27; UCL counterclaim is based those antitrust claims, that counterclaim also fails.<\/i><p>If the reasoning in that case applies here, I don&#x27;t see how Epic doesn&#x27;t lose both lawsuits? If Apple&#x27;s App Store policies are known by the consumer in advance of purchasing an iPhone, and Apple&#x27;s &quot;market power&quot; in the aftermarket of &quot;iOS App Distribution&quot; is based on the iPhone&#x27;s EULA saying you can only install apps from the Apple App Store, wouldn&#x27;t the same reasoning apply and Epic&#x27;s antitrust claim would fail because &quot;a contractually mandated monopoly over an aftermarket is not a legally cognizable market&quot;?<p>Note: the <i>Apple Inc. v.

We also know that creativity, innovation and empathy are not encouraged in such a climate even though above all else these are the survival qualities for coping with an uncertain future.<p>In this short book Peter Hartkamp develops his arguments against coercive ‘education’ with a needle-sharp engineer’s logic.
