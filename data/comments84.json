There is no first hand record of consent about whether or not any registered entity can call or message me. Almost everyone receives messages and calls from unsolicited numbers asking to buy insurance, loan, or a credit card. Its a huge problem so much that an average customer would get 2-3 calls a day.

A community economy is like a national economy except that the value of its currency does not rely on the coercive legal powers of a government. Aside from that, it functions exactly like any normal economy; if participants in this economy (token holders) export more services than they import, then their cryptocurrency&#x27;s total value (market cap) will go up relative to other national currencies.<p>I think cryptocurrency is the best use case for blockchain technology. It is a very narrow use case but an extremely important one. It gives a group of people access to powerful financial tools that are otherwise completely out of reach for regular people.<p>The idea that communities can have their own micro-economies is going to be radical and completely change how we do business.<p>One specific use case which I&#x27;ve identified is the ability to use a cryptocurrency to represent shares in a business. It offers small businesses powerful financial tools which are not available to normal businesses of that size. For example, you can use business profits to do token buybacks (which are like share buyback which corporations use); with decentralized exchanges, it&#x27;s even possible to do buybacks without relying on any intermediaries (e.g. no accountants or brokers). Token buybacks are a simpler alternative to distributing dividends to shareholders. Token buybacks (and subsequent burning of bought tokens) allow a company to pay shareholders through capital appreciation by diluting the cryptocurrency&#x27;s total supply; this gives small businesses access to the same financial tools which big corporations use to reduce their shareholders&#x27; tax liability among other things (capital gains are typically taxed much lower than income and only paid when they are realized; I.e. when tokens are sold). Also, having a tradable cryptocurrency gives a business exposure to influential outsiders (e.g. journalists, wealthy investors, politicians) who have an incentive to participate in the underlying small business and then use their influence to help grow that business and its cryptocurrency. &#x27;Airdrops&#x27; can also be carried out in highly targeted ways to create a favorable economic and political environment for the business.<p>With cryptocurrency it&#x27;s also possible to pay contributors (employees) using the token instead of fiat. It also helps make sure that contributors&#x27; incentives are aligned with all other stakeholders. I&#x27;m currently part of a business which works like this. We have 7 contributors and everyone has only been paid using crypto for the past few months. We have a buyback-and-burn deflationary mechanism in place so everyone knows that each token is (on average) guaranteed to always go up in value. You can also pay for marketing and other services using the token - I was quite surprised by how many people were willing accept our cryptocurrency in exchange for services; it feels like the majority of people."],"time":["2020-04-19 14:06:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kalium-xyz"],"id":[22914947],"kids":[22918595],"parent":[22914430],"text":["Git comes to mind."],"time":["2020-04-19 13:00:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bitconion"],"id":[22914841],"kids":[22918639,22922735],"parent":[22914430],"text":["problem #1 - protect freedom, liberties<p>problem #2 - adaptation to the needs of the complex system like modern society<p>those are kind of ‘significant’ problems, technologies like Internet, blockchain etc, provide sequential approximations to the solution of those problems."],"time":["2020-04-19 12:36:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["garmaine"],"id":[22914683],"kids":{},"parent":[22914430],"text":["&gt; I think the same is true for cryptocurrencies but I would like to keep those out of the discussion, if possible.<p>A bit strange to exclude the one and only answer to your question."],"time":["2020-04-19 11:51:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nvoyageur"],"id":[22917411],"kids":[22918870,22922750,22918550],"parent":[22914430],"text":["I’d like to go back to 1988 and ask “Is anyone actually using the Internet?”<p>I’m sure the responses would be similar.

From what I heard, it takes a few years to get disillusioned&#x2F;cynical here. With that said: In general, I&#x27;m fairly impressed with how Google behaves internally and how much emphasis there still is on being nice and good. I mean, one thing that seems obvious to me is that the Google of 2020s will always be held to the standard of the Google of the 2000s or the 2010s, and that is a comparison that it just cannot win. It&#x27;s very different to run a company of thousands of employees vs one of 100k people. Trying to not be evil just doesn&#x27;t scale so easily: there is definitely going to be internal politics, and you are confronted with harder choices. You _are_ going to be hiring some bad apples, even if you try your hardest and manage to achieve that 99,9% of your hires are nice, exceptional people. The numbers are against you, and so is public scrutiny, so anything bad that happens will get reported anyways. And you can&#x27;t be honest to your employees all the time if all your internal communication is going to be published on bloomberg, and has to be written with that in mind. You have multiple, sometimes conflicting interests that you need to handle. So in general: I think the Google of 2020 is less Good than the company it was 10 years ago. But overall it&#x27;s still a very, very good company: I am very impressed with the general quality of people that surround me. Both on the grunt level as well as higher up the totem pole. Obviously no-one&#x27;s flawless, and I definitely am unhappy with a lot of internal and external choices, decisions, strategies and communications. But I still feel that people (all the way up to leadership) are trying to do the right thing. Not to just do right for large stakeholders or themselves, but to actually figure out what the Right Thing is, and follow through on it. I don&#x27;t see a lot of greedy behavior in leadership, or people who don&#x27;t care or are doing a bad job. They seem to care to keep Google a &quot;good&quot; company, both to its users and internally. There were enough scandals, but I still feel like leadership is trying to sort stuff out and improving internal policies to make sure bad incidents don&#x27;t repeat themselves. I think most people in the company know that in the long term, it&#x27;s better to work with users, and put user&#x27;s interests (including privacy) first.<p>The general backlash against Google is the obvious one that Google collects a ton of data about you. Google is an ad company, and it makes as much money as it does BECAUSE it can put the ads in front of those users where it will be most effective. It can only do that because it knows a lot about users. It&#x27;s google&#x27;s core business. The trade-off makes a lot of sense to me: users get to use a really good product for free (It is hard to impossible to compete with google search), and in return Google gets to serve them targeted ads that it sells to other businesses. That&#x27;s a fairly obvious and IMO very good deal, and it&#x27;s easy to see how this happened historically, and it&#x27;s likely not going to change -- people are too used to getting good search for free, you simply can&#x27;t charge money for a search engine these days. I think the issue is that users aren&#x27;t always conscious of this transaction taking place (you get free search-results and emails, and google gets to use the data it collects when you use the services).\nBut the good news is that as far as I can tell, Google takes privacy concerns very, very serious. It&#x27;s mind boggling (but technically obvious) how much Google _could_ know about you, since it has your location data, search results, and theoretically even your emails (as far as I know, gmail data is fairly sacred and not exploited to better sell you ads). The mean reason I think google is still a good company (and doesn&#x27;t deserve the backslash) is that, simply, Google doesn&#x27;t exploit all the data it could collect about people for nefarious purposes, AFAICT. Now granted, I&#x27;m working in a role that is far away from those decisions, but it seems to me that a whole, Google tries to be nice and fair, and the protocols and technical solutions appear sensible and carefully designed to put user&#x27;s privacy first. Given the position google is in, I think it is trying very hard to do the right thing and protect its users rights and data, and does not exploit them in any &quot;evil&quot; way, as far as I can tell.<p>Like I said, I think this is a decision that makes economical sense: even as it is Google faces enough scrutiny, it&#x27;s in their interests to not exploit all the data it could collect. I&#x27;m sure all the scandals that Facebook has hurt its bottom line.

There&#x27;s no logically-consistent reason why Facebook should exercise more control over content than Verizon does over the content of phone calls. To do so is to invite accusations of censorship, and run the risk of being treated as a publisher rather than a carrier. Nonetheless, we&#x27;re devoting more human and computer time to detecting disinformation than most companies have in total. Vast data centers&#x27; worth. I&#x27;m in storage, so I see only the edge of this, in the form of (insanely complex) analysis pipelines and models. That&#x27;s enough to get a feel for the scale of these efforts, and it boggles my mind. People are honing these techniques all the time, and having some successes.

Most people who accuse FB of taking this issue lightly just don&#x27;t grasp the scale at which we operate and the additional difficulty that entails.<p>Does FB still do things that make me cringe? Sure does. The disrespect for user choice (e.g. chronological-timeline settings constantly being reset) pisses me off to no end. The demands put on moderators of large groups, and the dearth of tools made available to them, is inexcusable. Likewise for the lack of decent support or appeal processes when users are adversely affected by our own screwups. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that even though the people I work with directly are great, there are some other people at the other end of the company (user-facing product rather than deep infra) and at a different level who ... well, let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t get along with them so well. It <i>does<\/i> give me pause sometimes, but not enough to outweigh my belief in the basic mission.<p>You want evil companies? How about those who make much of their money from contracts with ICE&#x2F;CBP&#x2F;NSA? How about those that have helped hollow out the economy with their anti-labor &quot;gig economy&quot; BS, leading to millions of unemployed right now? Or the worse half of the finance or defense industries? How about those helping to destroy our health or our planet? There are absolutely better companies I could work for. My ideal would be to do what I do at a company that&#x27;s making vaccines or something, but they didn&#x27;t seem interested in hiring me. But there are other companies that <i>were<\/i> interested and I turned them down because I don&#x27;t approve of what they do.

After this you can aim to write your own interpreters.<p>3) Go to Norvig&#x27;s JScheme - which adds mechanisms from more real Scheme, like tail recursion optimization. By this time you&#x27;ll have some practical ideas about how closures are built; Michael Nielsen uses Python&#x27;s functions for that.<p>4) Read about continuations. Look at &quot;Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; for solid foundations. Look at &quot;On Lisp&quot; for e.g. treating of macros - both of these books are on the Internet to read. I&#x27;d also recommend checking &quot;Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming&quot; - another book (by Norvig) available on the Internet to read - which teaches Lisp while providing plenty of examples of its use for interesting problems.<p>&quot;The Little Schemer&quot; book (an awesome series) talks about patterns for how to apply Lisp for problems; look at them.<p>You will probably get most out of pp.1 and 2, but the others will expand your horizons.

Now try to build something from scratch, like try to write a tic-tac-toe game, or write a search engine, or whatever you prefer.<p>&gt; What is easier to do Lisp than is missing from functional languages like Python?<p>There are two kinds of Functional language. There are those who rely on first-class functions as their unit of abstraction. In those, functions close over their environment, and can be passed around as values. Python has support for this type of functional programming, but it is somewhat mediocre compared to most Lisps. Python still relies a lot on Classes and Objects, and there are some constraints with the way its functions are first-class especially around anonymous functions and partial application. Scheme and Racket are pros at this when it comes to Lisps.<p>And then there are those where data is immutable, and most functions are pure. In those, everything will be an expression that returns a value, instead of a statement which returns nothing. Recursion will be used for looping, because data can&#x27;t mutate, so it must be passed along. Records will be value based, instead of identity based, because they are immutable. Clojure is the king here when it comes to Lisps.<p>Nothing will be easier to do, especially to you, someone unfamiliar with Lisps, and learning it. But it should be more fun and more rewarding. The development process is more interactive, Lisp languages tend to have every feature under the sun for you to learn and mess around with. Performance should be better than Python, especially if you go for Clojure, Chez Scheme, or SBCL. Also expressiveness is really high, that means anything a little boilerplate, or requiring too much typing or contortioning can be factored out by a Macro. And structural editing is quite productive once you learn how to use it properly.<p>And once you know a Lisp, you can start exploring Emacs, and understanding how Emacs work, and how to modify it to your liking, which is a very fun new world of possibilities.<p>&gt; What are some big projects built in Lisp (other than this site)?<p>There&#x27;s Emacs. I know that Walmart was(still is?) using Clojure for their backend listings I think. I use it at my work for secret stuff ;), but it&#x27;s handling backend micro-services processing thousands of requests per second. Circle CI pretty sure have a mostly Clojure based stack. Consumer Reports online is apparently built in Clojure. Apparently Atlassian have some Clojure backends. Boeing apparently runs some Clojure based in-flight diagnostic.  ITA apparently uses CL for searching for airfares. And AutoCad uses CL it seems. NuBank is entirely written in Clojure, a pretty big fintech bank in Brazil of 5000 devs. AdZerk an ad serving company, and NextJournal, an awesome data-science notebook offering both have full on Clojure stacks. Apparently Cisco has a product called Threat Grid which is implemented in Clojure. Clojure&#x2F;Script really dominates in that area compared to other Lisp from what I know here.<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s so good, why isn&#x27;t it more popular?<p>Because everyone that could learn it, like you, back out because they ask this question :p Chicken and Egg is the answer really. Though I&#x27;d say, Lisp is tailored to experts, it doesn&#x27;t make things easy and obvious, it kind of gives you infinite flexibility and customization. It has the opposite mantra of Python, the one and only one way, Lisp is like all and every possible way. So imagine a language that gives you infinite flexibility and customization, and every possible way to do anything and everything, yet is dynamic and without static type to help guide you in any of it, and has a syntax that isn&#x27;t like anything you&#x27;ve learned in school, not like the math you know, not like the English you speak.

If you have a good IDE (e.g. Emacs + CIDER), this can make you slightly faster at editing code than normal.<p>2. Functional programming: Many lisps traditionally use recursion. It&#x27;s not necessarily a core part of Lisp nor is it super great (I avoid it whenever possible). Most of the FP you get from Lisp you can also get from JavaScript and a good FP library (e.g. lodash).<p>3. Immutability: This isn&#x27;t traditionally part of Lisps either, mostly just Clojure, and it can be done with libraries in JS. But people often mix these up and think it&#x27;s a Lisp thing so I listed it here.<p>4. Macros: Many other languages have good macros now (Elixir, Rust, etc). It can be useful in certain situations, especially how it&#x27;s used in Rust&#x27;s stdlib and third party libs, but it&#x27;s not a panacea as commonly thought.<p>5. Homoiconicity: This is one of the biggest touted features of Lisps and I just really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great. It&#x27;s mostly useful in writing macros, but other languages have macro systems that don&#x27;t really suffer from not having this.<p>6.

We don&#x27;t build new homes because homeowners <i>like<\/i> the value of their goods protected by intense scarcity.

And if you let people tinker with those benchmarks at random, you get random results, skewed to optimize towards a fairy tale. Think of all the fads and trends you&#x27;ve seen in your career - serious proposals for improving your skills, productivity, status, income, etc. How many of them ultimately  ended up being a disproven hypothesis built by someone doing some brand-building? The market weakly indicates demand, but it&#x27;s a naive system, prone to acting like a toddler.<p>This is, in fact, often a major question in game design too. When the problem space gets reduced to a score optimization problem(whether score in the context is &quot;high score&quot; or &quot;maximizing some form of output&quot; like HP damage), you often end up with degenerate solutions that involve a repetitive linear application of some technique. And when this appears in a competitive context, the game starts stagnating into a rote exercise of min-max, and other solution sets go unexplored. Competitive players often look for ways to gatekeep and declare a playstyle unacceptable so that they stay in their comfort zone and keep their status - but acceptability is ultimately a matter of what you believe the competition is or should be about. If you don&#x27;t have that agreement of shared belief, the game itself falls into incoherence, and that is what we see at a broader scale in society where its systems fail.<p>But there are some answers. One is to enforce a broad set of all-or-nothing contractual failure modes: If you fail the minimums you don&#x27;t get the maximum. At a baseline we have Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs setting some of these minimums. And our legal system often works in this direction of adding a minimum.  Another is to add buffers, delays and noise on results: If you don&#x27;t have an instant guaranteed outcome, you can&#x27;t push your margins nearly as hard, and so you don&#x27;t end up in a distorted min-maxing zone, but a more systematic one, which can only be manipulated through careful synchronization that &quot;gets ahead of&quot; or &quot;applies leverage&quot; to the problem. This is something we&#x27;re now dealing with increasingly in an interconnected &quot;instant society&quot; where continuous access is the norm and many activities that were one arduous and needed a strong commitment have been reduced and repackaged into status symbols. Lastly, overt market mechanisms - pricing and bidding and ownership - help when applied appropriately. But they are premised on active participation in the process, humans in the loop who can really think through all the factors. When we automate market activities, we end up back in the scenario of min-maxing.<p>Lots of fun things to think about. It&#x27;s not just the building that matters, but the &quot;why&quot; of it.

If I have limited resources (e.g., time, money, land, materials, etc.), then if I choose to build something, I may be choosing to abandon (not maintain) something, or even to destroy that thing. I think this applies to businesses, apps, bridges, skyscrapers, and even relationships. If I start something new, it often replaces the old.<p>I believe we may struggle with this, because, while we crave new things, we get emotionally attached to old things. We get attached to the way we&#x27;re able to see the SF Bay from our house and don&#x27;t want anything blocking our view. We get attached to our expertise and comfort at coding in a specific language and don&#x27;t want to learn yet another new language.

How do we fix them? Answer: rich people should manipulate the government even more! Clearly, that must be the answer.<p>But isn&#x27;t that how we got here in the first place?<p>Believe me, I know [our] democracy sucks. I&#x27;ve been to planning meetings in San Francisco. I&#x27;ve seen democracy sucking first-hand.<p>Our democracy systematically rewards the people who have the means, time and incentive to participate much more often than the average citizen. Anyone who visits enough town halls can tell: you see the same people over and over again, speaking louder than anyone else.<p>When you have a system that repeatedly gives bad outcomes in a variety of different situations, it&#x27;s not enough to try to force new particular outcomes. You have to change the way the system works. That doesn&#x27;t mean you try [and fail] again to get disengaged people involved in politics. Those people aren&#x27;t involved in politics for a reason. They&#x27;re busy; they&#x27;re not rich or charismatic; they don&#x27;t have strong motivations.<p>What you <i>can<\/i> do is change <i>the situation<\/i> around the disengaged people. The easiest facet is money. Most people do not spend money on politics. Only a small fraction do.<p>Andrew Yang had a proposal to give citizens a hundred dollars each that could only be spent on political campaigns. It wasn&#x27;t near the top of his list of proposals, but I thought it was the best idea he had offered. Most people don&#x27;t have the time or the desire to <i>participate<\/i> the way that social theorists imagine that they should. But what&#x27;s great about money is that it is very easy to pool together.<p>The other thing that&#x27;s great about money is that you have a lot of bandwidth for your signals. In an election, even a ranked-choice election, you submit maybe a few dozen bits of entropy to the great machine that rules the world and it tries to make something useful out of it. The advice bits are few; the world bits are many. The machine struggles. As the world becomes larger, the machine struggles more. Money is different; money can be spend in many, many different ways. The bandwidth becomes much larger; the machine can <i>at least in principle<\/i> function better.<p>In order to actually make sure that money is used in a positive way, though, you need to have a model of the people as they relate to the system of government. Economists like to talk about how the market aggregates information. So too should a democracy. But where a market aggregates information about people&#x27;s activities, a democracy aggregates information about their opinions.<p>In other words, in order to fix democracy, you need to find the best way to aggregate people&#x27;s opinions.<p>My theory here is simple: most people have a fair understanding of a few things and a poor understanding of most things. If the system could be organized so as to encourage people to spend money on issues they understand better than the norm, the information quality will be higher.<p>Some of this will have to depend on goodwill. The most clearly lucrative way to spend your money on politics will probably still be to lower your own taxes. But if we give people the <i>opportunity<\/i> to choose to spend their money on issues that relate to <i>them, specifically<\/i>, they might feel more included and more inclined to participate honestly.<p>There is a crisis of institutional trust in America.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;key-finding...<\/a><p>Improving democracy seems, to me, to be one of the best opportunities to rebuild this trust.

As early as January or February. A country as populous as India (with 1.3 billion people) has been under lockdown for well over 27 days and counting. Will be under lockdown till May the 3rd (and might get extended too if the curve has not flattened). We went in early unlike Italy or the United States. And it was a complete shutdown and not partial.<p>Even before the Lockdown commenced, we were testing all travelers as early as January and isolating those who were showing any signs of sickness. The Western countries did not do any of it. These two things alone helped slowdown the spread of the virus. There was no need for large amounts of ventilators, masks or PPE. Just common sense.<p>What the West got wrong was not &quot;lack of ability&quot; to build things. It was &quot;lack of agility&quot; to respond to the emerging crisis. The West should have gone in for a complete lockdown. The West should have tested (no contact thermal testing would have been sufficient) all travelers at the entry point. This slackness cost so many lives!<p>I remember having a discussion [1] about this almost a month ago when the first major destructive potential of this pandemic was still unravelling in the West. Many were skeptical about how India would respond and that it was a disaster waiting to happen. But no such disaster happened because of how proactive the Government of India had been since January. This proactiveness has allowed India to have really low number of positive cases compared to the West. This also doesn&#x27;t put pressure on the medical system.<p>The lesson to learn here is that you should use common sense. A lot of it. First control the spread of the virus and then work on a cure. You can&#x27;t let the virus wreak havoc and then expect a vaccine or a cure be available immediately to tackle it. It puts unnecessary pressure on scientists who need crucial time to figure out a cure. But I guess it is too late now and the West will just have to ride the wave. Unfortunately a lot of lives will be lost in the process.

(I love solving problems by building new things too!) However, the housing market works differently.<p>4&#x2F; Notice the open-air parking lots in most urban areas: they’re hardly developed, used only for a few cars — even though (and this is crucial) there is an <i>exceptional<\/i> demand for housing in those areas.<p>5&#x2F; It’s not that these lots are not zoned for housing, or that it’s too expensive to build any kind of housing on those open-air parking lots. None of these things are true. The reason these parking lots exist is because property ownership incentives are flawed.<p>6&#x2F; A person who owns an open-air parking lot often makes more money over time through property appreciation (even minus property taxes), and is therefore not incentivized to put this property to its optimal use, i.e. to use it to provide more housing.<p>7&#x2F; The core problem is that the land market (and therefore the real estate market) is, in actuality, an entry monopoly; an entry monopoly occurs whenever a market is closed to new participants because supply (i.e. land in prime locations) can’t be increased.<p>8&#x2F; See, the market for automobiles (or software, etc.) is different: if there is a greater demand for cars, more cars can, and will, be created.<p>9&#x2F; New land in good locations, however, cannot be made; so if property developers want to build more housing in a good location, they have to buy land from someone who already owns land in that location (if they choose to sell, that is!).<p>10&#x2F;  This artificially increases cost, artificially diminishes supply, and drastically limits the supply of affordable housing across the board. Unlike software, the housing market is not a free market. It is a monopoly. Like the game.<p>11&#x2F; There’s a lot more to this topic, but I’ve done my best to summarize a small part of it here in this thread.

The issue is not &#x27;getting everyone to harvard&#x27; - the issue is &#x27;getting everyone who deserves to go to a decent school - into one&#x27;. This actually isn&#x27;t a huge problem in the US.<p>Third - we DONT need more college! College was a legit mark of the elite (legitimately) but it&#x27;s not anymore. We are <i>failing<\/i> huge cohorts of kids that do <i>not<\/i> go to college! The &#x27;problem&#x27; is that we provide <i>no path<\/i> for non-college educated kids to get into the system.

If Chinese factories can pay pennies, fire people for going to the bathroom, spy on everyone 24&#x2F;7, pollute up the yang, have the government back national players with money from the central bank and force international competitors out of business ... when then you see why there are &#x27;few factories&#x27; in the US.<p>The &#x27;answer&#x27; to &#x27;more physical building&#x27; is something he is unwilling to say and that is a nationalist cause with trade barriers, something that neoliberals absolutely hate.<p>With issues such as lack of PPE, ventilators and chems. for testing it becomes much more clear obviously.<p>What would happen if the government literally said &#x27;We declar this, that and this sector to be &#x27;strategically imperartive&#x27; and therefore all production must happen within the country&#x27;. Well guess what? Those &#x27;fancy factories&#x27; would get built. It would still be more expensive than China - but - the huge benefit from that is that this would entail a huge transfer of wealth to the poor and less educated for their doing actual, meaningful work. Which is always better than welfare or UBI.<p>Now - combine this &#x27;factory&#x27; problem with the &#x27;what do we do with all these no-college people&#x27; and you start to see how these issues resonate.<p>So yes we need to be &#x27;building&#x27; but we need to be building &#x27;up&#x27; not &#x27;out&#x27;.<p>&#x27;Building out&#x27; is a 19th and 20th century strategy.

Then the very same right-wing think tank says it&#x27;s an unconstitutional infringement of liberty, the very same right-wing politicians who were proposing it now say it&#x27;s their job to vote against it, and 50% of the US dedicates its political aims towards overturning it, and it lasts barely five years before being overturned (as part of a bill to cut taxes, i.e., cut public sector funding, incidentally).<p>The public sector cannot build better hospitals, schools, transportation, cities, or housing than the private sector because the private sector can work on something for more than 4-8 years without being gutted.<p>&gt; <i>Here’s a modest proposal to my critics.

Seems like they&#x27;d be happier with a consistently small and low-taxing government and could demonstrate the superiority of the private sector more easily that way."],"time":["2020-04-19 04:57:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["gurumeditations"],"id":[22913409],"kids":{},"parent":[22911533],"text":["Everybody knows there’s something wrong. The problem isn’t the will or the want. It’s the political system hijacked by a radicalist extremist Republican Party that works for wealthy interests that want to preserve and expand their wealth at the expense of the society they extract their wealth from. When one side of the political system traffics in conspiracies, science&#x2F;education&#x2F;expertise denial, hatred, and treason, when one side is interested in allowing companies to dump toxic waste into the drinking water supply instead of building new infrastructure, and takes control of the executive, the legislature, the courts, law enforcement, and the military, it’s no surprise that things that should be done don’t get done. All the writing in the world won’t change the fact that the people who want to get things done aren’t in control, and much of society doesn’t give a damn either, in fact they support self destruction because they’re stupid, no other way to politely cover that up. If they did, we wouldn’t be where we are now. The founders certainly knew this. Let’s be clear: the Republican Party and its millions of voters is the biggest problem by far in this country, and the sooner they are removed from having an ounce of power, the sooner we’ll be on the track to doing any of the ideas listed in the essay (rant). Anyone who has paid close attention to politics in the last 5-10 years knows that there is no shortage of smart and visionary people who want to ‘make the world a better place’ in the Democratic Party, but that they are frustrated and obstructed by the Republican Party at every single turn. A society that elects and continues to allow someone like Donald Trump to be its leader is a society that is so thoroughly fucked. We’ve been stewed in this bullshit for so long that I think we forget just how insane it is that this is the guy who is supposed to lead us, and that millions of people voted for him, and he’s still in charge and no one’s removed him yet. Until the smart and&#x2F;or good people (of whom I’m sure Andreesen would like to count himself as one) wise up and take action to end the tyranny of the stupid and evil, the leadership and influence of the Republican Party and the voters who comprise it, absolutely nothing will get done. If we think a temporary pandemic is a disaster, just wait for the effects of climate destruction to keep getting worse and worse. Think partially empty grocery shelves for a few months is hard?<p>It’s difficult. In a relatively democratic system, it tends towards the lowest common denominator. Stupidity is easy to manipulate. Fear and anger and other emotional bases are cheaper and more powerful to inflame than hope and love and reason. Most people are relatively dumb, and when you empower those masses, you don’t get gold from a mountain of crap. You get more crap. Social media has connected the dumb masses together and empowered them. A society full of people so stupid and also connected and empowered in their stupidity is a recipe for disaster in democracy. Is democracy incompatible with progress? Should we die on the altar of democracy and freedom and the supremacy of the individual rather than understand that without the careful pruning of the all powerful gardener, a society will be overgrown and overtaken by weeds when left to its own power? Can a society that’s poisoned by sources on the right wing, whose poison is spread far and wide by the interconnectedness of social media, survive?"],"time":["2020-04-19 05:59:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["curyous"],"id":[22912232],"kids":[22912238],"parent":[22911533],"text":["The start of the article is simply wrong.

This sort of outcome does not magically self-assemble, it starts with one person that takes action. You actually need hyper competent, hard charging, ambitious, skilled people of all sorts to go after the extreme challenges represented by such a huge re-industrialization. These people and their talents no longer exist in such high numbers among the population as they did prior to the gutting of the US industrial age. They are now rare and the capital that desires to fund them is equally rare.<p>If you want to produce them, you need to completely alter the incentive structures we arrange our economy around.<p>We should have 0% corporate tax rates for all domestic manufacturing concerns, to get started. Tax individual income at a higher rate.<p>Implement a robust system of income tax credits and abandon the minimum wage as it exists today. This is not my idea of course, Warren Buffett is probably its loudest supporter and he is absolutely right. Set the income tax credit system such that it guarantees a higher minimum wage of at least $12. By removing the strict front-facing minimum wage we have today (which blocks labor from the market), all businesses would immediately aggressively seek to hire anyone and everyone they can get their hands on. The workers would be guaranteed a minimum wage by the redistribution income tax credit system and there would be no labor-value blocker (aka the minimum wage) keeping businesses from hiring people.<p>If a state has a $12 minimum wage, and your labor is only worth $9, you&#x27;re screwed. This solves that.<p>It&#x27;s about absorbing max lower skill labor (where the unemployment problems tend to be over time) into the workforce. You make labor artificially cheaper, while simultaneously paying that labor a fair wage: we subsidize the outcome we want. They produce, they earn a good wage, they build savings and can start to become asset owners. They also start learning new skills (and later might start production of their own based on the accumulating of experience at making goods; an important catalyst in re-industrialization). The combination would unleash epic common-goods manufacturing output the likes of which the US hasn&#x27;t seen in half a century.<p>It would make it economical to manufacture low-margin, lower value goods in the US again.

User interface design and customer service will probably generate more added value for computer companies than hardware manufacturing, and user interfaces are a major way to differentiate products in a market dominated by an otherwise homogenizing trend towards open systems.&quot; - Jakob Nielson, Usability Engineering - 1993.<p>I think he partly got the prediction right, that usability would be big differentiator. Apple and MS over the following years had big efforts focused on consistency in their interfaces and we had what many consider a golden age of UI usability, at least from a consistency standpoint. I think what happened next is that two things came along and basically reset the state of UI design back to zero: Mobile and the web.<p>Both platforms were so radically different that Apple and MS UI guidelines were useless. We got a horde of web and mobile designers experimenting with all sorts of novel interfaces. Experimentation is a great thing but consistency has definitely suffered. I&#x27;ve long thought there was big money to made by somebody wrapping up a complete linux distro, with a set of common applications (libreoffice, et al) but putting in the (very significant) effort to standardize _every_ interface, write good manuals and provide customer support. Sort of like the service that Red Hat provides for servers but with a desktop focus. Maybe they couldn&#x27;t eat MS&#x27;s lunch, but if they could demonstrate big productivity gains for businesses, maybe they could.<p>In the last decade I think we&#x27;ve seen the (much needed) injection of artistic talent into the UI design space. UIs today are much more beautiful than in 1995. That&#x27;s because businesses realized that users value beauty and hardware improved to the point where more visual effects could be provided without sacrificing performance. In the next decade I think we&#x27;ll see a resurgence of focus on accessibility and usability centered around design guidelines that coalesce out of consensus in disparate communities rather than corporate policy. I think especially that as Moore&#x27;s law continues to flatten out, and network connection speeds start to platau we&#x27;re going to see a renewed focus on responsive UI design and application performance. I am excited about these trends and feel optimistic about software design going forward.<p>Too bad Nielson was totally wrong about customer service though. :-("],"time":["2020-04-17 22:06:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MattGaiser"],"id":[22902996],"kids":[22903920,22903482,22904251,22903594],"parent":[22901541],"text":["I work on a project meant to sell a service and meant to manage the service being sold to the consumer.

Each application does its own thing when it comes to layout, and each app is also subject to change so not only do new users struggle to find where a button is, but experienced users have to re learn the UI. I also agree that a lot of the bad changes to the desktop come from mobile. Something that works on mobile because of the small screen, limited horizontal space, and inaccurate input method will inherently not be the most efficient on a usually large wide-screen device with very precise input methods. There is also a large element of sacrificing usability for aesthetics which doesn&#x27;t help.<p>What I don&#x27;t agree with: I don&#x27;t think we had ever reached a stage where we nailed usability. The &quot;golden age&quot; he talks about, with the file, edit, view menus weren&#x27;t all that great. I remember using word 2003 and having to click through each menu and reading each entry one by one to find the option I needed because it wasn&#x27;t obvious where it should live. The one advantage this system had was that every app used it and so everyone understood the paradigm, which is arguably a bigger factor to usability than the actual design.<p>He also makes it seem like (although I don&#x27;t think he argues this point) every new innovation in UIs past a certain point were bad. But he also gives a counter example, the bookmark bar. Older web browsers didn&#x27;t have this feature, it was something that came later. Some wizz kid one day implemented it and this feature happened to stick. We haven&#x27;t solved UIs yet, and so we have to try new things in order to figure out what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think the most important thing with many UIs is how easy it is for a new user to understand. Most people would agree that Vim has a great interface, but it just takes a while to learn it. This goes for a lot of specialist and professional applications, I&#x27;d prefer it to be designed to be useful for the veteran user, not the newbie, but with good documentation to make the learning as easy as possible."],"time":["2020-04-19 09:27:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["oneplane"],"id":[22908848],"kids":{},"parent":[22901541],"text":["This is also why Windows Phone and Windows 8 were dead before they arrived, there is no discoverability besides randomly clicking and swiping to see if something happens.

If you have no consistency and no known functionality, the UI is basically worthless.<p>There are some ways to get a &#x27;better&#x27; UI without breaking so much, like the macOS menu bar that is context-dependant. You save some space in each window, yet because you can only click one menu at a time anyway you don&#x27;t lose any functionality or consistency. The downside is the extra step of first getting focus on the application you wanted to use (but in most window managers you had to focus the window first before using the window-embedded menu bar).<p>It&#x27;s not that a UI can&#x27;t be made better, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s hard to sell to people with no knowledge or affinity with basic HIG principles.

Few steps are required and no sub-goal has to be generated.”<p>An example of task at this level is “Delete this email message” in an email app.<p>Level 1 = 29% of Adult Population<p>This is what level-1 people can do: “Tasks typically require the use of widely available and familiar technology applications, such as email software or a web browser. There is little or no navigation required to access the information or commands required to solve the problem. The problem may be solved regardless of the respondent’s awareness and use of specific tools and functions (e.g. a sort function). The tasks involve few steps and a minimal number of operators. At the cognitive level, the respondent can readily infer the goal from the task statement; problem resolution requires the respondent to apply explicit criteria; and there are few monitoring demands (e.g. the respondent does not have to check whether he or she has used the appropriate procedure or made progress towards the solution). Identifying content and operators can be done through simple match. Only simple forms of reasoning, such as assigning items to categories, are required; there is no need to contrast or integrate information.”<p>The reply-to-all task described above requires level-1 skills. Another example of level-1 task is “Find all emails from John Smith.”\nLevel 2 = 26% of Adult Population<p>This is what level-2 people can do: “At this level, tasks typically require the use of both generic and more specific technology applications. For instance, the respondent may have to make use of a novel online form. Some navigation across pages and applications is required to solve the problem. The use of tools (e.g. a sort function) can facilitate the resolution of the problem. The task may involve multiple steps and operators. The goal of the problem may have to be defined by the respondent, though the criteria to be met are explicit. There are higher monitoring demands. Some unexpected outcomes or impasses may appear. The task may require evaluating the relevance of a set of items to discard distractors. Some integration and inferential reasoning may be needed.”<p>An example of level-2 task is “You want to find a sustainability-related document that was sent to you by John Smith in October last year.”\nLevel 3 = 5% of Adult Population<p>This is what this most-skilled group of people can do: “At this level, tasks typically require the use of both generic and more specific technology applications. Some navigation across pages and applications is required to solve the problem. The use of tools (e.g. a sort function) is required to make progress towards the solution. The task may involve multiple steps and operators. The goal of the problem may have to be defined by the respondent, and the criteria to be met may or may not be explicit. There are typically high monitoring demands. Unexpected outcomes and impasses are likely to occur. The task may require evaluating the relevance and reliability of information in order to discard distractors. Integration and inferential reasoning may be needed to a large extent.”<p>The meeting room task described above requires level-3 skills. Another example of level-3 task is “You want to know what percentage of the emails sent by John Smith last month were about sustainability.”\nCan’t Use Computers = 26% of Adult Population<p>The numbers for the 4 skill levels don’t sum to 100% because a large proportion of the respondents never attempted the tasks, being unable to use computers. In total, across the OECD countries, 26% of adults were unable to use a computer.<p>That one quarter of the population can’t use a computer at all is the most serious element of the digital divide. To a great extent, this problem is caused by computers still being much too complicated for many people.<\/i><p>Let that phrase sink in: <i>across the OECD countries, 26% of adults were unable to use a computer.<\/i> In some countries like Japan, the number is even higher (about 1&#x2F;3 of Japan&#x27;s population can&#x27;t use computers, which may reflect the aging population, poor interface design, or some other factor.)<p>These data were based on surveys from 2011 through 2015, and if TFA is correct about the usability trends, surely it&#x27;s gotten worse."],"time":["2020-04-17 22:44:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Causality1"],"id":[22904188],"kids":{},"parent":[22901541],"text":["It&#x27;s all about fashion now.

His theory: for most apps the user is the commodity; not the software!<p>This is the number one reason why usability of software is not improving and often even declining. The other is feature creep. I&#x27;ll get to that later.\nCaveat: I will be generalizing a lot. :)<p>For the first point —<p>In the case of commercial software this is obvious. You get paid an hourly rate and the company buys software that you then use. Aka: you are not the one deciding which software to buy. How much you enjoy the experience of using it and how productive your are while doing so is thus not really important for the vendor.<p>In the case of open source software you commonly do not pay for the software too. The software is developed by people for various reasons. They may use it themselves or they just like working on it. Again – if you have an issue they do not really have reasons to care that much.<p>Feature creep —<p>One of the things that makes a developer very happy is adding a feature to a software and exposing it to the user.\nAs a developer myself I know the feeling. It&#x27;s wholesome, warm, fuzzy.<p>But when you expose a feature you need to add a user interface to this feature. This is the most difficult part. \nThe number of parameters driving a feature is also called a &#x27;parameter vector&#x27;. The more publicly exposed dimensions such a vector has the more difficult the feature is to use.<p>A feature that has ten parameters may be useful to 99% of users if only three of these ten are exposed. The rest can have magic numbers in the code.\nAdding another seven dimensions to the publicly exposed parameter vector of a feature to cover 100% of use cases is a bad idea.<p>Deciding these things requires intricate understanding of the problem space from the user&#x27;s side. Most developers are not good at this.\nAnd more parameters added to a UI somehow feels better to most people. Even though they do understand that this can be counterproductive.<p>So my friend had this analogy: imagine if you got paid to use a mobile phone. Imagine your government bought phones from Apple, Samsung; whoever. And then you got paid for using them.\nDo you think we would have something like an iPhone or modern smartphones? Unlikely. We would have crazy awful phones from the pre-smartphone era. Probably with much worse UX than some Nokia or Ericsson phones had at the time just before the iPhone appeared.<p>This is the situation we have with most of the common closed- and lots of open source software. Again: I am generalizing here.<p>On the bright side: software that needs to fight for its user base – whether open or close source –, often has better usability.<p>And certainly: for everything I said above there are countless counter examples. But the overall trend seems obvious to me.\nI agree with the author of the article 100%.<p>Well, maybe I&#x27;m just grumpy and old too. :]"],"time":["2020-04-18 23:52:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22906749],"kids":{},"parent":[22901541],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-18 12:34:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["coleifer"],"id":[22904688],"kids":[22906789],"parent":[22901541],"text":["UX careerists are clowns who chase trends and aesthetics over quality and function."],"time":["2020-04-18 03:54:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["GarvielLoken"],"id":[22905753],"kids":{},"parent":[22901541],"text":["Old man yells at clouds"],"time":["2020-04-18 08:26:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["jackschultz"],"id":[22908599],"kids":[22908711,22912729,22921068,22908609,22908867],"parent":[22908224],"text":["Don&#x27;t know if the person who posted this has an affiliation, I do not, but I&#x27;m a huge fan of TablePlus so feel it&#x27;s still worth it for me to comment about this.<p>It offers so many features that seem so natural.

(despite my carryover reservations with MS products from the 1980s-90s, SQL Server is indisputably an innovative and solid piece of technology -- MS did something right with their database group). One can interact syntactically with the database via pure SQL, but SSMS lets you access the deep corners of the database quickly via a GUI (SQL is a great <i>query<\/i> language, but many admin&#x2F;ops tasks are much more easily done via a GUI -- writing SQL every time you want make a simple change is tedious plus nobody remembers the syntax for infrequently used features).

My mom observed this and asked the school things can be accelerated. I was placed in 10th grade and just got myself bullied.

Throughout my school life all I faced was bullying cos I don&#x27;t share the same interests as the others.<p>College wasn&#x27;t any different. I grew up watching OCW physics and thought college would be similar. Turned out wrong. I have ruffled feathers with every faculty there that I wanted more work, to be challenged more.

Notably, I have difficulty knowing what patterns are good or bad in SSB.<p>As far as I can tell SSB utilizes effectively a commit ledger for user data.

Yet my issue is that I&#x27;m unsure what is considered &quot;bad form&quot; for the SSB crowd. I don&#x27;t want to write an application for SSB but written in some form of SSB anti-pattern.<p>Combine this with SSB not having well established[1] implementations in my language of choice (Rust), and all around as much as I want to use SSB as the foundation for my app the protocol was just a bit of a heavy burden currently.
