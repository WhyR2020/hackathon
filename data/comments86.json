CT images were reviewed and the CT severity score was calculated for each lobes and the entire lung. CT findings were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases.\nResults<p>Of 104 cases, 76 (73%) were asymptomatic, 41 (54%) of which had lung opacities on CT. Other 28 (27%) cases were symptomatic, 22 (79%) of which had abnormal CT findings. Symptomatic cases showed lung opacities and airway abnormalities on CT more frequently than asymptomatic cases [lung opacity; 22 (79%) vs 41 (54%), airway abnormalities; 14 (50%) vs 15 (20%)]. Asymptomatic cases showed more GGO over consolidation (83%), while symptomatic cases more frequently showed consolidation over GGO (41%). The CT severity score was higher in symptomatic cases than asymptomatic cases, particularly in the lower lobes [symptomatic vs asymptomatic cases; right lower lobe: 2 ± 1 (0-4) vs 1 ± 1 (0-4); left lower lobe: 2 ± 1 (0-4) vs 1 ± 1 (0-3); total score: 7 ± 5 (1-17) vs 4 ± 2 (1-11)].<p>Conclusion<p>This study documented a high incidence of subclinical CT changes in cases with COVID-19.

My two biggest ones are for a work tracker and a support system. The support system one especially is considered indispensable by the support staff and almost everyone else that ever interacts with it. (Why not just change support system?—you may ask. There were certain features that provided the concrete reason for staying with that one. And in bigger businesses you often don’t have the flexibility to choose different things anyway.)<p>A fair fraction of the user scripting is actually just stylesheets, and indeed I started out with just user stylesheets. It’s amazing what you can do with such stylesheets. You can reduce borders, margin and spacing, reorder sections with flexbox and&#x2F;or grid layout, hide irrelevant functionality or data fields that you <i>never<\/i> use but the tool doesn’t let you hide, emphasise details that <i>are<\/i> important to you, reduce the need for scrolling (more efficient layout is routinely able to make things 30–50% shorter without feeling in any way cramped, because many layouts are simply unnecessarily wasteful of space), make sidebars sticky to save scrolling, increase the size of elements and popups that are inexplicably small with forced scrolling, and <i>loads<\/i> more.<p>And that’s just the styles part. Add scripting and you can do things like set the document title because the system just sets “AppName” or “Manage Request”; automatically click on “load more” links; restructure content for better consumption; in history streams collapse automated things with a single line summary, or bulky tables of the fields that changed with more compact representation; highlight things differently based on the result of some function on the element (e.g. who wrote it), change how times are presented (e.g. replace an absolute timestamp with absolute and relative, plus showing other timezones that could be relevant in a tooltip); add a button to copy the ID or link for an item; and much more that I haven’t even thought of yet.<p>My user scripts are readily configurable: each feature can be turned on or off independently, since a few of the features some people like and others don’t.<p>I’ve thought and said before that this should be a plausible business: forced to use a web app that’s slowing you down? Hire me and I’ll make it easier and faster for you to use.

The painter is asked about the nature of painting and he responds that when he sets out to work in his studio and his brush strokes a canvass, he is discovering the fundamental nature of reality. He doubles down and exclaims that, in fact, reality is actually JUST lines and curves and shades and colors, and his proof is, well, look at how accurate his paintings are! Let&#x27;s pretend that he actually is a very skilled painter, and many critics have marveled at the extent to which his paintings are indistinguishable from his subject matter. Still though, the interviewer clears his throat after an awkward pause and continues on to the next question.<p>To me, math is a medium of description much like painting or writing. It&#x27;s units are not colors or words but points. A point, or &quot;that which has no part&quot;, is much finer and carries with it far less baggage than something like a word. Points can be assigned numerical values and played with in clever ways. You can even sprinkle a fine dust of them over anything observable and create a copy of it to arbitrary degrees of precision.<p>I know math is far more than just the study of points, but I&#x27;m not convinced that math is anything more than our capacity to distinguish and describe extended to its limit. I also don&#x27;t mean to belittle the accomplishments of mathematicians and theoreticians, I just think it&#x27;s more reasonable to say that math is JUST the limit of description than it is to say that reality is JUST math.<p>After reading through some of the comments, I think many of us are on the same page."],"time":["2020-04-17 20:32:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DeathArrow"],"id":[22897229],"kids":[22897277,22897279,22899191,22897595,22897391,22897360,22907656,22897314],"parent":[22896671],"text":["I am not sure of the implications.

You can model anything in a computer and running on a computer using math. You can describe logic, natural language, technology, biology using math.<p>In that sense, being the building block of other sciences, math is more akin to a language. Two physicist use math in almost the same way two people use English to describe things and communicate ideas.<p>But math has building blocks, too. Set of axioms upon which any mathematical object and theory can be constructed. The most popular as of now is Zermelo set theory.

It could be argued at the time that these branches were simply invented mathematics because there was no practical application of it, but 30 years following his death came breakthroughs in cryptography.

Especially when it only sometimes gave me code completion and type checking (A lot of &quot;unknown&quot; would fill my code).<p>Then Steve pointed out Rust Analyzer in a previous thread and I was off to the races. Rust Analyzer has gotten _so good_. Having a VSCode setup that gives me immediate feedback for my mistakes and code discovery makes a huge difference (to me at least).

How many equally smart people got it wrong? Was there something in common among these particular people that led them to get it right, or did they hazard a guess on approximately the same information that everyone else had and then end up in the winning group?<p>There&#x27;s a fun article somewhere in my bookmarks that I can&#x27;t find right now, but it covers the phenomenon of some bettor -- at the race track, or the stock market, or something -- who has this crazy winning streak and nobody can figure out why. Maybe it&#x27;s this person&#x27;s lucky hat, or maybe it&#x27;s the notes they take, or maybe... who knows. But the most compelling reason is that they just happen to be the 1 member of a very large group who, through probability alone, keeps winning.<p>This other article sort of mentions it in passing:<p>&gt; <i>The prosecution also had an expert witness, an economist named David DeRosa. He didn’t share Heeb’s views about poker. DeRosa used a computer to simulate what might happen if 1,000 people each tossed a coin 10,000 times, assuming a certain outcome — such as tails — was equivalent to a win and the number of times a particular person won the toss was random. But the results were remarkably similar to those Heeb presented: A handful of people appeared to win consistently, and another group seemed to lose a large number of times. This wasn’t evidence that a coin toss involved skill, just that — much like the infinite number of monkeys typing — unlikely events can happen if we look at a large enough group.<\/i><p>(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;are-the-best-gamblers-skilled-or-just-lucky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;are-the-best-g...<\/a>)<p>Back to the posted article...<p>&gt; <i>parachutes, etc. etc.<\/i><p>I mean, all kidding aside, there are enough parachute failures at this point to have a pretty good idea of the grim odds of surviving a fall from an aircraft without one.<p>There are some really good reasons for conservativism in medicine.

Its cause and treatment has been discovered, lost, and rediscovered many times, and each time, there was some common-sense treatment for it that was wrong.<p>&gt; <i>Gallant wouldn’t have waited for proof. He would have checked prediction markets and asked top experts for probabilistic judgments.

Next thing comes along with a 10% or 20% chance, you prepare for it. You&#x27;re in California, so, earthquake: you fill up your garage with supplies. The earthquake never comes.

Except, this time the floods do come, and you&#x27;re screwed again, and now some guy is writing about how all those people who didn&#x27;t properly prepare for the flood had bad mental models for assessing risk.<p>&gt; <i>A few weeks ago, I wrote a blog post on face masks. It reviewed the evidence and found that they probably helped prevent the spread of disease.

It is shameful that our federal and state governments haven&#x27;t better organized and incentivized solutions to fix this. I understand that it&#x27;s hard. I understand that they&#x27;re working hard to address this problem. But it&#x27;s unacceptable that we haven&#x27;t just gotten this done -- that we&#x27;ve instead put the burden on our medical workers to solve this life-or-death problem. As if they didn&#x27;t already have enough to worry about.<p>I feel much closer to this issue than I expected to be. Because I worked for weeks with a volunteer group called helpfulengineering.org to help figure out how to make face shields through local partnerships. I was helping organize efforts for the city of Chicago. Our group made dozens of 3D printed face shields, then hundreds. Each face shield was given to a medical worker who sent back stories about how desperately important each one was to them.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;syllablehq&#x2F;status&#x2F;1247891099324051462\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;syllablehq&#x2F;status&#x2F;1247891099324051462<\/a><p>In an effort to scale up faster, we got price quotes from local manufacturers who could manufacture NIH vetted face shields in bulk using injection molding or die cutting. These local manufacturers were very eager to help and work with us. We were prepared to get our own investment to kick-start the manufacturing as long as we had some confidence that we could get the products to market and not lose tens of thousands of dollars. We were prepared to sell them AT COST - not even for a profit. Next step: we just needed help to connect these manufacturers with an organized supply chain.<p>We talked to government offices and offered to help them get this plan in motion. But no one could do anything except direct us to generic websites and phone numbers. We filled out forms and called numbers. Never heard back. One government office told us they were working as hard as they could, and there were numerous projects in the works... but they couldn&#x27;t give us any more information. No transparency.<p>Weeks later, the hospitals are still in desperate need. There is still no plan to solve this problem. Corporations have stepped up to donate a million here and a million there. This is great. But it&#x27;s not a replacement for the war-time effort we need to save thousands of lives.<p>Thank you to so many leaders who are working hard -- including those from Chicago.

I&#x27;m quite interested in hearing what others think:\n1. The majority of clinical ML applications are still focused on narrow (e.g. binary) image recognition tasks. This makes sense because it&#x27;s where CNN&#x27;s excel. Also, many of these tasks are well reimbursed. I expect the performance to continue improving as datasets and annotations improve.\n2. There is less activity on broad image recognition tasks, like reading a CT Abdomen and Pelvis. Here the domain of possible diagnoses is rather large. For example, patients sometimes have unusual anatomy from prior surgeries. Or, a cancer may obliterate common anatomical landmarks. An experienced radiologist or surgeon can figure out this anatomy in a few minutes, whereas ML may need new approaches to get to this level.\n3. The history and physical exam are clinician-generated, not just for dataset annotations but for every new patient. This is notable because the history and physical exam determine the majority of what a patient needs.

The EARN IT Act lays out best practices for companies to maintain immunity from child sexual abuse material statutes and bolsters enforcement if companies choose not to comply with the practices.  The companies would not lose Section 230 protections for other content like defamation and threats.<p>&gt; As someone concerned about internet freedom, you will be pleased to know that I am an original cosponsor of the Save the Internet Act.  This bill would remand the Commission back to its February 2015 ruling protecting and promoting an open internet and make the net neutrality permanent.  This bill would also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from reissuing any rulings or orders unless specifically authorized by law.<p>&gt; I also voted for S. J. Res. 52, a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution which would reverse the December 14, 2017 vote by the Federal Communications Commission to repeal the Open Internet Order of 2015.  The resolution, which I cosponsored, passed the Senate on May 16, 2018.  In addition to cosponsoring the CRA, I cosigned a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai opposing the FCC’s vote to eliminate net neutrality.

I noticed some similarities in her format. Here&#x27;s what she emailed back:<p>------<p>Dear Cale:<p>I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently.   I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond.<p>First, I understand your concerns and want to point out that by law, the government cannot listen to an American&#x27;s telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause.  The programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case.  Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary.<p>As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that I believe the oversight we have conducted is strong and effective and I am doing my level best to get more information declassified.  Please know that it is equally frustrating to me, as it is to you, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used.  I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans&#x27; privacy rights.<p>These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, their activities, and those associated with terrorist plots, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks.  More information on this should be forthcoming.<p>· On June 18, 2003, the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) testified to the House Intelligence Committee that there have been &quot;over 50 potential terrorist events&quot; that these programs helped prevent.<p>· While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified, I have reviewed the classified testimony and reports from the Executive Branch that describe in detail how this surveillance has stopped attacks.<p>· Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates.<p>· Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, the NSA has determined that in early September of 2009, while monitoring the activities of Al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based Najibullah Zazi.  The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links.  The FBI tracked Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks. Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested. Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system.<p>· Regarding terrorist David Headley, he was also involved in the planning and reconnaissance of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India that killed 166 people, including six Americans.  According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O&#x27;Hare airport on a trip to Europe.  Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008.  At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, at the behest of Al Qaeda.<p>Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but laws passed and enacted since 9&#x2F;11 specifically authorize them.  The surveillance programs are authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which itself was enacted by Congress in 1978 to establish the legal structure to carry out these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes.  It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans.<p>The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9&#x2F;11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins.  For example, the phone call business record program was reauthorized most recently on May 26, 2011 by a vote of 72-23 in the Senate and 250-153 in the House.  The internet communications program was reauthorized most recently on December 30, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House.<p>You may be interested to know that the Senate Intelligence Committee will be proposing changes to these programs to ensure transparency and to make public additional facts.  Attached to this letter is an opinion piece (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;NSA-OpEd\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;NSA-OpEd<\/a>) I authored in the Washington Post on July 30, 2013 that further highlights our proposed changes.  While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity, I believe it is important to ensure that the public record now available on these programs is accurate and provided with the proper context.<p>Again, thank you for contacting me with your concerns and comments.  I appreciate knowing your views and hope you continue to inform me of issues that matter to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 224-3841.<p>Sincerely yours,<p>Dianne Feinstein\nUnited States Senator"],"time":["2020-04-17 05:31:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22896417],"kids":{},"parent":[22895756],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-17 07:16:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["pmiller2"],"id":[22896163],"kids":[22897247,22896216,22897094],"parent":[22895756],"text":["Somebody needs to primary her."],"time":["2020-04-17 06:20:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fulafel"],"id":[22897362],"kids":{},"parent":[22895756],"text":["What would happen to non-US based platforms?

So what would you need if you hosted on-prem:<p>- a DB with a read replica in case your main DB died (RDS can actually build read replicas for you pretty easily so this part of the deployment would be much easier than doing the same MySQL replication config on-prem)<p>- Redis for caching (my experience with WP is a couple of years out of date now but when I last managed an highly popular WP install (several in fact) Redis or Memcached caching was a necessity to get the kind of page load times our visitors expected)<p>- Shared storage (bare in mind you&#x27;re running more than one WP web server - if this was on prem you&#x27;d be hosting those files off a SAN)<p>- A load balancer (I don&#x27;t think I need to explain a justification for that one)<p>- And probably a CDN too (reduce the stress on your web-servers and internet gateway)<p>That&#x27;s literally the bare minimum any large Wordpress application would need and that&#x27;s all that AWS architecture is outlying. Sure there&#x27;s a few more items on there like NAT gateways but those are just network stacks that are deployed as part of your VPC (or in on-prem terms, that&#x27;s just the VLAN and&#x2F;or subnet management that you&#x27;d assign to your load balancer).<p>If you don&#x27;t need multiple web-servers nor high availability then your architecture becomes drastically simpler (no load balancer, no shared storage, no replica DB, etc) but also you would run the risk of downtime and even data loss. Which might not be an issue for some people but it&#x27;s also not one of the selling points of AWS. So you&#x27;d be better off with shared hosting or a managed WP service -- or to put it another way, AWS was never going to be a good fit.<p>edit: Personally I think the issue here is more WP -- or rather the classical CMS design -- than it is AWS.

Edit3: This lead me to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vibrations_of_a_circular_membrane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vibrations_of_a_circular_membr...<\/a> with Bessel equations and all the good stuff. Solving it (numerically) would supposedly create the cool picture of the 432 Hz note. Edit4: And I&#x27;ve returned to where I began: cymatics, cymaglyphs and that cymascope. It gives an impression of a lazy pseudoscience at first, because of the somewhat sloppy language they use, but after watching a John Stuart Reid&#x27;s presentation (watch it, it&#x27;s only 40 mins), I had to change my opinion. The indeed capture the interference patterns created by sound in a bowl of water and a picture of that rapidly moving pattern is called a &quot;cymaglyphs&quot;. I&#x27;d say, visualizing sound and music is a solved problem and the solution is called cymaglyphs. Obviously, an app can&#x27;t use a bowl of water to solve the diff equations, but it can do that numerically with a decent precision, and apply some smoothing techniques to deal with the rapid evolution of these cymaglyphs."],"time":["2020-04-19 05:15:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["givinguflac"],"id":[22900065],"kids":[22900069],"parent":[22899416],"text":["This is really cool, I think the linear and circle visualizations are my favorite.
