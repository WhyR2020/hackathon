Gmirkin. It&#x27;a an academic thesis and not really written for readability by the general public, but the ideas it presents are mind blowing. The gist is a theory that the Hebrew Bible was written by pre-Jewish scholars and politicians who studied Plato&#x27;s works at the Library at Alexandria with the goal of uniting (12) disparate pre-Jewish tribes into one nation modeled after Plato&#x27;s Republic. It&#x27;s interesting both as a challenge to the mainstream theory that Plato&#x27;s works were inspired by the Hebrew Bible, and as a look at an ancient social engineering project that still has huge implications thousands of years later. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;32183185-plato-and-the-creation-of-the-hebrew-bible\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;32183185-plato-and-the-c...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-22 03:51:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tomek_zemla"],"id":[22099416],"kids":{},"parent":[22092108],"text":["<i>Unflattening<\/i> by Nick Sousanis.

With that said, these are the four that immediately spring to mind as being both worth reading and relatively obscure (judging by date of publication in conjunction with being either out of print or with very few star ratings on Amazon).<p>Did Monetary Forces Cause the Great Depression? - Peter Termin, 1975<p>Termin is still going strong at MIT. His 1975 book was foundational for challenging Friedman on the cause of the Great Depression. Given what was to come in the 1980s this book quickly became overshadowed and destined for obscurity. However, it still provides an appropriate, timely lens to analyze monetary theory without the abstraction that has engrossed economics as of late.<p>The Supreme Court in the American System of Government  - Robert Jackson, 1955<p>A series of lectures created for a Harvard lecture series in 1954-55 by Justice Jackson. He suddenly died before being able to deliver them, but they were compiled in a book now out of print. Justice Jackson is widely regarded - across the aisle - as one of the most brilliant legal writers of our time (or perhaps of any time). While this book doesn&#x27;t set out his entire judicial philosophy, or even do what the title says due to his untimely death, it does lay a valuable conception of the proper role of the SCOTUS within the Republic. Also recommended, to see both his pen and intellect in action, are his opinions in Korematsu v. United States and West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette.<p>The Opium of the Intellectuals - Aron, 1955<p>Amazon does a better job of summarizing than I could off the top of my head, so here you go: &quot;Raymond Aron&#x27;s 1955 masterpiece The Opium of the Intellectuals, is one of the great works of twentieth- century political reflection. Aron shows how noble ideas can slide into the tyranny of &quot;secular religion&quot; and emphasizes how political thought has the profound responsibility of telling the truth about social and political reality-in all its mundane imperfections and tragic complexities.&quot;<p>An incredibly difficult read that is worth trying to get through. Brimming with ideas and not without its own pitfalls. Tells the story of 20th Century intellectual history and thought as well as any could, although in a rather indirect way.<p>The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy and Caste in America (Aristocracy &amp; Caste in America) - Baltzell, 1987<p>I&#x27;ll let Amazon summarize again: &quot;This classic account of the traditional upper class in America traces its origins, lifestyles, and political and social attitudes from the time of Theodore Roosevelt to that of John F. Kennedy. Sociologist E. Digby Baltzell describes the problems of exclusion and prejudice within the community of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants (or WASPs, an acronym he coined) and predicts with amazing accuracy what will happen when this inbred group is forced to share privilege and power with talented members of minority groups.&quot;<p>My summary would be: what will happen (hypothetically, remember the date of publication) when an ephemeral class (WASPs) suddenly disappear from their previous pedestal of influence? Prescient, widely applicable to other countries with their own quasi-classes, and deeply interesting for those less familiar with the subject."],"time":["2020-01-19 19:53:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zeristor"],"id":[22093578],"kids":[22096235,22095990],"parent":[22092108],"text":["&#x27;The Extended Organism&#x27; by J Scott Turner<p>I&#x27;ve posted this repeatedly to these lists, but no one else is as enthused by it.<p>From the GoodReads page:<p>&quot;Can the structures that animals build--from the humble burrows of earthworms to towering termite mounds to the Great Barrier Reef--be said to live?

Stern&#x27;s research assistant at the time he was working on this topic went on to become known as a science fiction author, and based one of his first works on this notion:  Isaac Asimov.<p>On the question of compiling such lists:  I&#x27;ve recently started keeping a research journal in which I&#x27;m trying to capture works of significance that I&#x27;ve read, vaguely inspired by both index-card methods (such as Zettelkasten or POIC) and bullet journals.<p>The organisation is &quot;BOTI&quot; -- best of the interval.<p>I will start a two-page spread, dated, of a specific class of entries -- works, videos, authors, ideas, etc. -- and when that closes, start another.  Periodically (about every month, for now) I&#x27;ll select the best of those works for a BOTM list, and at the end of a year, a BOTY list.<p>Or at least that&#x27;s the idea.<p>This may address the question of keeping track of the most significant works (or authors, concepts, ideas, etc.) over time, which otherwise tend to become a bit of a jumble.<p>The BOTI list and periodic aggregations themselves resemble round-robin databases, or ring or circular buffers or files, though without actually rewriting each specific list.  The initial capture levels remain accessible (in the journal) for revisiting, should something prove to have been more significant on subsequent reflection than initially appeared."],"time":["2020-01-19 22:27:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["intrepidhero"],"id":[22095961],"kids":{},"parent":[22092108],"text":["Goat Walking by Jim Corbett.

There was a narrow focus which meant seeing life as if from blinkers and with the centre of awareness in my head; and there was a wide focus which meant knowing with the whole of my body, a way of looking which quite altered my perception of whatever I saw. And I found that the narrow focus way was the way of reason. If one was in the habit of arguing about life it was very difficult not to approach sensation with the same concentrated attention and so shut out its width and depth and height. But it was the wide focus way that made me happy.<p>The book is full of arresting and innovative insights on awareness and perception. For example, the spotlight analogy for &quot;covert attention&quot; is often attributed to Francis Crick writing in 1984[2], but fifty years earlier Milner writes:<p>&gt; At any moment there exist in the fringes of my thought faint patternings which can be brought to distinction when I look at them. Like a policeman with a flash-light I can throw the bright circle of my awareness where I choose; if any shadow or movement in the dim outer circle of its rays arouses my suspicion, I can make it come into the circle of brightness and show itself for what it is.

Ownership is fair, in the sense that you can run your node and self-host. However this is true of any self-hosting solution. You could run a Docker instance of a Wordpress or Ghost site and get ownership &#x2F; control.<p>2) The point about censorship is muddied, however. I&#x27;ll combine that point with the second upside: Resilience.\nEvery day for the past two years, I&#x27;ve seen people wonder if IPFS is a magical cloud with infinite storage. People seem to think you put a file on IPFS, and it just gets replicated, censorship resistant hosting. That&#x27;s not how it works. People need to pin your hash. You need to tell the world about your hash somehow. All this is done via a public list of IPs that is being broadcasted. Think of IPFS this way: you&#x27;re letting people with the hash become CDNs of your content. That&#x27;s cool, but that doesn&#x27;t solve discovery, keeping things up, etc. IPFS doesn&#x27;t encrypt the content, or the connectivity, or hide the hosts. Solutions exist around that, but they&#x27;re niche, and honestly I question the motives besides just ideology.<p>3) Elegance. Yeah it&#x27;s a really, really cool way to solve linking. As some others pointed out, it&#x27;s not as fast as classic centralized links, so it&#x27;s better suited currently for solutions that don&#x27;t require speed."],"time":["2020-01-19 23:33:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kalmi10"],"id":[22094311],"kids":[22095489,22094431,22094432,22095443,22094359],"parent":[22093157],"text":["The thing I worry about with IPFS is privacy.

There are still a few problems related to incentivizing people to pin files for you. Filecoin, the ICO coin associated with IPFS has been inching closer to a testnet launch for quite long now. That was supposed to happen end of last year and it didn&#x27;t as far as I know. So, they are obviously a bit behind schedule on that. Without that, content on IPFS is only as durable as the node that uploaded the content. There are no guarantees long term availability of content.<p>So, IPFS is more of a CDN than a file system currently. It&#x27;s a distributed content cache. There&#x27;s an enormous long tail of files that are only available on 1 node, which is typically somebody&#x27;s laptop.<p>Another problem is that the block system does not combine well with e.g. s3 or similar file buckets on popular cloud providers. If you think of IPFS as a CDN then you basically have to worry about hosting files somewhere that is reliable and durable. IPFS does not solve that problem currently. So, you basically will either be self hosting some file servers or use something off the shelf, like S3. There&#x27;s an S3 backend for IPFS but it&#x27;s a bit unclear how well that performs. We&#x27;ve done some tests with it and the small blocksize is creating quite a bit of overhead for read and write HTTP requests.<p>Access control or privacy protection are currently not really in scope of IPFS. I doubt this is a good tool for bypassing e.g. censor ship unless you are willing to expose yourself to explaining why your node is hosting certain content hashes. TOR and I2P probably provide better protection here. I2P actually runs a variant of bittorrent for file sharing.

I think it is safe to say that most HN users skew toward searching for more technical, intellectual or scientific topics and get frustrated by their searches getting swamped by popular topics.  What I&#x27;d like to see is a check box or slider bar to exclude or adjust the weighting for popularity in a search.  I don&#x27;t need to see links for the latest Taylor Swift breakup or what the Kardashians are up to that appear in a technical search due to a randomly shared keyword. Often, the topics I am searching for will never be popular and current search operates on the assumption that it will.<p>A second problem is that now that Google likes to rudely assume to know what you want, i.e. ignoring quotes and negation in search or even modifying keywords, its even harder to find what you want especially if its not on the first page or two of results. Because of this interference even changing your search parameters doesn&#x27;t change the results much and you see the essentially the same links. What I&#x27;d like to see is a search engine that will do a delta between say Google and Bing and drop the links common to the two services.

Gone are the days where you could search for technical terms and not be bombarded by marketing websites.<p>2. Google&#x27;s AI is far too aggressive for technical searching. It is clear that Google is using NLP to parse queries and substitute synonyms based on some sort of BERT-like encoding. The problem is that a given word may have synonyms that are actually orthogonal in meaning space. For example, if I search for trunk, Google may return results for &quot;boot&quot; as in car trunk, instead of anything related to SVN. Contrived example, sure - but here&#x27;s where the real problem is: Google&#x27;s AI is regressing to the layman&#x27;s mean. It is effectively overfitting to Grandma&#x27;s average search query. Think of it as the endless summer of search...and since there&#x27;s no way to usefully customize your search now (can&#x27;t give people too many options or they might get confused!), you&#x27;re stuck combing through unrelated results and it is increasingly difficult to disambiguate your search query. Remember when advanced search existed and typing in a question to search was terrible practice?

I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I&#x27;d assume with confidence that the majority of result inclusion decisions made by Google are now based on rejection blacklists, &#x27;known good&#x27; safe hits and effectively minimizing anomalous results above the fold. Simultaneously, the internet has become an international place and the bar has been raised for new entrants such that an incapacity to return meaningful results in multiple languages bars a search engine from any significant market position. A huge percentage of results are either Wikipedia&#x2F;reference pages, local news or Q&amp;A sites. Further, huge amounts of what is out there is behind Cloudflare or similar firewalls which will probably frustrate new and emerging spiders.<p>The existing monopolies, having some established capacity and reputation in this regard, may have become somewhat entrenched and lazy, and do not care enough about improvement. They are literally able to sail happily on market inertia, while generating ridiculous advertising revenues.

Surely they vary, depending on everything from the application (Is it &quot;code once and throw it away&quot;, or does it need to be maintained when the original programmers have left?) and down to the individual programmer&#x27;s approach to life (What is the cost of an error: how bad would it be to have a bug? Etc).<p>- <i>&quot;This is a case of improper data modeling, but the static type system is not at fault—it has simply been misused.&quot;<\/i> — To me this shows that bugs can exist in either the data modeling or the code: in a dynamically-typed language the two tend to coincide (with much less of the former) and in a statically-typed language they tend to be separate.

On the one hand you can think about them separately, on the other hand you have to look for bugs in two places &#x2F; switch between two modes of thought, but then again maybe you need to do that anyway?)<p>- Structural versus nominal typing, where the latter involves giving a name to each new type (<i>&quot;If you wish to take a subselection of a struct’s fields, you must define an entirely new struct; doing this often creates an explosion of awkward boilerplate&quot;<\/i>).<p>- <i>&quot;consider Python classes, which are quite nominal despite being dynamic, and TypeScript interfaces, which are structural despite being static.&quot;<\/i> — This is highly illuminating, and just this bit (and the next) elaborated with some examples would make for a useful blog post on its own.<p>- <i>&quot;If you are interested in exploring static type systems with strong support for structural typing, I would recommend taking a look at any of TypeScript, Flow, PureScript, Elm, OCaml, or Reason [...] What I would<\/i> not <i>recommend for this purpose is Haskell, which [is] aggressively nominal&quot;<\/i><p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my opinion is that posts like this, on hotly debated topics, would do well to start with concrete examples and be written in the mode of conveying interesting information&#x2F;ideas (of which there are a lot here) rather than being phrased as an argument for some position, which seems to elicit different sorts of responses — already most of the HN comments here are about static versus dynamic type systems in general, rather than about any specific ideas advanced by this post."],"time":["2020-01-19 16:04:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["UglyToad"],"id":[22091277],"kids":[22091804,22091929,22091425,22094265,22092205],"parent":[22090700],"text":["I think there&#x27;s a perhaps irreconcilable disconnect between 2 camps here, but I also think that&#x27;s ok and different people are allowed to like different things.<p>My experience, having gone from dynamic typing to static typing and now pining for more expressive type features in my chosen language is that static typing changes where you have to spend the cognitive complexity budget.<p>To my mind if I return to a piece of dynamically typed code written any time other than in the same session I have to load a whole mental model of the entire code, what types all the variables are, what expectations are attached to them, what mutation, if any, each method call performs.

With dynamic languages you can even have hot reloading of your code.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that statically typed languages are stupid, there are situation where they make a lot of sense, for embedded or system programming for example I would never use node, and surely Rust will have a future in these contexts.<p>But the point is that you should use the most appropriate tool for the job, and a dynamic language is in a lot of contexts the appropriate tool."],"time":["2020-01-19 14:20:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mirekrusin"],"id":[22091904],"kids":{},"parent":[22090700],"text":["Structural typing is extremly helpful&#x2F;practical, it lowers &quot;type-friction&quot; a lot.

It seems we are in violent agreement on this point.<p>King then goes on to make a different claim: that it is possible to implement `pickle.load` in Java and also in Haskell. It is possible in Java but not in Haskell.<p>Here&#x27;s the key line for Java:<p><i>However, nothing is stopping you from passing Serializable.class and branching on the type later<\/i><p>Notice the subtle shift in meaning for &quot;type&quot;: from static type to runtime tag.

Absolutely—we can use the serialise library, which has a similar API to the Java one mentioned above.<\/i><p>Absolutely you cannot! The Serialise libary requires you to list all of the possible result types up-front, &quot;by providing a set of type class instances.&quot; There is no way for a Haskell program to deserialise a value whose static type was not visible when the program was compiled. There is no way in Haskell to &quot;get a list of all types&quot; (it&#x27;s hard to even formulate this).<p>Implementing Python-style pickle isn&#x27;t really about types, it&#x27;s about the language&#x27;s dynamic features.

I would note that it seems to be the same, but reversed, for proponents of dynamic languages. Other than two or three mentions of Rust, all the examples and discussions have been about primarily interpreted or JIT languages with extensive runtimes. So there is little argument that these type systems are saving users (and I mean developers) from “memory safety” bugs or potential vulnerability exposing errors (those would tend to be problems with the interpreter&#x2F;runtime implementation).<p>Maybe I’m missing something, but if we are talking about managed language runtimes and, again based on the languages dominating the discussion, are nearly universally garbage collected, who cares what, if any, type system is in use for a given program?<p>I don’t know for certain (I don’t do any web based work) but I can’t recall ever reading about using typescript to boost speed or memory efficiency over vanilla JS.

Static type systems have a way of putting developers at ease on auto-pilot. Arguments which compare dynamic type systems with static type systems should be more focused on reality rather than hypothetical, idealized use cases where the developer is a completely rational agent who understands everything about the project&#x27;s direction and strategy. The reality is that the vast majority of developers can&#x27;t design software properly; they can&#x27;t even select the best data structure to solve the simplest problems and they over-engineer and can&#x27;t create good abstractions that make sense and aid the project&#x27;s evolution. Most developers don&#x27;t know what a good abstraction looks like because they don&#x27;t have a long term vision for the product that they&#x27;re working on.<p>All these safety features which static typing supposedly introduces don&#x27;t actually protect the project&#x27;s code from the real threat which is poor design at an architectural level. I would even argue that dynamic typing can encourage worse design because it gives developers an incentive to keep inventing strange abstractions&#x2F;types that don&#x27;t correspond to the high level picture of what the software actually does... Most statically typed projects I&#x27;ve seen tend to be full of weird and unnecessary abstractions like: &#x27;Interactor&#x27;, &#x27;Builder&#x27;, &#x27;PrimaryAdapter&#x27;... these kinds of abstractions do not bring the code any closer to alignment with the end user&#x27;s perspective of the software (which should be the primary goal of any abstraction), instead, they impose constraints on developers working on the project... but as requirements change, these constraints have a way of becoming redundant which is why sometimes large amount of logic needs to be re-written.<p>Static typing encourages short term development strategies centered around constraining developers from doing certain things based on speculative and often completely arbitrary concepts that the lead developer felt in their gut was important. Maybe if the abstractions were designed around some long-term vision of the evolution of the project, but this is almost never the case (and I&#x27;ve worked on many different projects, for many different companies for over a decade), most of the time, abstractions and the constraints that they impose are in fact based on nothing but arbitrary technical decisions that may as well have been the result of a coin toss.<p>Developers should have an incentive to create fewer (and only necessary) abstractions, not more. By forcing developers to rely on their memory instead of their IDE to figure out which variables hold what kinds of objects, there is a strong incentive for them to keep abstractions as simple an non-confusing as possible.<p>Any tool which makes some aspect of life easier for the user will invariably make the user lazier and complacent in that domain.

Yes, it makes tremendous economic sense for people and companies to co-locate in cities. In a country where individuals have a choice to live in an urban or a rural environment, and their demonstrated preference is to live in an urban environment, then urbanization becomes a self-reinforcing positive economic spiral.<p>However, this spiral is offset by a negative economic spiral in rural areas. As the national currency appreciates due to the increasing competitiveness of urban centers, rural industry becomes less and less competitive. When a national economy is in a downturn, the central bank can devalue the national currency to improve the price-competitiveness of national products for export; however, rural economies don&#x27;t have this option as they share a currency with urban centers. So rural communities continue their downward economic spiral.<p>Why is this a problem? If we could force the rural laggards to move to urban centers, or if rural populations didn&#x27;t hold outsize influence over the political process, it wouldn&#x27;t be. But we can neither coerce rural depopulation nor can we make that kind of political change. So the situation continues.<p>Unfortunately, there will be a price to pay.

This thesis also establishes a correspondence between two-level programs and one-level programs which take a generalized arrow instance as a distinguished parameter. A translation across this correspondence is possible, and is called a <i>flattening transformation<\/i>.<p>&gt; The flattening translation is not specific to any particular object language; this means that it needs to be implemented only once for a given metalanguage compiler. Support for various object languages can then be added by implementing instances of the generalized arrow type class; this does not require knowledge of compiler internals. Because of the flattening transformation the users of these object languages are able to program using convenient multi-level types and syntax; the conversion to one-level terms manipulating generalized arrow instances is handled by the flattening transformation.<p>&gt; A modified version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) with multi-level types and expressions has been produced as a proof of concept.

My suggestion for doing this with as little friction as possible is, instead of messing with limited accounts or trials, just provide a link to a live demo that is scanning a few interesting keywords. I recommend showing a household name like Apple alongside a much smaller company alongside the EFF, for example.<p>Second, I really respect that you&#x27;re trying to keep the price low, but I have grave concerns that you are making the wrong assumption about where your paying clients&#x27; pain points are. Specifically, the issue that would make people use this service is that it works amazingly well, is reliable and user friendly. If you achieve these baselines, the typical customer is going to be willing to pay <i>more<\/i> for this service than the competitors, not less. To be clear, a huge number of people could end up using this tool everyday as the main part of their job. Do you really think that their employers are going to care that your per-seat cost is $7 instead of $300? If anything, your service is so cheap that you might lose enterprise customers because it appears to be too cheap and there can be very legit longevity concerns. The API is great news until you consider that the CTO&#x27;s job is to consider a) is this the best product and b) how likely is it to disappear or otherwise fail? Jobs get lost over integrations with services that go bankrupt.<p>Long story short: I think that idea has amazing potential but you need to seriously reconsider your pricing because at best you&#x27;re burning potential revenue and at worst you aren&#x27;t charging enough to scale to be the company you could be."],"time":["2020-01-19 10:03:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gingerlime"],"id":[22090175],"kids":{},"parent":[22089160],"text":["Interesting.

It&#x27;s a lot less about looking perfect or weighing some ideal amount and more about caring for myself, and celebrating those small victories in the gym as evidence of personal resilience and  growth.<p>Excersize may not be the magic bullet for your situation, but the same experience of caring for yourself might come from other experiences, like volunteer work, studying a new skill or hobby, etc.<p>By the way, I&#x27;ve certainly let mediocre therapy go too long. Nothing wrong with exploring other therapists, it&#x27;s a deeply personal search, and needs also change over time. Trust your instincts on whether you are receiving the right care for you. The worst that can happen is that you try someone else and realize you prefer your former therapist.<p>You are worth it!

I&#x27;ve had a problem with always looking at &quot;the big picture,&quot; and consequently, seeing how little of a difference I ultimately make.<p>I&#x27;d recommend reading <i>The Conquest of Happiness<\/i> by Bertrand Russel [1]. Some great excerpts:<p>&gt; When I was a boy I knew a man bursting with happiness whose business was digging wells. He was of enormous height and of incredible muscles; he could neither read nor write, and when in the year 1885 he got a vote for Parliament, he learnt for the first time that such an institution existed. His happiness did not depend upon intellectual sources; it was not based upon belief in natural law, or the perfectibility of the species, or the public ownership of public utilities, or the ultimate triumph of the Seventh Day Adventists, or any of the other creeds which intellectuals consider necessary to their enjoyment of life. It was based upon physical vigor, a sufficiency of work, and the overcoming of not insuperable obstacles in the shape of rock. The happiness of my gardener is of the same species; he wages a perennial war against rabbits, of which he speaks exactly as Scotland Yard speaks of Bolsheviks. […]<p>&gt; But, you will say, these simple delights are not open to superior people like ourselves. What joy can we experience in waging war on such puny creatures as rabbits? The argument, to my mind, is a poor one. A rabbit is very much larger than a yellow fever bacillus, and yet a superior person can find happiness in making war upon the latter. Pleasures exactly similar to those of my gardener so far as their emotional content is concerned are open to the most highly educated people. […]<p>&gt; To all the talented young men who wander about feeling that there is nothing in the world for them to do, I should say: “Give up trying to write, and, instead, try not to write. Go out into the world; become a pirate, a king in Borneo, a laborer in Soviet Russia; give yourself an existence in which the satisfaction of elementary physical needs will occupy almost all your energies.”<p>Now, you probably don&#x27;t want to go <i>that<\/i> far. But the point is: your life doesn&#x27;t have to be grand or world-changing in order for you to be happy. You probably won&#x27;t end up in the history books, but there&#x27;s still a lot of cool things you can do before you die. You probably won&#x27;t be the next Charlotte Brontë, but maybe you can write one book. You probably won&#x27;t be the next Florence Nightingale, but maybe you can donate to the Against Malaria Foundation and save a dozen lives.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;in.ernet.dli.2015.222834\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;in.ernet.dli.2015.222834<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-19 21:09:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["spikepuppet"],"id":[22096051],"kids":{},"parent":[22092303],"text":["This is something i can relate to in a big way.

It&#x27;s old, but the big ideas that changed my life are there.<p>So based on that course you&#x27;ll want to learn about meditation. I&#x27;ve got the right book for you from a Google engineer who made sure most of it was evidence-based [2].<p>Obviously you&#x27;ll also realize because of the course you want to pickup aerobic exercise.<p>David Burns is my favorite psychologist (I read Intimate Connections from him, his claim to fame is Feeling Good). He has an answer to your question, which is Ten Days to Self Esteem [3]. Though, when I read the reviews you might just want to get one of his other books. I&#x27;m a fan of Intimate Connections, other people are fan of Feeling Good. You&#x27;ll definitely learn a lot about cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT changed my life.<p>And what the heck, not sure if this counts towards your question, but it&#x27;s at least related to it and good for the soul. Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl [4]. What&#x27;s interesting about his book regarding self-esteem is that he basically invents half the field of positive psychology 50 to 60 years before it even exists. Also, it&#x27;s just mandatory reading for any human being IMO, but that&#x27;s again IMO.<p>Then, some personal advice that I&#x27;ve seen to work.<p>You need to be brutally rational and empirical about self-esteem. I know one programmer friend and I noticed that he wasn&#x27;t able to do that. What I noticed was the following: HE DIDN&#x27;T TEST HIS ASSUMPTIONS! Yes, that warrants a caps because I told this to him every single time and it didn&#x27;t get through to him. So, do find your assumptions and do some experiments.<p>Some experiments I have done in the past:<p>1. People are mean. Experiment: walk up to 10 people and say hi and see what happens. Result: people say hi back, and the pressure of not saying anything sometimes caused a conversation to happen which was fairly pleasant. In other cases it was awkward. In conclusion: people were never mean.<p>2. Stating to a woman that you want to kiss her doesn&#x27;t work. Instead you have to make the move. Experiment: when I feel I have a bond with a woman [a] and I want to kiss her, then state it <i>politely<\/i> and leave it at that, repeat every 2 hours (if you still feel that way and have been fully platonic otherwise). Results: to my surprise, <i>every<\/i> woman kissed me. Heck, some just kissed me out of curiosity despite feeling no attraction to me. Weirder still, one of those curious kisses was one of the best kisses we both had in our lives. Note: I didn&#x27;t ask any random woman on the street to kiss me. If the constraints of [a] weren&#x27;t satisfied, I&#x27;d feel too unsafe to kiss her, and in almost all cases wouldn&#x27;t even want to kiss her.<p>[a] Minimally 3 hours of <i>intense<\/i> talking about life, ourselves, our families, hopes, ambitions, the works, preferably 6 hours. This excludes having fun. Without getting a feel about someone and without feeling a strong connection, kissing feels a bit too dangerous for me to do. Since I had low self-esteem I wanted to feel safe.<p>3. I am not attractive. Experiment: go up to 30 people for which you want to be attractive to and give them a survey. Ask them at least: from a scale of 1 to 10 how attractive you are, and from a scale of 1 to 10 how attractive you could potentially be and what you&#x27;d need to change and why it would make you more attractive. While I didn&#x27;t do this experiment, I have had enough feedback about my attractiveness. Long story short: I think I&#x27;m not that good looking (I have a scar on my face since birth). But most people that I want to be attractive to find me actually quite attractive. I&#x27;ve also been called ugly enough times, so ¯\\_(<U+30C4>)_&#x2F;¯. I think a strong moderating variable is whether you simply click with the other person in that moment.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned by experimenting: my assumptions and ideas about social interactions and dynamics are terrible. Sometimes I was right, most of the time I was quite to horribly wrong.<p>Other advice I want to give:<p>(1)<p>Self-esteem &#x2F; confidence is knowing about understanding what you are afraid of and then understanding what success looks like, a successful failure case looks like and a horrifying failure case looks like. When I learned to ski this was crystal clear.<p>Successful case: I am able to turn, break and go straight.<p>Successful failure case: I am about to ski of a cliff, but I am capable of falling right now to break. I know that by falling it won&#x27;t really hurt that much and I won&#x27;t injure myself.<p>Horrifying failure case: (I had this one as a kid) you ski towards the ski lift and while at full speed you realize that you&#x27;re going to slam into the ski lift row and you can&#x27;t break (and can&#x27;t realize that falling was a good option). Helloooo hospital, how are you? :D<p>Pick the topic and map out these 3 cases and try to find ways to make horrifying failure cases into successful failure cases. In the skiing example: if I just fell down before slamming into the ski lift row, I would not have gone to the hospital. Back then I didn&#x27;t know that falling was relatively painless.<p>(2)<p>My self-esteem issue had to do with romantic relationships. What I learned was that if I was capable of giving me self love and didn&#x27;t need a relationship, but see a relationship as the cherry on top, then life is awesome! And it was. One attitude that really helped with that was: treating life as playful and as positively as possible. I got all my relationships where I realized that I&#x27;d like one, but I didn&#x27;t need one and I didn&#x27;t crave for it. I learned how to kill the craving (thanks meditation).<p>So yea, hope this helps.<p>[1] I found a link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K8qpn6kNfPc&amp;list=PLF6A3AC0B711AEF28\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K8qpn6kNfPc&amp;list=PLF6A3AC0B7...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;12921211-search-inside-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;12921211-search-inside-y...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;19295.Ten_Days_to_Self_Esteem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;19295.Ten_Days_to_Self_E...<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning?from_search=true&amp;qid=G2do38dJfg&amp;rank=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;4069.Man_s_Search_for_Me...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-19 20:09:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fffff1"],"id":[22095460],"kids":{},"parent":[22092303],"text":["Hi,<p>I think we are wired to create social stories about things that happen. \nFind new ways of being social, feeling connection, getting praise.

Even for one-to-many or many-to-one associations, it creates look up lists and master-detail user interfaces. It also creates interface for searching, for printing reports, for custom queries, for group-by and similar aggregate queries and much more. All automatically.<p>How? It uses information that you provide which Java class corresponds to which table, Hibernate style JPA ORM annotated classes, either in XML or as plain java classes with annotations (one class per table).<p>If you have a large database, with multitude of tables, you can use the Hibernate &#x2F; JBoss reverse engineering tool to generate the mapping classes directly from the database structure. See this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eugencovaciq.wordpress.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;hibernate-tools-reverse-engineering-using-maven&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eugencovaciq.wordpress.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;hibernate-tool...<\/a><p>There are other tools that could help. Why OpenXava? Because it is very easy to customize the generated user interface and it is very flexible. You just add @view annotations to the classes that modify how the interface is generated. For example, when you need to drop out some attributes, or not show a link to another table, or when the table is used as a lookup for the foreign key in another table, you can configure how the lookup will look like in one situation, and how in another. You can reconfigure the layout of complicated forms for tables with many attributes, also using view annotations.<p>I am not involved with OpenXava, but have used it to make an administration interface for several apps. I have a maven script that can be run from the command line, that uses hibernate reverse engineering library to generate the mapping classes and i have the initial app in minutes."],"time":["2020-01-19 20:04:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["erikcw"],"id":[22092802],"kids":{},"parent":[22091012],"text":["We’ve been using Anvil for internal employee tools for the last year or so with much success.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-19 19:02:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rumanator"],"id":[22091409],"kids":{},"parent":[22091012],"text":["For those like me who never heard the term &quot;CRUD screen&quot;:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?CrudScreen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?CrudScreen<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-19 14:50:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aosaigh"],"id":[22091133],"kids":{},"parent":[22091012],"text":["Are you looking for a framework or a more complete tool?

The latter representation is &quot;better&quot; than the doughnut in the sense that it&#x27;s symmetric: the horizontal and vertical directions are treated the same.

You can visualize how this asymmetry happens by turning the square into a doughnut: start with the square above; make it into a roll so that the left and right sides are identified, and then now bend the roll to identify the top and bottom edges: if you bent towards you, then the backside gets stretched a lot more than the front side on the way to forming the full doughnut.<p>Clifford torus is a way to satisfy both properties (symmetry and uniqueness) at the same time and it&#x27;s a theorem that one needs to be in 4 dimensions for this to happen."],"time":["2020-01-19 17:05:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["carapace"],"id":[22092340],"kids":{},"parent":[22073781],"text":["Ooo, that footnote: &quot;Flat tori in three-dimensional space and convex integration&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;109&#x2F;19&#x2F;7218\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;109&#x2F;19&#x2F;7218<\/a><p>Borrelli, V.; Jabrane, S.; Lazarus, F.; Thibert, B.

We then provide an implementation leading to images of an embedded square flat torus in three-dimensional space. This visualization has led us in turn to discover a unique geometric structure.

Project “leadership” is the abdication of that responsibility to individual contributors.<p>This antipattern typically begins with the engineer being &quot;volun-told&quot;. The manager will frame leading a project as a growth opportunity, a chance to learn about people, the power to push the envelope in their org. Once the engineer submits, the manager will take a back-seat. They adopt the mindset of a passive referee: sitting on the sidelines as the engineer wrestles with the complexities of aligning people with technology. They&#x27;re here to &quot;guarantee the success of the project&quot;, they can&#x27;t get caught up in the little details!<p>Sure, the engineer will question why she or he is responsible for reading, writing, communicating, coding, and basically doing the manager&#x27;s job. But the manager will link to a litany of excuses, they&#x27;ll offer vague assurances, they&#x27;ll encourage the engineer to exercise more leadership!<p>Eventually, the engineer encounters an insurmountable obstacle: the structure of the organization. No amount of &quot;influence&quot; on behalf of the engineer will make this project succeed: the engineer needs authority to make substantive changes.

The project achieves its objectives, the engineer (may) rise, and the org takes one step away from its goals. After a few hundred cycles across a few years, these unmanaged projects have created a product disassociated from reality, and therefore unusable.<p>The cycle ends with the engineer exiting: hopefully with a firmer understanding of power, and some useful technical skills for his or her next job.

Not until a few years ago, it was still common that the head signs in trains, buses or subways where mechanical. It was often just a paper roll [0] that was adjusted to display the correct destination, or even just a plate that was changed by the conductor [1]. Things like car numbers or seat reservations were displayed by simple paper signs. Fast-forward to the 90ies, where at least in Europe, they began to replace these things by LCDs. After a few years, it was normal to see trains with broken head signs, broken car numbers, and broken reservation systems [2]. Fast-forward to today, where it is now en vogue to use full-fledged displays everywhere. The result (at least in the towns I use public transportation) are regularly broken displays [3] [4] [5] that even when they work, often offer no advantage over LCD or LED or even mechanical display from a passenger perspective. They just look more modern. Add to this that the display software is mostly some variant of Windows with a poorly built and designed web application running on it.<p>Think of all the people, all the knowledge, all the hours, all the resources and all the energy required to build and run a full-fledged high-resolution display, an operating system, the web application and a central server in the vehicle running those displays - all to replace a simple roll of paper <i>with a less reliable solution<\/i>!

The code changes might not be high stakes, but having a good relationship with your peer is very high stakes.<p>I recommend a book called &quot;Crucial Conversations&quot;. You can find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s a fantastic book about how to recognize that you&#x27;re making &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Choice&quot; (their words)... and how to get out of it.<p>To apply the book to your case, you&#x27;ve boxed yourself into two options (I.e., The Fool&#x27;s Choice):  1) I can argue with this person and could have an unfavorable outcome, or 2) give in and just do what they want. This is actually a false dichotomy -- there are other options! One of the possible options is to turn that choice into a question by turning them into an AND option instead of OR options.

If you can later prove your vote was cast correctly, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the system that correctly recorded your vote has some theoretical flaw.<p>Verifiability could also prevent or reveal traditional attacks or miscounting, like lost ballot boxes, hanging chads, misdelivered absentee ballots, or simple hand counting errors. It could have a separate benefit of drastically increasing trust in the system, preventing allegations of fraud by those who simply want to undermine faith in Democratic institutions (be they foreign governments or sore losers).<p>The author quickly dismisses verifiability as a practical goal though, despite its potential benefits, citing an old objection: verifiability enables vote selling.<p>Since verifiability could lead to significant benefits, it&#x27;s worth asking two questions at this point:  (1) might there be other ways to mitigate the risk of vote selling under verifiability, and (2) does verifiability really increase the risks of the status quo?<p>(1) Other Mitigations<p>Two possible mitigations immediately spring to mind, there are probably others.<p>First, we could just make vote buying or vote extortion a serious federal crime, where any whistleblower voter gets some portion of the fine, enough to outweigh whatever they were offered. The new incentive would make these attacks highly risky, as they&#x27;d have to involve an improbable number of close confederates you can rely on, but who won&#x27;t vote the way you recommend without a bribe. This becomes basically impossible to scale.<p>As a second option, we could instead give voters a true receipt and a false receipt. Voters could privately confirm their vote was cast correctly, but the system would have deniability, the voter would be unable to prove it. Maybe the true receipt holds a secret shared with the election commission that can only be unsealed under credible allegations of outcome-altering irregularities.<p>(2) Unclear New Risks<p>The argument against verifiability is that it would suddenly allow proof of vote, and that creates the risks of extortion and selling.<p>Proof of vote is already trivial in the status quo though. Sure, there are prohibitions on voting booth selfies, but if you had entered into a vote buying cartel, you would easily be able to defeat these with a discreet photo behind the curtain.<p>Mail-in absentee ballots allow one to fill in a ballot while being directly observed by an attacker.<p>Despite these possibilities in the current system, there isn&#x27;t significant evidence that vote buying is a widespread problem, so the risk may be wildly overstated anyway.<p>If it is not clear we&#x27;re avoiding a new risk, and if verifiability could dramatically increase the trust in the system, I think it&#x27;s worth a harder look than most voting security analysis gives it.<p>That said, this amount to a quibble about one page in a significant piece of research, which is still an admirable summary of the issues in secure voting theory and design."],"time":["2020-01-19 08:53:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gravypod"],"id":[22095746],"kids":[22150093,22096398],"parent":[22090828],"text":["It would be really cool if this included some wheels of misfortune down the line.
