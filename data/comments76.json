There&#x27;s no adjustment for this confounder at all that I can see. Quick example:<p>Suppose there&#x27;s a 10% chance of getting infected every time someone goes outside. Suppose there&#x27;s a million people of which half are type-A people who go outside once this month, and half are type-B people who go outside 10 times a month.<p>The type-A person will have a 10% infection rate. The type-B person will have a 65% chance to be infected after a month. The average infection rate is around 42%. Yet if you randomly select someone outside, odds are 10 to 1 that it&#x27;ll be a type-B person, and you&#x27;ll get a far higher average of 60%, which isn&#x27;t indicative of the average person, only of the average person who goes outside.<p>Second, the article then compares the infection rate to the mortality rate. But the mortality rate does not include excess deaths. These are quite a bit higher for NYC, about 30% or so it seems than the official figures. But even this may be undercounting (or potentially, overcounting) the impact of the corona disease itself. Other deaths might be much lower (e.g. traffic, murder) or higher (e.g. untreated cancer).<p>Then there&#x27;s the lag-effect. There&#x27;s 150 thousand confirmed infected, 15 thousand dead. But the vast majority of confirmed cases are still active, not recovered. They&#x27;re confirmed because tens of thousands were hospitalised. Of the incubated people, 80% do not come out alive. There&#x27;s lots of people fighting for their lives right now. Once those cases resolve, many will not have made it. And that&#x27;s just hospitalised people. Then there&#x27;s lots of cases who just got infected, and will be developing symptoms in 1-2 weeks.<p>The way exponentials work is that lag is way more important. In the first weeks NY doubled every 2 days. That means if you have 10 thousand today infected today, in 10 days that&#x27;s 320 thousand. That&#x27;s when people start to get symptoms, and 10 days later people start dying from the symptoms. That means your infection count can go into the hundreds of thousands or even millions before seeing any death. But you can&#x27;t conclude mortality figures from that, at all.<p>In short, the 21% and the 0.5% conclusions are extremely premature and should not be reported like this.

Intel is still leading all the rest for single core performance, but it does that at very high frequencies and using a very high power envelope due to process node.<p>If Intel could use 7nm, they could have had a much higher performance if they desired. I can speculate here that they wouldn&#x27;t have gone for the absolute best performance, because they don&#x27;t have to. Their goal is to make money, not to make the fastest CPUs they can.\nWhen Intel had a clear lead, they improved the CPUs little by little, each generation.<p>2. AMD has the best performance per dollar and watt and also the best multicore performance. That does bring them a lot of sales and they are happy with that. Their goal is to stay a bit ahead of Intel, so they can sell more CPUs. So their strategy is to be have a better value for dollar. Also, even if they are technically ahead in some areas, there&#x27;s due to Intel being behind TSMC.<p>3 ARM<p>Arm makes CPU designs and it seems it doesn&#x27;t care too much about having a clear lead in performance. Maybe with their investment in Ampere and the push towards ARM on servers from the likes of Amazon, they will start to care more. But right now, ARM makes a ton of money by licensing slow and power efficient cores to hundreds of licensees.<p>4 Qualcomm<p>It&#x27;s not clear if Qualcomm has the know how to push performance. Or that they are willing to allocate the resources for that. I can speculate that they would have done that with 8CX and SQ1 they built for Microsoft if they had the know how and made business sense.<p>Qualcomm doesn&#x27;t see Apple, Intel, AMD as threats. They compete mostly with Mediatek, Samsung, Huawei. From here, they are very safe. Mediatek optimizes for the absolutely cheapest CPUs they can make, Samsung doesn&#x27;t care much about CPUs and most of their phones use Qualcomm while Huawei doesn&#x27;t threaten Qualcomm much yet as their best CPUs are on par with Qualcomm&#x27;s and they don&#x27;t sell CPUs to other phone makers.<p>So Qualcomm thinks they can do the same things for the foreseeable future: get some cores from ARM, optimize them a bit, pack with their modem and make a nice sell to the Android makers.<p>The disruption of this model where most CPU makers are happy with slower CPUs can come from ARM server space.<p>If the companies pushing ARM for servers are smart, capable and hungry enough, they might start to eat Intel&#x27;s and AMD&#x27;s pies. That would push Intel and AMD to make better optimization and the tech might slip in mobile CPUs, too."],"time":["2020-04-24 10:05:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["prirun"],"id":[22957682],"kids":[22957821],"parent":[22954656],"text":["&quot;Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines.&quot;<p>Part of their release timing might be to ensure that emulating Intel on Arm has acceptable performance for most users."],"time":["2020-04-23 18:25:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["msoad"],"id":[22956064],"kids":[22956272],"parent":[22954656],"text":["I always wondered how much of my development environment will keep working on ARM?

It appears to be triggered because I was testing an odd network configuration.<p>Once something goes wrong, after that, every change just results in a one-line &quot;apt-get fails&quot; error message.<p>But consider the implications...<p>Canonical apparently doesn&#x27;t have an automated testing system which checks how Snap behaves under failure conditions but they put it into the install process without protections around it.

The case and probably battery are from the iPhone 8; the CPU&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;SOC and most of the rest of the electronics are from the iPhone 11; the camera still seems to be a slightly unknown quantity but the specs suggest it has a lot in common with the iPhone X camera. No doubt a certain amount of tricky engineering was required to put those parts together efficiently, but the SE requires almost no new manufacturing capacity beyond the final assembly line. For Apple it&#x27;s pretty much a no-brainer.<p>A hypothetical &quot;iPhone Classic&quot;, with modern innards in an iPhone 4&#x2F;5 form factor case, would be a very different matter. You couldn&#x27;t combine the 11&#x27;s CPU with the 5&#x27;s battery - battery life would be laughable. So you&#x27;d need to use a CPU from an earlier model; I suspect you&#x27;d have to go back at least to the 8 to find a CPU that doesn&#x27;t drain an iPhone 5 size battery like water through a sieve. That means keeping one more CPU fabrication line in business beyond its intended life, taking that capacity away from the plants that are making silicon for the iPhone 11 and the coming 12. The camera would of course also have to be based on an earlier model, with all the same downsides again in terms of keeping old technology going and taking up factory capacity. And fitting all that into a 4&#x2F;5 case would still be a much bigger engineering feat than the actual SE 2.<p>Bottom line: Even if you assume that the &quot;iPhone Classic&quot; market would be as big as that for the SE 2, it&#x27;s hard to see how it would be worth Apple&#x27;s time and money to cater to it. If you want to argue that the Classic would be a practical proposition for Apple, you would have to claim that the Classic market would be much bigger than the SE 2 - and given how popular the SE 2 is already turning out to be, that seems really unlikely."],"time":["2020-04-23 12:33:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["labster"],"id":[22952706],"kids":[22952731,22953242,22952782,22952770,22956606,22952793,22953519,22953589],"parent":[22952085],"text":["I don&#x27;t really see his attempts to use the new gestures on the old-design iPhone as proof that the new UI is better.

Yeah, Kubernetes is massively useful and I&#x27;m grateful, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from being very cynical about it -- the complexity and learning curve is a consultant&#x27;s dream (disclaimer: I&#x27;m a consultant) and at this point it looks like a 5d chess move to improve their cloud offering by basically backdooring themselves into every single other cloud and the headspace of millions of developers.<p>Condolences to Crossplane[1].

I&#x27;ll start with an architecture diagram: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;anthos&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;anthos&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;overview<\/a><p>You might still find this diagram difficult to understand (unless you live with the &quot;cloud-native&quot; stuff day to day) so I&#x27;ll break this down for you:<p>- Anthos GKE: This is basically the GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) you know. But it is now capable of running clusters not just on Google Cloud. If you ever thought &quot;ahh, X cloud doesn&#x27;t have good Kubernetes support&quot;, well Google can bring GKE quality to that cloud (AWS support is now GA, Azure is in preview) or to your on-prem datacenter, or AWS&#x2F;Azure account. The GKE you know is still available with pay-as-you-go model.<p>I must note that this GKE on-prem&#x2F;hybrid capabilities are probably the most critical part of Anthos stack.<p>- Anthos Service Mesh: This is Istio (the open source service mesh), set up and managed for you. It helps you (1) connect your services, even if they&#x27;re across different datacenters or clouds (2) automatically export telemetry like traces, metrics and set up SLOs&#x2F;alerts with them (3) set policies for your RPC traffic at high level e.g. tcp retry policies should be like  X (4) enable mTLS automatically without changing your code across ALL your fleet and without having to run a PKI. (If you&#x27;re still not convinced about service mesh, you probably don&#x27;t have a RPC-heavy infra like some companies, maybe you don&#x27;t need it.) You can technically install&#x2F;manage Istio yourself across your clusters, but with Anthos, Google does that for you.<p>- Cloud Run for Anthos: This is actually hosted Knative (open source serverless stack on Kubernetes) for you. If you like rapid request-based autoscaling containers, you can have it anywhere (GCP, AWS, on-prem). You can install Knative anywhere, but Google does it for you and ensures it works properly with Istio and Kubernetes versions. I&#x27;ve written a blog post explaining what Knative does here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahmet.im&#x2F;blog&#x2F;knative-better-kubernetes-networking&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahmet.im&#x2F;blog&#x2F;knative-better-kubernetes-networking&#x2F;<\/a> Basically, this works like a CaaS (containers as a service)  or build your own opinionated in-house opinionated PaaS with this.<p>We also offer Cloud Run as a fully-managed serverless product (not running on GKE, runs on Google’s infra directly) if you&#x27;re into that: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.run&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.run&#x2F;<\/a><p>- Anthos Config Management: This is available to GKE users as &quot;GKE Config Sync&quot;. It&#x27;s basically a GitOps tool (though not a complete suite like some stuff like Weaveworks Flux etc). You point it to a git repo&#x2F;branch, and it will go create Kubernetes manifests in that directory across your clusters. It has a pretty neat model where leaf directories correspond to Kubernetes namespace and there&#x27;s inheritance to fanout Kubernetes policy objects to multiple namespaces etc. AFAIK many companies using Kubernetes at scale build similar in-house solutions to this. So we worked with them to create a solution for everyone. This product also has some policy enforcement features and monitoring to see if your Kubernetes objects are propagating properly to your clusters.<p>- Other components: You&#x27;ll find them on the page I linked. I think they are not as interesting to the day to day practitioners here.<p>Obviously I&#x27;ve oversimplified many of these, but the docs of each specific product do a decent job explaining, you should read if you&#x27;re interested.<p>I&#x27;d say that if you are a practitioner, you don&#x27;t need to worry much about details of Anthos. You can continue focus on the technologies you need to know (choose how low-level you wanna go: containers, Kubernetes, RPC or networking layer&#x2F;service mesh, DevOps&#x2F;GitOps) and continue to be successful.<p>However, if you work at a company which doesn&#x27;t haven&#x27;t gone through the cloud native application modernization (I&#x27;m hitting my head on the wall for you for saying this), Anthos can actually help your company use cloud-native stack WITHOUT having to go to cloud.<p>As you might imagine, a ton of companies out there are (perhaps happily) run on infrastructure stacks from another time. However, those looking to change it and try to use Kubernetes, they need to build a lot of in-house tooling, hire talent to manage Kubernetes. Google is decent (maybe more) at running Kubernetes clusters at scale for many customers, so Google can bring this service and all the listed above to you.<p>I&#x27;m not that familiar with pricing, though as you can see from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;anthos&#x2F;pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;anthos&#x2F;pricing<\/a> if you want to use these features on just on GCP, there&#x27;s a $30 vCPU&#x2F;month cost based on GKE nodes you&#x27;re running.

A user&#x27;s system can be configured to load arbitrary validation layers in various ways and the application cannot prevent any of that. It can only ask for more layers to be loaded.

The new streaming stuff is particularly interesting to me, and it&#x27;s very impressive that you managed to implement it with no protocol changes. I have a couple questions. Please forgive any misconceptions as I&#x27;ve never used capnproto myself, since all the streaming I&#x27;ve done has to work in the browser, and as far as I know capnproto doesn&#x27;t work over WebSocket or WebRTC transports. But I&#x27;ve long been impressed with and inspired by capnproto and sandstorm.<p>Main question: is there a reason you opted for traditional window flow control a la TCP, as opposed to &quot;request-N&quot; style like in reactive streams[0] (see rsocket[1] for a great implementation)?<p>So with request-N, a server-&gt;client stream would look something like this:<p>interface MyInterface {<p><pre><code>  streamingCall @0 (callback :Callback) -&gt; (requester :Requester);\n\n  interface Callback {\n    sendChunk @0 (chunk :Data) -&gt; ();\n  }\n\n  interface Requester {\n    request @0 (n :int) -&gt; ();\n  }<\/code><\/pre>\n}<p>And the server will only ever send as much data as has been requested by the client with requester calls. This results in really elegant flow control that takes into account both the network, and the client&#x27;s capacity to consume, without the necessity of tracking windows. The receiver simply calls request(1) each time it processes a message. If you want a buffer you can just start with an assumed N=10, 100 etc.<p>I&#x27;ve found this worked really well when implementing omnistreams[2], which is basically a very thin streaming&#x2F;multiplexing layer for WebSockets, since WS doesn&#x27;t have any flow control. (fibridge[3] is a good example of it in action). I started with a window-style but once I learned about reactive streams the request model was much easier to reason about for me.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactive-streams&#x2F;reactive-streams-jvm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactive-streams&#x2F;reactive-streams-jvm<\/a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rsocket&#x2F;rsocket\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rsocket&#x2F;rsocket<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omnistreams&#x2F;omnistreams-spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omnistreams&#x2F;omnistreams-spec<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iobio.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;introducing-fibridge&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iobio.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;introducing-fibridge&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-23 23:56:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_pmf_"],"id":[22965341],"kids":{},"parent":[22956318],"text":["I&#x27;d really like to read an experience report of using the promise pipelined &#x2F; time-travelling RPC mechanism in production."],"time":["2020-04-24 08:52:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xyz-x"],"id":[22965279],"kids":[22965318,22968207],"parent":[22956318],"text":["For me, new to cap&#x27;n&#x27;proto, this blog post doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard because of multiple red flags:<p>- to start, it&#x27;s self-congratulatory at stating that streaming already exists &quot;[via] promise pipelining&quot; — but that has a name, it&#x27;s called polling, not streaming.

Noone knows, and &quot;Callback&quot; is not a good name for a callback, it should be &quot;SendEmailWithData&quot; or something that makes sense.<p>- `sendChunk @0 (chunk :Data)` doesn&#x27;t make sense to a beginner without explaination; what&#x27;s `@0` and why do I care?<p>Here&#x27;s what made me write this comment despite the threshold annoyance in commenting:<p>- Why name a <i>message<\/i>, `Data` when it&#x27;s clearly NOT a chunk of data in layer-3&#x2F;layer-4, but rather a layer-7 artifact with retries and checksumming implemented to ensure complete and accurate message delivery?<p>Finally, the articles goes on and discusses control flow via a proxy variable; your OS&#x27;es TCP send buffer size. But the linked Wikipedia article states:<p>&gt; because the protocol can only achieve optimum throughput if a sender sends a sufficiently large quantity of data before being required to stop and wait until a confirming message is received from the receiver, acknowledging successful receipt of that data<p>Which is not the case for Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Proto (admittedly it states it uses a hack). And there&#x27;s no discussion of end-to-end problems like BufferBloat, which are very hard to solve by only looking at your own buffer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bufferbloat#Solutions_and_mitigations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bufferbloat#Solutions_and_miti...<\/a> — or even the semantics of &quot;blocking on server&#x27;s return value&quot; (Is it enough for the receiving process to have the message in memory? The type system showcased seems to tell that story)<p>The article also doesn&#x27;t state how a simple RPC call works. Going to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org&#x2F;rpc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org&#x2F;rpc.html<\/a> immediately puts me off by inventing &quot;time travel&quot;, calling it &quot;promise pipelining&quot; and showing an impossible trace diagram (you can&#x27;t have messages go backwards in time).<p>But when explaining it, it&#x27;s really RPC message coalescing and compile-time reference indirection, from the promise to the underlying object instance as it is after executing the coalesced message pipeline. However, even when using the example of a file system (which is about as exception-intense as you can imagine), exceptions are ignored.<p>Looking through the Calculator example (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;c++&#x2F;samples&#x2F;calculator-client.c++\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;c++&#x2F;sampl...<\/a>) it turns out they haven&#x27;t actually performed the compile-time indirection, but actually block the calling thread like any random do-it-yourself-RPC framework out there.<p>What a RPC framework should do is give you:<p>- an extremely clear serialisation model that is outside of the framework<p>- a clear API<p>- clear garantuees &#x2F; invariants on how it manages the complexities of network programming<p>In short: it must be very clear in what it promises.

But with commit daedfb22451d in 2014, the eBPF virtual machine was exposed directly to user space.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;What can you do with eBPF?<p>An eBPF program is &quot;attached&quot; to a designated code path in the kernel. When the code path is traversed, any attached eBPF programs are executed. Given its origin, eBPF is especially suited to writing network programs and it&#x27;s possible to write programs that attach to a network socket to filter traffic, to classify traffic, and to run network classifier actions. It&#x27;s even possible to modify the settings of an established network socket with an eBPF program. The XDP project, in particular, uses eBPF to do high-performance packet processing by running eBPF programs at the lowest level of the network stack, immediately after a packet is received.<p>Another type of filtering performed by the kernel is restricting which system calls a process can use. This is done with seccomp BPF.<p>eBPF is also useful for debugging the kernel and carrying out performance analysis; programs can be attached to tracepoints, kprobes, and perf events.

Given that the stimulus is appropriate for the economy, this is all fine.  It&#x27;s not anything that future generations have to &quot;pay back.&quot;  And it&#x27;s not going to cause a collapse of the dollar.<p>The important thing to keep in mind is that we are <i>intentionally<\/i> shutting down parts of the economy.

Inject still more money into the economy or the entire financial system collapses.<p>Whenever this balance sheet chart shows up, MMT boosters descend to explain why the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s interest we owe ourselves. Nobody in the real economy looks at that balance sheet when making actual financial decisions, they claim.<p>I think that misses the point. The point is that since the last financial crisis, the balance sheet has on net expanded. By a lot. When the current crisis hit, the balance sheet shot up from an already elevated level.<p>To put it another way, consider the size of the balance sheet relative to GDP (~$24 trillion):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;GDP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;GDP<\/a><p>At the current level, the balance sheet is about 25% of GDP.

We can&#x27;t possibly pay for them at the current value of the dollar. Ever.<p>To the MMT boosters, what happens when the balance sheet approaches 1x GDP? 2x? 5x?<p>Nobody knows because this experiment has never been tried before. The reserve currency printer is also a net debtor. It runs very high, structural deficits with no end in sight. The currency is completely decoupled from gold, and as recent history shows, possibly industrially-critical commodities like oil.<p>I&#x27;d be very curious to hear from the MMT proponents on what signals they&#x27;s look for that the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet actually does matter in the real economy. Things that can only be explained by problems stemming from the size of that balance sheet. Problems whose only cure is a massive reduction in that balance sheet.<p>Of course, the balance sheet isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Nor are deficits. When faced with such situations in the past, the answer has been devaluation.<p>The US did that back in the 70s when it closed the gold window. It will happen again.

Central banking is the greatest scam in the history of mankind that cartelises the banking sector, gives them the privilege of access to the printing press, and is the root cause of the boom-and-bust cycle. It has managed to convince people (particularly mainstream economists) that its institution is necessary for &quot;financial stability&quot; but what it really does is absolves banks from any form of financial responsibility as they will always be able to receive a bailout if they act irresponsibly, allowing them to always make a profit regardless of risk. This is not free market capitalism but a system that enriches those closer to the central bank (and who get freshly-printed money first before inflation hits the rest of the economy) and punishes those who are relatively further away like manufacturing workers and salary earners. This is the reason why salaries at SV startups (bankrolled by VCs and soaring stock prices leading to valuable RSUs) are so high, and why wealth inequality has notably increased dramatically since we went off the gold standard in 1971[1].<p>I believe this topic is among the most important things we need to discuss and is arguably more important than climate change (what else is driving consumerism and throw-away-culture but inflation?), but economists have overcomplicated things and made it inaccessible to the average person when it really is so simple that a five-year old can understand it: printing money enriches the few who have access to the printing press at the expense of the many.<p>End central banking and the economy will be stronger, more resilient, fairer, and will reward those who create real value rather than the well-connected.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wtfhappenedin1971.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wtfhappenedin1971.com<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-23 13:22:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stephenr"],"id":[22954439],"kids":[22954662,22954611],"parent":[22953484],"text":["Please investigate &#x27;safe&#x27; php file upload handling, specifically: the `is_uploaded_file` and `move_uploaded_file` functions.<p>Also perhaps consider the `mkdir` function, and perhaps &#x27;file_put_contents&#x27;.

But this is not true; standard WireGuard happily works as long as as least one end (usually the central VPN concentrator) has a static IP address.<p>Maybe I don&#x27;t understand the issue to be solved (I was unfamiliar with the &#x27;road warrior&#x27; term so I looked it up [1]), but I think both Avery Pennarun and Michael Tremer misunderstood what WireGuard is capable of. WireGuard works just fine when the <i>physical<\/i> network interfaces have dynamic IPs (on both ends even). You can use the basic <i>wg<\/i> or <i>wg-quick<\/i> tools to create a VPN server on a server with a dynamic IP and have clients connect from dynamic IPs. However, all the <i>tunnel<\/i> IPs must be static unlike e.g. OpenVPN where the server gives the client a tunnel IP during authentication.<p>&gt; (for example, so you can get to an office network whose home connection uses dynamic DNS). It’s true that plain WireGuard does not support this configuration out of the box.<p>I have done literally that for over a year now. I cannot think of a way to interpret this that would make Avery&#x27;s claims true.<p>&gt; Someday, WireGuard will need to be upgraded to support a second cipher suite. When this happens, users will be able to configure it peer-by-peer to allow one cipher suite or the other, or both, exactly as they would with any other VPN.<p>That is not how I interpret what Donenfeld has said [2] about the future of WireGuard. I believe the software will get a v2 without backwards compatibility. However, even that is a non-issue because sysadmins can run both protocols in parallel during the transition.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Road_warrior_%28computing%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Road_warrior_%28computing%29<\/a><p>[2] Page 3 of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wireguard.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;wireguard.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wireguard.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;wireguard.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-24 00:19:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brobinson"],"id":[22960382],"kids":[22960813,22960726],"parent":[22955607],"text":["Glad someone did a rebuttal of that article.

Without testing we don&#x27;t know the new places where the virus is spreading until a week or two later, so reactionary measures like contact tracing don&#x27;t work as well.  Total lockdown reduces deaths, but destroys the economy and reduces the scope of life.<p>Maybe we need to use the tools we already have, such as flu surveillance and data from hospitals, to detect excess non-flu infections.

So understanding transmission better is something that could be used in addition to whatever testing is available in order to prevent deaths and economic damage.

This seems like an interesting conundrum — the only pages where you would invoke it are pages that have information you&#x27;d like to keep private. But you&#x27;re granting the developer of the extension read&#x2F;write access to the content on these pages, which seems unwise unless you know and trust the dev.<p>As someone with an accessibility-related extension that needs broad access, I can say that some folks are hesitant to install any extensions that have broad read&#x2F;write access. Some companies (including Google, I&#x27;m told) forbid employees from installing extensions that have global read&#x2F;write access, and would presumably feel the same way about this extension since it is intended to be invoked on pages with private content. I wish the creator the best of luck — this seems like a cool tool! — but I wonder about how this will pan out.<p>A couple pricing suggestions, since I also started out at $10&#x2F;yr: set your price higher and offer coupons. I thought the affordability and simplicity of $10&#x2F;yr would be a winner, but it isn&#x27;t. People expect discounts on software, so they&#x27;ll wait until they get one. If you don&#x27;t give a coupon, many of them will give up and uninstall. You&#x27;ll have more revenue AND more customers if you price at $15 and give random $5-off coupons.<p>Also, it appears this is a free trial that becomes paid, with no free functionality past the expiration of the trial. I would suggest allowing some functionality (perhaps 2x uses per month?) to post-trial users, so they have a reason to stick around instead of just uninstalling.<p>It would also provide a greater inducement for people to sign up — I like the idea of your extension, but I won&#x27;t install because I don&#x27;t value it at $10&#x2F;yr — and I don&#x27;t want to spend time learning how to use a tool that I&#x27;m only going to have access to for a short time.
