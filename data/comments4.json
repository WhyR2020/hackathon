Nvidia has a terrible track record of working with other companies, partners, and open source developers.

I?m not saying they won?t, but because the present situation would limit any efforts to do so long enough that it would be futile.Consider the perpetual license agreements ARM holds with companies like Apple. These companies are best positioned to resist meddling with ARM. As an example Apple will forever have access to the ARM ISA, so NVidia can?t simply stop them from using existing designs. The processors Apple uses are all custom designs anyway. If future designs were purposely kneecapped, they could just improve their currently licensed designs until a suitable alternative is produced. Hindering future processor designs won?t hurt the biggest players in the short term, and in the long term it will only drive them to the competition. NVidia could take the approach of slowly drifting new designs to greater integration with their own GPUs in such a way that alternatives would be displaced - either by favor of NVidia GPUs or by the difficulty in using alternatives. This would be obvious though, and would again drive their users away. NVidia hasn?t had great success like they have had with GPUs in any other market.

Then there are all the buffer overflows, because functions handed a pointer have no idea what the limits are, and no array bounds checking is possible.&quot;<p>PDS: The root of all of this -- is that C, being a low-level, close-to-the-hardware, designed in the 1970&#x27;s programming language (some in academia pejoratively call it a &quot;glorified assembler&quot;), was not designed with a proper string storage class as we know them in programming languages today; instead, arrays of characters were substituted for this purpose, and those arrays were not implemented containing total size (length) and dimensionality information.<p>Basically an array in C -- is a set of contiguous memory, which has a starting address (the pointer passed), and a stated element size that the compiler knows about, but not the length (aka, total size, element count, etc.) of that array, nor its dimensionality.<p>Observation: C&#x27;s arrays need length information signalled in an out-of-band fashion (that is, this information cannot exist as a zero (0) -- somewhere in the array).<p>The irony of all of this is that C was invented at AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T for the longest time had difficulty with phreakers exploiting 2600hz signals to gain access to its long distance trunk lines, from which they could call to anywhere in AT&amp;T&#x27;s system for free.<p>But, that&#x27;s what the engineering error of in-band signaling generates...<p>C, by using arrays to implement strings, and letting the zero terminator (information about string length) exist in the memory space of the string, made exactly the same engineering mistake -- just in software -- and that is the mistake of in-band signaling.<p>Now, that being said, hindsight is 2020, and it couldn&#x27;t be expected that Dennis Ritchie, who invented C in the 1970&#x27;s would have foreseen the consequences of that engineering &quot;mistake&quot; (AKA, &quot;act which generated quite the <i>education<\/i> for a future populace&quot;. &lt;g&gt;).<p>Such is the price of being an innovator.<p>On the one hand, he advanced computer technology greatly -- far beyond the technology advancements created by most of his contemporaries of his day...<p>On the other, that advancement gave us this highly educational engineering &quot;mistake&quot; -- that we can all learn from!<p>Such is the price of being an innovator -- and pressing the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; of what is possible...<p>Humanity could not be advanced without such innovators, and the occasional future flaws (and the wisdom that comes from examining them in hindsight!) that their innovations generate..."],"time":["2020-09-13 18:23:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tus88"],"id":[24455612],"kids":[24455860],"parent":[24454369],"text":["&gt; Conflating pointers with arrays.<p>AND Strings.<p>FTFY."],"time":["2020-09-12 22:58:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bumblebritches5"],"id":[24456115],"kids":{},"parent":[24454369],"text":["is errno, global state is incompatible with multithreading"],"time":["2020-09-12 23:46:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["jpab"],"id":[24454592],"kids":[24454632],"parent":[24454067],"text":["Prior discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24441979\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24441979<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-12 21:00:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blululu"],"id":[24454639],"kids":[24455092,24454893,24455504,24454722,24455956,24459263,24456092,24454845],"parent":[24454067],"text":["It is always a little surprising how naive people are when it comes to recycling. \nThe majority of the cost and difficulty comes in sorting.

Hire a performance marketer (i.e. leads, revenue focused), not a brand marketer. Your sales team needs leads to grow, not &quot;brand awareness&quot;. Once you&#x27;ve got a nice flow of leads, that&#x27;s when the softer side of marketing becomes important.<p>2. If they are focused on how big of a budget they&#x27;ll get, that&#x27;s a major red flag. The first channels should not be paid. Budget needs to be small to start -- once you prove ROI&#x2F;traction, it&#x27;s now a conversation about scaling quickly, and not about blindly throwing money away.<p>3. A quick look at their resume or LinkedIn should tell you everything you need to know... is it full of numbers&#x2F;data, or is it a list of tasks &amp; buzzword bingo?<p>4. Hire someone who can do everything themselves. Make sure they won&#x27;t need to rely on agencies.<p>Edit: Regarding the article&#x27;s recommendation about hiring ICs to perform smaller tasks.

As background, I&#x27;ve been running marketing teams for high tech B2B companies for about 12 years. This will be just a rambling set of thoughts that come to me on a Saturday night. So, with that caveat, a few things in the article jump out at me:<p>- Marketing leadership tenure is definitely short. Average lifespan for a CMO is supposedly 23 months. I can see it. The great irony about this is that I&#x27;ll often hear people say, about a marketing leader&#x27;s resume, is that &quot;it has a lot of short stays&quot; - showing that they are relatively unaware of the dynamics of the role.<p>- The kind of marketer you hire depends a lot on the size of your company and your go-to-market motion. As the author correctly points out, at the beginning, you are better off hiring a performance marketer, content marketer, or product marketer - depending on your product and the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>- If you&#x27;re selling an enterprise software product, you should probably hire a product marketer first to support that team, especially since attracting enterprise clients generally doesn&#x27;t come from, say content marketing or, say, SEM. That&#x27;s not saying it doesn&#x27;t happen - it does, but it just far less common.<p>- If you&#x27;re selling a solution that can be bought off the website, then you should probably start with a content marketer or performance marketer. If the ASP is low, then these are likely a requirement for the business to work - marketing is your sales team.<p>- In my experience, you generally hire a VP or CMO when you&#x27;ve reached somewhere around $10m in revenue. I&#x27;ve typically been brought in here.<p>- Usually, the founders will tell you that they really care about brand and perception in the market. Don&#x27;t fall for it. All they care about is leads.<p>- As a marketer joining a company, what I think you should be looking for is a company and product that has a clear mission, and clear sense of who they are marketing to. If you don&#x27;t have these, as a marketer, you&#x27;ll just about always fail (and I&#x27;ve had that experience). There are, of course, exceptions - some companies do create a new product category, but most of the time you&#x27;re going into an existing market.<p>- Be extremely skeptical of the founder saying they are forming a new market - most of the time it means that they really don&#x27;t have a buyer or budget, or that they exist &quot;In between&quot; product categories which can be extremely challenging because you&#x27;ll be competing against product in multiple categories with functionality deficiencies that can make it very hard to win. Maybe just as important, it will be incredibly hard for you to create compelling messaging around such a product.<p>- The most common situation I see is this: company has achieved decent product&#x2F;market fit, and has grown to approximately $3-5m using primarily content marketing. However, it&#x27;s largely tapped out. This isn&#x27;t always the case - if a startup is going after a very horizontal, broad market, that has a large online audience, then these strategies can scale much better. But my experience is with high tech, B2B companies - often very &quot;niche&quot; - so they tap out. The solution that the founder have come to, along with their Board, is that they need to build a real marketing team. So they&#x27;re bringing in a VP of Marketing to &quot;fix it&quot; and allow them to continue the growth required to validate their valuation.<p>This is a dangerous place for a marketing leader. The expectations are incredibly high, and you don&#x27;t know what marketing can really do to help. Again, the founders will sell you on brand, etc - but it&#x27;s all about the leads. This situation is often the reason for high marketing leadership turnover. They need leads, they bring in a VP, she or he tries to scale it through other channels like events, outbound, etc - and doesn&#x27;t see enough success in the extremely short window and they are shown the door.<p>One other interesting thing often happens in these situations - as the VP of Marketing, you bring actual measurement tools&#x2F;analytics that allow you to precisely measure what is working and what is not. And then you find out that the metrics they were using were bullshit and the situation is even harder than you thought.<p>- Marketing leaders are shown the door because they often come up with marketing strategy&#x2F;tactics&#x2F;messaging that the founders just don&#x27;t agree with. The leader may be right, or the founder may be right - but these conflicts make for quick exits. Founders can be extremely stubborn, and some may suffer the dreaded &quot;I&#x27;ve been successful in this one area, and now I feel I am a master of all areas.&quot;<p>- Marketing leaders are shown the door because they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. You need a very broad skill set in my opinion to be a successful VP at a startup - understanding everything from analyst relations, to SEO, to how run marketing automation and a huge amount of other technology. I&#x27;ve had friends at startups talk to me about their new VP of Marketing who didn&#x27;t understand how browser cookies worked. That guy did not last long.<p>- East coast vs. west coast high tech marketing is night and day. West Coast have a go big or go home approach. They will spend 5-10x current revenue on marketing with the intention of just dominating that market. East coast companies almost always have much more conservative approach. I&#x27;ve seen companies succeed and fail with both.<p>- In my experience with, again, relatively niche B2B high tech solution, Google Ads words and most paid spend produce results that make it difficult to justify the spend. I&#x27;ll couch this by saying that I&#x27;m sure there are successes out there, and that maybe I just suck at it, but I&#x27;ve done it across multiple companies and have rarely seen truly scalable success. I think you&#x27;re better off figuring out how to get your content spread as far and wide as possible vs. paid digital spend.<p>This is all, obviously, my experience - your mileage may vary!

In fact, most training schedules these days are &quot;boring&quot;.  Adam with warmup and either a linear or cosine decay.  CNNs have been doing that for awhile, and the hyperparameters now are fairly robust.  If you get within an order of magnitude you&#x27;ll land within a few percent of optimal accuracy.<p>The OpenAI paper Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models does a good job of exploring the hyperparameters of GPT-like networks.  It&#x27;s a fascinating read.<p>That paper suggests another thing about Transformers that we don&#x27;t understand.  Beyond some minimums, the layer count, embedding size, and number of attention heads _isn&#x27;t important_.  The most important factor in the performance of a model is simply the number of parameters.<p>That&#x27;s quite unusual, as the classic intuition is that adding more layers to a model improves performance.  Yet for GPT-like architectures that isn&#x27;t the case.  You can get the same performance gains by just increasing the embedding size.  4 heads?  12 heads?  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  Weird.<p>&gt; Initially introduced for machine translation, Transformers have gradually replaced RNNs in mainstream NLP. The architecture takes a fresh approach to representation learning: Doing away with recurrence entirely<p>The more I study Transformers, the more I suspect that their success has more to do with our utter failure to train RNNs.  In theory, RNNs have infinite attention.  In practice, the only tool we have for optimizing models is backprop, and so to train an RNN we have to use BPTT.  This defacto creates a learning horizon.  There is absolutely no training signal that tells an RNN to remember something beyond the BPTT horizon.  So why would it?<p>Our training loop for RNNs involves giving them, for example, 1024 tokens, running them for 1024 iterations, and computing loss on 1024 predictions.<p>A Transformer&#x27;s training is nearly identical.  They get 1024 tokens of context, make 1024 predictions, and compute loss.<p>The difference?  Let&#x27;s consider a scenario where it&#x27;s the last prediction, and that prediction should be a copy of the first word in the sequence.  Very simple, right?  Yet for an RNN to learn how to do that, it needs to backprop the loss through 1024 iterations of its model.  Even for a simple 1 layer RNN that makes it look like a 1024 layer model.  Vanishing gradients turned up to 11!!<p>For a Transformer this is dead simple.  Its attention mechanism allows the last column of the Transformer to directly use knowledge from the entire sequence.  Not only can it see the first token in the sequence, it can see all the computations it previously performed on the sequence, all at once.  All with easy backprop.  No vanishing gradients here.<p>So is it really any surprise that Transformers have dominated RNNs?  Given the exact same compute, memory, parameters, etc Transformers make much more efficient use of the resources.  (During training)<p>To put it another way, a Transformer is exactly like an RNN.  It just uses attention to access history rather than recurrence.  And we know that backprop and recurrence are incompatible.  So Transformers win.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s a huge problem.  We have a temporary win.  A HUGE win.  But Transformers haven&#x27;t solved what RNNs were meant to solve.  By the end of a book, human brains can remember things from the beginning of the book.  RNNs trained with BPTT cannot.  Transformers cannot.  Even Transformers with linear attention mechanisms cannot.  There&#x27;s another leap here left to do.<p>We need some kind of long term memory mechanism.  A big Transfomer model can probably approximate the active parts of a human brain.  The image-gpt model and papers using Transformers in place of CNNs for classification tasks have shown that Transformers are a generic substrate.  But the big missing puzzle piece is long term memory.  Give a Transformer some method to query a bank of memory and I think we&#x27;re going to see that next big leap.  Plus, with access to a memory bank, a Transformer can free up all the resources its using today to behave _like_ long term memory and instead use them for more &quot;thinking&quot;.<p>Yet we have absolutely no mechanisms available to us today to build such a thing.  To teach any kind of model to act as long term memory requires some way to show to an example from its distant past, see how well it remembers it, and then ... backprop that.  But we can&#x27;t backprop it, because we can&#x27;t backprop across an entire book, let alone WikiText or WebText2.<p>We&#x27;re really back at square one.  We need some way to make the theory of RNNs a reality.  Transforms haven&#x27;t bought us that.  They&#x27;ve only bought us a short-term cheat in performance.<p>EDIT: Just so it&#x27;s clear, none of my comment is meant as a criticism of the linked article.

Then, after a records stimulus was passed, profited as over 200k US citizens died. That&#x27;s just America (though America is the defacto reserve currency since WW2).

Ethereum can&#x27;t change that, it&#x27;s just offering the same financial services that crony capitalism offered but with a MORE oligarchical rules set. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s funny his &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot; pictures for success in cooperation both have pictures of castles.<p>Bitcoin is anarchist money (for now) because it uses entropy to secure instead of force&#x2F;violence (all fiat currency requires a military to secure). It questions the some of the base authorial structure of all human society&#x2F;nation-state economics. It is built with disorder in mind. It has built in distrust of authority. Authority is(or requires) force (to enforce). It&#x27;s important to question authority--that&#x27;s the only way to progress, no power&#x2F;responsibility&#x2F;trust should be given indefinitely. With that in mind.<p>Ethereum is a new form of authority, just like Bitcoin. But, it does some different stuff with the responsibility that is bestowed upon it. Ethereum owners (people who design, say, &quot;smart contracts,&quot; or whatever), have already abused their power, this makes it more dangerous than Bitcoin. Recent SushiSwap stuff. Eth classic is constantly getting 51% attacked. There has been rollbacks. The devs change the inflation rate at will. They are constantly trying to move at a breakneck speed, so it&#x27;s scary for people who want to hold money long term because you never know what you&#x27;re gonna have to adapt to, or whatever. It is designed to play with new trust models, it&#x27;s totally different than Bitcoin. Could be fun, but is designed to be more of a wild west than Bitcoin. If anything it&#x27;s really better to see it as another layer to Bitcoin. If it surpasses Bitcoin in value, something will surpass it. If Bitcoin fails, it will likely fail since it is tied to the Bitcoin economy (wrapped Bitcoin, code similarities and cryptography standards used). If you&#x27;re interested in Ethereum, there&#x27;s already a better Ethereum, it&#x27;s called TRON. And what about Polkadot. etc etc.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in going down this rabbit hole. Start with tech deflation.<p>IMO, On a macro level we&#x27;re seeing the same thing that happened after the industrial revolution, leading up to WW1 (though historians still argue about the cause of WW1--I think it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;d have a lot to argue about if we had a WW3 soon, as well). It&#x27;s called tech deflation. Of course, I&#x27;m not a historian or an economist. SO TAKE THIS ENTIRE DIATRIBE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.<p>Deflation is political suicide because business money goes where there is promise of a strong consumer base and labor force. But inflation is also effectively gaslighting citizens of the inflating nation-state. That&#x27;s why we see such disparity through asset bubbles and pops every decade. The problem isn&#x27;t inflation, though, it&#x27;s that there isn&#x27;t another legal option for all people. Money is a good that is consumed like anything else. You can keep fiat AND your Amazon gift card AND have some Bitcoin. Accept deflation into your life. Bitcoin is an anti-inflationary anti-censorship (Ethereum is not) choice, it is the best option for an equally distributed access to deflation that humans have right now (better than gold, or whatever, anyway). Honestly, believe it&#x27;s the best first step to preventing a third world war.<p>Ignore Vitalik&#x27;s grains of salt, ignore my grains of salt<p>Buy Bitcoin"],"time":["2020-09-12 08:10:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hidihi8790"],"id":[24450161],"kids":{},"parent":[24449629],"text":["My last month&#x27;s online job to earn extra dollars every month just by doing work for maximum 2 to 3 hrs a day.

You&#x27;re going to laugh (and then downvote fiercely): it&#x27;s ether.<p>However this time science knows what this ether is and already performs some experiments on it, although doesn&#x27;t recognize it as a valid state of matter.<p>Ether is multiquarks essentially. Protons and neutrons are the densest or biggest form of ether. A tetraquark sporadically appearing in experiments is a particle of thinner ether. Individual quarks are very thin ether. So far so good and it&#x27;s just a matter of terminology.<p>There are a few interesting claims made with respect to ether that science can actually verify. One claim is that ether is a legit state of matter and everything is packed with it. This doesn&#x27;t contradict observations because most of the ether forms compounds with no electric charge, so there&#x27;s no electron cloud around them that we could detect. Second claim is that ether forms very complex compounds with very sophisticated structure. The most complex compounds are atomic nucleus, the simplest ones are the basic multiquarks, but there&#x27;s a whole zoo in between. Ether isn&#x27;t just 6 quarks with an occasional tetraquark, it&#x27;s a whole periodic table. What do you think the atomic nucleus consists of? Ball shaped protons and neutrons? Is it because thats what you&#x27;ve seen on a textbook picture or because nucleus tends to spit out individual protons and neutrons on collisions? Take a look at the competing theories explaining the structure of nucleus and ask yourself if they look convincing.<p>If this guess is right, dark matter is huge clouds of mostly neutral ether that can&#x27;t possibly interact with light, as photons have nothing to bounce of (unless an occasional photon hits a quark directly). Ether could form a ring of &quot;asteroids&quot; around Earth: it would affect trajectories of spacecrafts, but otherwise would be completely undetectable. We would see it as a mysterious deviation from the computed trajectory.<p>And don&#x27;t confuse ether with aether.

Most SASS products base their pricing on unique metrics because each unique aggregation has a cost. In the 3 pillars model, companies like Datadog are pushing those high cardinality values into the log pillar, and this article seems to imply the same. However, logs are often unstructured. There are often tools to search through logs, find values within those logs, and I can even do aggregations on them. However, when you know ahead of time what you want to aggregate on, text logs are more brittle than simply defining an event in json or another structured format. This log tier quickly becomes an ad-hoc version of a  data warehouse and I feel like there is a missing tier here where you would send structured data to a datastore to do aggregations on for observability purposes only. I know datadog supports parsing structured data in this way, but I&#x27;m curious what is a common solution to this.<p>Is sending structured data through the &quot;log&quot; tier common, or are there structured event and reporting systems that are part of another system that is seldom discussed in this topic."],"time":["2020-09-12 18:38:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yowlingcat"],"id":[24453623],"kids":{},"parent":[24452109],"text":["&gt; Edgar captures 100% of interesting traces, as opposed to sampling a small fixed percentage of traffic.<p>Very interesting.

Are there tools to achieve something like this open source or SaaS in a reasonable way? Am I ignorant or is this actually too hard to do at scale I wonder.<p>1. Detail response&#x2F;time taken for every single endpoint. So I want a histogram and not just an average. I have seen often you get the top X endpoints (for me mostly requests) in tools and top X by global measure. At my work the number of unique requests are a lot and the good response time for them varies a lot from 50ms to 1s easily. A global threshold is useless. There&#x27;s also the fact that users have different cost for same endpoint but that I don&#x27;t have a super good solution.<p>2. Some level of traces for requests that crosses a threshold. That means the agent has to keep the threshold for every endpoint but is that so expensive? I think I saw some ideas (in some commercial product) where they collect data and drop them if the request ends up being fast enough. I think that&#x27;s a very good approach. So I want specifics when something is slow and against a per endpoint threshold. Perhaps I want all requests slower than 99 percentile, perhaps I keep 20% for &gt; 90 percentile etc.<p>3. Now the per end point statistics has to be kept for significant period, months not days otherwise how would you see the change. I have things slowed down due to code change, due to usage increase, due to query plan getting whacky. You have different performance due to different level of usage (concurrency). No one can probably afford per second resolution for a year sure but if my 9am spikes are averaged out how would I know that this is an old problem or the spike actually worsened by 20% in the last two month? I think you can get away with reducing resolution a lot if you keep a histogram and not just average. But I don&#x27;t think anyone optimizes for that. And you also need to keep those important traces for quite a long time.<p>4. I work in Java and use unstructured log and have been trying to figure out how to parse that reliably for debugging so that we don&#x27;t spend hours to grep the logs.

But most log tools seems like either grep &amp; super structured. Also someone else mentioned cardinality because while the rest can be fine, user is definitely high cardinality so everything might break down there.<p>I think for my problems, at my scale Million of user not Million concurrent user I think these are nicely solvable given the capabilities the tools today have (even if they are not doing it exactly like that) but is is unscalable at large or this is just not needed if you do &#x27;something` which I&#x2F;we are not doing?"],"time":["2020-09-12 20:40:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tonic_section"],"id":[24450393],"kids":[24450717,24454811,24451828,24451226,24450600],"parent":[24450392],"text":["Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve been working on an implementation of a model for learnable image compression together with general support for neural image compression in PyTorch. You can try it out directly and compress your own images in Google Colab [1] or checkout the source on Github [2].<p>This project is based on the paper &quot;High-Fidelity Image Compression&quot; by Mentzer et. al. [3] - this was one of the most interesting papers I&#x27;ve read this year! The model is capable of compressing images of arbitrary size and resolution to bitrates competitive with state-of-the-art compression methods while maintaining a very high perceptual quality. At a high-level, the model jointly trains an autoencoding architecture together with a GAN-like component to encourage faithful reconstructions, combined with a hierarchical probability model to perform the entropy coding.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the model avoids compression artifacts associated with standard image codecs by subsampling high-frequency detail in the image while preserving the global features of the image very well - for example, the model learns to sacrifice faithful reconstruction of e.g. faces and writing and use these &#x27;bits&#x27; in other places to keep the overall bitrate low.<p>The overall model is around 700MB - so transmitting the model wouldn&#x27;t be particularly feasible, and the idea is that both the sender and receiver have access to the model, and can transmit the compressed messages between themselves.<p>If you have any questions or notice something weird I&#x27;d be more than happy to address them.<p>---<p>[1] Colab Demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;Justin-Tan&#x2F;high-fidelity-generative-compression&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;assets&#x2F;HiFIC_torch_colab_demo.ipynb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;Justin-Tan&#x2F;high-fid...<\/a><p>[2]: Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Justin-Tan&#x2F;high-fidelity-generative-compression\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Justin-Tan&#x2F;high-fidelity-generative-compr...<\/a><p>[3]: Original paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hific.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hific.github.io&#x2F;<\/a><p>[4]: Sample reconstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Justin-Tan&#x2F;high-fidelity-generative-compression&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;assets&#x2F;EXAMPLES.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Justin-Tan&#x2F;high-fidelity-generative-compr...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-12 08:45:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["atorodius"],"id":[24451421],"kids":{},"parent":[24450392],"text":["Nice demo!

And that&#x27;s without following any big influencers, just friends.<p>The bots also invade basically every public comment section, trying to sell porn or NSFW snapchat. I don&#x27;t get why they are successful, but I assume they are, given the scale they operate.<p>Their TikTok clone feature that basically completely spams my discover&#x2F;search tab is full of content taken from TikTok or barely dressed girls trying to push their OnlyFans. Maybe that was the plan, I find it just annoying.<p>And now to their ads, easily one of the most annoying parts. Given how much data Facebook&#x2F;Instagram is collecting, you&#x27;d assume they&#x27;d somehow manage to show interesting and relevant advertisings. At least for me and some friends I talked to, that is absolutely not the case. While it feels like every third post is an ad, there is nothing relevant at all. Basically all ads I get on instagram are trying to sell me 100k passive income online courses, cheap Chinese drop shipping products, knockoff products or trading apps (something I was never remotely interested in either)."],"time":["2020-09-12 17:24:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rospaya"],"id":[24452416],"kids":[24452572,24452436,24452433],"parent":[24451567],"text":["I hate being in a position to defend Facebook or Instagram, but independent of the size of any of the platforms, Apple is a gatekeeper for them, not the other way around."],"time":["2020-09-12 15:53:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["syllable_studio"],"id":[24452435],"kids":[24452554,24453106,24452508,24452849,24452484,24452542],"parent":[24451567],"text":["I CAN&#x27;T WAIT for decentralized infrastructure to finally become robust enough that clones of instagram and facebook can all share a network -- they&#x27;ll all become portals to the same social graph data.

As my sibling say, it is all theoretical until you actually do it.<p>So if you really want to learn a language, just start vomiting out words with a teacher one-on-one. Just like with child rearing, vomit and messiness is always involved.<p>There is no magic technique. If there is a magic technique, it is like this article alludes, to use many techniques. Some may work, some may not. It is up to you to find those techniques that work for you. You are the only one who can do that.<p>Don&#x27;t take SHIT classes.

There are many things that you might think are productive, and they are not. Sometimes it depends on where you are in your language learning process. For example, listening or watching to a TV show in your target language with <i>subtitles<\/i> in the target language can be counter productive if you barely understand the sounds, let alone the meanings and grammar. Also, subtitles are not 1 to 1 to the audio.<p>In my experience, if it is painful to you, you won&#x27;t continue doing it. Most of language learning can be a pain. One of the best ways to get around the pain is to find a teacher (iTalki is a great site for that) who you find fits your needs and <i>meet regularly<\/i> with them. At the minimum, twice a week. You&#x27;ll probably find that, over time, you&#x27;ll develop a friend-type relationship more than a teacher-student relationship. How else are you going to talk for an hour? And if you are paying someone for their time and not relying on your friend who speaks that language it is a clear-cut transactional relationship. Patience can be bought. By paying a teacher, you are paying for their patience and your accountability to them.<p>It is like going to the gym. If you go to the gym once a week, don&#x27;t expect a lot. However, if you go to the gym 3 times a week, you can definitely expect some improvement.

Studying languages is often boring, annoying and takes years. Nobody likes memorizing vocabulary. Embrace it. Study every day, even if that means only reviewing 5 words on some days.<p>- Don&#x27;t try to analyze and understand everything. Communication isn&#x27;t a science, treating it as such is unproductive and frustrating to the learner. There will be many things that at first sight make little sense, and that&#x27;s okay; just move on. Language can be very nuanced, but with persistence you&#x27;ll eventually &quot;feel&quot; the subtleties.<p>- Passive learning is super helpful. Change the phone language, watch movies (whether in the target language with subtitles, or your native language with target language subtitles), listen to music, etc. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t understand.<p>- It can be depressing and you&#x27;ll want to stop. Even after months of studying hard, go to a party with only natives and see how much you&#x27;ll understand. Likely very little. Know it&#x27;s normal, and only temporary.<p>- The hardest part is reaching a level of fluency where your brain no longer actively translates the language.<p>- Study from multiple sources. Most textbooks explain the nuances in natural language badly.<p>- Nearly all dialogue in textbooks is unnatural and robotic. Don&#x27;t imitate textbooks or you&#x27;ll sound like one.<p>- Observe and imitate natives. Often, the forced imitations eventually become a natural part of your speech.<p>- Stop caring so much.

Also being willing to take the language as it is, and not imposing your own values on it from the get-go (e.g. why are there so many unnecessary cases&#x2F;conjugations? it&#x27;s stupid! -- people who are super-contrarian and judgy probably struggle more... they try to analyze everything but end up not learning anything. It&#x27;s a common attitudinal problem among many otherwise smart people.)<p>(2) constant contact -- you need to spend time with the language in small chunks (e.g. 1&#x2F;2 hour a day) over a long period of time rather than spend a week studying then stopping for several months.<p>(3) ability to notice things&#x2F;distinctions -- this is important because if you cannot differentiate sounds or details, it can be hard to get to a certain level. I believe this ability is at least partly innate; folks who have this ability in spades seem to be able to progress faster. (but I also believe folks who have a growth mindset and put in the work eventually get there)<p>With these elements, one can assemble a combination of  techniques tailored to oneself (everybody learns differently). For me, watching YouTube creators explain local culture is what interests me. Podcasts work for some people, but interesting content doesn&#x27;t always exist in my target language, so I&#x27;m perfectly happy to reject that as technique for acquiring certain languages. Taking classroom lessons actually works really well for me because I like structure, so I do it weekly. Some people like music for learning languages -- it doesn&#x27;t really work for me because I don&#x27;t get to learn intonation (music obscures intonation and vowel lengths).<p>Learning techniques have to necessarily be bespoke because we come at languages with different backgrounds and interests. But I believe the 3 elements above have to exist.<p>In my opinion -- this is only my opinion --  immersion by living in a country is overrated as a technique. It helps for sure, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary. The elements above are what are needed -- without these, even immersion is ineffective. I&#x27;ve met Irish guys living in Barcelona who couldn&#x27;t speak any of the local languages.

Climate change may indeed be worsening dry fuel loads, but there?s a lot in terms of forest management that simply isn?t being addressed and could go a long way in preventing wildfires.<p>As this article notes, controlled burns are an important tool, and based on personal observation they seem vastly underused today compared to the frequency with which we used to see them in the past. We also need responsible forest management to thin trees and clear brush. We also need proper management (or funding) of power utilities, which have been responsible for many wildfires on the West coast - and I don?t mean just PG&amp;E in CA (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;pg-e-sparked-at-least-1-500-california-fires-now-the-utility-faces-collapse-11547410768\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;pg-e-sparked-at-least-1-500-cal...<\/a>), as some recent fires in WA were also sparked by power lines downed by trees that were too close and poorly managed. We also need relaxed regulations for private land owners - I know home owners in WA who were prevented from removing dangerous trees on their land and the difficult, expensive, time consuming process of getting permits caused them to give up and ignore the trees ultimately until they naturally fell. Unfortunately I had a tree fall on my house that my neighbor ignored for the same reasons.<p>It feels to me like basic common sense techniques to prevent wildfires have been abandoned, and rules intended to protect the environment have backfired in some cases.<p>Forestry management works: WaPo has noted that Finland does a lot better than its neighbors when it comes to wildfires due to controlled burns and compartmentalization of forests (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;why-finland-is-so-good-handling-forest-fires-hint-its-not-because-raking&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;why-finland-...<\/a>). That compartmentalizations comes in part from a dense forest road network that makes the forests accessible and has also subdivided them (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.is.fi&#x2F;ulkomaat&#x2F;art-2000005903733.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.is.fi&#x2F;ulkomaat&#x2F;art-2000005903733.html<\/a>). Another interesting note is that Trump was widely ridiculed for his ?raking? comment, but he was somewhat correct, although he misunderstood the term. Visit a clear cut of a timber stand in WA or OR and you?ll see a tangled mess left on the ground (brush, branches, stumps) that?ll dry up into a mass of fuel waiting for a spark. In Finland, they invest in clearing the land of what would otherwise be prime forest fire fuel in a process known as a ?root rake? (see example video of machinery at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;o_EZeAiy3ew\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;o_EZeAiy3ew<\/a>).<p>Voters need to draw more attention to preventative techniques and ask that funds be redirected accordingly. In Washington state, our Department of Natural Resources has been asking for increased investment in managing the fuel load and thinning forests for years (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dnr.wa.gov&#x2F;StrategicFireProtection\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dnr.wa.gov&#x2F;StrategicFireProtection<\/a>).

It is good that more people are trying to go Google-free. Your project does server side analytics, though, while Google Analytics is client side. Both different advantages and disadvantages.<p>Server side analytics advantages: \n- No overhead on your website, because no external resources are loaded \n- Not affected by content blockers \n- Can track resources other than web pages, like images or redirects\n- Show resources that could not be found<p>Client side analytics advantages:\n- Can capture more data about the user, like device size, browser and OS \n- Better track user behavior, like time spent on each page \n- Provide real-time feedback about visitors\n- Usually easier to setup (3&#x2F;8)<p>I&#x27;ve been playing around with different analytics options on my blog recently - Netlify on the server and Plausible Analytics on the client side. The results from 7 days comparison turned to be quite different [0].<p>The server side tool shows much more views across all pages in my blog. I think this is because the pages are accessed many times from automated systems that don&#x27;t run JavaScript and are therefore not counted on the client side. This happens when you post a link on Twitter or WhatsApp for example, because their websites or clients then make a request to fetch the metadata of the page and display a card preview. Therefore, it counts on the server, but not on the client side. A perfect example is the draft article, which I only sent per WhatsApp to my wife for proof reading. The difference there is just 2 views (I guess one preview each on my and on her phone). I sent all other links to several people and posted them on Twitter and Reddit.<p>You can also somewhat see this effect in the referrers [1]. The server side tool counted many hits from a RSS reader and Google Translate (my parents in law reading my blog in Bulgarian :D). The preview requests from Twitter and WhatsApp are probably counted as direct traffic.<p>I think client side analytics more realistically count the number of people reading my blog (even if not many). However, there are cases that can be captured only on the server side (for example Google Translate). So, the best way would be to use both or maybe even make a service that combines client and server side - I think there is a lot of potential there!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EY-IqtdXsAAJvu9?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EY-IqtdXsAAJvu9?format=jpg&amp;name=...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EY-J0c8WoAEwn2J?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EY-J0c8WoAEwn2J?format=jpg&amp;name=...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-06-04 07:32:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["johnghanks"],"id":[23411507],"kids":[23411528,23411640],"parent":[23411047],"text":["So... more work, slower, and fewer features than GA."],"time":["2020-06-04 04:02:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["da39a3ee"],"id":[23423548],"kids":[23425456,23425858,23425819,23425804,23425077,23425954,23428985,23424329,23424184],"parent":[23420308],"text":["I use Emacs heavily, write projects in emacs lisp, and have used gnus and offlineimap&#x2F;dovecot for my email for a year or so.<p>For nearly everyone this is a spectacularly bad idea, other than to gain some experience with Linux&#x2F;Unix administration&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;infrastructure.<p>You will waste a LOT of time getting it set up and fiddling with it.

researcher, programmer, sysadmin, and work in a multilingual environment (Python, English, Dutch, R, Java, French, Spanish), so I was expecting some interesting results.<p>I put 3 years worth of keylogs into Patorjk&#x27;s Keyboard Analyzer app [2] used by OP (after sanitizing passwords and personal identification).\nHere are my personal results:<p><pre><code>  Programmer Colemak      59.06\n

scores:<p><pre><code>  Colemak Thumbshift      63.12\n  Ergodox&#x2F;Colemak&#x2F;Cub     60.93\n  Ergodox Colemak v1      60.13\n  Ergodox&#x2F;Workman&#x2F;Cub     59.27\n  Ergodox Colemak v2      57.07\n<\/code><\/pre>\nFor me, Colemak variations seem to come on top over Workman and CarpalX in this test.\nNote that Patorjk&#x27;s Keyboard Analyzer [2] does not have a ergonomic typing effort modeled in as much detail as the CarpalX model which takes into account full stroke path.\nIt is very much possible that CarpalX will come out in front of Colemak using the more CarpalX model.\nOther interesting layouts can be found at the Keyboard-Design.com ranking [3] which uses [2] on different (programming) language inputs.\nFor me personally, I will start learning Programmer Colemak on my regular keyboard and Colemak Thumbshift on my Ergodox.<p>OP argues against Colemak based on added typing effort due to horizontal and diagonal stretching.\nIf Workman is better in this regard, PatorJ&#x27;s Keyboard Analyzer [2] as not as good a tool as CarpalX to reflect this advantage.\nCarpalX takes into account finger travel distance, hand&#x2F;finger&#x2F;row penalties and stroke path.\nPatorJ&#x27;s tool does not model stroke path or allows for penalization of horizontal and diagonal movement.\nI would like to have seen an analysis using CarpalX as that could have strengthened your argument for Workman.\nAdditionally, OP puts a lot of focus on the common monolingual English keystrokes (HE) which is not necessarily relevant for multilingual programmers.<p>A personalized approach is necessary because most standard lay-outs are based on monolingual text datasets of books as is in the OP.\nEveryday typing of an IT-professional does not resemble natural language text in the slightest, so actual keylog input is required for any layout analysis IMHO.<p>Overall, I very much appreciate the effort OP put into Workman, it looks great!\nIt seems Workman is

Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, Ill watch a few segments from the previous week. Usually I will watch the times that felt like it took a lot longer to complete some task than it should have. While watching them, Ill pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going.<p>&gt; For example, previously when writing code, I would write all my code for a new feature up front and then test all of the code collectively. When testing code this way, I would have to isolate which function the bug was in and then debug that individual function. After watching a recording of myself writing code, I realized I was spending about a quarter of the total time implementing the feature tracking down which functions the bugs were in! This was completely non-obvious to me and I wouldnt have found it out without recording myself. Now that Im aware that I spent so much time isolating which function a bugs are in, I now test each function as I write it to make sure they work. This allows me to write code a lot faster as it dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to debug my code.<p>The main benefit comes from review.

Emails are probably one of the most important things to backup. Not sure what `imapgrab` adds, since fetching mails from imap is exactly what getmail is doing.<p>That being said, if you go on and set up getmail, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the point to continue to use mutt through imap (the author mentions decrypting the archive before reading them, so I assume it&#x27;s not their daily driver and they keep using direct imap connection otherwise). Imap is still useful if you want to read mails on your mobile.<p>For the encryption part, I found cryfs [1] to be very useful. It&#x27;s a fuse based app that encrypts files on the fly as they are written to the pseudo fs and stores them in partioned small size encrypted files. Basically, it means you can use the pseudo fs as a regular directory, store your mail in it and read them from it, and then the special layout of the encrypted directory with its small files is especially rsync-friendly (outside of email system, if I store a big file where only a small part has changed, only the files related to these small changes will be uploaded).<p>An other advantage of going full local : you can use notmuch [2]. It&#x27;s a mail indexer that allows fast and advanced search within mails. I have all my mails since 2013 locally, and it takes less than a second to make a full text search within them.<p>The last thing that I love is the ability to use maildrop [3]. It&#x27;s regexp based filtering and can forward the mail to anything (mailbox or program), so it allows to have advanced filters that can do quite crazy things (my phone sends me mails when my battery is depleted or fully charged, and it triggers desktop notifications on my computer). Not to be abused, obviously.
