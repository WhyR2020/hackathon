I had already written at length in another post about this topic, but my opinion is that what we think of as a &quot;car&quot; right now will never be fully autonomous.<p>I see the future diverging into two paths, fully autonomous commercial vehicles, like taxis, delivery vehicles, semi-trucks, etc. that work within urban areas or other designated, mapped and specially prepared areas. This will possibly involve a centralized system of control and communication, something like an ATC but for cars. These will be owned by corporations and only used by people. It makes no sense for a person to buy one of these fully autonomous vehicles, although I imagine some people would pay extra to have priority access so they always have one available.<p>The other side of the coin will be privately owned cars that have autonomous capability, or autonomous cars with override. These will be able to go anywhere the driver wants, including unmapped villages, small towns, off road tracks, etc. I suspect these will be the domain of enthusiasts, people who really need them for work (ranchers and farmers, for example) and people who choose to live away from urban centers. They will be more expensive than cars now, but the need for these vehicles will never go away. Even if we get true AI capable of driving anywhere with only the sensors aboard the vehicle, there will still be the need for a human to override it, even if that involves just authorizing a risky maneuver or putting the AI into &quot;unsafe driving&quot; mode.<p>I think the movie I, Robot (with Will Smith) got the future of autonomous cars surprisingly right, autonomous inside cities and on highways, and using the manual override comes with penalties (higher insurance, being at fault in an accident, etc.).<p>On a personal note, and this may sound bad, but I would never buy a car which I cannot use to break the law. Even if I never plan to do it, being able to speed, jump the curb, intentionally crash into a wall (or another car) or even run over a person (for example, in self defense) may be at some point required or the least bad of many bad options. In this case any consequences should fall on me, but I don&#x27;t think a thing I own should be designed to prevent me from breaking the law or doing something stupid if I really want or need to, although providing warnings or an optional safe-mode is fine. I suspect many people feel the same way, even if they don&#x27;t put it in such an extreme way.

The following is a description of what they found:<p>&quot;The hospital was in darkness. Ventilators, incubators, dialysis machines were not functioning and any patients dependent on these support systems had died. We made ward rounds with Iraqi physicians, many trained in the US and Great Britain, who were despondent and demoralized. No x-rays, lab tests, or possibility of surgery. Worse of all, intravenous fluids and supplemental feedings for the scores of malnourished children were in short supply, the pharmacy had exhausted its store of antibiotics for treatable infections, and there was not one vial of morphine to relieve the pain of children suffering with tumors on the cancer ward.&quot;<p>Outside of the US, economic sanctions of this magnitude are often regarded as war crimes. They are routinely deployed against the populations of official US enemies and have been for some time under the theory that if we make life as bad as possible for the people, maybe they&#x27;ll overthrow the regime. Hint: It usually doesn&#x27;t work and the regime uses the sanctions to (correctly) characterize itself as under attack by foreign enemies.<p>In the modern instance, the case for sanctions in Iraq can only be described as barbarous bullying. The Iraqi government voted to remove US troops in response to an unprovoked assasination on an Iranian top general on their soil while performing what is claimed to be a diplomatic peace mission (another war crime). In response, the US employs sanctions to bully the Iraqis into acquiescing to an unending occupation that they have judged does not serve their interests.<p>Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek Finance Minister (paraphrased, talking about austerity in Greece) said that where they used to use tanks, they now use banks.

The way they would die is very interesting: The printer would receive the document to print, pull in paper, start priting but not pull the paper so everything would get printed on one line. Then, when it is done printing, it would move the paper properly, in steps, without printing anything, until it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot;, when it would eject the paper.

Not really able to visually explore edge relationships without taking stuff apart. Undirected graph, generic edge meaning. Links probably often one-way and not self-healing (removing a card wouldn&#x27;t remove links of all linking cards). Supported heirarchical containers, and a card could conceptually link to a container by having &quot;2&quot; link to &quot;2a&quot; which might include 2a1, 2a2, 2a3, etc. Supported tags, sort of, although there wasn&#x27;t a way to search for all cards that had a particular tag.<p>Ultimately you find that different thinking styles require different combinations of these concepts, so there isn&#x27;t a one-size-fits-all, and there isn&#x27;t &quot;one system&quot; that works like how the brain does, at least not until we have a system that allows us to easily mix these concepts together into a custom implementation."],"time":["2020-01-19 00:06:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blumomo"],"id":[22090362],"kids":{},"parent":[22085837],"text":["While the authors promote their own software solution for building your Zettelkasten, I am happy a user of (and not affiliated with) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bear.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bear.app<\/a> which I use on my iPhone and Mac for organizing my plenty notes for software engineering, meetings, management notes, my Psychology study notes and anything private as well.<p>In analogy to Zettelkasten I put my notes into different (nestable) boxes what they call hashes.

It still felt like a generic enough task to use an external tool with those requirements, but then additional functionality appeared, such as changing task parameters according to certain rules (and internal state). At this point it seems that the way to go is either a custom scheduler or just regular cron, crontab editing, and wrappers akin to cronic (or otherwise handling the state-related configuration in the tasks it runs) -- that is, also a custom scheduling system, but incorporating cron.

Certainly it is true that no community of practice achieves meritocracy, just as no polity achieves democracy — there are always some citizens with more influence than others, so it is always possible for the government to act against the interests and values of the majority of its population.  Should we therefore consider democracy &quot;a dirty word&quot; because democracy &quot;is a lie&quot;?  Perhaps it is better to consider it an ideal to which we aspire, without feigning to have achieved it.<p>Let&#x27;s consider what alternative ideals are available in place of meritocracy for governing a community of intellectual practice.<p>We could strive for a democracy, in which the decisions are made by the majority — but the majority of whom?  For this to meaningfully distinguish a community of intellectual practice from the surrounding community from which it arose, as a lotus blossom arises spotless from the swamp, a distinction must be made between voting members and outsiders.  (Can you imagine a Linux User&#x27;s Group where all the presentations are about Microsoft Windows, or a Python conference where all the talks are about Java?)  But that is just a way of postponing the question of who the voters are.<p>We could strive for consensus, like the Quakers, in which any collective decision is postponed until every member agrees; but, like democracy, that demands gatekeeping that draws an ingroup&#x2F;outgroup distinction, so it is not really an answer to the question of who governs, just how they govern.<p>We could strive for anarchy, in which all decisions are made individually, and there are thus no collective decisions to be made, whether by the meritorious or by anyone else.  A variant of anarchy is &quot;do-ocracy&quot;, where decisions are made by whoever shows up and makes the effort required to implement them.<p>We could strive for a gerontocracy, in which the oldest members — perhaps by length of membership rather than by physical age — make the collective decisions.<p>We could strive for a high-school clique, where the decisions are made by whoever is most popular.<p>We could strive for a plutocracy, where the decisions are made by whoever is wealthiest, or who donates the most.<p>Given these alternatives, it seems to me that when anarchy and consensus demand unacceptable tradeoffs, the least undesirable alternative is meritocracy.  In meritocracy, the decisions are made by the <i>best<\/i> members of the group, according to some measure of merit that seems worthwhile to the group; in a community of intellectual practice, this usually amounts to some kind of knowledge and skill, seasoned with judgment and perhaps a guess about aptitude.  If they are the wisest members, then they will make the best decisions.  The greatest foolishness is to subject the wise to the government of the foolish.  If some of the foolish and ignorant currently are so simply because they have not had the opportunity to learn, we can best remedy that by guiding them to learn from the wise, not by putting the foolish and ignorant in charge.<p>Of course, meritocracy as an ideal cannot be reached, only striven for; but it is a better ideal to strive for than a high-school clique, a gerontocracy, or a plutocracy.<p>Which of these are the campaigners against meritocracy hoping for?"],"time":["2020-01-18 16:06:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Aqueous"],"id":[22085273],"kids":{},"parent":[22076348],"text":["am i the only one who thinks it’s a good thing that his Linux example was shorter than the other two and required less calling into hyper-specific API functionality?"],"time":["2020-01-18 17:31:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dscpls"],"id":[22083334],"kids":[22083616],"parent":[22076348],"text":["Awesome talk.

In my   humble understanding of Bayesian reasoning the argument to defend any prior is that with enought data the learning method converges to the real distribution, so if the result of any learning method depends heavily of any prior assumption then that assumption is crucial and in no way can it be taken randomly.  On the other hand, it is well known that deep learning can learn any random model, so in the end I think all of this is about the bias-variance trade off. If your prior has an infinite number of adjustable parameters (zero bias) then the variance becomes infinite ( your result will depend and becomes equal to the training set).<p>So in practice one should choose the prior with the minimum number of parameters (bias) that shows a good learning performance on the available training set.<p>Anyway, trying to measure how a prior generalizes or not in BNN seems to be another way of thinking about bias-variance, if there is more than this, I would like to know."],"time":["2020-01-18 13:02:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bjornsing"],"id":[22085450],"kids":[22085996],"parent":[22082860],"text":["Lack of good priors is definitely a weak spot for BNNs.

If you personally believe that exploring this space of priors (similar to exploring the space of architectures or hyperparameters) is particularly promising, then that is a good reason to keep working on BNNs.<p>Isn&#x27;t this overstating it a bit... Making the network Bayesian (even if the priors are generalization-agnostic) still bought us something: after training we have a posterior distribution over weights that contains <i>both<\/i> weights that generalize and weights that don&#x27;t generalize. That&#x27;s better than being unlucky and only having weights that don&#x27;t generalize at the end of training. I&#x27;m not saying this advantage is easy to achieve in practice, or benefit from. But it&#x27;s not nothing.<p>Also Bayesian inference as a framework has a distinct advantage over the usual aimless architectural twiddling that so much &quot;research&quot; seems to focus on: it&#x27;s intellectually&#x2F;mathematically sound."],"time":["2020-01-18 17:58:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["psv1"],"id":[22084626],"kids":[22084825,22085055,22085447,22084780,22084763,22084711],"parent":[22082860],"text":["The paragraph beginning with &quot;Let’s consider how we might apply the Bayesian framework...&quot; where he introduces the notation is a great example of everything I hate about mathematical notation.

The authors admit themselves that it is pure speculation. They present a speculative class of generalization-agnostic priors, speculate that commonly used priors might belong to this class, and then speculate about why we haven&#x27;t observed commonly used priors belonging to this class even though they speculatively might belong to this class. This argument is not very convincing, to say the least.<p>Generalizability is a function of both the network structure and the priors. Non-Bayesian networks without priors can be seen as pseudo-Bayesian networks with (improper) flat priors. The use of independent priors that are unimodal at zero, like the independent normal priors mentioned in the article, will tend to shrink weights toward zero, which makes the function smoother. Smoother functions tend to generalize better (measuring generalizability as the gap between in-sample and out-of-sample error). The classic bias-variance trade-off is that they will generally perform worse in-sample and may also perform worse out-of-sample. Heuristically, if you take any neural network and make it Bayesian by putting priors on the weights, it will (averaging over datasets) generalize not worse than the original network. It may have worse absolute performance.<p>The authors also argue that we can&#x27;t be confident in the uncertainties from BNNs until we have a good theoretical understanding of NN generalization in general. They ignore the possibility of building confidence in the uncertainties, both in general and for any particular network, by empirical observation--the same way we&#x27;ve built confidence in generalization of non-Bayesian NNs, since, as the article points out, we don&#x27;t yet have a good theoretical understanding of NN generalization."],"time":["2020-01-18 18:02:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nafizh"],"id":[22084553],"kids":[22084725,22084765],"parent":[22082860],"text":["Frankly, just solve an important problem with BNNs in a meaningful way with advantages that only BNNs bring (e.g uncertainty estimation) and you won’t have to write blogposts defending them."],"time":["2020-01-18 15:19:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22085620],"kids":{},"parent":[22082860],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-18 18:23:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["tel"],"id":[22085599],"kids":{},"parent":[22082860],"text":["My summary:<p>Neural nets have massive &quot;capacity&quot; which means that, in the face of finite data sets, they can both (a) reasonably represent generalizable and non-generalizable functions and (b) can take on priors which do not distinguish between those classes of functions.

Two years ago, on a whim, I decided to go to the US Go Open. I drastically overestimated my own rating when registering, played too strong of players and lost every game. A good lesson in humility and I made some friends. To lick my battle wounds, I paid a South Korean Go professional for lessons for three months and I feel like that really helped my game."],"time":["2020-01-18 15:53:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Izkata"],"id":[22086155],"kids":[22087805],"parent":[22072193],"text":["Can someone explain this Q&#x2F;A to me?<p>&gt; Is there a safe way to prevent Mirror Go?<p>&gt; A really sad result of talking to God about go would be that there is a way to just play mirror go and win.

This is actually for a generalization of Go that I call MANGO, which stands for MAth Nerd Go<p>Equipment<p>To play Mango, you need the following:<p>• A countable set, I.<p>• A set, C, whose members are subsets of I, each of which contains exactly two members of I.<p>• Three subsets of I, called E, B, and W, such that their union is I, and the intersections of any pair of them is empty.<p>• A real-valued function F, whose domain is I.<p>• A function, T, whose range is {0,1}, that is defined on the real numbers.<p>Definitions<p>• If P is a finite subset of C, and n is a member of I, then the INDEX of n in P is the number of elements of P that contain n.<p>• A finite subset, P, of C is called a PATH if the following conditions are met:<p>1. Each element of I has an index in P of 0, 1, or 2.<p>2. There are exactly two elements of I whose index in P is 1.<p>• An element of I whose index in a path is 1 is called an ENDPOINT of the path.<p>• An element of I whose index in a path is 2 is called an INTERIOR point of the path.<p>• Let S be one of the sets B or W. Let s be a member of S. Let L be the set of all members, e, of E, such that there is a path whose endpoints are s and e, and whose interior points are all in S or E. Let z be the sum over L of F. Then s is ALIVE if T(z) = 1.<p>• The ordered triple (E,B,W) is called the CONFIGURATION.<p>Playing<p>The players must first obtain a Mango set. This consists of agreeing to the sets I, C, E, B, and W, and the functions F and T.<p>The players must agree to an initial score for each player.<p>The players than decide who shall have the first turn. Players alternate turns.<p>On a players turn, that player may do one of two things:<p>• The player may PASS. It then becomes the other players turn.<p>• The player may make a LEGAL MOVE.<p>Note that a player <i>MUST<\/i> either pass or play a legal move. If there is no legal move, the player is forced to pass.<p>A MOVE consists of performing several actions. In the following, if it is Black&#x27;s turn we will use the symbol M to refer to the set B and the symbol H to refer to the set set W. If it is White&#x27;s turn, M will be W and H will be B. Here are the actions that are taken by a player on that players turn:<p>• A member, n, of E is selected.<p>• n is removed from E and added to M.<p>• All members of H that are not alive at the end of the above step are removed from H and placed in E.<p>• All members of M that are not alive at the end of the previous step are removed from M and placed in E.<p>A move is a LEGAL MOVE if the configuration, (E,B,W), produced by the move is new.<p>The game ends when two consecutive turns are passes.<p>Scoring<p>Each player uses the following procedure to compute his score. We will use the symbol M to refer to B if the player is Black, and to refer to W if the player is White.<p>We use the symbol H to refer I-(E union M).<p>The player starts with the initial score agreed upon at the start of the game.<p>For each m in M, the player receives F(m) points.<p>A player receives F(n) points for each member, n, of E for which the following conditions both hold:<p>• There exists a path with n as one endpoint and the other endpoint in M, and which contains no members of H as interior points.<p>• All paths that contain n as one endpoint and a member of H as the other endpoint contain a member of M as an interior point.<p>The player with the most points wins.<p>Example<p>To play ordinary 19x19 Go, with a 5.5 point Komi, the players might agree to the following:<p>• I = { (x,y) | x and y are integers in [1,19] }<p>• C = { {(x,y),(u,v)} | (x,y) and (u,v) are in I, (x-u)^2+(y-v)^2 = 1 }<p>• B = W = {}<p>• E = I<p>• The initial scores are 0 for Black, 5.5 for White.<p>• It is Blacks turn.<p>• F((x,y)) = 1<p>• T(z) = int((z+360)&#x2F;361)<p>To play a Go-like game on an infinite board, the players might agree to this:<p>• I = { (x,y) | x and y are integers }<p>• C = { {(x,y),(u,v)} | (x,y) and (u,v) are in I, (x-u)^2+(y-v)^2 = 1 }<p>• B = W = {}<p>• E = I<p>• Initial scores are Black:0, White:0.<p>• It is Black to move.<p>• F((x,y)) = exp(-x^2-y^2)<p>• T(z) = 1 if z &gt; 1&#x2F;1000, otherwise T(z) = 0"],"time":["2020-01-18 19:40:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Iv"],"id":[22085634],"kids":{},"parent":[22072193],"text":["Unfortunately Lemy is dead"],"time":["2020-01-18 18:25:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pressurefree"],"id":[22085288],"kids":{},"parent":[22072193],"text":["go is where asian nurses think th3y can turn out any american boy where theres no back row we are all equal pawns.

Importantly, most of the sense of purpose we see as being &quot;real&quot; comes from our desire to continue existing, (hence Existentialism.) But, existence is a choice. You simply choose to continue to exist, or you don&#x27;t. (In which case you die.) This is the main insight which makes Nihilism disturbing.

Housing is consuming a bigger and bigger share of median income because growth in housing is not keeping up with growth in income of the top tiers of the population, who can afford to pay disproportionately more than the median, and the trend is accelerating. While it&#x27;s true that increasing supply would help relieve some of the pressure, it would have to skyrocket to keep up with the meteoric rise in income of the top 10% of the population.

I never put my articles behind the paywall; my aim in writing is not to get paid, and I don&#x27;t put them up for curation because I don&#x27;t have an explicit goal of increasing my readership.<p>I&#x27;m also a Medium member, because I do think we need ways of paying for content, and paying for good content (the curation part). Maybe Medium&#x27;s model is not the best way to do that, but I&#x27;d rather support a company that&#x27;s trying to find the right balance than declare that all content should be free."],"time":["2020-01-18 19:37:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["swiftcoder"],"id":[22086065],"kids":[22086143],"parent":[22085649],"text":["Almost all Medium articles can still be viewed in incognito Firefox (you get &quot;1 free article&quot; in each new incognito session).<p>The gradual paywalling of the web continues apace, however.
