They&#x27;ve done a mostly brilliant job in creating a very minimalistic Civ-style 4x game. Has two modes: a 30 turn game in which the player with the highest score wins. Building wonders and temples gives more points than conquest, so that mode is a very stripped down version of a cultural victory goal. And then there&#x27;s the free-for-all mode, with no turn limitations and the only possible victory is conquest. I mostly play the latter.<p>There&#x27;s a simple tech tree. Diplomacy is done in an interesting way, and I wish more games would emulate it. There&#x27;s no direct negotiations, relationship scores, or anything like that. Instead, you have to measure how they feel about you by the way they act. They give you a greetings when you first meet. If they laugh at you or are suspicious, then they&#x27;ll probably attack immediately. If they worship you or condescendingly pat you on the head, then they won&#x27;t attack for a while.<p>And this is also built on by judging them based on further actions. If you move a unit adjacent to theirs, and they don&#x27;t attack it, then you know they&#x27;re trustworthy for a time. And you can subtly manipulate their feelings towards you by doing things like not counter-attacking even when they&#x27;re attacking you. This is useful in a multi-front war when you&#x27;re losing. You can make the decision to concentrate an offensive on one front when your defenses can possibly hold on a second front. If the enemy isn&#x27;t hellbent on your destruction, they&#x27;ll possibly just stop attacking and do something else. If you accurately guess that they hate another nation more than they hate you, then attacking the hated nation will get them to consider you acceptable. It&#x27;s a bunch of big gambles and an interesting ones. Judging the other nations&#x27; attitudes towards you by intuition alone.<p>That definitely adds a little nuance to the conquer-the-world bits. Most games are over in 30 minutes or less, though occasionally they stretch out when you&#x27;re evenly matched.

A popular alternative is the shift-key mod that fattire mentioned, which requires soldering of a wire to one of the paddle ports.<p>The lack of support is because the company was working on the Apple III (1980), which it expected would quickly obsolete the II series. The III has built-in 80-column text and full lowercase support, at both the character-font and physical-keyboard levels. Apple had incentive to not make the II too attractive.<p>Neither Woz nor anyone else at Apple expected that a) the III would quickly fail, and b) the II series would remain Apple&#x27;s bread and butter. Without the III&#x27;s distraction the II+ would surely have had built-in lowercase software and hardware support, or there would have been another II around 1981 with such. As it were, the III took up so much of Apple&#x27;s resources that the Apple IIe did not appear until 1983, by which time the IBM PC had surpassed the II series."],"time":["2020-09-10 21:23:33"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["robterrell"],"id":[24435475],"kids":{},"parent":[24433135],"text":["When I was a kid, I used to buy EEPROMs at the local electronics store and burn them with the Apple ][ lower-case characters.

You have to provide an email address when setting up LE exactly for this reason. The only explanation I can think of for why the author wouldn&#x27;t have received an email is that they did not execute a renew check for their certificate in the three months leading up to the change of service, which is going straight against LE&#x27;s guidelines (you should check more often, exactly for this reason).

However, the assumption that the entire host OS needs to update just to use a new piece of software is simply wrong. Things like Docker and LXC make it trivial to run newer software without upgrading the entire system. It also forces the software into a contained space to prevent the catastrophic failure the author had to deal with before.\nFrom what I can tell from a Shodan check for this domain, the author still seems to be running Ubuntu 14 (which went EOL last year). That probably explains why the author is afraid that they will need to upgrade their server. However, if you&#x27;re running on a software stack whose LTS support has already been dropped, you&#x27;re just postponing the inevitable by not planning an upgrade plan already. Blaming Let&#x27;s Encrypt for potentially not supporting a platform nobody else supports is a silly excuse.<p>I agree that Let&#x27;s Encrypt has its issues.

So cheap, in fact, that it’s too good to be true. In reality, all flash memory is riddled with defects — without exception. The illusion of a contiguous, reliable storage media is crafted through sophisticated error correction and bad block management functions. This is the result of a constant arms race between the engineers and mother nature; with every fabrication process shrink, memory becomes cheaper but more unreliable. Likewise, with every generation, the engineers come up with more sophisticated and complicated algorithms to compensate for mother nature’s propensity for entropy and randomness at the atomic scale.<p>These algorithms are too complicated and too device-specific to be run at the application or OS level, and so it turns out that every flash memory disk ships with a reasonably powerful microcontroller to run a custom set of disk abstraction algorithms. Even the diminutive microSD card contains not one, but at least two chips — a controller, and at least one flash chip (high density cards will stack multiple flash die).&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;The embedded microcontroller is typically a heavily modified 8051 or ARM CPU. In modern implementations, the microcontroller will approach 100 MHz performance levels, and also have several hardware accelerators on-die.<p><i>Amazingly, the cost of adding these controllers to the device is probably on the order of $0.15-$0.30<\/i>,<p>particularly for companies that can fab both the flash memory and the controllers within the same business unit. It’s probably cheaper to add these microcontrollers than to thoroughly test and characterize each flash memory chip, which explains why managed flash devices can be cheaper per bit than raw flash chips, despite the inclusion of a microcontroller.<p>The downside of all this complexity is that there can be bugs in the hardware abstraction layer, especially since every flash implementation has unique algorithmic requirements, leading to an explosion in the number of hardware abstraction layers that a microcontroller has to potentially handle. The inevitable firmware bugs are now a reality of the flash memory business, and as a result it’s not feasible, particularly for third party controllers, to indelibly burn a static body of code into on-chip ROM.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;From the DIY and hacker perspective, our findings indicate a<p><i>potentially interesting source of cheap and powerful microcontrollers for use in simple projects.<\/i><p>An Arduino, with its 8-bit 16 MHz microcontroller, will set you back around $20.<p><i>A microSD card with several gigabytes of memory and a microcontroller with several times the performance could be purchased for a fraction of the price.<\/i><p>While SD cards are admittedly I&#x2F;O-limited, some clever hacking of the microcontroller in an SD card could make for a very economical and compact data logging solution for I2C or SPI-based sensors.&quot;"],"time":["2020-09-10 06:05:18"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["saagarjha"],"id":[24429270],"kids":[24432224],"parent":[24428755],"text":["microSD cards are part of the reason why I always amazed at how much stuff we can fit into such a small package."],"time":["2020-09-10 07:49:53"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["synack"],"id":[24428807],"kids":{},"parent":[24428755],"text":["(2013)"],"time":["2020-09-10 06:09:38"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["moonchild"],"id":[24429970],"kids":[24432862],"parent":[24410641],"text":["&gt; since registers are specified in sub-byte nibbles, one needs very good memory and tons of experience to predict what goes where<p>Nope, you just need to use octal instead of hex - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20041117160755if_&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dabo.de:80&#x2F;ccc99&#x2F;www.camp.ccc.de&#x2F;radio&#x2F;help.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20041117160755if_&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dab...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 10:00:00"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["dang"],"id":[24410683],"kids":{},"parent":[24410641],"text":["Discussed a bit at the time: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13938935\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13938935<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-08 19:36:15"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ficklepickle"],"id":[24443918],"kids":{},"parent":[24410641],"text":["I thoroughly enjoyed that.

Three product lines co-existed: Word 1.0 to Word 5.1a[6] for Macintosh, Word 1.0 to Word 2.0 for Windows and Word 1.0 to Word 5.5 for DOS. <\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_Microsoft_Word#Word_for_DOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_Microsoft_Word#Word...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-11 00:45:59"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["ssh_wintermute"],"id":[24439687],"kids":{},"parent":[24420215],"text":["Read it as &quot;Compiling World of Warcraft&quot;, reading first paragraph wondering what the hell does Word has to do with it."],"time":["2020-09-11 08:15:46"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["phendrenad2"],"id":[24440576],"kids":{},"parent":[24420215],"text":["I wonder how much work it would be to compile this in the latest Visual C++.

AFAIK, &quot;sa&quot; is a dialectal variation of &quot;se&quot;.<p>* What would <i>you<\/i> write on a book you have investigated?<p>Con:<p>* What the heck is &#x27;no&#x27;?<p>The hypothesis was met with cold reception on the VMs mailing list and I never cared about it too much but I still find it more credible than the reading in this article.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inamidst.com&#x2F;voynich&#x2F;michitonese\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inamidst.com&#x2F;voynich&#x2F;michitonese<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 19:30:04"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["MFogleman"],"id":[24432227],"kids":[24433663,24435892],"parent":[24416236],"text":["Readers may also find the Copiale cipher[1] interesting.

Illegally, by UK laws, and refuse to be held accountable for that in their own courts. Not that the judge even tries to demand reasonable treatment for Julian Assange from the prosecutor.<p>UK laws are very clear on what should happen in this case: because of the government&#x27;s treatment of Assange the case should be thrown out, because obviously the government has acted illegally against him on MANY occasions, they don&#x27;t even give him his rights INSIDE THE COURTROOM (to talk to his lawyer privately and however much he wants without interference). The government DOES NOT have the right to sue somebody for anything once they have tortured him. Once they have lied about the case, they lose the right to sue. Once they refuse medical aid to a prisoner, they lose the right to sue. They have spied on his communication with his lawyer, again grounds for dismissal. They are obviously not feeding him right, which again would normally disqualify the government&#x27;s case. Or at the very least, warrants a delay in the case with him decently taken care of until he is once again strong and fit enough to stand trial. Note that this is completely independent of the merit of the case itself: the QC in any normal case like this would never be allowed to make their case without fixing these issues first. Some of these reasons for dismissal the judge has seen happen right in front of him with his own eyes.<p>Then there is the fact that the UK government does not have evidence against Assange on this crime (because he violated US law, not UK law), furthermore I do not see how it could -legally- obtain any such evidence.<p>And yet this farce continues. The judge systematically refuses to face issues of fairness of the case and is obviously intimidated by the government.<p>This shows one thing very clearly : the United Kingdom&#x27;s government (the &quot;executive&quot;) has ZERO intention of following through on their commitment to either follow their own laws, respect human rights and has no qualms whatsoever to threaten their own branches of government, when they want to violate laws.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)30383-4&#x2F;fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 15:47:50"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["DiogenesKynikos"],"id":[24431100],"kids":[24431773,24431972,24432057],"parent":[24430207],"text":["The surreal aspect of this is the UK prosecution&#x27;s assertions that the US prosecution is not politically motivated.

They have pretended that America’s First Amendment freedoms shield them from justice. They may have believed that, but they are wrong.<p>&gt; Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value. He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous. He is a fraud—a coward hiding behind a screen.<p>&gt; First, it is high time we called out those who grant a platform to these leakers and so-called transparency activists. We know the danger that Assange and his not-so-merry band of brothers pose to democracies around the world. Ignorance or misplaced idealism is no longer an acceptable excuse for lionizing these demons.<p>&gt; Third, we have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us. To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for.

Maybe this could be fixed in a json extension which allows words to be read as strings of themselves but if you extend json you lose any interoperability. Json also doesn’t have comments.<p>There are some arguments for or against alists&#x2F;plists instead of json “dictionaries”. An obvious point is that only one of these allows for non-string keys. A weak concern I have is about using “the wrong type”, eg if you use an array you sort of imply an ordering, and an object an unordered mapping, so should you put unordered data like a set in an array or should you have a map full of null values?<p>In recent years, languages with tagged unions like haskell or rust have become more popular. I feel like there’s no satisfying way to write such a thing as json (relying on field names to disambiguate is only sometimes possible and feels tricky to read, having an object with a tag field or an array of [tag, value] feels unnatural. With a sexp you can just write it with a list of tag and args but because everything is lists, it doesn’t feel so unnatural.<p>This isn’t related to json vs sexps but having a difference between &quot;123&quot; and 123 in your text format kind of sucks. Either the parser will reject one or go to the trouble of parsing both or there’s a semantic difference between them which feels worse.

The most recent rise in cases, to more than 2,600 a day, is particularly unsettling.<p>One thing the article briefly mentioned but didn&#x27;t really dig into (IMO) is that the peak of 5,451 cases on April 5th is basically a meaningless number and that it is important to try to figure out what the real number should have been.<p>On April 5th, the UK was only doing 16,000 tests a day and had a nearly 40% positive rate for tests. Only very sick people were being tested. That implies that the 5,451 cases detected that day is a vast undercount of the actual number of new cases at that point. It is bad data science to keep reporting that peak case number in comparison with the current case numbers as if it means anything.<p>So how many new cases were there on April 5th? No one knows for sure, but various estimates based on community surveys guess that it was more like 100,000&#x2F;cases per day. That would be a very different graph than what gets attached to every news story.<p>Compare that with now, where the UK is doing ~200k tests a day (over 10x!). We also have much better community survey data now and can estimate that there are about 3,200&#x2F;cases a day right now. The daily testing is picking up the majority of those expected cases.<p>So if you actually compare numbers that are comparable (~100k cases&#x2F;~1000 deaths with ~3k cases&#x2F;~10 deaths), you get a much better idea of what is actually going on.

Maybe It Shouldn’t Be&quot;)<p><i>&gt; The PCR test amplifies genetic matter from the virus in cycles; the fewer cycles required, the greater the amount of virus, or viral load, in the sample. The greater the viral load, the more likely the patient is to be contagious.  This number of amplification cycles needed to find the virus, called the cycle threshold, is never included in the results sent to doctors and coronavirus patients, although it could tell them how infectious the patients are. In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.<p>&gt; ... One solution would be to adjust the cycle threshold used now to decide that a patient is infected. Most tests set the limit at 40, a few at 37. This means that you are positive for the coronavirus if the test process required up to 40 cycles, or 37, to detect the virus. Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk — akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said. Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive, agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. “I’m shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,” she said. A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35, she added. Dr. Mina said he would set the figure at 30, or even less. Those changes would mean the amount of genetic material in a patient’s sample would have to be 100-fold to 1,000-fold that of the current standard for the test to return a positive result — at least, one worth acting on.<\/i><p>Every published &quot;case&quot; should include the PCR cycle threshold to enable statistical analysis."],"time":["2020-09-10 04:41:26"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["lukehutch"],"id":[24427371],"kids":[24427841,24427472],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Because the average of infection has dropped by over 20 years."],"time":["2020-09-10 01:53:44"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["kristianpaul"],"id":[24427672],"kids":{},"parent":[24426131],"text":["So the metrics where misleading because testing was not constant and&#x2F;or performed same way across the same population distribution?"],"time":["2020-09-10 02:37:56"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["laurencerowe"],"id":[24429544],"kids":{},"parent":[24426131],"text":["This article could really do with a discussion of how the positive test rate is increasing over the past month, see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e26349e5-29d4-4797-96ea-a09aac8cd652\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e26349e5-29d4-4797-96ea-a09aac8cd...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-10 08:39:12"],"type":["comment"]},{"by":["pieceofcakedude"],"id":[24428515],"kids":[24428543,24429350],"parent":[24426131],"text":["Because we&#x27;re relying on a test which can barely be trusted.

While low band spectrum (850MHz) has decent penetrating power, the majority of 5G is deployed at ~5GHz and mm-Wave frequencies, where you won&#x27;t get much of any signal through a wall, or even on the other side of the building. This is why so many 5G base stations have to be deployed; the coverage just isn&#x27;t as good. But the improvements in base station handoffs and spectral efficiency will increase a carrier&#x27;s total capacity, even if the end user doesn&#x27;t see a massive benefit.<p>There are scenarios where you might see massive speeds, though. 5G heavily leverages Carrier Aggregation, where a client can connect to multiple channels at once, increasing bandwidth, and beam-forming, where the &quot;shape&quot; of the signal is modified to steer maximum power to the physical location of a client. If you happen to be near a base station with good Signal to Noise Ratio while downloading something large, the base station can allocate multiple channels and use beamforming to finish your download at Gbps speeds and get you off the network faster, freeing up spectrum time for more users at lower SNR&#x27;s and bandwidths.<p>There is potential for much more impactful deployment of 5G cellular in rural areas where there aren&#x27;t many buildings or walls blocking high frequency signal.
