The lack of eye contact shows timidity, embarrassment, shyness, uncertainty and social awkwardness. (Edelmann and Hampson [1]).” Having a camera on top of a monitor creates the appearance that participants are looking down. If you do look up into the camera, you aren’t looking at the other participant’s faces! Our minds are programmed to interpret looking down as gaze avoidance. Seeing someone look down makes them seem disinterested or even dishonest.<p>It is a hard problem to solve. I set up a studio in my office where I have a second monitor and external camera back far enough away so it works. I have looked for solutions and they are generally inaccessible. Room sized immersive systems from Cisco, etc solve it, but they are too expensive for the plebs. I have seen some goofy hacks using see through mirrors and video prompters.

You build a house a brick at a time, and so far you&#x27;re laying a good foundation.<p>I would actually add a lesson or two for you:<p>There is no Perfect Solution. Just because somebody really likes Python, or React, or Rust doesn&#x27;t mean that those are the right languages to use for everything. Each language, framework, or mental-model has its strengths where it will work better than others, and weaknesses where it will not. You are not married to one thing, and no one thing will be the &quot;perfect&quot; solution to all of your problems.<p>Secondly, release.

It is helping me to read, but that&#x27;s because this isn&#x27;t the only tool I use. In Chinese, words are really compound words. For example, <U+718A><U+732B> means panda. But <U+718A> means bear and <U+732B> means cat. This makes these unbounded morphemes, which is different than what we do in the Indo-European languages. And Chinese is composed of radicals that make things harder. <U+679C><U+6C41> is juice, but <U+6C41> is juice. The three ticks on the left are the symbol for water but <U+5341> means 10. The book focuses on the latter cases but you&#x27;d be very confused if you read about the bear cats of China. And these are just the simple examples.

To some extent, the same applies to trying to learn individual characters as opposed to the words they are a part of.<p>I am ethnically Chinese and grew up listening to the language. Unfortunately, I didn’t end up learning the written language that well, so these days I’m working to catch up by learning more advanced vocabulary. The thing that I needed to realize at the outset is that Chinese is actually not much different from English, if you view it at the word level and not the character level. If you stop thinking of words as being a sequence of characters which each have their own meanings, and more as a single unit, the language is a lot easier to learn IMHO.<p>This lesson came a bit late for me. I still have trouble sometimes with words that are similar and share characters in common. I sometimes incorrectly substitute characters within words with synonyms when I can’t come up with the correct one, which renders the whole word meaningless.<p>Don’t get too hung up on characters when learning Chinese.

This seems very possible to me and a very good investment of time at that. After these 6 months you&#x27;ll be free to pursue gaining vocabulary in the form of combining the characters you know into words, pronunciation and listening&#x2F;speaking.<p>That&#x27;s treating language learning as batch job, even though pipelining it would probably make more sense. You don&#x27;t have to first learn all the characters and then all the words and then how to pronounce all the words and then finally you can dare to utter your first sentence.<p>I think it&#x27;s better to do it the other way around: find a sentence you want to say or understand. Look up all the words in that single sentence, their characters and pronunciations, then memorize only those. Then learn another sentence. That way you always have some context for the new knowledge, instead of just treating it as a random collection of facts.<p>If you frontload on characters, it&#x27;s easy to overlearn things you don&#x27;t actually need.

Might try to experiment with a few things going forwards. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.reganmian.net&#x2F;a--chinese\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.reganmian.net&#x2F;a--chinese<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-15 13:16:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["olivernyc"],"id":[23184387],"kids":[23185615,23185026],"parent":[23183936],"text":["Shameless self promotion: I made an app for learning Chinese characters, Noodle Chinese [0].

Maybe the biggest problem is that it completely ignores pronunciation. It does not help you remember the pronunciation and it does not make use of the sound components of the characters. Most characters are composed of one component which hints at the meaning and another which hints at the sound, e.g. <U+9752> is the sound component in <U+60C5><U+6E05><U+8F15><U+8ACB>, all of those are pronounced qing (with different tones). Usually it&#x27;s not that obvious, this is just a good example. The left component in those characters would hint at the meaning.<p>The Heisig method instead creates a mapping between a keyword, which is derived from a single meaning of the character or invented for components which don&#x27;t have a meaning, to the written form of the character using mnemonics. This works well in the beginning but once you reach a more advanced stage where you know how to say something in Chinese but maybe forgot how to write the characters this doesn&#x27;t help you much since the pronunciation is not incorporated into the mnemonics.<p>When you are just starting out and learning all those characters seems like an unmanagable task, the Heisig method can provide a good structure to quickly &quot;learn&quot; many characters (keyword&lt;&gt;writing). It&#x27;s also fun to come up with stories and images. But in the end it can only provide a basic scaffold for learning more meanings, pronunciation, words etc.<p>I even made a small game once using those character decompositions: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jiong3.com&#x2F;pinzi&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jiong3.com&#x2F;pinzi&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-14 22:55:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pixelperfect"],"id":[23185976],"kids":{},"parent":[23183936],"text":["I learned Chinese characters using this method and found it very helpful.

What [YesJapan] does, and does well, is give users an excellent base of Japanese from which to work from. With a base of about 2000 vocabulary words and enough grammar to get by in most situations, the kanji comes secondary as they will then help to start bridge the gaps between the beginner&#x2F;intermediate level and the advanced&#x2F;fluent level.<p>&gt; As far as learning speed goes, there is a fast assimilation of the first 100 kanji. After that, the learning pace levels off to a slow progression until around the 800-1000 kanji point when the pattern recognition starts to kick in, then past 1200 the pace picks back up again until around 2400-3000 where the pace levels off again because at this point the literacy level is of that of a graduate student, and only obscure or rarely used kanji are available for further study. You can judge your kanji learning speed through the first 100 kanji benchmark. It takes one unit of time to learn the first 100 kanji, then about 14-30 units of time to learn the 800-1000, and then another 7-15 units of time to finish off the joyou list (and name kanji). So if it took you 1 month to learn your first 100 kanji it should take you another year to 3 years to learn your next 1000, and then another half a year to a year and a half to finish the list. Again, faster learners will find themselves closer to the earlier stages of the spectrum, while casual learners and slower learners towards the further end of the spectrum.<p>&gt; Another nice benchmark to keep in mind when studying Japanese is that going from a western to asian language (meaning no prior fluency in an asian language) takes 88 weeks (5 hours a day study) or 2200 hours of study to go from 0 to complete fluency. 44 weeks, or about a year of intensive study should put you at around the JLPT 3-2 level, and another 44 weeks to put you at the JLPT 1 level. Again this is assuming 5 hour a day of dedicated language study, so if your study time is less then that, you can plan your progression accordingly. One of the benefits of living in country is that the 5 hours comes a lot easier and quicker then living outside the target country where the material has to be self or externally generated.<p>&gt; In case you were wondering - western languages to other western languages take about 22 weeks (550 hours of intensive study), non-western&#x2F;non-asian languages 44 weeks (1100 hours of intensive study) and asian languages [88 weeks] (2200 hours of intensive study). The other benefit of learning a language in one of the other two language families is that if you decide to learn another language in the same language family (region 1 2 or 3 as described above) it takes only 22 weeks of study.<p>&gt; Which brings about another intersting topic. Korean takes about 52 weeks of intensive study to master from a western language (because their writing is mainly hangul, the necessity to learn a complicated script is lessened, thus easier to learn then chinese or Japanese). Thus learning Korean first, followed by Japanes will only take 74 weeks of study, vs 110 weeks of study going to Japanese first then Korean."],"time":["2020-05-14 22:38:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["du_bing"],"id":[23191195],"kids":{},"parent":[23183936],"text":["We teach Chinese with the best teacher, if you want to learn Chinese, contact us: tarvos21@gmail.com"],"time":["2020-05-15 14:11:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["dkyc"],"id":[23181587],"kids":[23181698,23181646,23181767,23181616],"parent":[23181324],"text":["This is complete nonsense.

Since the 1960s, the Democratic Party in the U.S.has staked out a position as the party of racial liberalism (Carmines and Stimson 1989). Democratic support for civil rights legislation helped the party secure the long-term loyalty of a majority of African American voters, but alienated many of the party’s white voters. This led to Republican gains in new areas of the country, especially the South (Black and Black 2002.)<p>That&#x27;s historical revisionism. Four Civil Rights Acts were passed in the 1950s and 1960s, plus the Voting Rights Act. Each passed by overwhelming majorities in the House Republican Caucus, and much narrower majorities in the House Democratic Caucus. In fact, the 1960s were a time of the Democratic Party toeing the line on civil rights to appease southern Democrats. Indeed, while people talk about Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Southern Strategy,&quot; Nixon won the South only because George Wallace. Wallace, running on a segregationist platform, split the Democratic vote with Hubert Humphrey. Wallace outright won 5 deep southern states, and beat Humphrey in several others.

It’s also interesting that this, at least from my outsider perspective, is also how YC operates - they have a particular ethos, norms of behavior etc, they admit people who they think are consistent with those norms, and then enforce those norms: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;ethics&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;ethics&#x2F;<\/a><p>I think there’s an interesting analogy with professional sports.

From there you can focus on slower organic growth.  Examples: YouTube and MySpace both began as dating sites.  YouTube focused on getting people to upload introduction videos of themselves.  Once they had accumulated a number of people who were willing to film themselves they pivoted over to content creation.  Similarly, MySpace was a very crude dating site that allowed people to customize their page.  Brad Greenspan was a serial investor who bought up a large number of tiny dating sites.  He cannibalized all the revenue from those sites to promote MySpace as a &quot;free&quot; dating site.  They had millions of users coming from other sites.<p>reddit was promoted heavily on Hacker News and focused on a tech crowd at first.  Paul Graham threw his endorsement behind the platform a few times and that also helped interest people in checking it out.<p>For my successful community sites, I&#x27;ll just mention one experience - I had built a Q&amp;A site from scratch.  It was finally done one Sunday night and I decided to go to bed.  There were eleven posts on the site, mostly from myself, but also a couple from friends I&#x27;d asked to test the site for me.  It was obvious there was no community there.  I bought a single ad - for $10 - at $0.01 CPC on a Quiz site, then went to bed.  My intention was not to launch the site, but to throw a little real traffic at it and see if any bugs cropped up that neither I nor my friends had found.  When I got to work in the morning and had finished catching up on my emails I decided to check the site and see if anyone had posted.  There were over 100 posts and people were using the site exactly as intended.  Not only that but there was about $0.50 in ad revenue already, meaning my monthly run rate was net-positive from day one.  I had hit upon a great fit between people who were already interested in asking and answering questions (the quiz site I advertised on) and my product.<p>In each case I&#x27;m familiar with, the formula was to find an existing audience that had an interest in the product in question and bring them on-board ASAP.  If the internet were brand-new and no community websites yet existed I would build one by building a non-community website that provided a useful service, and building a community around that once I have captive eyeballs.  In other words, to belabor the point: I would start with an existing community."],"time":["2020-09-11 18:50:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulHoule"],"id":[24443922],"kids":{},"parent":[24442569],"text":["YCombinator was a successful startup accelerator,  then built HN.<p>The folks behind Stack Overflow ran a popular blog (Coding Horror)<p>In those cases they had a smarter-than-average population that had some shared interest (e.g. &quot;COMM-unity&quot;.)<p>When those sites came around,  Google was recognizable as what it is today,  but Facebook was not.

The means that you really can&#x27;t do much software development in the true sense because just getting programmings to run and run consistently take a lot of mental effort.<p>Years 3-5 are the intermediate stage where you can solve most common problems without having to think about programming too much, but programming itself is still a source of friction when it comes to completely projects. At this stage you begin to think more about how to structure larger and larger projects, learning some clever techniques, and understanding some of the more specialized techniques in your language of choice.<p>Expertise happens when you don&#x27;t have to think about programming any more and are exclusively concerned with larger design problems.

Overwhelmed by the wide variety of skills, being a software engineer in a professional environment requires way more than coding skills. You need to be adequate with GIT, Programming Languages, Unit Testing, Various Frameworks, CI, Deployments, Team Dynamics, and more.

Lack of methodology in learning, a lot of people rely on their feelings to help decide what to do next.

Having a plan for what you need to learn and the order you want to learn it in can be tremendously helpful for growing your career.<p>4.

Making your self a checklist of steps can be very helpful for taking the stress and guesswork out of your day. For instance, step 1 pick up a ticket and understand the requirements. Step 2 pull from the git repo and run all tests. Step 3 Right down a development plan. Step 4 write code. step 5 write unit tests. step 6 submit a pull request.

That takes bravery and you&#x27;ve started a really interesting thread. I have a couple of suggestions as someone who is self taught in various fields, and the world of programming and music have some bizarre parallels.<p>First, you might be wrong. You may be fine, and just need to back to fundamentals. This is <i>very<\/i> common in many complex fields. I have gone through multiple rounds of taking stuff back to beginning level. I&#x27;m doing it all over again right now in programming. I highly, highly, highly recommend reading &quot;How To Design Programs&quot;. Putting time in to truly and deeply master the very basics as well as you can is the road to mastery in anything complex, and it&#x27;s never too late to do this.<p>Second, you may not be totally wrong, you may be slightly off target on how you like to think best! There are a lot of people out there who like computing and programming, but discover that really, they are better off as someone in a related field, or that they like a different kind of coding. In my experience, the best low-level coders are often terrible architects (very high level software design), because they can&#x27;t imagine being wrong! Also, some people naturally gravitate for whatever reason to sysadmin&#x2F;dev-ops style stuff, or security testing, or embedded electronics. Or perhaps you have better than average ability to understand how people make software and would be an excellent development manager.<p>So my advice is to take a two-pronged approach:<p>A) Go back to fundamentals and learn new languages, both high and low level.<p>B) Experiment with related areas and see if one of them makes you say &quot;ah damn this is what I should have been doing&quot;.<p>And C) give yourself like a good year or two to figure this out.

These are some thoughts that might be helpful.<p>1) I&#x27;ve known several great programmers who didn&#x27;t have formal education and that definitely exacerbated their impostor syndrome. Try to be easy on yourself; as others have said here, it takes time to build up your skillsets and it&#x27;s super easy to compare yourself with someone who seems to know more.<p>2) Maybe you aren&#x27;t on the team that could help you grow the most. It sounds like you can hammer out code that does the thing you want to do. Going beyond that is about judgement and patterns and processes and experiences. The right team can really help you grow those skills. Does your team do code review? Do they do pair programming [0]? Maybe some sort of mentor relationship would be helpful?<p>3) I generally find solutions are easier to understand when I&#x27;ve personally struggled with the problem they are trying to solve. Look at code for problems you are familiar with and try to figure out what patterns&#x2F;OOP concepts are being used in the solution. When you can wrap your mind around the problem, you can learn more from solutions.<p>4) Do you have an interest in the people&#x2F;product side of software development? \nIf so, you could try to move into a neighboring field.\nI&#x27;ve got a notion that a strong technical background would make it easier for product&#x2F;project managers to do their jobs.<p>5) You don&#x27;t have to be the best; most of us aren&#x27;t :) if you enjoy the work you are doing and your employer and team approves of your work, then maybe you shouldn&#x27;t stress about it? Work to improve your skills for the fun of it :)<p>6) Maybe pick a single language and focus on getting great at it. Preferably one that enables you to work on a passion project.

Many people are quite bad at learning because the process is counterintuitive. People mistake the feeling of mastery for learning, and it&#x27;s not at all a productive feeling (if you want to learn; it&#x27;s great at building self-confidence). My advice:<p>1. Focus. Acknowledge that you have surface level familiarity in many things, but that nobody can or should go deep in everything. Pick a language you&#x27;re using professionally, and focus on that. If you don&#x27;t currently have a job, try to pick something with broad applicability like Python or Golang. Also eliminate distractions: email popups, SMS, facebook, HN&#x2F;reddit, Slack, all must go while you focus.<p>2. Study. Now that you have a language you want to build expertise on, study it methodically. Start an Anki[1] deck for it (and run through reviews daily) -- this is your tool to &quot;try smarter&quot;. Get a set of beginner books from the library&#x2F;amazon. Run through a codecademy or similar online course series. Make new Anki cards as you go. When you&#x27;ve finished a book, start working on the easiest online problems you can find online. Sort Leetcode[2] by acceptance rate -- many make the mistake of trying them in order, or by difficulty tag, and get frustrated when they hit a stumbling block. Learn from their failures. Once you solve a problem, review how others solved it and try to understand their code: did they use arrays or objects? did they use recursion? obscure syntax you need to look up? Which code base is cleaner, and easier to read?<p>3. Pace yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint. Improvement will be slow, and it will not feel good. If you have a job, I&#x27;d limit myself to 1 hour a day on professional improvement. If you&#x27;re searching for work, I&#x27;d still limit myself to 4h daily. I try to spend about 10 minutes a day on Anki, just to retain what I&#x27;ve learned. People spend 4 years of their life on this stuff, after all.<p>4. Advanced study. As you advance beyond the material in step 2, look for conference talks at your level. Read through the official documentation. Start browsing StackOverflow or similar for your language tag[3]. Keep making Anki cards and reviewing them. Maybe pick up a CS textbook to shore up theoretical shortcomings and study 10 pages a day (textbooks tend to be denser reads than other reading material, so again, pace yourself.). Start with freshman undergrad stuff like Data Structures -- nearly universal in application and immediately useful. Or since you feel anxious about it, a book on OOP.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ankiweb.net&#x2F;about<\/a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leetcode.com<\/a>\n[3]: Little known secret: the most viewed questions aren&#x27;t the ones with the most votes, they&#x27;re the ones that novices google the most.

I would welcome more.<p>The author is correct that C++&#x27;s greatest weakness, and one that can never be fixed, is that other code can do things that violate the model your code depends on. It is not enough to have your own discipline, the rest of the system needs to observe the same discipline at interfaces. And there are many possible, correct disciplines to choose from.<p>Rust imposes one of the possible disciplines for memory-object management that enforces one set of non-negotiable tradeoffs and costs. You the programmer are relieved from choosing a discipline or discovering what was chosen, and from discovering that two subtly different ones were used in different parts of the system.<p>Memory-object management is not the only place where systems need a consistent discipline, but others can often be referred to it; and every program needs at least the one, besides any others.<p>Arguably the reason Common Lisp never took off is that practically nothing can be assumed about any other part of a system. C++ has enough forced consistency to drive adoption, but might better have had more. C++ has a lot more tooling than Rust does to capture semantics in libraries, so the library is the natural boundary for a discipline, and it is not unusual to find more than one safely co-existing, but it is also not unusual to find them not safely encapsulated, and in conflict.<p>Ultimately there is no substitute for sound design.

PMTUD remains the proper way to handle things, or something like PLPMTUD if you&#x27;re not willing to assume IP. Some things create path MTU black holes, commonly firewalls but also APs. APs can be particularly troublesome because nowadays they commonly don&#x27;t terminate the wireless encryption, the controller at the other end of the tunnel does, which means they can&#x27;t inject an ICMP to let the client know that packet is too big. MSS saves the day (for TCP) but otherwise the AP can either drop or fragment at the encap layer transparent to the client. I&#x27;ve yet to see a system that delivers the fragmented tunnel packet so the controller can ICMP back that the packet is too big but it&#x27;d be the cleanest thing in that scenario.<p>Also if you&#x27;re going to limit tunnel size arbitrarily beforehand probably best to make sure the resulting packet ends up being able to fit into 1428. A lot of products use a 1300 &quot;inside&quot; MTU for this (and similar) reasons. 1400 + auto IPsec calc will lead to trouble in this scenario.<p>Don&#x27;t drop &quot;inside&quot; MTU below 1280 in IPv6 networks.

American companies have built a lot of cool science fair projects that get lots of media attention, but minimal real-world deployment – from light shows to food delivery.  We also design a lot of interesting low-volume consumer drones, but most of them lean heavily on Chinese R&amp;D and then go on to have their product manufactured in China.  Yes, I know, I am fully aware I did the same thing years ago with Oculus.&quot;<\/i><p>He&#x27;s not wrong.  A few years ago, I spent $399 for a point-and-shoot digital camera that took decent photos under decent lighting conditions.  It supported resolutions up to 1920x1080 or so.  DJI just sold me a camera for the same price that takes better photos.  Also, it takes videos.  Also, it fucking <i>flies<\/i>.  It can fly for over 20 minutes, shoot a 1080p or 2.7K video two miles away, and find its own way back home.  Uncle, already.<p>In a completely-unrelated anecdote, some <i>other<\/i> people in China just sold me a 3 GHz vector network analyzer with performance and features comparable to a $10,000 portable VNA model from Keysight.  It cost $70, batteries included.  (And in an amusing bit of irony, its Chinese designer is currently upset because some other Chinese people used its CC-licensed design and GPL-licensed firmware to undercut her own Tindie offering.)<p>Not many people will find the second example very meaningful, but quite a few people can appreciate the first one.  If you haven&#x27;t played with a quad yet and your toy budget can accommodate $399 (really $499, because you want the &#x27;Fly More&#x27; kit), consider setting aside a Saturday afternoon to goof around with a Mavic Mini.

It helps to have a recommendation, but roles are rarely filled by asking the team who they would most like to work with an approaching them. Normally companies advertise roles and try to use some kind of standardized process. So CV writing and interview technique are critical.<p>Promotions often happen because people apply for the role up when it is advertised competitively. My observation is that people succeed at this by focusing on performing against their current objectives, not being a problem, requesting training, and picking up the tasks relevant to their current role that will be on the job description for the next one up. That next role up might be in another team so your own teams favor matters less. The main thing is not to have been a problem to management and to present yourself well during the application process.<p>I think external upwards moves are more likely to be powered by skill at believable exaggeration, and internal promotions by rules compliance and consistent ambition driven box ticking.<p>Finally, some people get promoted because management need someone they trust to do that job now, at least temporarily. This happens when a new project team is created and someone is told they are in charge of it, or someone quits and their duties are reallocated to an immediate report.

I found another with my name, etc.)<p>I used Zazzle to print a custom post card for each location with a picture of the location on one side, and a large block letter on the other.

It would seem like a postcard I might send her from that location if I&#x27;d actually been there.<p>I also found a set of 50-state stamps the USPS had previously issued on eBay, and used the correct state&#x27;s stamp for its postcard.<p>Finally, I round-tripped each postcard through its respective post office by mailing it inside an envelope addressed to the postmaster at that post office along with a note to the post master:<p><i>Dear Postmaster:<p>I am mailing my sister 30 postcards from 30 towns for her 30th birthday. I have enclosed a postcard, which I ask be hand-cancelled with a postmark from your town.
