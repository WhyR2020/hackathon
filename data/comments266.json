Google really had no choice here, and it&#x27;s actually a problem for them that this is coming out now via a blog post by the fired employee and not by their own admission.<p>Google is in a phenomenally trusted position in the world. Chrome is the most popular browser. It auto updates silently and continuously, as do installed extensions. Vast swathes of information and infrastructure is accessed via web apps. We tend to forget that browser makers have access to all our authentication tokens and can do whatever they like.<p>Put simply, given the level of web dependence in our lives and infrastructure, those who can modify browsers are practically gods. The same goes for operating system developers of course.<p>We don&#x27;t think about this because our level of trust in those developers and the corporations they work for is extremely high and deservedly so: after decades of using operating systems and web browsers they&#x27;ve never violated that trust. In fact they&#x27;ve reinforced it by rolling out encryption to block rogue government departments who were exploiting the lack of it, they&#x27;ve invested heavily in security to lock out hackers and done many other great things.<p>But trust is hard to build and easy to destroy. What if browser makers stopped being so trustworthy? What if they started to become convinced of their own superior morality, the correctness of their political judgements, the importance of their role in the world? What could they do?<p>They could use SafeBrowsing to arbitrarily censor the web.<p>They could edit out individual comments, rewrite news stories, insert their own views into the middle of documents purporting to be neutral. They could distort your view of the web at will.<p>They could violate our privacy at will by linking our identities together and then publishing what we&#x27;ve written, they could publish browsing logs, they could take over any accounts we have and use them for whatever purposes they like, they could feed sensitive information to political enemies to give themselves plausible deniability, they could even frame us by posting illegal material under those accounts. It&#x27;d just look like someone phished the password.<p>They could do many other things we never even considered.<p>Google absolutely needed to go nuclear on this employee. The news has been filled over the past years with stories about Googler&#x27;s increasingly hard-left political activism. As a consequence some users and even politicians have started to wonder if Google Search is trustworthy, but their trust in browser developers is so total, so blind, the world hasn&#x27;t yet taken the next mental leap and started to wonder if Chrome is. Mozilla is hardly in a better position: it&#x27;s funded by Google and literally just down the road from them. If the integrity of the Chrome devs start to be doubted, few will consider Mozilla devs to be radically different.<p>Inserting political JavaScript via browser security mechanisms targeted at Googlers, even if it may <i>seem<\/i> fairly harmless in this case, is a very problematic situation and a slippery slope Google simply cannot afford to go near. It raises fundamental questions, like are Google&#x27;s internal procedures robust? What else might have been slipped through code review already? Are Google employees only adjusting their own tools or did some already start to abuse their access to people&#x27;s private data and systems? How many of them feel the ends justify the means when dealing with political causes they feel passionately about?<p>How safe is Chrome, really?"],"time":["2019-12-17 17:15:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["downdown4eva"],"id":[21813679],"kids":{},"parent":[21813619],"text":["More like fired for pulling a stupid stunt that she&#x27;s now trying to turn into a press release."],"time":["2019-12-17 15:26:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["buboard"],"id":[21813717],"kids":{},"parent":[21813619],"text":["Google getting a taste of ad injection.

As long as the trash dominates listings, better manufacturers and vendors seem to begin to find it difficult to keep the trash out of their own supply chains.<p>A personal example is search in Amazon on &quot;lightning splitter&quot;, for the Lightning adapters that split a single Lightning port into one for charging and one for audio.<p>This entire category is awash in pretty much all the sketch activity we talk about here on HN. It&#x27;s easy to find an example where questions were asked about completely different products, and the vendor subsequently swapped the product in the listing for the Lightning splitter. Also easy to find reviews in broken English posted within 1-2 days of each other. The litany goes on.<p>That&#x27;s not the interesting part. What I find interesting is Belkin, whose business model seems to tend to be source from about the same as these vendors in China, slap on a bunch of marketing with some so-so-but-not-spectacular QA and support, and marks up the result 5-800%, is themselves caught up in this. Their own offering in this category is complete trash just like all the other listings, based upon reviews and first-hand experience, with exactly the same failure mode (works for 1-6 months, then power and&#x2F;or audio connection breaks down).<p>Power banks seemed to go through the same sketchy phase, which I finally gave up upon and just started only buying Anker brand. Even though they weren&#x27;t the absolute best, they were good enough, and I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get utter trash out of the box.<p>I have long suspected this entire state of affairs suits Amazon just fine. The more product categories that trash themselves like this, the more of an opening it gives Amazon to completely vertically integrate the entire supply chain for that category under their Basics label, and shove aside most&#x2F;all of the trash vendors to the loud acclaim of consumers, who get so sick of the trash experience that they welcome the creeping Amazon monopolization with open arms and lusty cheers. I wouldn&#x27;t at all be surprised if Amazon rolls out tiered-quality offerings beyond Basics as this effort takes hold.<p>One possible way that might frustrate Amazon&#x27;s efforts in this direction is more companies like Anker spot these opportunities (with a basic business model being &quot;don&#x27;t be completely toxic to your customers, build a reasonable product with reasonable support at a reasonable price point&quot;) and fill the empty niches, then exert absolutely tyrannical channel control. The manufacturer claims the only authorized Amazon (or even a whole set of online platforms) authorized channel sales to avoid commingling counterfeits, and comes down like a ton of bricks on anyone that tries to mom-and-pop resell online on staked-out e-commerce platforms.<p>This is a live economics and marketing exercise in the power and utility of branding. Could be some interesting needs and solutions for supply chain verification coming out of this as well, with subtle, secret but cheaply-implemented, manufacturer-designed watermarks built into the products to catch authorized resellers trying to sneak in cheap counterfeits amongst their legit stock to illicitly boost their margins."],"time":["2019-12-17 19:43:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Trias11"],"id":[21817031],"kids":[21817964],"parent":[21815215],"text":["+1 for Costco."],"time":["2019-12-17 19:42:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jostmey"],"id":[21816673],"kids":[21818152],"parent":[21815215],"text":["I RECEIVED AN OPENED BOX OF BABY FORMULA FROM AMAZON.<p>I&#x27;ve basically stopped using amazon for all but a few purchases I can&#x27;t get elsewhere.

There are better build systems, like Bazel, that are faster and produce consistent, reproducible results.<p>Make&#x27;s lack of hermeticity means that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally craft a Makefile where there are dependencies between targets that are not explicitly listed in the Makefile. When this happens, you can&#x27;t be sure that when you change an input file and run `make`, all the dependent targets will be rebuilt. This means you often have to `make clean; make` to make sure that things get correctly rebuilt.<p>Bazel also supports things like caching of artifacts so that when you build, switch branches, build, switch back, and build, it can re-use built artifacts from build #1 so that build #3 becomes a no-op. With remote caching, this can happen across computers and users; when user 1 builds at SHA 123, and then user 2 later checks out SHA 123 and does a build, user 2&#x27;s build will simply copy the cached artifacts over the network and do no local work.

They are very tempting, because they follow naturally from interactive exploration.  You see yourself writing a command a lot, and think &quot;I&#x27;ll just paste that into a Makefile&quot;.  Now you don&#x27;t have to remember the command anymore.<p>But the problem is that building software is a lot more than just running a bunch of commands.  The commands represent solutions to problems, but if the solutions aren&#x27;t good enough, you just make more problems for yourself.<p>The biggest problems I&#x27;ve had with Makefile-based builds are getting everyone using the repository the right version of dependencies, and incrementality.  A project I did at work involved protos, and it was great when I was the only person working on it.  I had a Makefile that generated them for Go and Typescript (gRPC-Web) and usually an incremental edit to a proto file and a re-run of the Makefile resulted in an incremental update to the generated protos.  Perfect.  Then other people started working on the project, and sometimes a simple proto change would regenerate the entire proto.  Sometimes the protos would compile, but not actually work.  The problem was that there is a hidden dependency of the proto compiler, protoc-gen-(go|ts), and the language-specific proto API version that controls the output of the proto compilation process.  Make has no real way to say &quot;when I say protoc, I mean protoc from this .tar.gz file with SHA256:abc123def456...&quot;  You just kind of yolo it.  Yolo-ing it works fine for one person; even if your dev machine gets destroyed, you&#x27;ll probably get it working again in a day or two.  As soon as you have four people working on it, every hidden dependency destroys a day of productivity.  I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>Meanwhile, you can see how well automated dependency management systems work.  Things like npm and go modules pretty much always deliver the right version of dependencies to you.  With go, the compiler even updates the project definition for you, so you don&#x27;t even have to manage files.  It just works.  This is what we should be aiming for for everything.<p>I have also not had much luck with incremental builds in make.  Some projects have a really good set of Makefiles that usually results in an edit resulting in a changed binary.  Some don&#x27;t!  You make a change, try out your binary, and see that it decided to cache something that isn&#x27;t cacheable.  How do you debug it?  Blow away the cache and wait 20 minutes for a full build.  Correctness or speed, choose any 1.  I had this problem all the time when I worked on a buildroot project, probably because I never understood what the build system was doing.  &quot;Oh yeah, just clean out those dep files.&quot;  What even are the dep files?  I never understood how to make it work for me, even after asking questions and getting little pieces of wisdom that seemed a lot like cargo-culting or religion.  Nobody could ever point to &quot;here&#x27;s the function that computes the dependency graph&quot; and &quot;here&#x27;s the function that schedules commands to use all your CPUs&quot;.  The reason is... because it lives in many different modules that don&#x27;t know about each other.  (Some in make itself, some in makefiles, some in the jobs make runs... it&#x27;s a mess.)<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve also worked on projects that use a full build system that tracks every dependency required to build every input.  You start it up, and it uses 300M of RAM to build a full graph.  When it&#x27;s done it maxes out all your CPUs until you have a binary.  You change one file, and 100% of the time, it just builds what depended on that file.  You run it in your CI environment and it builds and the tests pass, the first time.<p>I am really tired of not having that.  I started using Bazel for all my personal projects that involve protocol buffers or have files in more than one language.  The setup is intense, watching your CPU stress the neighborhood power grid as it builds the proto compiler from scratch is surprising, but once it starts working, it keeps working.  There are no magic incantations.  The SHA256 of everything you depend on is versioned in the repository.  It works with traditional go tools like goimports and gopls.  Someone can join your project and contribute code by only installing one piece of software and cloning your repository.  It&#x27;s the way of the future.   Makefiles got us far, but I&#x27;m done.  I am tired of debugging builds.  I am tired of helping people install software.  &quot;bazel build ...&quot; and get your work done."],"time":["2019-12-18 09:51:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["floor_"],"id":[21813120],"kids":{},"parent":[21812656],"text":["If you&#x27;re doing anything other than a unity build (single compilation unit) you&#x27;re doing it wrong."],"time":["2019-12-17 14:17:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zonidjan"],"id":[21811565],"kids":[21811988,21811680,21812391,21812025,21812888,21817243,21812190],"parent":[21810287],"text":["&gt; Recently I saw a tweet where someone mentioned that you can include &#x2F;dev&#x2F;stdin in C code compiled with gcc.

Gödel&#x27;s work had a deep impact on mathematicians&#x27; _philosophical_ views of what they do, but that didn&#x27;t carry down into the actual day to day business of proving theorems.<p>Isn&#x27;t that strange?

This work, advancing precise characterizations of effective, algorithmic computability, was the culmination of intensive investigations into the foundations of mathematics. In the decades since, the theory of computability has moved to the center of discussions in philosophy, computer science, and cognitive science. In this volume, distinguished computer scientists, mathematicians, logicians, and philosophers consider the conceptual foundations of computability in light of our modern understanding. Some chapters focus on the pioneering work by Turing, Gödel, and Church, including the Church-Turing thesis and Gödel&#x27;s response to Church&#x27;s and Turing&#x27;s proposals. Other chapters cover more recent technical developments, including computability over the reals, Gödel&#x27;s influence on mathematical logic and on recursion theory and the impact of work by Turing and Emil Post on our theoretical understanding of online and interactive computing; and others relate computability and complexity to issues in the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of mathematics."],"time":["2019-12-17 18:00:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["darkmighty"],"id":[21819417],"kids":[21820479,21828126],"parent":[21812581],"text":["&gt;One way of describing the Incompleteness Theorems (1931) of the Austrian logician Kurt Gödel is to say that he proved, in the form of a mathematical theorem, that the possibility of a fully automated mathematics can never be realized<p>What Gödel apparently missed (although it&#x27;s hard to tell without going over his writings carefully), is that <i>humans, by the same criterion, can&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; mathematical problems<\/i>.

My mom had a police scanner and it had a button titled &quot;HAM&quot; [sic]. I found a repeater and no more than a few weeks later I was absolutely enthralled and was licensed in 2007.<p>I got a radio, an antenna, installed it, and I was absolutely hooked. It did not matter that the average age of a ham was around 50 or 60, and I was only 15. It was just so much fun and there was so much to do an learn using it. I studied for my General and got it a few months after my first Tech license. A few months after that, I got Extra. All the while, I ran a YouTube channel documenting my experiences.<p>I chose to go to Missouri S&amp;T (formerly University of Missouri - Rolla) because they had a ham radio club (W0EEE). I declined a full ride to Truman State in Chem or CompSci, and went to S&amp;T as undecided engineering. I naturally nestled into EE realizing a lot of the basic circuits knowledge was already covered under the Extra exam. Myself and one other ham became de-facto President and VP of the ham radio club, which we re-grew from near death.<p>I ended up working at an Electromagnetic Compatibility lab for a while, before having a co-op at the Very Large Array radio observatory in NM where I ran cabling, designed antennas, and worked on mitigation of RF interference. My manager specifically sought me out because I was a ham.<p>Acheving full time employment was also a no brainer. I applied to Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, Garmin, Boeing, Honeywell, Black &amp; Veatch, maybe a few more, and had offers from everyone but Garmin (apparently proving my way around a smith chart dedicated to quiz grad students in the off-site interview, but choking at an unannounced op-amp circuit analysis by hand while two managers watched on-site wasn&#x27;t good enough for them!). And now I design antennas for a living! All because of ham radio.<p>Ham radio never ceases to entertain me.

Another is that the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Newport News acquired water rights to nearby creeks long ago, back when nearby jurisdictions were rural counties, so by the time other areas experienced growth, all of their surface water rights were already owned by the oldest cities [1].<p>Caught in a wave of post-war growth, white flight, threatened by annexation, and discontent with having to buy local water from their neighbors, counties in this part of Virginia started becoming cities. In Virginia, cities are independent from counties -- the federal government therefore considers Virginia cities to be county-equivalent -- and cities are protected from annexation by adjacent cities.<p>Counties turned into cities, then merged with an adjacent friendly city to avoid annexation by a rival city; Princess Anne County merged into the City of Virginia Beach; Norfolk County merged with the City of South Norfolk and renamed itself to Chesapeake; Nansemond County changed into a city, then a year and half later merged into the City of Suffolk; the county surrounding the City of Hampton merged back into it; and the City of Newport News eventually merged by mutual agreement with the City of Warwick, even though 6 years prior Warwick changed from a county to a city to avoid that exact fate.<p>After experiencing major growth, Virginia Beach wanted to have a better negotiating position with Norfolk over water supply. It build a long interbasin transfer [1][2] to withdraw water from Lake Gaston on the Roanoke River, adjacent to the North Carolina border. Chesapeake joined as a minority partner. The resulting water is delivered into to Norfolk&#x27;s system, who filters and treats it, and distributes it to Norfolk, Virginia Beach, the most urbanized areas of Chesapeake, and most military bases in the area.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virginiaplaces.org&#x2F;watersheds&#x2F;lakegaston.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virginiaplaces.org&#x2F;watersheds&#x2F;lakegaston.html<\/a> [2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vbgov.com&#x2F;government&#x2F;departments&#x2F;public-utilities&#x2F;about-pu&#x2F;lake-gaston&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vbgov.com&#x2F;government&#x2F;departments&#x2F;public-utilitie...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-18 06:22:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Thorentis"],"id":[21819885],"kids":[21823487,21823444],"parent":[21817680],"text":["It amazes me that these events seem &quot;frequent&quot; when you look at them overall, but then extremely rare when you realise how far apart some of them are (millions and millions of years).

This resulted in a wave of text rippling down the screen, and many complaints that the screen refresh was too slow. The remedy was to scroll the bits already on screen and then redisplay each line from the top. The second implementation was actually slower than the first because we incurred the overhead of scrolling the bits before we even started to display the new text on the screen. However, the perception was that there was an immense increase in speed. We stuck with the second implementation because it increased the overall satisfaction of the user even though it actually decreased the throughput of the product.<p>The commenter is actually subtly wrong about what&#x27;s going on here though (but fortunately does the right thing by focusing on user satisfaction).<p>Without scrolling the bits first there&#x27;s a &quot;wave&quot; artifact.

Mice are still best for manipulators--photo editing, etc. Trackpads are best for consuming content like browsing and reading email.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Keyboarders only think they are faster—I think its because of the sound of the keys ...<p>This might be true, <i>as a generalization<\/i>, but it should be obvious that it doesn&#x27;t apply to everyone. That&#x27;s a bit like me pontificating on how a basketball free-throw should executed. Listening to me or studying my free-throw will reveal <i>nothing<\/i> interesting or important about performing a free-throw. Talk to a professional player, study the players that hit over 90% of their free-throws, but don&#x27;t try to draw conclusions from non-players just making thing up.<p>I can&#x27;t play basketball worth a crap, but I have used computers and their interfaces for over 50 years. All this time I have been programming, and I&#x27;ve programmed on more different systems than I can remember (really).<p>I&#x27;ve used every mainstream word-processor and every mainstream text-editor, often for years at a time. I have owned at least 100 keyboards and 100 mice and trackpads over the years. These are my personal observations.<p>* People are surprisingly good at learning repetitive fine motor skills. The average typing speed of regular people is surprising and would be, IMHO, counter-intuitive if not for our ubiquitous exposure to good typists and piano players.<p>* One doesn&#x27;t need to be a great typist. My big fingers seem to be made for picking up rocks, not for typing, so I &quot;only&quot; type around 50-60 wpm despite half a century at the keyboard. However, even at half this speed my thinking speed is what limits most of my coding speed and writing speed. I don&#x27;t do data-entry or transcription where more speed would be really valuable.<p>* Fast typists are fast because they make less mistakes than the rest of us[1].<p>* Qwerty is superior to Dvorak, Workman, Coleman, and other layouts for me because I\nhave to use other people&#x27;s keyboards often. I don&#x27;t work entirely by myself. If I did I might be drawn to these improved layouts, but even then a small percentage increase in typing speed wouldn&#x27;t be a big benefit for me (see above). Furthermore, my hands don&#x27;t seem to be vulnerable to Emacs pinky syndrome or repetitive use issues where these layouts do seem to be beneficial.<p>* The strange historical accident that gave us staggered keyboard keys[2] is unfortunate. I have experimented with ortholinear keyboards, I have two TEK keyboards[3] and two Kinesis Advantage[4] keyboards. These keyboards have the keys arranged in columns. I really like the Advantage layout, but I make errors when jumping back and forth between my laptop keyboard and my more extreme ergonomic keyboards. However, the main advantage of these alternative layouts for me is not their ergonomics (see above) but the <i>better utilization of the thumbs for accessing additional &quot;shift&quot; keys<\/i> layers (control, alt, meta, hyper, command) and special vim style leader keys. I have tried the other ortholinear keyboards as well[5].<p>* Major keyboard manufacturers have ergo-style keyboards, but they suffer from poor physical keys (like my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard[6]) or poor utilization of the thumbs (the Microsoft keyboard has split shift keys, which is good, but they can&#x27;t be programmed to transmit different keystrokes, which is bad).<p>* The mouse is really good at controlling analog style controls on the screen.<p>* The mouse is really bad for drawing. For this a tablet is slightly better--I own six. I also have also owned a couple of expensive Wacom tablet&#x2F;display combinations[6] these fail to be useful to me because they are (1) poor displays, (2) expensive, (3) awkwardly big, (4) require software drivers and hardware interfaces that don&#x27;t work with my newer equipment--usb-c thunderbolt for example.<p>* The iPad Pro with Apple Pencil if the best really practical, useful stylus for drawing note taking that I have found. It also is quite easy to use as a tablet with a Mac.<p>* The one-button mouse was great for my Mom, but I am more productive with more buttons, and for gaming I regularly use a gaming mouse that has 12 thumb buttons. This works great, but it does take a few hundred hours of use to become proficient. (My daughter, an avid gamer, turned me on to the Razor mouse[7]).<p>* The Apple trackpads are the best trackpads. Trackpads seem particularly well suited for content <i>consumption<\/i>, like browsing the internet and reading email. They are much less suited for operating other analog style screen based interfaces such as draging icons (folders, selected files, etc.) around the screen. For these later tasks, a mouse is superior.<p>* The Macbook Touch Bar is pretty, but for professional users, it is not worth giving up function keys to have a touch bar. The lack of an escape key makes it difficult to use vim. I can remap the escape to caps-lock or use a control-key combination instead, but then I fumble around when I&#x27;m trying to use a different system. The butterfly keys suck--I haven&#x27;t decided when&#x2F;if I&#x27;m going to buy a new Apple MacBook Pro with the newer keys because they still don&#x27;t have function keys. Furthermore, my desktop Apple systems don&#x27;t have the same keyboards and they don&#x27;t have the Touch Bar.<p>* In the early days of GUI interfaces, Apple was right to put the menu at the top of the screen. It served two purposes, it prevented confusion as to which app menu on a cluttered screen was the correct one to interact with and it was easy to get the mouse to the menu--just shove the mouse up and to the left. It eventually hit the upper corner of the screen where you could visually pick up the cursor and guide it to the appropriate menu item. With separate windows on MS one had to guide the cursor visually all the way to the menu. However, now with the large&#x2F;wide&#x2F;multiple screens on my desktop systems it means dragging the mouse a long way from where I was using it to interact with a menu.<p>* I&#x27;m not very happy with the wide variety of keybindings that exist for Emacs. However, a properly configured Emacs system has the <i>absolute best<\/i> system there is for managing software that has one-thousand different functions that a user may want to execute. Nothing I&#x27;ve seen compares to a well configured Emacs for making hundreds of commands available at one&#x27;s fingertips. Using a mouse instead would be laughable. Emacs requires an investment in time that will not be worth the effort for most people. Like practicing free-throws, there is no point for a regular person to master Emacs. However, if you strive to be a professional developer (or basketball player) practice makes perfect and it is worth your effort.<p>* Configuring Emacs is important, however it is completely programmable so there is no limit to how much time this will take. Stand on the shoulders of the giants that have come before us and use someone else&#x27;s configuration. Spacemacs and Doom are great configurations there are many others[9,10,11]<p>* Vim is great too and is better than Emacs at some things (but I&#x27;m currently being faithful to Emacs)<p>* Keypunch machines suck as IDEs. Just ahead of keypunch machines on the hierarchy are line editors on paper teletype machines. The next step up are editors like TECO. All of these are archaic ways to program that I&#x27;ve been saddled with in the past.<p>* <i>Real<\/i> developers should adopt tools as powerful as they can learn to control: Emacs, neovim, and JetBrains suite of tools, all take study, pick one because they are totally worth it. There are other editors, but don&#x27;t wimp out and pick one less powerful than you can handle. Almost every developer should also learn git, another tool that has tremendous advantages and is worth the effort. Every academic that works with mathematics, data, or code should learn LaTeX--this will take time but again it&#x27;s worth it for serious work.<p>* Xah Lee has thought about keyboard, mice, and menus a lot. I like his thinking about keyboards; you should check out his website if this subject interests you.

No, they took me and another one of the technically savvy people from the team and took us off the boring daily stuff entirely and put us on a DevOps style team where we managed ourselves and were told to just attach ourselves to whatever projects we want and just add value somehow.  They promoted me.  They also promoted the person who had been there the longest to make them the manager of a new Dallas team that was  being created for us to pass off the remainder of the boring stuff do, as well as new initiatives that they weren&#x27;t able to capitalize on because lack of headcount to handle the work.

It reminded me of my impression of Scheme when I first learned it over twenty years ago. You can learn the language in a day, but it takes a while to realize how exceptionally powerful it is. But it&#x27;s not just its radical design that&#x27;s interesting from an academic perspective; I also think that its practical goals align with mine. My primary programming language these days is C++, and Zig is the first low-level language that attempts to address all of the three main problems I see with it: language complexity, compilation speed, and safety.<p>In particular, it has two truly remarkable features that no other well-known low-level language -- C, C++, Ada, and Rust -- have or can ever have: lack of macros and lack of generics (and the associated concepts&#x2F;typeclasses) [1]. These are very important features because they have a big impact on language complexity. Despite these features, Zig can do virtually everything those languages do with macros [2] and&#x2F;or generics (including concepts&#x2F;typeclasses), and with the same level of compile-time type safety and performance: their uses become natural applications of Zig&#x27;s &quot;superfeature&quot; -- comptime.<p>Other languages -- like Nim, D, C++ and Rust also have a feature similar to Zig&#x27;s comptime or are gradually getting there -- but what Zig noticed was that this <i>simple<\/i> feature makes several other complex and&#x2F;or potentially harmful features redundant. Antoine de Saint-Exupery said that &quot;perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot; I think that Zig, like Scheme -- and yes, there are others -- is close to that minimalist vision of perfection.<p>What a truly inspiring language. Rather than asking how we could make C++&#x27;s general philosophy work better as another increasingly famous language does, IMO, it asks how we could reshape low-level programming in a way that&#x27;s a more radical break with the past. I think it&#x27;s a better question to ask. Now all there&#x27;s left to hope for is that Zig gets to 1.0 and gains some traction. I, for one, would love to find a suitable alternative to C++, and I believe Zig is the first language that could achieve that in a way that suits my particular taste.<p>[1]: I guess C has the second feature, but it loses both expressivity and performance because of it.<p>[2]: Without the less desirable things people can do with macros."],"time":["2020-08-27 13:57:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tobz1000"],"id":[24293284],"kids":[24293329,24294235],"parent":[24292437],"text":["Some of Zig&#x27;s ideas fascinate me, both the great low-level concepts (e.g. arbitrary-sized ints), but much more than that, the high level concepts.<p>Particularly great is Zig&#x27;s handling of both macros and generic types, the answer to both of which seems to be: just evaluate them at compile-time with regular functions, no special DSL or extra syntax. Andrew mentions in the video a big drawback of this system - implications for IDE complexity and performance. I imagine the performance side of this could be (maybe is?) mitigated by limiting recursion depth&#x2F;loop counts for compile-time work.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly interested in taking on a language with manual memory management and the responsibilities it entails, but I would love to have access to Zig&#x27;s compile-time capabilities, if it were available with some more memory safety."],"time":["2020-08-27 15:08:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["HourglassFR"],"id":[24294015],"kids":[24295081,24294053,24294562,24298209,24300406],"parent":[24292437],"text":["I&#x27;ve stumbled upon the Zig language a while back and have been checking in regularly to follow its progress.
