It&#x27;s not too hard, if you&#x27;ll bear with me for 2 minutes.<p><i>Mental health trigger warning<\/i>: this might unintentionally make an atheist believe in God and Jesus. If you have a background with religious trauma, avoid this post. It is weird stuff.<p>Ok, that said, the first point to make is that &quot;God the father&quot;, in early and orthodox Christianity, wasn&#x27;t a person, except as an allegory. The One God was rather the incomprehensible concept of Oneness -- more akin to a mathematical singularity than Zeus. This was discussed extensively by Philo of Alexandria (b.25 BC), one of the biggest influences on early Christians. That Oneness was also described by Plato and the Pythagoreans.<p>Pausing there -- I find this Oneness concept to be a really fascinating idea, especially as we now accept that the entire universe was born out of a single point in the big bang. Also, Oneness is more or less a culturally universal phenomenon in mystical and psychedelic experiences. This god of Oneness is a very different perspective than the &quot;guy in the sky&quot; perspective -- but it is actually still compatible with Christian orthodoxy.<p>Where does Jesus fit in? Jesus was the &quot;Logos&quot; -- translated poorly as &quot;the word&quot; -- which was understood by the contemporary stoics and jewish-greek philosophers (Philo) as &quot;the eternal emanation of the Oneness&quot;. We need the logos as the oneness is really kind of boring with no diversity.<p>So, Jesus was viewed as the allegorical &quot;son&quot; of the oneness (the father). That&#x27;s why Jesus was there since the beginning of time. But, the mystery of the Christian faith is that the cosmic logos incarnated as a human -- the Jesus story is the story of the logos becoming flesh. Make sense?<p>What troubled me was the Christian idea that <i>you have to believe in Jesus to have eternal life<\/i>. I found that irritating and disturbing. Why would belief in Jesus give eternal life?? Here is my best-faith interpretation: if you believe that we are all part of an eternal, common, cosmic logos, like if you <i>really believe that we are the logos<\/i>, then of course we don&#x27;t die, we live on for ever, since we are the logos. So, in shorthand, believe in Jesus and you live for ever.<p>Of course, theology got weird when people wanted the allegorical stories to be true and adopted the absurd idea of biblical literalism. For instance, Theophilus was a 4th century Alexandrian pope who first wrote a treatise on why it was foolish to believe that the One god was a material person -- but then had to backtrack when the monks literally started rioting in the streets [1].<p>So, there you have it: orthodox christianity can be galactic in scope, philosophically sound and compatible with empirical physics. No supernatural required, but plenty of mystery.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.nl&#x2F;books?id=9joABAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;ots=xBsDihrVyW&amp;dq=Theophilus%20riot%20monks&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=Theophilus%20riot%20monks&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.nl&#x2F;books?id=9joABAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;ots=x...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-28 12:13:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DiogenesKynikos"],"id":[22441290],"kids":[22442333,22441488,22441573,22441515],"parent":[22439124],"text":["This is very poor history. A constant theme among apologists for the 17th Century Catholic Church is the claim that the Church was somehow defending scientific rigor. That idea is quickly dispelled by simply reading the Inquisition&#x27;s 1616 findings on heliocentrism:<p>&gt; Proposition to be assessed:<p>&gt; (1) The sun is the center of the world and completely devoid of local motion.<p>&gt;   Assessement: All said that this proposition is foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts many places the sense of Holy Scripture, according to the literal meaning of the words and according to the common interpretation and understanding of the Holy Fathers and the doctors of theology.<p>&gt; (2) The earth is not the center of the world, nor motionless, but it moves as a whole and also with diurnal motion.<p>&gt;   Assessment: All said that this proposition receives the same judgement in philosophy and that in regard to theological truth it is at least errouneous in faith.<p>The Church wasn&#x27;t calling for scientific rigor. It was calling for adherence to orthodoxy - in this case, its interpretation of Scripture.<p>Graney and others make an ahistorical argument: they cherry-pick one observation (the apparent angular diameter of stars), and then apply modern arguments not known to people at the time (the actual size of stars) to say that Galileo&#x27;s scientific argument was weak. They ignore all the other observations that strongly favored heliocentrism at the time (the phases of Venus, the discovery that Jupiter and its moons form their own Copernican system, the greater parsimony of the heliocentric system when it comes to explaining things like retrograde motion of planets, and so on), and focus on the argument about sizes of stars. But Galileo had a perfectly reasonable answer to the star-size argument: the stars might be very large, and different measurements of stellar angular diameters were inconsistent with one another. Countering with modern knowledge about the true sizes of stars doesn&#x27;t give any insight into who had the stronger argument in the early 1600s.<p>On balance, the argument for heliocentrism was already much stronger at the time.

Each of our areas on the map is a different size, and has a different number of people in it.

A very productive development method I&#x27;ve used is to have the front end and back end teams agree on the GraphQL types (often times having the front end folks actually write the types), quickly mock things out, then have the front end folks go implement the front end and the back end folks provide the real resolver implementations.<p>The things I love about this is that it really simplifies and hides the backend details from the front ends.

Projects that require a vision beyond 10 years, much less 20, are exceedingly rare. Very, very few companies last more than a generation or two. This map in the article might make it seem like there are lots, but for context there are roughly 190 million companies on the planet, so to say these long-lived ones are an extreme outlier is still an understatement.<p>Enter religious institutions: Ballpark estimates in my head indicate that, sure, some come &amp; go quickly, but many have much more staying power than their pure corporate counterparts. Lasting a handful of generations is common: Many major sects of Christianity are hundreds of years old.<p>I think this is a problem with human ability to truly plan in timescales longer than a generation, much less an entire human life time or longer. The <i>purpose<\/i> of a corporation is not to last forever, and changing markets often present hard limits on their lifetime, effectively a Great Filter for corporate enterprise. Contrast with the purpose of any religion, which is inherently devoted to beliefs that are not purported to be limited to a discrete period of time (excepting doomsday cults, which are interesting studies, but not in scope for this topic)<p>I am not particularly religious, but I think this difference in longevity, stemming from inherent differences in purpose, points the way towards the type of mindset necessary for the human race to begin acting and planning from the truly long term, beyond the horizon of a human life time or two. Which is really necessary when you consider issues like climate change (regardless of what you believe is the cause (a separate debate) the effects must be dealt with over time scales that exceed a human life time) and not just that, but other grand projects than cannot be accomplished in a single lifetime."],"time":["2020-02-27 01:12:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dredmorbius"],"id":[22426577],"kids":[22426592],"parent":[22426289],"text":["Disambiguated source:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;businessfinancing.co.uk&#x2F;the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;businessfinancing.co.uk&#x2F;the-oldest-company-in-almost...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-26 20:49:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Gusen"],"id":[22427569],"kids":{},"parent":[22426289],"text":["Attorney General Barr will not resign; not before President Trump does.

Many epidemiologists now suspect that it is likely to become endemic, and that 40-70% of the world&#x27;s population will contract it. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;covid-vaccine&#x2F;607000&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;covid-vac...<\/a><p>So what can we do?<p>The most important thing to keep the death rate low is to reduce the burden on the hospital system so that they don&#x27;t end up with more cases needing critical care than they can handle.

This has resulted in a constant iterative design that&#x27;s led to the flattening and hiding of every major UI element. It&#x27;s not because of malice or anything, it&#x27;s just that for designers who already know and are familiar with the system, it&#x27;s redundant to keep displaying things users already know.<p>In general, it&#x27;s fine for users that are already familiar with the system. If you&#x27;ve been using macOS since it was Mac OS X (or even earlier), and you used every version from then to now, then the system is probably totally obvious. The catch is that we stopped &quot;teaching&quot; users things from scratch. So there&#x27;s a ton of users who feel like the current user interfaces are totally obvious, while users who are just now entering an ecosystem find themselves completely lost.<p>I&#x27;ve advocated for this a lot privately, but I think it needs to be said more prominently: interfaces need to grow with the users on an individual level. Maybe you want to reach some kind of eden where no control is highlighted and the entire interface is flat -- so be it. Just make sure that you start users off with a very 3D interface with obvious affordances before you start changing things up. Maybe this sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s basically the only way to teach a brand new user how to use a computer system from scratch.<p>I help my mom and grandparents out all the time when it comes to technology. They aren&#x27;t dumb. They just don&#x27;t follow every design change, take every OS update, or buy new devices every year. They know how to close windows, resize windows, and deal with windows. But when the iPad ships things like three and four finger gesture systems that have no obvious way to discover them, of course they look clueless. Similarly, when a button doesn&#x27;t look like a button (but it did in three design languages ago and has just slowly removed all of the button-like features), they don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a button. Again, it&#x27;s not their fault: they just haven&#x27;t followed every iteration of the design language to know why or how things have changed.<p>The key UI element that Superhuman gets right that everyone talks about is its ridiculous obsession with teaching keyboard shortcuts. Every time you click a button instead of using a shortcut, the confirmation tells you &quot;yes, that worked, but also here&#x27;s the keyboard shortcut to do it faster next time.&quot; Maybe something like this would help?<p>Whatever the case may be, users who don&#x27;t know things make the industry look inscrutable and unfriendly.

By making MLIR open from the start, we let everybody add the whistles they need, or collaborate on them with other people who also need them. That is sort of the point of open source community. Personally, I am happy to work with anybody who shares my needs, but I won&#x27;t do somebody else&#x27;s job instead of them. In a sense, MLIR does not intend to solve any specific compiler problem, but rather give people tools that help them focus on the problem at hand instead of IR infrastructure, storage, serialization etc.<p>The alternative would have been to develop it internally for a long time, driven exclusively by the internal needs, and then just throw it over the fence into public. It would have had significantly more &quot;features&quot;. I am certain some people would have complained about that process as well.<p>As for the need of MLIR when LLVM already exists: yes, you could express a lot of things by (ab)using LLVM IR, but sometimes it&#x27;s worth considering whether you should. Loop optimizations is the canonical example of LLVM IR&#x27;s limitations [1,2]. Peculiarities of GPU execution model are another [3,4]. People spent years on trying to fit those into LLVM&#x27;s constraints. Generic passes like DCE, CSE and inlining are (re)implemented on many levels of IRs, which seems more like the time-consuming wheel reinvention than doing an infrastructure that can be reused for those.<p>TL;DR: if you want a compiler giving faster code for language X today, MLIR is probably not for you, also today; if LLVM already does everything you need, MLIR is probably not for you either. There are plenty of other cases around.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;polly.llvm.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;polly.llvm.org<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.llvm.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;llvm-dev&#x2F;2020-January&#x2F;137909.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.llvm.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;llvm-dev&#x2F;2020-January&#x2F;137909...<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nhaehnle.blogspot.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;compiling-shaders-dynamically-uniform.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nhaehnle.blogspot.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;compiling-shaders-dynam...<\/a>\n[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.llvm.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;llvm-dev&#x2F;2019-October&#x2F;135929.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.llvm.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;llvm-dev&#x2F;2019-October&#x2F;135929...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-27 13:21:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["qaq"],"id":[22433539],"kids":{},"parent":[22429107],"text":["if one believes Jim Keller the end is pretty far off"],"time":["2020-02-27 15:31:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ilamont"],"id":[22436606],"kids":[22436861,22439740,22436753,22436859,22440311],"parent":[22421159],"text":["<i>The mathematical model Hu and Ko developed isn&#x27;t just a fun curiosity; it should also prove useful for industrial robotic designs.<\/i><p>I recall seeing somewhere (maybe coverage of CES or another trade show) of automated machines for cooking Chinese dishes that traditionally had to be made by hand.

This isnt &quot;cast off&quot; food either, its high quality prepared food.

These alpha oscillations are among the most widely studied brain signals, related to cognitive phenomena such as attention, memory and consciousness. However, the mechanisms by which alpha oscillations affect human cognition await demonstration. Here, we suggest the honey bee brain as an experimentally more accessible model system for investigating the functional role of alpha oscillations. We found a prominent spontaneous oscillation around 18 Hz that is reduced in amplitude upon olfactory stimulation. Similar to alpha oscillations in primates, the phase of this oscillation biased both timing of neuronal spikes and amplitude of high-frequency gamma activity (40–450 Hz). These results suggest a common role of alpha oscillations across phyla and provide an unprecedented new venue for causal studies on the relationship between neuronal spikes, brain oscillations and cognition.&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-28 00:36:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["IIAOPSW"],"id":[22440018],"kids":[22441145,22440691],"parent":[22434234],"text":["Admittedly I&#x27;m very pedestrian when it comes to neurology.

The basic idea is that the cells are divided between dark “sea” cells and light “land” cells. We run Brain in the sea, and on land we run not Life but AntiLife. All the land cells are normally firing cells, and the presence of an active AntiLife cell is signaled by having a land cell which is not firing. Full details on EcoLiBra are in the Cellular Automata Theory chapter.<p>&gt;The name EcoLiBra suggests 1) an ecology of Life and Brain, 2) a balanced situation (equilibrium), and 3) the human intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli, known as E. coli for short. The third connection is perhaps a bit unsavory, but remember that E. coli cells are in fact the favorite “guinea pigs” for present day gene splicing experiments. As one of the goals of CelLab is to promote the development of artificial life, the designer gene connection is entirely appropriate. I&#x27;ve given EcoLiBra a nice, symmetric start pattern, but it also does fine if you use the Bit Plane Editor to randomize all bit planes.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fourmilab.ch&#x2F;cellab&#x2F;manual&#x2F;chap4.html#EcoLiBra\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fourmilab.ch&#x2F;cellab&#x2F;manual&#x2F;chap4.html#EcoLiBra<\/a><p>&gt;The EcoLiBra rule, consisting of Brain and AntiLife,\neach turned on by the red&#x2F;black boundary.<p>&gt;But when the sea runs Brain and the land runs Life, the situation is no longer symmetrical. The pervasive presence of Brain&#x27;s refractory state makes it less likely for a sea cell to have seven firing neighbors and be turned into a land cell. Unless we change the transition rules, the land will always melt away. So to give land a fighting chance, I now say that a sea cell becomes land if it has seven or six firing neighbors. Also I use better colors: Black, blue, and green for Brain; red and yellow for AntiLife.<p>Here is a variant I call &quot;ECO&quot; that runs &quot;ANNEAL&quot; on the water&#x2F;land plane, and (for giggles) a heat diffusion in the upper left-over planes.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SimHacker&#x2F;CAM6&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;CAM6.js#L3331\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SimHacker&#x2F;CAM6&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;CAM...<\/a><p>Here are the guts of the rule (omitting the heat diffusion layer calculation):<p><pre><code>                            var cell = 0;\n\n                            var sum9Anneal =\n                                    ((nw &amp; 0x04) + (n &amp; 0x04) + (ne &amp; 0x04) +\n                                     (w  &amp; 0x04) + (c &amp; 0x04) + (e  &amp; 0x04) +\n                                     (sw &amp; 0x04) + (s &amp; 0x04) + (se &amp; 0x04)) &gt;&gt; 2;\n                            var anneal =\n                                    ((sum9Anneal &gt; 5) || (sum9Anneal == 4)) ? 4 : 0;\n\n                            cell |= anneal;\n\n                            var sum8 =\n                                    (nw &amp; 1) + (n &amp; 1) + (ne &amp; 1) +\n                                    (w  &amp; 1) +           (e  &amp; 1) +\n                                    (sw &amp; 1) + (s &amp; 1) + (se &amp; 1);\n\n                            if (anneal) {\n                                &#x2F;&#x2F; Anti-Life\n                                cell |= ((c &amp; 1) &lt;&lt; 1);\n                                if (c &amp; 1) {\n                                    if (sum8 != 5) {\n                                        cell |= 0x01;\n                                    }\n                                } else {\n                                    if ((sum8 != 5) &amp;&amp; (sum8 != 6)) {\n                                        cell |= 0x01;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            } else {\n                                &#x2F;&#x2F; Brain\n                                cell |= (c &lt;&lt; 1) &amp; 2;\n                                if ((c &amp; 3) == 0) {\n                                    if (sum8 == 2) {\n                                        cell |= 1;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe CelLab user&#x27;s guide and Rudy Rucker&#x27;s recounting of the origins of CelLab and his experience with Margolus and Toffoli&#x27;s CAM6 is especially delightful.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fourmilab.ch&#x2F;cellab&#x2F;manual&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fourmilab.ch&#x2F;cellab&#x2F;manual&#x2F;<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fourmilab.ch&#x2F;cellab&#x2F;manual&#x2F;chap5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fourmilab.ch&#x2F;cellab&#x2F;manual&#x2F;chap5.html<\/a><p>Bennett shows me another pattern, one that looks like boiling red cottage cheese, and then he takes me across the Charles River to the MIT Laboratory of Computer Science. In the basement is an exuberant French scientist named Gérard Vichniac. He and an associate are watching a small rectangular dot-pattern in the center of their terminal&#x27;s screen. The pattern is mostly white, with a small amount of red in it. The edges keep folding in on each other as the pattern evolves according to some simple rule which Vichniac made up. He calls it an “Ising Model,” but it looks like an electronic kaleidoscope. “This pattern started as a red square,” Vichniac tells me. “The rule is reversible, so we know that eventually the red square must come back. We&#x27;ve been watching it for eighty thousand steps now”.<p>Upstairs from Vichniac are two equally cheerful cellular automata specialists, Norman Margolus and Tommaso Toffoli. There&#x27;s another journalist there, a guy from Rolling Stone.[Footnote] Cellular automata are hot. I introduce myself and sit down to watch the demonstration. Right now there&#x27;s a central cloud of dots, with square little patterns flying out of it. On the sides of each of the square patterns are individual pixels that pump up and down.<p>“Look at the critters, Tom,” says Margolus. “They look like rowers, don&#x27;t they?”[Footnote]<p>“Show him the square rock,” says Toffoli.<p>Margolus clears the screen and keys a big red square into the center. The square expands out to the edges of the screen and bounces back. As the bouncing continues, the patterns interfere and form complex checkerboard patterns, enough patterns in thirty seconds to have made a respectable one-man Op-Art show in the 1960s.<p>Toffoli pries Margolus away from the controls and takes over. “Now we do the square rock in the toroidal pond again, but this time we add a heat-bath, a cloud of random gas in the background.”<p>The background fills with darting dots, and Toffoli keys another big red square into the center. This time the waves are smooth and roughly circular, much like real waves in a real pond. We try it with two squares and get interference patterns. Toffoli is pleased. He says that this shows how simple physics really is.<p>[...]<p>After watching the CAM in operation at Margolus&#x27;s office, I am sure the thing will be a hit. Just as the Moog synthesizer changed the sound of music, cellular automata will change the look of video.<p>I tell this to Toffoli and Margolus, and they look unconcerned. What they care most deeply about is science, about Edward Fredkin&#x27;s vision of explaining the world in terms of cellular automata and information mechanics. Margolus talks about computer hackers, and how a successful program is called “a good hack.” As the unbelievably bizarre cellular automata images flash by on his screen, Margolus leans back in his chair and smiles slyly. And then he tells me his conception of the world we live in.<p>“The universe is a good hack.”<p>[...]<p>Margolus and Toffoli&#x27;s CAM-6 board was finally coming into production around then, and I got the Department to order one. The company making the boards was Systems Concepts of San Francisco; I think they cost $1500. We put our order in, and I started phoning Systems Concepts up and asking them when I was going to get my board. By then I&#x27;d gotten a copy of Margolus and Toffoli&#x27;s book, Cellular Automata Machines, and I was itching to start playing with the board. And still it didn&#x27;t come. Finally I told System Concepts that SJSU was going to have to cancel the purchase order. The next week they sent the board. By now it was August, 1987.<p>The packaging of the board was kind of incredible. It came naked, all by itself, in a plastic bag in a small box of styrofoam peanuts. No cables, no software, no documentation. Just a three inch by twelve inch rectangle of plastic—actually two rectangles one on top of the other—completely covered with computer chips. There were two sockets at one end. I called Systems Concepts again, and they sent me a few pages of documentation. You were supposed to put a cable running your graphics card&#x27;s output into the CAM-6 board, and then plug your monitor cable into the CAM-6&#x27;s other socket. No, Systems Concepts didn&#x27;t have any cables, they were waiting for a special kind of cable from Asia. So Steve Ware, one of the SJSU Math&amp;CS Department techs, made me a cable. All I needed then was the software to drive the board, and as soon as I phoned Toffoli he sent me a copy.<p>Starting to write programs for the CAM-6 took a little bit of time because the language it uses is Forth. This is an offbeat computer language that uses reverse Polish notation. Once you get used to it, Forth is very clean and nice, but it makes you worry about things you shouldn&#x27;t really have to worry about.

Japan has people that died due to COVID-19 and they don&#x27;t know how it was spread - the US didn&#x27;t even test everyone that came from Diamond Princess! Why aren&#x27;t those countries tracking down how the viruses are being spread?<p>I don&#x27;t like conspiracy theories, but seriously it looks like they are trying to lessen the numbers on the paper instead of really trying to find the patients. Compare the numbers that the countries are testing[0], US is less than a thousand and Japan is about 1300.<p>Edit: Just for people who are curious in how things are working in South Korea, we test everyone who has: pneumonia symptoms, or has been in the same place with already discovered patients for free - and anyone who is concerned can test with about $100 - which is refunded if one turns out to be positive. We track every COVID-19 patient&#x27;s routes and test everyone who was in the same place; which means that the government (mostly) knows exactly how the virus is being spread. Based on data that was announced 10 hours ago[1] (we announce data and roadmap twice every day), we have tested 66,652 people with 1,766 cases found, and currently 25,568 tests are on-going. 1,727 people are being quarantined, and 26 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.<p>Second Edit: Okay, I&#x27;m not really skilled in English; if this felt like bragging how South Korea is well handling this situation, that is not my intent - we have a lot of complaints of how the government should handle this.

I can&#x27;t speak for Hillel Wayne who used the word &quot;framed&quot;, but I didn&#x27;t understand his newsletter post as <i>Bentley<\/i> having &quot;framed&quot; Knuth -- I understood his post as pointing out that in the popular imagination&#x2F;folklore, the story had mutated over the course of years from the original setting (a program that Knuth was asked to write in WEB specifically as that was the point, and a review of that program by McIlroy evangelizing the then little-known Unix philosophy) to a &quot;framing&quot; where two people were competing to solve the same problem with the same available resources, and one of them did it in a &quot;worse&quot; way. (Also left this comment on the blog post above.)<p>2. Here&#x27;s a comment on the previous thread from someone who says they read the column when it was posted, and their reaction they say was one of cringing -- so at least at that time it probably wasn&#x27;t perceived that way: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22418721\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22418721<\/a><p>3. Much of the space taken by the literate program is for explaining a very interesting data structure that we could call a hash-packed trie (AFAICT, devised on that occasion for that problem -- a small twist on the packed tries used in TeX for hyphenation, and described in the thesis of Knuth&#x27;s student Frank Liang). One cannot obtain this data structure by combining other programs, only by combining other ideas. (I mentioned this in the previous thread as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22413391\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22413391<\/a>)<p>4. So as far as evaluating literate programming goes, the real question (and the answer is not obvious to me!) is: if you&#x27;re going to write a program that uses a custom data structure (like this), <i>how<\/i> should you organize that program? Should you write it as Knuth does, or as a conventional program (like I tried to do with my translation: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codegolf.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;197870\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codegolf.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;197870<\/a>)? And as for estimating the value of a new data structure in the first place: as of now (at that question), solutions based on a trie are about 200 times faster than the shell pipeline, on a large testcase. (The hash-packed trie, which Knuth calls &quot;slow&quot; in his program, is not so bad either, and it does economize on memory a bit.)"],"time":["2020-02-28 00:32:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shaggyfrog"],"id":[22436899],"kids":[22439522,22438623],"parent":[22416841],"text":["&gt; perl -a -MText::LevenshteinXS -e &#x27;print distance(@F), &quot;\\n&quot;&#x27;<p>Step 2: draw the rest of the owl"],"time":["2020-02-27 20:35:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["coolreader18"],"id":[22437099],"kids":[22439738,22437770],"parent":[22416841],"text":["I really like the <i>idea<\/i> of the Unix model as well, but you&#x27;re not going to be able to use it effectively to write an actual application.
