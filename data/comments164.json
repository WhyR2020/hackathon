The whole CSP concept makes a ton of sense to me in writing enterprise software - mainly from a &quot;keeping the architecture cheap to own and change over time&quot; point of view. I appreciate this isn&#x27;t where CSP was targeted but it lends itself very well IMO to solving this problem because you could decouple components and grow them independently so effectively.<p>Go is an entire language but core.async is just a library in Clojure, they didn&#x27;t have to change the language to implement this which is mind blowing to me.<p>Another example is types. Only some of the code I write actually benefits from types AND most type systems in &quot;enterprise&quot; languages are pretty anaemic. Typing is also really hard to do well, like really really hard. You had a problem, you adopted typing and now you have two problems is generally my thinking here.<p>Scala was to be my saviour here but that missed the mark quite spectacularly and the compiler is still ridiculously slow today but then along came TypeScript which is pretty darned awesome IMO.<p>Thanks to TypeScript and modern Python i had learned that i wanted &quot;optional typing&quot; and i was undecided about type erasure at runtime - i don&#x27;t immediately see a problem with it, i&#x27;ve written probably thousands of lines of Java with generics then used reflection at runtime without losing sleep, but it fills an awkward space in my head - to invest in types but only benefit at compile time seems like a miss.<p>In Clojure i can follow the TypeScript model but actually take it further to runtime.<p>This post is too long already. Long way to say Clojure appears very interesting."],"time":["2020-09-02 21:02:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["praptak"],"id":[24357059],"kids":[24358453,24358649],"parent":[24353476],"text":["For me the most interesting part is how it gets rid of the JVM startup time.<p>So there are two parts to the solution: The first part is Small Clojure Interpreter (sci) which is a &quot;(subset of) Clojure written in Clojure&quot;, so kind of McCarthy for Clojure.

I need reStructuredText &#x2F; reSt markup (which can also be rendered by github), specifically for program documentation. reStructuredText is more suited for longer documentation, it has better code formatting, can show tables of contents, and is also less tied to output in a HTML page (it can easily be converted to a LaTeX or PDF document).

Besides the fact the premiums are onerous, it is the health insurance carriers that evaluate if and how much insurance will cover an expenditure, usually after a copay and possibly coinsurance has been paid. To say nothing of ever-growing deductible limits. On top of that, the Trump Administration is working overtime to purge what little insurance benefits are provided via Obamacare (in it&#x27;s quest to eliminate any legacy of the Obama Administration). Unfortunately, the GOP is woefully short on replacement ideas. One does get the idea--in the true spirit of the Republican Party--the replacement will consist of costly, high-deductible health insurance that will include many exclusions from its coverage.<p>All this begs the question: quality of life in the US, especially for the middle class, is crashing compared to our friends in other industrialized nations. Why middle class especially? Because the middle class is most likely to have an employer-sponsored plan that has deductibles and exclusions. In fact, most of those carrying employer sponsored health insurance never really know how much of the  bill insurance will cover. Poor and indigent people, in many states, can still obtain health care without insurance and many states have funds just for this so the bill is paid by the tax payers in one form or another.<p>And since the healthcare complex is an aggressive lobby in Washington, this situation is not likely to change. Not under Biden, certainly not under Trump. And to those Democrats who say millions of people who have employer-sponsored health insurance love their coverage and don&#x27;t want to give it up, I say poppycock!

But that&#x27;s not the core of OOP, that&#x27;s some weird crap people piled on top of OOP in the 90&#x27;s.<p>Object-oriented programming, fundamentally, is about associating code with the data it manipulates. Code + data = object. Two essential follow-ons:<p>* Encapsulation: Your object provides an interface composed of methods, without allowing callers to reach in and mess with the data inside except by calling those methods. This allows your implementation to evolve without breaking callers.<p>* Abstraction&#x2F;polymorphism: Objects with different implementations can implement the same interface thus making them interchangeable. This enables code which operates on such objects to be reused across wildly different use cases.<p>These fundamentals exist in basically all large systems. Example: Linux file descriptors are objects. Different kinds of file descriptors (e.g. disk files vs. sockes) implement the same interface (syscalls, e.g. read&#x2F;write), and you cannot reach directly into their implementation from userspace, which allows the kernel implementation to evolve over time. You really can&#x27;t <i>not<\/i> use OOP in these scenarios.<p>The opposite of OOP is separating code from data. In anti-OOP, you declare your data structure completely transparently, without declaring any kind of &quot;methods&quot; that apply to it. Code modules interoperate by operating on the same underlying structure. This tends to lead to sclerosis as adding new features to the data structure without breaking existing code can be quite difficult.<p>My hot take: The philosophy of REST (though less often the actual implementation) is disturbingly anti-OOP."],"time":["2020-09-03 01:50:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["decafninja"],"id":[24357629],"kids":{},"parent":[24356978],"text":["I think OOP is fine.<p>What people really hate is &quot;enterprise OOP&quot; and its related ecosystem.<p>It&#x27;s like Agile.

Just as you wouldn’t kill a fly with a sledgehammer, you wouldn’t choose a big, heavy OOP language like Java to write up a simple script to copy some files around, would you? No, Python or Perl would be better suited for such things. But using scripting language for large Enterprise-level software begins to fall apart at some point. Suddenly you’ll find yourself wishing that you could name and encapsulate data structures, and then perhaps extend the functionality of a module, and you might even find yourself mimicking concepts of classical inheritance - and eventually you’ll end up with a mess that would have been much cleaner with some kind of OOP. Take Javascript, for example. In the days before ES6, many large JS Enterprise libraries were written with strange prototype hacks that did their best to mimic classical inheritance with varying degrees of success. A framework called Dojo tried solving this with convoluted constructs like “declare”; Whole transpiled languages like TypeScript and Coffeescript were created just to make it easier for developers to write “clean” classic OOP-style code. My point is, OOP is and has been useful in all manner of problem solving, and no matter how hard we try, we always come back to it in some way. Perhaps the question of why it’s so prevalent is misguided, driven by misunderstandings, culture, trends, and a desire to shun what’s old and promote what’s new."],"time":["2020-09-03 01:13:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geophile"],"id":[24357643],"kids":{},"parent":[24356978],"text":["People like and use useful abstractions, and OO offers them: encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, inheritance.

Here we go, here I am commenting on a subject on which _everybody_ has an opinion. A lot of people say that &quot;OOP&quot; is just a tool. Or that it is overused. Or that it isn&#x27;t used properly. I will say that even though I sometimes use objects I am not a fan of almost every &quot;object-oriented&quot; codebase that I&#x27;ve had to work with. The issue is that OOP is presented as an abstraction that, if you understood it, would provide for good readable code. The way I judge good principle is whether when, inevitably, junior to mid-level programmers start working on the codebase will they be able to preserve some amount of sounds structure. I would say that OOP offers very little here, as I&#x27;ve seen even senior developers write what to them was &quot;good OOP code&quot; but in practice nobody could work with.<p>Here are some things that OOP does not give you:<p>* Is your state normalized, i.e. saved only in one place? You do not know.<p>* Is your execution predictable? Parent to child? And how do you do it when it&#x27;s reversed.<p>* What should be public and modifiable and what should be intermediate state internal to the object. And should intermediate computed values be stored next to values determining the true state of your application? (even though there are &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; modifiers it is quiet difficult to determine what is truly public and cannot be modified through some method. This makes it more difficult to understand what the state of your application truly is and what are intermediate convenience values).<p>* Are there limitations on passing state around? Or can large chunks of state be passed to multiple actors in the form of classes who change it concurrently or might store it for later use?<p>* How much state should be in a single class? In other words: how many classes can a class encapsulate and how complex could those classes be?<p>* Should something that has no state be an object or just a function (in some languages you are not given the option at true, but can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s awesome).<p>* Should you be allowed to use event buses and how to prevent spaghettification? (cause events really are akin modern goto statements).<p>* etc.<p>Basically the ability to compose the state, type and methods is so wildly open-ended that almost always what I see is just an ever expanding convoluted bloat of state spread ts chaotically that it become extremely difficult to see what the state of your application is at any moment. Everybody has their own idea of what an object _is_, what should be an object and how they should come together. And that is for every developer on the team. So you can follow the absolute best of OOP practices and still end up with a mess.<p>Let&#x27;s look at a counter-example. It is not a system that claims to be universally usable but that is the point. I&#x27;ll use the, quiet banal, example of React. Yes, it is a framework, and in a way it does have objects, but really it borrows heavily from functional programming in the sense that it says that state is king and the single most important thing in your program. That you _must_ have strong constraints as to how your state is created, organized and modified. (In contrast to a class, which is state that you can pass around as much as you want and the whole codebase could modify it at will).<p>* The application is always a predictable tree of dependencies.<p>* State is either stored separately altogether (using a state-store such as redux, mobx, etc.) or bound to a particular element in the tree hierarchy.<p>* State only flows down the tree, ideally immutably.<p>* A component (unlike a class) cannot modify state of anything outside of itself.<p>* Only &quot;has-a&quot; relationships are allowed - no polymorphism.<p>* Only event can be passed up.<p>* State is essentially a collection of easily inspectable primitives. Meaning that even though a component can _contain_ another component a class is not a valid member of component state.<p>While a system like this could be built using OOP primitives (classes). Nothing about OOP suggests this system. Yes, you can build it, but can build something absolutely unrelated. And, really, it enforces things that are the antithesis of many things that &quot;proper OOP&quot; espouses.<p>Perhaps the main thing of any system is to create a predictable and well-structured relationship between elements of state. I think that wonderful examples of the basis of such a system are Go and Rust. To be honest, I barely know the languages, but from what I see is that they make _type_ the most central element of the language. If you have your types well-defined and be separate from how the types are used you are already suggesting many things that could prevent state-sprawl. A struct defines the basic primitive around which your program is based.<p>* Struct has no private intermediately computed values. If you do not want to recompute something - memoize, do not bloat the state with random data that is inseparable from you base state.<p>* Structs provide a very predictable &quot;has-a&quot; top-down dependency between state<p>* No inheritance, so composition is enforced.<p>* Keeping types and functions that operate on those types makes it very explicit what a function does - is it a method or is it a function?"],"time":["2020-09-03 01:12:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["boltzmann_brain"],"id":[24358754],"kids":{},"parent":[24356978],"text":["I think it&#x27;s because it is excellent for building layers and layers of useless indirection and abstraction that solve no problems, and software engineers love and prefer that to looking at data, as they should, and solving actual problems at hand. ;)"],"time":["2020-09-03 00:06:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["throw1234651234"],"id":[24357319],"kids":[24357365,24357444],"parent":[24356978],"text":["Because you can do functional programming in OOP.

I don&#x27;t love configure scripts, I don&#x27;t agree with the heavy reliance on POSIX if you intend to be compatible with Windows, and I don&#x27;t love the fact that the author recommends third party data structure libraries that they haven&#x27;t actually used. For container libraries in C, you really have to use them to get a feel for their usability (this sounds like a tautology but it&#x27;s not.)<p>I disagree strongly with one recommendation. This is just an example, but it holds for larger API design in general:<p>&gt; we could add a fallback to reading &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random. [...] However, in this case, the increased portability would require a change in interface. Since fopen() or fread() on &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random could fail, our function would need to return bool.<p>No, definitely not. It is dangerous to expect the application to sanely handle the case of randomness being unavailable when it is never going to occur in practice. On all POSIX platforms, &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random exists and will block until sufficient entropy is available. Something would have to go seriously wrong for this to fail. This is so rare that any error handling code for it will never be tested. The most likely outcome of forcing the caller to handle it is that the return value is ignored or improperly handled and the buffer is used uninitialized, leading to a security vulnerability.<p>My recommendation instead would be to error check your fopen() and fread() calls within get_random_bytes(), and print an error and abort() if they fail. This way if someone&#x27;s system is improperly configured and &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random doesn&#x27;t work the program will just crash. Same goes for macOS&#x27;s SecRandomCopyBytes() and Windows&#x27; half a dozen calls to use an HCRYPTPROV. This way you still return void and there is no danger of callers improperly handling errors.<p>In general, unless you&#x27;re writing safety-critical software, it&#x27;s fine for your code (or even library code) to abort() in these sorts of exceptional situations when there is no reasonable or safe way to handle the error.

There will be tons of interesting transients hidden in that stream of data, and the key is flagging them as quickly as possible, so that other telescopes can do targeted follow-up. LSST itself is really the discovery machine, but it doesn&#x27;t give much information about the transients it discovers.

Feel free to steal it for your own workplaces.<p><i>We should consider working from home.<\/i><p>You may all have seen the news by now. A patient was just diagnosed with COVID-19 at UC Davis after having no known contact with anyone travelling. Importantly, they were diagnosed after being intubated already for 7 days. It is suspected that this is the first known case of public transmission of the virus in the US. From what we know about the incubation times and progression of the illness, that means they contracted it sometime between 14-21 days ago. This is the letter UC Davis sent to their staff.<p>If the virus has already been in the wild in California for 3 weeks, it seems likely to me that it has or will reach the bay area, and given the limited testing capability that has been reported, we may not know until the first cases end up in the ICU, weeks after exposure.<p>The death rate for young healthy people is relatively low, around 0.2%. It is much higher for older people, who it kills in double digit percentages. Still, 20% of the people it infects need intensive hospital care.  Many epidemiologists now suspect that it is likely to become endemic, and that 40-70% of the world&#x27;s population will contract it. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;covid-vaccine&#x2F;607000&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;covid-vac...<\/a><p>So what can we do?<p>The most important thing to keep the death rate low is to reduce the burden on the hospital system so that they don&#x27;t end up with more cases needing critical care than they can handle. And the most important thing for reducing the burden on hospitals is to slow the spread of the virus, so that even if it ends up infecting all of us, it doesn&#x27;t infect all of us at once.<p>We&#x27;re fortunate enough that aside from impromptu collaboration and whiteboarding, all of our concrete tasks can be done at home. Most workers will not be in this situation, and will have to come to work to keep the economy running.

So far, building green infrastructure seems attractive, but I fear that in the end it just makes energy a little bit cheaper for people, and the real CO2 impact that happens in the transport and agriculture sectors doesn&#x27;t really get solved.<p>I also was attracted to planting trees, since there&#x27;s a very concrete impact there, that can&#x27;t really be cheated against (unless people burn them down of course). So I started calculating how many trees to plant and it turns out that there&#x27;s a lot of misleading info.<p>For example, in ideal conditions a tree might accumulate 20kg of CO2 in 40 years. My car did 16000km at about 1&#x2F;14, on gasoline so that&#x27;s 2742kg of CO2. So some website will tell me to plant 140 trees to compensate over 40 years, to compensate what I did in 1 year, assuming all those trees survive.<p>But they don&#x27;t, only 55% lives, so I should plant 280 trees to be a bit more sure I really am compensating. And then it&#x27;ll be compensated in 2060, which is useless because climate is changing now, not in 40 years. So it&#x27;s better to compensate up front, so say I want to make sure I&#x27;ve made an impact by 2025, I should plant 8 times as many trees, so that&#x27;s 2240 trees, and that&#x27;s just assuming they grow linearly, which they probably don&#x27;t do. And that they are planted in the tropics, which they probably aren&#x27;t, and even if they were there&#x27;s a risk they would be burned down for agriculture within the decade anyway.<p>And that&#x27;s just me with an under average commute driving a mediocre car.<p>Does anyone have a better solution for offsetting carbon?

For example, broader environmental issues like plastic trash. If you&#x27;re throwing carbon in a landfill and it doesn&#x27;t decompose, it&#x27;s not climate change. You may hate it, but it doesn&#x27;t cause climate change, because that carbon went from being on the ground to being in the ground. And I&#x27;m not picking on the left and the green new deal crowed (where climate change is now a jobs, Healthcare and racial reconciliation issue as well).

Ie, people you didn&#x27;t like immigrants before now have arguments telling us how you can&#x27;t solve climate change without restricting immigration :rolleyes:<p>At the end of the day I see two inseparable requirements to solve it: new technologies which let us keep our standard of living without emitting carbon, and a cultural change to accept and desire low carbon substitutes. For example, EVs let you move around without emitting carbon, but they can&#x27;t take off until people&#x27;s attitudes towards ICE vehicles change to associate them with dirtyness.

The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>169 pg PDF [last updated: February|25|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

Everyone goes through the initial shock of complaining about the &quot;ugly markup&quot;, the violation of separation of concerns, etc. But I&#x27;ve worked in enough large codebases to tell you that the ones that use Tailwind have a more consistent UI, with much less handwritten CSS. Bootstrap sites inevitably devolve into a soup of custom CSS and Bootstrap framework. You end up with lots of verbose class declarations like &quot;btn btn-link btn-primary btn-xs danger&quot;, but you still need lots of little `margin-left: 3px` rules to push and pull things into place. Most other CSS libraries suffer the same fate.<p>On the other side of things, sites without a framework generally opt for a convention like &quot;BEM&quot; (block-element-modifier). BEM seems to be the worst of both worlds, both abandoning the &quot;cascading&quot; part of &quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot; and still requiring verbose class names!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a Tailwind project for the last six months with a team of around 8 people.

That we were doing a hard thing, despite having an experienced, capable, and &quot;battle tested&quot; founding team, as well as early revenue that was nothing to sneeze at, was very often a knock against us. Early on, it was kind of hard not to take this a bit personally, but that quickly gave way to shrewd calculating reality.<p>I think this is a perspective that&#x27;s afforded to the VCs who have either the pockets or the connections to carry out the strategy that&#x27;s called out in the OP. Namely, that the startup is probably going to need a lot of money to get to clear product-market fit&#x2F;readiness before being able to really scale.<p>For the throngs of early-stage VCs out there who can&#x27;t write Million Dollar checks more than a couple times a year, there&#x27;s a built-in risk aversion to going after something &quot;deep tech&quot; shaped because they literally can&#x27;t afford it.<p>What worked for us at the end of the day was essentially having larger, later-stage funds who&#x27;d been exposed to or burned by the problems we&#x27;re solving go to bat for us, and also to find very focused &amp; targeted VCs whose thesis about the future of the world aligned very strongly with ours. We&#x27;re very happy with where things ended up.<p>One conflating problem I observed during fundraising was that as it became clear that finding thesis alignment was essential, many VCs go out of their way to appear very generic in their thesis. Though others are great about being very specific. When you find a fund that invests in say biotech, they&#x27;re often really up front about that in numerous obvious ways from their website, to the background of their partners, to their investment portfolio. As a founder not explicitly targeting biotech it is then easy to filter out.<p>However, when it&#x27;s not so cut and dry (I assume because many VCs want as much deal flow as possible), it actually makes the problem worse for both parties. Founders waste time targeting VCs that don&#x27;t make much sense, and VCs waste time talking to founders that don&#x27;t make much sense, but there&#x27;s a natural tension because you&#x27;re both living &amp; dying based on matchmaking with each other, and so it feels like you&#x27;re doing something really irresponsible by clearly signaling and constraining ahead of time who you&#x27;ll talk to.

Ending up there by accident is easier than you&#x27;d think.<p>Fortunately I now have a fully tractable, instrumental plan that goes from 0 to ripping the guts out of a couple FAANG-scale companies:<p>1. Get a well-paying engineering job I&#x27;ll probably hate, because money, quality of life, and sanity all have instrumental value. Hopefully keep the fire alive during this period.<p>2. Work it for about two years, then raise a pre-seed round (at year 9!) to support myself for the next couple of years, while I embark on a formal pre-production phase, and possibly develop an up-to-date prototype&#x2F;PoC.<p>3. Potentially a seed round totaling a few million. Hire a few key people and put together a refined prototype&#x2F;pitch over the course of a year, for a Series A that no high-caliber VC with sufficient funds could refuse.<p>4. At year 12, raise a 100M+ Series A, with the caveat it&#x27;s going to take about a decade to do properly, with further funding rounds along the way.<p>5. Complete the journey, or at least achieve the intended objectives, a decade later at year 22.<p>---<p>I&#x27;m well aware that sounds insane, mostly was just a writing exercise to underscore the timescales involved. The funding requirements are high because it&#x27;s basically a blueprint for something that will become an indispensable part of people&#x27;s every day life, and it consists of multiple verticals all woven together, sharing a common technology. Thinking about how to do this precisely was not trivial and took years.<p>End of the day I&#x27;d rather be skipping to step two, but I&#x27;m ironically out of time at this point. Job it is.<p>In retrospect, a proper plan would have been this:<p>a) Work a job until financially comfortable.<p>b) Do a smaller-scale startup or two.<p>c) Then dream big.<p>Hindsight is of course 20&#x2F;20, and I suspect isolation, desperation, being depressed, being uncomfortable—all those things breed a level of ideation you might otherwise not encounter. It ain&#x27;t recommended, though at least perhaps there&#x27;s a silver lining.<p>---<p>For the most part, the tractability of the plan has only increased with time, not decreased, and I don&#x27;t view competition or someone else figuring it out as a threat.<p>The biggest threat I face actually, is some of my talent pool may be aging out. Of the 50 or so people I&#x27;ve kept an eye on for years and basically dream of hiring on a daily basis, a few key people are in or approaching their 60s.<p>On the bright side, if anyone ever doubts how committed I am in the long-term, it should be easy enough to simply respond that I&#x27;m moving so slow the people I want to hire may end up retiring before I can hire them!"],"time":["2020-02-27 03:33:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mootzville"],"id":[22427685],"kids":{},"parent":[22425745],"text":["Thanks Sam, I needed this reminder."],"time":["2020-02-26 22:44:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trevyn"],"id":[22432406],"kids":{},"parent":[22425745],"text":["Is Sam trying to write like PG?"],"time":["2020-02-27 12:37:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["new_realist"],"id":[22429875],"kids":[22430237],"parent":[22425745],"text":["Translation: the only startups willing to play YC’s sweatshop game are fruit flies; they want meatier deal flow.

And it looks like YC&#x27;s design has stepped up quite a notch too :)<p>Quick question: how to reconcile these two almost-conflicting views:<p>1) Raising money is the CEO’s job. If you are the CEO, you should plan for it to be your sole, full-time focus.[...] Do what you can to avoid distracting others with fundraising. Co-founders or other executives are typically only brought in to answer specific questions (e.g. CTOs handle technical diligence), and usually only at the full partnership stage.<p>Even in the rare case of co-CEOs, it’s best to have a single point of contact. Investors want to see a clear decision-making process, which generally requires a final decision-maker.

The problem comes when they run <i>several<\/i> Electron apps at once, and each comes with its own “base” overhead (i.e. the runtime memory consumption of the browser-runtime as a whole, independent of how many render contexts are open.)<p>Chromium is built to share a lot of things between tabs efficiently, but this economy-of-scale doesn’t translate over into having multiple instances of Chromium running. Each instance gets its own GPU renderer process + font-glyph tile cache, its own network-request cache (i.e. its own in-memory key-value store with its own LRU limit), etc. Running multiple Chromium instances at once is a bit like running multiple copies of an RDBMS on the same machine and expecting them to not fight over memory.<p>Does anyone know what exactly this “base” overhead in Chromium consists of; and, more importantly, how often it changes relative to Chromium releases? Because I’m wondering whether it’d be possible to factor most of it out into a separate layer from the highly-iterated-on “browser engine” DLL stuff (the renderer + DOM + JS layer) into its own sort of “Chromium Core Services” DLL, which could be relatively-more ABI-stable.<p>If you had that factoring-out, you could achieve a pretty good memory + CPU savings just by having Chromium + application frameworks like Electron all share one copy of the Chromium Core Services between them, while keeping their own higher-level “renderer+VM” DLL on top (which would hopefully be pretty stateless in terms of shared state, only adding the ~50MB mmap(2) overhead of the DLL-image itself, and then whatever memory the individual render-contexts consume.)<p>Alternately, of course, you could build Electron as a pseudo-browser where Electron “apps” are just separate windows running in its memory space, and the native Node processes are all just distinct V8 Execution Contexts in the same process.

One day when the MoD is done with that building, perhaps it will open to the public again.  <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stuffaboutlondon.co.uk&#x2F;london&#x2F;henry-viiis-wine-cellar&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stuffaboutlondon.co.uk&#x2F;london&#x2F;henry-viiis-wine-cellar...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-26 17:50:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toyg"],"id":[22421871],"kids":[22422263],"parent":[22421365],"text":["I wonder if the “graffiti artist”\nTom Porter and the recorded stonemason Thomas Parker, are actually the same person.

Disney has quite a number of disparate businesses, from theme parks to streaming services to movies. Chapek is a business guy that has done consumer products and parks (parts of the business that aren&#x27;t huge growth areas), and hasn&#x27;t even been president of parks for that long. He has no experience on the creative side. Usually the future CEO is appointed to a COO&#x2F;President role in order to help them learn the parts of the business they don&#x27;t have experience in. It also helps vet if they&#x27;ll be capable of leading all those business heads, which is how they determined not to go with Tom Staggs after he was made COO. Not doing this is pretty irregular, especially with all the shakeup that occurred with Fox. They&#x27;re still working through a lot of that.<p>Similarly, I don&#x27;t buy the story that Iger is moving into a creative leadership role. It&#x27;s true there&#x27;s been a vacuum there since Lasseter left, but unless there&#x27;s long term tenure planned, Iger won&#x27;t be very influential. Anyone who&#x27;s worked at a large company knows that no one listens to the guy whose only responsibility is to have creative ideas if they have no other real responsibility and will be out in a few months. Iger put himself into a meaningless, insignificant role, and no one has satisfactorily explained why.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a scandal. If there was, the narrative around his departure would be different and he wouldn&#x27;t be sticking out to the end of his contract. He wouldn&#x27;t still be chairman of the board. I&#x27;ve heard a rumor the board is upset about Star Wars, but Q1 2020 was pretty solid and Mandalorian was well received. I&#x27;m actually worried he&#x27;s sick, though I hope not because I admire him a lot. Regardless, I do feel like there&#x27;s another shoe.

Sequestration (CCS) and solar shades (SRM) are the primary, big-$tretch approaches that are most readily-apparent to moderating insolation. CCS seems much more doable than sending a giant blackout curtain into space or spraying tons of SO2 into the air to return as acid rain.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing about CCS: direct air capture is like a junior engineer&#x27;s naive, brute-force solution because it&#x27;s way too expensive and not scalable for the several teratons that need to be sequestered.<p>Bio CCS remediation approaches are superior because they use biology to do more of the work for less resources. Kelp, phytoplankton (including ferrous seeding) and other ocean-based CC are the natural solutions to lock-up carbon. There&#x27;s a massive kelp forest right now off the Yucatan in Mexico stretching nearly to Africa. Harvesting, expanding and fertilizing such an ecosystem with an army of specialized ships seems like a better plan for tackling it. Such a plan would still require assuring the Sequestration in CCS such that biomass sinks to deep ocean trenches OR harvesting, compacting and pumping underground. If we can manage and offset GHGs down to a sane level at some point in the future, then it should be an immutable prime-directive that GHGs cannot be emitted without first purchasing or accomplishing an equivalent assured CCS.<p>PS: As luck would have it, I happen to subscribe to several climatology and related academics on various video platforms, including Paul Beckwith, who does a good job of summarizing the latest research and underscoring events and trends.
