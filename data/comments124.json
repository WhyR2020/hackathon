You end up coding around the spacer component or not using it entirely for some situations which makes the whole approach kinda useless.<p>The approach I take is the &quot;pass your own classname&quot;-approach. Im sure somebody has found a fancy name for it.<p>Having a componenent A:<p><pre><code>  const A = ({ className }) =&gt; (\n    &lt;div className={`${COMPONENT_CLASSNAME} ${className}`}&gt;\n      Hello, World!\n    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n  )\n<\/code><\/pre>\nYou can then just pass your own classname from the parent into the child component. If your component A does not define any margins, it should be easy to define those and not break anything. As simple as that. I find that to be way more flexible than a spacer component, because most of the time, spacing depends <i>heavily<\/i> on context. The spacing component therefore either becomes too complex and unwieldy or does not get used at all.<p>The approach from above does have a drawback: if you dont pass a className to your component, the resulting class attribute will contain &quot;COMPONENT_CLASSNAME undefined&quot;. I have not found that to ever be a problem, although if you really want to, you can also write the template string as follows to mitigate this:<p><pre><code>  `${COMPONENT_CLASSNAME} ${!!className ? className : &quot;&quot;}`\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBut I do find that to be unnecessarily verbose."],"time":["2020-03-24 20:15:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["disillusion"],"id":[22682742],"kids":{},"parent":[22676442],"text":["In my experience, margin isn&#x27;t harmful. Using a container to space components relative to each other is harmful.<p>In fact, using margin correctly can prevent an explosion of exceptions on the relative positioning of your components. It also brings you more in line with how a designer thinks.<p>Consider this: one of the things a designer takes into consideration is composition and whitespace. In effect, this means that distances between components might change, depending on what their layout is, and what components are situated around it.<p>When you have a wrapper component, you can set some sensible spacing defaults for its children. But some components visually need more breathing room, while others need less. This depends on the design of the component. It also depends on what components comes before or after, so a simple padding won&#x27;t suffice. Two visually heavy components need more space in between as compared to two that are visually airy. You&#x27;ll eventually end up with a long list of + selectors to precisely tune every single combination. This quickly gets out of hand. With or without a wrapper element, those exceptions must be applied somewhere.<p>However, when using margins, you avoid all that. Since margins collapse, you can be assured that any combination of components has the minimum amount of whitespace between them, determined by who needs the most. Now this isn&#x27;t perfect, but it gets pretty close; any component that needs a bit more breathing room can force a larger distance. This way, you might still have one or two combination exceptions, but these will be rare.<p>So, looking at it like this, margins _are_ a property of the component itself: it&#x27;s the equivalent of a guy stretching his arms out and saying &quot;don&#x27;t come too close, I need my space!&quot;."],"time":["2020-03-25 08:55:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["neya"],"id":[22677879],"kids":[22677987,22678217],"parent":[22676442],"text":["Call me old school if you like, but the cleaner solution in my eyes are to create well-defined CSS classes for such margins and use them in my designs.<p><pre><code>    &lt;div class=&quot;margin-10&quot;&gt;..&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;margin-20&quot;&gt;..&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;margin-30&quot;&gt;..&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\nis MUCH cleaner than:<p><pre><code>    &lt;div space={3}&gt;..&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n    &lt;div space={4}&gt;..&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe difference being, first of all, I don&#x27;t need to dig into the source to see what `space` does.

Nothing can clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old crufty comment that propagates lies and misinformation.<p>Comments are not like Schindler&#x27;s List. They are not &quot;pure good.&quot; Indeed, comments are, at best, a necessary evil. If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need comments very much -- perhaps not at all.<p>The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration.<p>So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it through and see whether there isn&#x27;t some way to turn the tables and express yourself in code. Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression.<p>Previous related Discussions on NH:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073230\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073230<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073620\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8073620<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;285787&#x2F;clean-code-comments-vs-class-documentation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2857...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-25 02:09:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["irrational"],"id":[22678191],"kids":[22678255],"parent":[22677970],"text":["The biggest benefit to markdown is even if every parser was deleted and nobody every wrote a new parser, all markdown documents would still be readable.

However, I strongly disagree with the conclusions here in practice. A lot of this boils down to &quot;other tools are better,&quot; and that&#x27;s true, but the issue is that it&#x27;s really, really hard to get people to write documentation, and handing them a perfect but complex tool means they&#x27;re less likely to actually go through with it.<p>I&#x27;ve written every kind of documentation in Markdown, and it&#x27;s not a panacea, but it does work. I&#x27;ll talk about the article&#x27;s points first, though:<p>&gt; Lack of specification<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonmark.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonmark.org&#x2F;<\/a>. It&#x27;s not perfect, but GFM and it are (slowly) unifying. Pick one, document that that&#x27;s the one you support, and you&#x27;re done.<p>&gt; Flavors<p>See answer 1.<p>&gt; Lack of Extensibility<p>While it does not have an extension system, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t do it. As long as you only add things, you should be good to go. Most things you&#x27;d want that aren&#x27;t in the spec proper have some sort of existing extension that will solve your problems.<p>This is not ideal, but it&#x27;s also not insurmountable. This is the only true negative I agree with on this list, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the end of the world.<p>&gt; Lack of Semantic Meaning.<p>While this is true in a sense, at the same time, CommonMark lets you put any string on a code fence, which means that you can add whatever sematnic you&#x27;d like.<p>&gt; Markdown is now dependent on specific HTML classes, and page design<p>No more dependent on those classes than on whatever other semantic marker you were trying to do, and if you want to change them, do what you&#x27;d have to do with the semantic: configure your tooling to put out something else.<p>&gt; Document content is no longer portable to other output formats<p>This problem would still exist if semantics were there; someone has to write the mapping.<p>&gt; Conversion to other markup tools and page designs becomes much harder<p>I disagree, but there&#x27;s also no justification, so it&#x27;s hard to respond.<p>&gt; Lock-In and Lack of Portability.<p>This is a non-issue in practice. It&#x27;s just like any other format.<p>-------------------------------------<p>All of Rust&#x27;s documentation is in Markdown. We&#x27;ve overcome these challenges in a few ways:<p>* Choosing CommonMark<p>* Defining some additional, backwards-compatible with regular Markdown semantics. If you don&#x27;t use them, you won&#x27;t get as nice of an output in some cases, but if you do, stuff is a lot nicer. This includes things like &quot;Show an icon to indicate that this does not compile&quot; or &quot;run this code sample as a test&quot; or &quot;this is a summary line and then this is a body.&quot;<p>* Writing Markdown to other format compilers. The Rust book (540 pages for its first printing) was written 100% in Markdown. Our editors don&#x27;t use Markdown, they use Word. Carol, my co-author, wrote a DOCX to Markdown compiler in XSLT[1]. We write Markdown, compile it to HTML, concatenate it all into one big document, and send it to them. They open it in Word, they leave comments, we take the resulting DOCX, compile it back to Markdown, and address things.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;book&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tools&#x2F;docx-to-md.xsl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;book&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tools&#x2F;docx-to-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-24 20:29:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["freeopinion"],"id":[22678177],"kids":{},"parent":[22677161],"text":["I&#x27;m guessing the author doesn&#x27;t like reStructuredText either."],"time":["2020-03-24 20:42:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mattl"],"id":[22677928],"kids":{},"parent":[22677161],"text":["Both alternatives look like garbage as plain text."],"time":["2020-03-24 20:17:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bediger4000"],"id":[22677752],"kids":{},"parent":[22677161],"text":["At least he&#x27;s not vehemently advocating Word."],"time":["2020-03-24 19:58:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["xapata"],"id":[22677956],"kids":{},"parent":[22677161],"text":["rST fits all the goals of both sides of this argument.

As such, this is more than just an engineering role, as, although you can code and develop remotely, you&#x27;ll be expected to go into the hospitals every now and then to talk with the users directly, understand their needs, design solutions with them, and iterate on the results.<p>Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix&#x2F;Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.<p>Email me if interested at sam@vetspire.com (include &quot;HN&quot; in the subject)."],"time":["2020-03-23 18:34:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jeremeholiman"],"id":[22666314],"kids":{},"parent":[22665398],"text":["Clyde | NYC, NY | Full Time | Currently remote during quarantine | FS Engineers (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joinclyde.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;about#jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joinclyde.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;about#jobs<\/a>)<p>Clyde empowers businesses—from startups to enterprises—to offer extended warranties and accident protection to their customers.

On the backend, our APIs are built in Scala, with Go and Java powering some of our custom services.<p>We are excited by people who want to constantly innovate; borrow from other industries, experiment with new tools and pool their knowledge with other solution seekers; people who have shipped entire projects with ownership and autonomy; people who take pride in what gets built, all the whilst balancing day-to-day pragmatism with building for the future.<p>Current open roles:\n- Backend Software Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4586921002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4586921002<\/a>\n - Systems Software Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002<\/a>\n - Security Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4629664002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4629664002<\/a>\n - Frontend Software Engineer (Performance)  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4363932002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4363932002<\/a>\n - Frontend Software Engineer (Design system) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4655086002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4655086002<\/a>\n-Site Reliability Engineer\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4370269002<\/a>\n-Technical Support Administrator\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4675597002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4675597002<\/a><p>Tech stack: Scala, Go, GraphQL, ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, DynamoDB, AWS SQS, AWS Kinesis, Docker, Terraform, AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus, AWS &amp; Linux.<p>Apply: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tray.io&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tray.io&#x2F;jobs<\/a> or get in touch with london-talent@tray.io"],"time":["2020-03-24 16:20:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
