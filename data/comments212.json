Unfortunately the school of thought is still seen as\npseudoscience!  Oh well, what a world...<p>Anyway, the &quot;machine code&quot; of thought is called &quot;submodalities&quot; in NLP\njargon, an (outmoded) model of &quot;microcode&quot; is called &quot;strategies&quot; but\nthat&#x27;s deprecated (I don&#x27;t know how to succinctly describe the replacement\nmodels, and many of them don&#x27;t have names), etc.  Using the patterns and\nalgorithms discovered or reified by the NLP folks you can rapidly and\neasily reprogram your mind.

See also Brenda Laurel&#x27;s\n&quot;Computers as Theatre&quot;.<p>[2]  For example there&#x27;s a spelling &quot;strategy&quot; that involve using visual\nmemory to recall the word (as a picture) and a kinethestic check for\ncorrectness.

Using floats and rounding at some fixed precision before rounding to penny precision is basically exactly the same as using integer multiples of whatever you&#x27;re first rounding the float to. So you&#x27;re basically not using floating point anymore, you&#x27;re just using a float type to represent fixed point integers. The problem as I see it here is that you need to be careful to round to the fixed precision at the right places. The easiest way to not miss a place is to do it after every operation, and the best way to do that is to abstract your money type as a class. So now what we&#x27;re comparing is a fixed point class holding a float vs an int. In my opinion, holding an int is the better option, because it&#x27;s slightly more obvious when the values overflow the maximum range of that integer than when the precision of the float drops below your fixed point rounding delta.

Interestingly, almost all processor architectures natively implement symmetric division.<p>&gt;What is the difference between the two types? In floored division, the quotient is truncated toward minus infinity (remember, this is integer division we’re talking about). In symmetric division, the quotient is truncated toward zero, which means that depending on the sign of the dividend, the quotient can be truncated in different directions. This is the source of its evil.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forth-standard.org&#x2F;standard&#x2F;core&#x2F;FMDivMOD\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forth-standard.org&#x2F;standard&#x2F;core&#x2F;FMDivMOD<\/a><p>&gt;Rationale:<p>&gt;By introducing the requirement for &quot;floored&quot; division, Forth 83 produced much controversy and concern on the part of those who preferred the more common practice followed in other languages of implementing division according to the behavior of the host CPU, which is most often symmetric (rounded toward zero). In attempting to find a compromise position, this standard provides primitives for both common varieties, floored and symmetric (see SM&#x2F;REM). FM&#x2F;MOD is the floored version.<p>&gt;The committee considered providing two complete sets of explicitly named division operators, and declined to do so on the grounds that this would unduly enlarge and complicate the standard. Instead, implementors may define the normal division words in terms of either FM&#x2F;MOD or SM&#x2F;REM providing they document their choice. People wishing to have explicitly named sets of operators are encouraged to do so. FM&#x2F;MOD may be used, for example, to define:<p><pre><code>    : &#x2F;_MOD ( n1 n2 -- n3 n4) &gt;R S&gt;D R&gt; FM&#x2F;MOD ;\n\n    : &#x2F;_ ( n1 n2 -- n3) &#x2F;_MOD SWAP DROP ;\n\n    : _MOD ( n1 n2 -- n3) &#x2F;_MOD DROP ;\n\n    : *&#x2F;_MOD ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 n5) &gt;R M* R&gt; FM&#x2F;MOD ;\n\n    : *&#x2F;_ ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 ) *&#x2F;_MOD SWAP DROP ;<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-01-25 16:33:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22148224],"kids":{},"parent":[22145189],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-25 20:47:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["favorited"],"id":[22143607],"kids":[22145379,22144524,22145130],"parent":[22140268],"text":["The article&#x27;s update provides the reason:<p>&gt; Last year, The Tetris Company, Inc. and N3TWORK announced a multi-year agreement where N3TWORK will be the exclusive developer and publisher of new Tetris® games for mobile devices worldwide, excluding China.

Politics, echo chambers, moderation, etc. The site itself is diverse. The main preferences in voting are people that just want deep tech vs people that want human side and&#x2F;or political (most far-left-leaning). There&#x27;s plenty in between who submit links, drop in randomly, etc. These two are just most vocal about preferences. If not haters or trolling, then moderators let visibility be determined by votes w&#x2F; worst collapsed, not deleted. Deletes and bans are rare with constructive criticism from community being most common.<p>3. Experts. Lobsters comments has higher expert-to-non-expert ratio on a lot of topics due to its model. HN&#x27;s model and long history gives it a higher volume of experts and expert comments. The two are also usually different even on same article or topic. Reading both sites is best for maximizing expertise.<p>Dan, I appreciate the list you posted illustrating No 3 since I&#x27;ve needed that on most of the occasions I&#x27;ve described HN&#x27;s diverse array of experts to people not on the site.

Of course nobody is making sure that all these properties and property edits are inter-consistent, and you find that because of this even adding properties to Tom has somehow become difficult.

Keeping a copy here for those who aren&#x27;t reading the comments section. I have noticed this a lot in various websites I have helped in ad campaigns. Their biggest problem is their landing page. Just like this article uses lots of jargons to explain simple concepts, their landing page reflects the same. For those of you wanting to know more about landing page optimization just watch Isaac Rudansky&#x27;s excellent videos on Udemy. One of the most important rules is the 5 second test. Show your landing page to your colleagues&#x2F;friends&#x2F;family depending on your target audience. If they can&#x27;t understand what your business proposition is in 5 seconds you have failed landing page optimization. As simple as that.<p>The comment I posted on the IndieHackers page:<p>------------------<p>The landing page is too complex. Like what does &quot;Full stack adaptive delivery&quot; even mean? I am sure 90% of your paid visitors are just bouncing because that landing page tagline is alien to them. Dumb it down. Make it simple.<p>Surprisingly, the description in the Indiehackers page makes so much more sense than the one you put up: &quot;File-system-as-a-service that does uploads, storage, and media processing for Web and mobile apps, so you can ship products faster and scale them painlessly&quot;<p>If you told me that the first time I would have understood your value proposition. Don&#x27;t get too fancy with your taglines. People don&#x27;t have time to understand what you are saying. People don&#x27;t like fancy terminologies except for what is popular. There are too many jargons already. Don&#x27;t complicate it further.<p>Instead of &quot;Full stack adaptive delivery&quot; just try: &quot;File-system-as-service&quot;. Instead of &quot;Serve ultimate UX with better images on any website. One script to rule them all.&quot; just have: &quot;Ship products faster with better images on any website&quot;. That&#x27;s it.

Cable channels produced “disruptor lists.” Some observers said the term’s use added sophistication to any discussion. Others complained it was overused. Various forms of it regularly pop up in discussions about sports, for example. To his chagrin, users often apply it as a synonym for anything new or transformative, not understanding Christensen’s actual theory. The ubiquity worried him.<p>&gt; “If we call every business success a ‘disruption,’ then companies that rise to the top in very different ways will be seen as sources of insight into a common strategy for succeeding,” he once said. “This creates a danger:<p>&gt; Managers may mix and match behaviors that are very likely inconsistent with one another and thus unlikely to yield the hoped-for result.”<p><i>THIS<\/i>. I witness this so many times a week.<p>People do not understand what the terms really means and <i>the difference that makes the difference<\/i>.<p>This ends up being the source of misunderstanding when people says &quot;X works&quot; and &quot;X does not work.&quot;<p>&quot;Agile&quot;, &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; and &quot;Cloud&quot; in the workplace are others terms that are commonly misused.<p>In private life &quot;intermittent fasting&quot; and &quot;meditation&quot; come to mind.<p>If somebody is successful at something or they have something that work, I am always ask about the process or giving me a real example of what they are talking about.<p>Make the right distinctions is so critical to properly model their success.<p>&gt; He second-guessed the wording of the label, but never the theory. Even after he changed his terminology to disruptive innovation, he saw flaws.<p>&gt;“What we didn’t anticipate, and what in many ways was a fault of mine,” he told Quartz in 2016, “was that the term disruption has so many different connotations in the English language, that it allows people to justify whatever they want to do as, ‘Oh, this is disruptive,’ and they don’t ever read the book. The population of people where the fewest have read the book are venture capitalists. They are arrogant and smart and why do they need to read something?”<p>&gt; He wished he’d created something less expressive.<p>This is so true.

If such data is needed or important in a case, a judge can call my doctor to testify, to answer specific questions, and that&#x27;s the absolute limit of government access.\n2) Any data you record on me you need to specify what it will be cross-referenced with, for companies, but ESPECIALLY if you are the government. There must not be any consequences for saying &quot;no&quot;.

It&#x27;d be much more similar to imdb perhaps, owned by Amazon.

It requires multiple actual humans involved, like for .com having the right person actually pick up the phone at the registrar and get in touch with Verisign. Cloudflare offers it for example, but only for their enterprise class Custom Domain Protection [1] service, which they explicitly describe as &quot;high touch&quot; or &quot;very manual&quot;, since the whole point is that it&#x27;s a fully offline&#x2F;out-of-band communication requirement.<p>In principle it seems to me that there could be a &quot;per-incident&quot; price model that would more accessible to more general DNS users who setup their core domain DNS and touch it once a decade, where a flat upfront $200 payment (spit balling) enables Registry Lock and two uses, after which the fee must be paid again for more. The idea here is that you&#x27;d directly be paying the $100&#x2F;hour or whatever it costs a couple of engineers to take time for this each time, on the logic you&#x27;d be using it very infrequently. This would avoid ongoing subscription costs which might be easier to justify for non-enterprises, while still being feasible for a registrar. I don&#x27;t know of anyone who does this though.<p>A lot I think ultimately really does come down to the registry itself and their specific security practices, as well as fundamental tensions between stopping alterations by unauthorized people while enabling recovery by authorized-but-forgot-password-or-token-broke-or[...]-people. Supporting hardware factors for example is great, but if support can just override them that&#x27;s a hole. Conversely there needs to be some fallback procedure for if a token breaks (maybe a super long key written down and put in a vault, maybe based on payment information). Some methods can be real footguns too, my current registrar for example offers IP address&#x2F;range restriction options, but it&#x27;s not hard to see how that could come back around to bite you in the butt in an emergency if not used quite carefully. It&#x27;s one of many tough problems due to the ongoing primitive state of electronic authentication I guess.<p><i>Edit to add<\/i>: useful direct quote on Register vs Registry Lock from their initial enterprise-only CloudFlare registrar launch [2]:<p>&gt;<i>&quot;Many registrars support Registrar Lock, which prevents the registry from altering information unless the lock is explicitly removed. The problem is, if an attacker compromises your registrar account, they can unlock it and make whatever changes they want.<\/i>&quot;<p>&gt;<i>&quot;Registry Lock prevents changes by any registrar until the lock is removed. Unlocking at the registry level requires out-of-band communication between the registrar and Verisign (the global registry operator for several top-level domains), and is thus very manual. Since most registrars are volume operations, it’s very difficult to find one that takes the time to literally pick up the phone and call Verisign every time someone makes a change to their DNS settings.&quot;<\/i><p>So yeah I&#x27;m sure that stops attackers real well, but not exactly scalable. &quot;[I]f you’re an organization where losing your domains would be a front-page story...&quot; indeed!<p>----<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;registrar&#x2F;custom-domain-protection&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;registrar&#x2F;custom-domain-...<\/a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;introducing-cloudflare-registrar&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;introducing-cloudflare-registrar...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-24 20:29:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jkingsbery"],"id":[22141213],"kids":[22144565],"parent":[22136405],"text":["&gt; They then told the students to go up the hallway to a different room where there would be another test.

In that room you&#x27;ll find a mechanical wooden-and-string toy on a table. If you interact with it, the symbol on the base changes, and the toy performs some sort of action (I think dropping a weight) some number of times. From that you can deduce that the symbols are numbers, and the toy is for teaching what number each of the symbols represents.<p>If you&#x27;re playing correctly, you&#x27;ve got some scratch paper handy (I used a drawing app) and you can write down each symbol and what number it corresponds to. And you&#x27;d better do this, because you&#x27;re going to see a lot of important numbers in the game, and this is the only way they are written.<p>Towards the end of the game, you find a journal from one of the characters, which is written in English. However, when referring to the Age (the game&#x27;s term for different worlds) that they&#x27;ve gone to, they use these numerals.

It is split into two ORFs (ORF8a and -b) in most\nhuman SARS-CoVs from late-phase patients due to a deletion\nevent in this part of the genome (3).

I did this for several reasons: environmental, force myself to walk and get more exercise, and it lets me joke about being poor.
