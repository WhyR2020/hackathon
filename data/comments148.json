Here are some of\nthe things I am doing to improve my C skills to match with some of the\nadmired&#x2F;professional developers.<p>Decide which platform to use<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Unfortunately, to become proficient in it we need to write code and focus on a\nplatform. I have been fighting between whether to develop on Windows vs Linux. I\nam very experienced in Windows environment(using debuggers&#x2F;cl&#x2F;linkers&#x2F;Windbg\netc) but when it comes to writing good quality C code(not C++) and for learning\nhow to write good maintainable moderately large source code, my research showed\nthat Windows compilers&#x2F;C standard APIs are not great, in fact they hinder your\nproductivity. I have wasted countless number of hours to just figure out how to\nproperly create a simple C project with a decent build system. Unfortunately, I\ncould not find one. The closest I could find is CMake as MSBuild is a nightmare\nto work with. I even tried NMAKE but failed. When it comes to documentation of\nfinding basic C Api usage,\nMSDN(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;c-runtime-library&#x2F;run-time-routines-by-category\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;c-runtime-library&#x2F;run-t...<\/a>)\ndoes a decent job. But in the name of security you will find zillion\nvariations(<i>_s, <\/i>_l) of an API and by default msvc compiler will not let you use\nsome of the API in their simple forms. Instead, you have to define\n_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS etc. I think for someone just getting started to\ndevelop&#x2F;learn to write a decent code base in C these restrictions really\nhinder the productivity. So finally, I have decided to instead focus my learning\non Linux platform(currently through WSL - Windows subsystem for Linux) with its\nPOSIX apis. You know what, `man 3 printf` or `man 3 strlen` is soooooo much\nbetter than googling msdn<p>Mastering C<p>~~~~~~~<p>I think, the simple and straight answer here is reading good code and writing\n&quot;good&quot; code and also reading good C content(be it books or articles). I think\nthese are the three ingredients necessary to get started. Of all the open source\nprojects that I have investigated, I found Linux Kernel and related projects\nseems to have very good taste in terms of code quality. Currently, I am just\nfocused how they use the language rather than what they actually do in the\nproject. Things like, how they structure the project, how they name things, how\nthey use types, how they create structures, how they pass structures to\nfunction, how they use light weight object based constructs, how they handle\nerrors in function(for example forward only goto exits), how they use\nsigned&#x2F;unsigned variables etc(more of my learnings to the end), how they use\ntheir own data structures. I think its good to initially focus&#x2F;target on ANSI C\nAPI with C99 instead of heavily relying on the OS specific API on which ever\nplatform you choose. For example, such projects could be writing binary file\nparsers for example projects like .ISO file format etc.<p>Good C projects&#x2F;articles<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>1.

(Aside from purely academic ones for you to learn.) The point of a programming language is to help humans write safe and correct code. In this sense, C has completely failed. The syntax itself is just begging you to make a subtle mistake. And due to lack of memory safety, even the most well tested and scrutinized projects in C&#x2F;C++ (such as Chromium) suffer from buffer overflows or memory leaks, potential security vulnerabilities that are automatically prevented by design in other languages.

Just this evening I was looking in the HN repository for the last version of the code that pg wrote, to remind myself how he used to do something.<p>One of my favorite tricks is to make a file out of all the changes in the history:<p><pre><code>  git log -p &gt; bigass\n<\/code><\/pre>\nand then grep through the file (edit: which I like to do in Emacs—hence the file) to see every appearance of some construct. There&#x27;s a lot of knowledge in there. It&#x27;s particularly useful when you remember that you did something, but forget how you did it.<p>In fact, I use git proactively this way, to store things in the version history that I might want to remember later. For example, if I write exploratory code to test out a feature or throwaway code to do some analysis—anything I might want to use again, but don&#x27;t want to commit to the codebase—I&#x27;ll add it as a commit and then immediately revert the commit (i.e. make a new commit that deletes what I just added). The codebase remains unchanged, but what I just did is now there forever for future me to recover.<p>Such an approach only works if your system is small, but I like to work on small systems and prevent them from becoming large systems. There&#x27;s a beneficial feedback loop here: as you get comfortable working with history, it gives you more confidence to delete things, helping to keep the system small.<p>I&#x27;ve also found this technique useful for solving the chronic problem with documentation: that it inevitably fails to get updated. When I write something about the code, I commit it and, as above, immediately revert the commit. Now it&#x27;s permanently glued to the state of the code when I wrote it. When I read it in the future, I can do so alongside a diff of the code from then to now.

Frequently, they will have half a dozen commits with the same message -sometimes even unrelated commits because they got a bit too lazy-. Most Jira tasks don&#x27;t have a description. If it&#x27;s a new development, the documentation is generally elsewhere and the Jira task has no description <i>at all<\/i>. If it&#x27;s a bug, it may have some screenshot attached, and it sometimes has an explanation but generally the explanation is given verbally to the developer.<p>A handful of developers heard The Architect say once that it&#x27;s preferable to submit one commit for each changed file than to put two unrelated changes in the same commit, and so they do. They change 12 different files for a certain feature and they will make 12 separate commits, one file each. Not always one after the other but sometimes dispersed through the day. One or two developers obsessively commit each single change they do. Meaning they write a couple of lines of code, commit it, and <i>then<\/i> try it, see it wasn&#x27;t correct -there was a typo, it wasn&#x27;t the correct field they needed, whatever-, edit again, commit again, etc.<p>They have a certain backup process which stores a handful of XML log files from some processes; they store them by committing them to the SVN repo. A commit every hour, in the <i>development<\/i> branch.<p>They have a flow with two branches, <i>trunk<\/i> and <i>development<\/i>, and a 6 month cycle for releases... It sort of works this way:<p>Start (theoretical): People develop on <i>development<\/i>. Two -or two and a half- months before release, they make &quot;the switch&quot;. Everybody commits whatever they are doing at the moment and stops for a day. They merge <i>development<\/i> into <i>trunk<\/i>. and then they all start working on <i>trunk<\/i> for the rest of the cycle until release.<p>In that final period, <i>trunk<\/i> is mostly &quot;open&quot; -more on this later- and people just commit to it and that&#x27;s it. <i>development<\/i> is abandoned and deleted. A new <i>development<\/i> branch is taken from <i>trunk<\/i> but is not generally used during this period.<p>When release time comes, <i>trunk<\/i> is tagged with the version. Everybody switches back to the new <i>development<\/i> and development is done there. But this is not what happens because there&#x27;s another period of maybe one or two months, where <i>trunk<\/i> -the released version- has a number of a. bugs, b. stuff that was unfinished, c. smaller things which &quot;well, we could do it on <i>trunk<\/i> because it&#x27;s just a small thing&quot;. So, what happens is they go on working on <i>trunk<\/i> for that month or two, and only gradually people start working on <i>development<\/i>.<p>Also, they don&#x27;t really tag <i>trunk<\/i> at release time because it&#x27;s not &quot;done&quot; yet. When the bug hunting season is over -or when they are just tired of it- then they tag and freeze <i>trunk<\/i>, with the version, move it into storage. Nothing in this is really planned. They just decide one day and then tell people, who just rush whatever they were doing on <i>trunk<\/i> and commit it, or abandon it and move to <i>development<\/i>.<p>During both pre-release and post-release periods, merges are done about once or twice a week from <i>trunk<\/i> to <i>development<\/i>. If you use SVN you&#x27;ll know that these merges are seen as a single commit in the receiving branch. You <i>can<\/i> see the full history if you query the merge info, but it&#x27;s not shown directly in the main &quot;svn log&quot;.<p>All this means they have:<p>- about 40% automated commits from some backup process.<p>- Most changes happening <i>in the other branch<\/i>, so you need to go through <i>mergeinfo<\/i> several times.<p>- Main <i>development<\/i> branches deleted and created new every so often.<p>- Most people <i>not<\/i> explaining what they did in commit messages.<p>- About half of the bugs in Jira not describing the problem and almost all of the tasks not explaining the work to be done.<p>So... do we ever truly use the revision history?<p>Yes.<p>A few people -particularly Karen- use it to drop the blame on whoever they want. They get a bug, they open the svn log for something related, see a name they don&#x27;t like much and say &quot;Ok, just assign this to X, because they did something on that file 4 months ago&quot;.<p>I am using it, sometimes -with some effort and some success- to try to understand just where do some heavily copy-pasted snippets come from, so that I can wipe them out for good. Also, sometimes I use it just to write in my diary and laugh a bit about it so I don&#x27;t cry so much when I get up in the morning.

The concept of the Short Duration Personal Savior (or ShorDurPerSav, the proper Tibetian term) is a new one-- traditional religions tend to emphasize &quot;unwavering servitude&quot; over convenience. But is absolute devotion to one savior always best? Buddha is a wonderful role model for certain aspects of life, but when that po&#x27;bucker shoves you out of the way as he walks by, don&#x27;t you wish that you worshipped George Foreman instead, if only for the next few minutes?<p>&gt;Well, you can! The Church of the SubGenius heartily endorses the concept of disposable saviors, or ShorDurPerSavs. Choose your messiah to fit the situation. If peace and compassion are what you need right now, follow the teachings of Gandhi. Later, when you need to cut a business deal, emulate the wisdom of Sam Walton. When you need a witty remark on the spot, let Samuel Clemens into your heart to inspire you. And when you need Slack in your life, sell your soul to &quot;Bob&quot;.<p>&gt;&quot;Bob&quot; is the most frequently invoked of our infinitely varied Short Duration Personal Saviors, with good reason. He has Slack--he IS Slack. He symbolizes the &quot;easy life&quot;, where one follows the Path of Least Resistance and gains Slack effortlessly. But no one is expected to worship &quot;Bob&quot; 24&#x2F;7! If you&#x27;re trying to get that PC to work, choosing &quot;Bob&quot; as your ShorDurPerSav will hinder you far more than helping you! &quot;Bob&quot; couldn&#x27;t use a PC if he wanted to (though he sold more of them last year than IBM and Packard Bell put together)! Read through Stephen Levy&#x27;s _Hackers_ and let the TMRC be your ShorDurPerSavs!

At under $200, it&#x27;s not the height of bling, but still an order of magnitude above the cheapest thing that could possibly work. I bought it after handling almost everything in a shop specializing in Japanese knives, and I selected it largely based on its feel and balance.<p>It is much better at cutting things than any other kitchen knife I&#x27;ve used (yes, most were properly sharpened), though compared to German knives around $100, its advantage for me as a home cook is mostly that it feels good to cut with, not that I couldn&#x27;t do all the same things with a cheaper, lower-performing knife. The difference in performance comes from the blade stock being thinner, the grind being convex instead of flat, and the blade being thinner immediately behind the sharpened edge.<p>There are downsides: the steel is not stainless, and being much harder than a typical German knife makes it prone to chip if it accidentally contacts something hard.
