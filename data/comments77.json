If your MVP is filled with bugs, it isn&#x27;t actually viable. You should also focus on making an MVP that people actually want. If it isn&#x27;t solving a real problem (&quot;loveable&quot;), it&#x27;s not actually a product.<p>In other words, increase the polish of your initial releases by making them smaller and including fewer features.

This is mostly just playing semantic games and allowing WP Engine to subtly imply that they&#x27;re better at building polished products than other companies.<p>How do you make something simple? You make it do less stuff. That&#x27;s what &quot;minimal&quot; means. What does &quot;loveable&quot; mean? It means you&#x27;re solving an actual problem -- you have a real Product. How do you build an SLC? You radically cut down on the number of features you plan to ship in an initial product, to the point where you have time to polish them in your initial release. That sounds a lot like an MVP to me.<p>If WP Engine just put up an article saying, &quot;our software is always very polished and very usable, even in the first release&quot;, nobody would care.

The Pi 4 uses 1mb of L2. I can&#x27;t find anything about the 905 except that it has L3 cache. The maximum L2 for A55 is 256kb. L3 can go up to 4MB. The s922x launched middle of last year and seems to have had 1mb of cache on it&#x27;s A73 cores, so I would guess at less than that for a lower-end chip. In any case, I&#x27;d put cache as equal at best.<p>Pi 4 uses 1-4gb LPDDR4-3200 vs some DDR4-1320 on the odroid. No matter how you slice it though, something weird is going on here.<p>There is a default clockspeed difference (1.5GHz vs 2.0GHz), but it isn&#x27;t nearly as large as the actual performance per clock difference. Since the 905 is apparently rated to run at 1.9GHz, I suspect they slightly overclocked the chips in their devices. I&#x27;d note that overclocking the Pi 4 to 2.0GHz is easily doable, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to do that as it can lower the life expectancy of the chip (given the 8-stage A55 pipeline, I doubt that the 905 has much overclocking overhead).<p>On paper, the Pi 4 should be way faster at most of these things, so it must be elsewhere.<p>The first stop is data storage. SD cards suck. They suck so much that a spinning drive can usually get better performance. They desperately need to launch a new Pi with a SATA port or PCIe port for a faster drive. eMMC is a much better default option. The Pi loading benchmarks get 2-4x faster (sometimes more) when a USB3 SSD is used. On the flip side though, if a benchmark sits in RAM, you aren&#x27;t going to notice a difference unless their benches are including load time. That may be fine for a few things, but it should be stated and it simply doesn&#x27;t apply to a lot of real-world uses (for example, loading a browser may be a little slower, but opening and using web pages will not).<p>The next question is thermals. The 28nm Pi with larger cores definitely gets hotter and throttles more than the 12nm smaller A55 cores. If they shoved the pi into the default enclosure without a heatsink, it would definitely throttle hard which would affect benchmarks significantly. I fully expect this to be responsible for a large percentage of the performance disparity over what would be expected. Testing the raw Pi would be much more fair. A small heatsink would be more than fair and a fan would be overly-generous (seriously, pi foundation needs to recommend and sell a heatsink and redo their case design to accommodate a fan). I&#x27;d love for this to also be disclosed.<p>The next issue is insidious and veers much closer to evil. Using the same OS when possible should be a prerequisite for fair comparisons.

I switched from Rasbian and there was a <i>very<\/i> noticeable increase in performance.

For no extra pay. They don&#x27;t tend to get things like bonus pay at the end of the year, common among the HN crowd. Essential workers, most especially the ones stocking grocery stores full of jerks who refuse to wear masks or socially distance, likewise have no health care rights. They don&#x27;t get bonus pay. If they get sick and are out of work for two months, they aren&#x27;t assured they will be paid for time they didn&#x27;t work. HN doesn&#x27;t care about that.

Whatever that is.<p>And very little is recognized on HN about the consequences about &quot;reopening&quot; or &quot;resuming&quot; the economy on health care workers. It is a defacto demand: we own you; you are our slaves; you must work to protect us; work harder; sacrifice your lives; and above all, when the inevitably higher case load explodes you will choose who lives and dies. That is your job. To decide. And live with the scar of having chosen who lives and who dies. Deal with it.

The most senior developer (24yo or so) we had on the project was using Go to connect to the database to write some simple reports, but each report took hours to run, and often had to sleep for 30+ minutes. So, after a while, pgbouncer would kill their connection, and their report would die. No other application did this among the many that we had connect to that DB, so it was definitely strange.<p>Found out pretty early on in troubleshooting it that they had no mechanism to keep the connection alive, which makes total sense for why his app died. So, they put the library standard keepalive function in a loop if the report wasn&#x27;t doing anything.. but that didn&#x27;t fix it.. it made no friggin&#x27; sense. After bashing my head against that for a while, I finally threw my hands up and asked if they could just run a &quot;SELECT 1&quot; as a keepalive instead of whatever the Go library was doing. Got a bit of pushback, but just told him to do it and walked away. That ended up fixing the problem.<p>Turns out the Go library was trying to be clever in its keepalives (can&#x27;t remember what it was doing exactly), in that it made some silly assumptions that there was nothing in the middle managing connections.<p>I like to think that dev learned a lot about trust in &quot;magical&quot; libraries after that."],"time":["2020-04-22 19:24:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["falcolas"],"id":[22945645],"kids":[22945791,22945753,22946665,22951628,22951784,22948950,22947462,22957951,22945861,22946058,22954616,22946865,22950713,22951874,22976565,22949314,22946229,22949442],"parent":[22942278],"text":["(The 80&#x2F;20 rule applies below, some developers do care)<p>Developers... just don&#x27;t care.

I guess we will never know.<p>To draw a parallel, one of the criticisms of the French system -- where mathematics is treated as the most important arbiter of intelligence (for grandes ecoles admissions) -- is that other aptitudes are almost seen as secondary. It optimizes too much for a very narrow aptitude -- which is great for producing Fields Medalists, but underoptimizes for talent elsewhere.<p>In my experience, while the American education system on the other hand is kind of a piece of cake from K-12, it somehow manages to catch up at the college level (more or less).

This means technical and scientific subjects are watered down so nobody is left behind. USSR and eastern block educational systems were built to cater to the most gifted students and produce scientific excellence. That is also true for some parts of Europe today, China, India and South Korea and maybe some other asian countries.<p>There was also a lack of distractions so it was easier for the kids in schools and students in universities to concentrate on learning.<p>In general, kids were expected to do a lot of homework each day and during vacations - I remember doing tens of math exercises each day and hundreds in vacation.<p>There were special classes in high school for more talented kids - where they got to do more math, physics, chemistry than their peers. Those classes had the best teachers.<p>Best kids at math or other sciences had supplementary training, they stayed after hours and learned more advanced concepts often with University teachers.<p>The school books in secondary schools and high schools weren&#x27;t authored by educators but by best scientist in their fields. Learning programs were unique and developed also by the best in their fields, not by educators.<p>Teachers followed very rigorous training in universities, so they were actually skilled in the field they taught.<p>Everything builds over notions taught in previous years. There&#x27;s no shortcut, no constant remembering of elementary notions.<p>Everything was taught with proofs, in a logical manner. There was no &quot;magic&quot;. No teacher said &quot;this thing works this way, you have to trust me on this&quot;. Instead, all things were proofed and the students had to learn all the &quot;whys&quot; along with the &quot;hows&quot;. If you were a high school student and forgot one more advanced integration or derivation formula, there&#x27;s no problem in deducting it from more basic theory.<p>One could enroll in a technical Faculty at University only after a series of very difficult exams.

Basing the algorithm on instantaneous information should be more accurate and thus give better savings, but maybe it varied too much to reliably run the loads they want.<p>Imagine when your fridge can do this: freeze extra cold when the sun is shining (or wind is blowing), don&#x27;t run the compressor when it&#x27;s not, only run the blower after you open the door to move that extra cold from the freezer, allow a slightly larger temperature range, and of course run as necessary to avoid spoilage. It&#x27;s not a simple algorithm, it has to handle various timeframes, such as solar being a daily cycle except there&#x27;s less in winter and can go for a week or more with very little (storm&#x2F;overcast). Maybe it could also use a bit of &quot;learning&quot; like the Nest thermostats to also optimize predicted usage.<p>I know of one commercial product that sort of does this: the Zappi electric car charger.

It&#x27;s actually pretty awful.<p>There are lots of independent artists running Pateron accounts with 200-5000 patrons. Fans sign up to support them but also to get access to their library of content.<p>Patreon provides a piss-poor UX for getting to this content. There is no list of content. There just &quot;here&#x27;s the stream of posts by the artist&quot;. The stream is JavaScript driven so if you want to go 100 posts back you have to page through multiple pages of posts. If you want to do it again tomorrow, or if the site crashes which it does, you have to start over at post 1 and page through again.<p>It&#x27;s telling that so many artists use google drive, dropbox, mediafire, or mega to distribute their works. This seems like money Pateron is leaving on the table if they&#x27;d provide for a similar service at similar prices. They do provide a way to upload media but the UX is awful compared to Mega which has arguably the superior UX of those 5 options.<p>Worse, because these artists are using these separate services there is no way to limit who accesses them. In other words a bad user can share the links with others where as if they did this through patreon you&#x27;d have to log in to access the media. Of course bad users can still share the media they downloaded in other ways.<p>Further, and I don&#x27;t know if this has been fixed, but I know what one time they only billed once month so bad users would sign up in the middle of the month, download everything, then cancel their patronage and avoid having to pay at all.<p>I can certainly imagine a service that&#x27;s significantly better Patreon for this use case.<p>Let me also add discoverabilty is horrible.

It was also non-profit. It of course seems attractive, if you really want to ensure long-term preservation, to set up a financial model that can somehow do this independent of the risk of the business continuity and budgets of the original depositors. And for cultural heritage institutions -- in the business of preserving incrementally more stuff every year -- it&#x27;s a big advantage to budgeting if you can budget per GB you add to preservation storage up front, and never have to pay for it again -- so your yearly budget for preservation storage is just based on number of NEW TB&#x27;s you are adding, instead of constantly going up with total number of TB&#x27;s preserved, and thus this portion of your budget stays pretty constant instead of ever-increasing.<p>However, the DPN folded in Dec 2018, after fewer than 5 years of operation.

Not every try ends up at the same outcome.<p>But I&#x27;d think the story of that effort should hopefully be informative for this new one.

I&#x27;d find it a bit more reassuring if they were like &quot;Here are people who have tried this before, and why we think we will succeed.&quot; Although the answer to that might just be &quot;an endowment model&quot;.<p>I think the permanent.org website is engaging in a bit of marketing slight of hand when they say &quot;We are leveraging the same funding models used by museums, libraries and universities for centuries.&quot; -- making it seem like this is a solved problem, we&#x27;re just doing what&#x27;s worked for centuries for libraries and museums!<p>There&#x27;s really nothing specific to libraries, museums, or universities about &quot;endowments&quot;. Non-profits of all sorts would love an endowment. (and maybe some for-profits somehow?) I know of few libraries, museums or universities whose <i>entire<\/i> operating budget is paid out of an endowment. Most institutions even with endowments (and not all do) need to seek ongoing funding or revenue for operations in addition to the endowment.<p>Only the wealthiest even approach it. Generally there is a correlation between how much of operating budget is endowed and how <i>old<\/i> the endowment is. &quot;For centuries&quot; indeed -- those institutions with the biggest endowments generally have <i>centuries-old<\/i> endowments, created by extremely wealthy people long ago. I think there are probably few, if any, examples of <i>recently-created<\/i> endowments funding all or most of the operating budget of non-tiny institutions. Let alone endowments created by aggregating fees from &quot;customers&quot; paying for service, instead of wealthy benefactors.<p>And of course, there is the different <i>business<\/i> here too, the need to be able to predict ongoing operational costs not just of hardware, and things like electricity and space and networking, but of course the staff time that we all know is a non-trivial component of most IT projects.

However, the school got some used 386 and 486 next years, so we got to use &quot;the real deal&quot;. In my last year, my parents also got enough money to buy me an used 486 SLC - which got intense use since I also had Borland C++ compiler and a C++ for dummies book. I did my final project for CS in Borland C++ on that PC. It was a DOS based MS Paint clone.<p>Before that, I owned a ZX Spectrum clone when I was in secondary school, and while I did some programming, most of it was written on paper first and typed on Spectrum later. I compiled and debugged &quot;in the brain&quot; because I couldn&#x27;t save programs and if a program halted, I had to reboot the thing wasting all I have written. A guy my father knew hacked a cassette player to help me load programs and games, but sadly it didn&#x27;t work to save anything.<p>Even now, I sometimes like to draw diagrams, sketch code flow and write bits of pseudocode on paper before I start coding something, if I feel I need to clarify the idea."],"time":["2020-04-23 09:38:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gorgoiler"],"id":[22949113],"kids":{},"parent":[22948055],"text":["Yes!

Make them earn the fees if they must.<p>Instead, it was a direct transfer from the Fed and treasury to QE that was pilfered by the usual suspects: hedge funds, market makers, foreign funds, oligarchs, wealth&#x2F;value extraction ops, naked short selling, short and distort and more. The SBA money was pilfered by banks and large companies. The &#x27;stimulus&#x27; for the economy, routed around the entire actual economy, never reaching individuals or true small business.<p>Companies that received SBA funding many are listed on the public markets. I doubt most people would call &quot;small business&quot; companies that have IPOed and been on the market for years. These companies have other access to funds, they just wanted the 1% loans and took from hundreds and thousands of small businesses that supply them, subscribe to their services, buy their software, consume their products, feed them and other services.<p>Examples of companies that got SBA PPP and other [1]:<p>- Drive Shack Inc.

It is gangbusters for wealth and value extraction ops. How long can this go on?<p>The stimulus for individuals, families and small business is vaporware, time for some vaporwave as we fade away into the ether.<p>Good luck wealth and big business with no one to skim from and no small business to use as research and development or suppliers.<p>Maybe it needs to be framed in the way that it is an additional bailout for their own companies and interests. Most of that money makes it back into banks, larger companies, wealth, top end etc.\nIf consumers have purchasing power and small companies buy up their services, supply them, and are where they make their money broadly, maybe their self-interest will align with the actual market.<p>Our policies already downplay the importance of wages, consumer base purchasing power and just keep piling on the backs of a finite resource. How long do can the wealth extraction keep happening before there is none left and stagnation takes over in a big way? Rich people and large companies can only buy so much, the long tail of small businesses and consumer purchasing power is America, it is under attack.<p>Real wages and purchasing power have barely budged in 40 years [4].<p>Worker share of GDP being on a long dwindle down [5] and velocity of money is off a cliff [6], that is why we are so stagnant.<p>Richest 1% of Americans Close to Surpassing Wealth of Middle Class [7]<p>Money trickles up and down and all around, but money only trickles where other money is found.<p>If there isn&#x27;t purchasing power or demand, that is hard to create.

But after the computers of world have converged to multiple-of-8-bit integers, the inability to specify a particular size of an integer become an issue. As a result, in modern C programming, the standard is to use uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, etc., defined in &lt;stdint.h&gt;, C&#x27;s inherent support of different integer sizes are basically abandoned - no one needs it anymore, and it only creates confusions in practice, especially in the bitmasking and bitshifting world of low-level programming. Now, if N-bit integers are introduced to C, it&#x27;s kind of a negation-of-the-negation, and we complete a full cycle - the ability to work on non-multiple-of-8-bit integers will come back (although the original integer-size independence and portability will not come back)."],"time":["2020-04-22 17:53:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Traster"],"id":[22946701],"kids":[22947901,22946919,22947186,22946902,22946841,22948895,22949316,22946884,22948355,22947496,22947246,22947147,22946950],"parent":[22946014],"text":["I&#x27;d love to know if there&#x27;s any use to this beyond FPGAs.

When the room warms up enough, the bending of the strip abates, opening the contact, and turning off the heater. Turning the dial modified the distance between the bimetallic strip and the contact. Turning the dial to a lower number moves them farther apart, so the strip has to bend more to close the contact, and so the room has to get colder before the heat turns on.<p>If you ask people how they think it works, some will know the above. Others will have other explanations.<p>Some people might think that it is just based on time. The system runs the heater for a variable time controlled by the dial, and then turns it off for a fixed time, and then repeats this cycle. Turning the dial to a lower number reduces that variable time.<p>There were, if I recall (it&#x27;s been years since I read it) correctly, a few more explanations given, some quite wrong in the sense that no one would actually build a thermostat that way.<p>The interesting and important thing from a user interface point of view, though, was that all of them lead to the user doing the right thing when it comes to actually operating the thermostat. If the room is too hot, they move the dial to a lower number. If the room is too cold, they move the dial to a higher number.<p>The point was that users are going to have some kind of model for how your thing actually works. It is not important that the model they have is actually right--as long as their model leads them to the right control inputs that is fine. Be aware of what kind of models people are going to have, and design your interface to not encourage bad models.<p>An example of an interface design failure was a refrigerator&#x2F;freezer Norman had. It had two sliders, labeled &quot;Freezer&quot; and &quot;Fresh Food&quot;, both in the fridge compartment. The &quot;Freezer&quot; slider had settings A-E, and the &quot;Fresh Food&quot; slider had 0-9. The instructions said: &quot;Normal settings C and 5&quot;, &quot;Colder Fresh Food C and 6-7&quot;, &quot;Coldest Fresh Food B and 8-9&quot;, &quot;Colder Freezer D and 7-8&quot;, &quot;Warmer Fresh Food C and 4-1&quot;, and &quot;Off 0&quot;.<p>The labeling of the controls suggest or reinforces a model that leads to someone who wants to adjust the freezer temperature fiddling with just the freezer control, and someone who wants to adjust the fridge temperature fiddling the the other control. Probably something with thermostats in both compartments, each controlling a cooler unit for that compartment, with the sliders each controlling one of the thermostats.<p>The way that fridge actually worked is that there was a thermostat somewhere, controlling the cooling unit. The output of the cooling unit went through a valve that could direct part of it to the freezer and part of it to the fridge. One of the sliders controlled the thermostat, and one controlled the valve. Nothing really suggested which compartment had the thermostat (assuming that it is even in one of the compartments), or which control was for the thermostat and which was for the valve.<p>An average user of that fridge who, say, feels the fridge temperature us just right but would like the freezer to be a little warmer is in for a frustrating time of fiddling with the controls. Their model of how it works probably leads to different predictions of control response than the actual model. That way that fridge actually works is far enough away from the models the users are likely to have that the controls should have at the very least been labeled in a way that lets those user know that this fridge is difference.<p>Maybe label the slider that controls the cooling unit something like &quot;Overall Cooling&quot; and label the valve control something like &quot;More to fridge&#x2F;less to freezer &lt;--&gt; More to freezer&#x2F;less to fridge&quot;. Still a pain to operate, but at least it is obvious it is going to be a pain. The user who wants a warmer freezer but is happy with the fridge temperature can tell from that labeling that they are going to have to decrease the overall cooling, and change the allocation toward &quot;More to fridge&#x2F;less to freezer&quot; to keep the fridge temperature the same."],"time":["2020-04-23 01:12:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["olooney"],"id":[22950837],"kids":{},"parent":[22948723],"text":["I&#x27;m a little tired of &quot;X is a fallacy.&quot; Everything is a fallacy, or nearly so. Almost every method by which we naturally and intuitively reason have been shown to be error prone, deeply biased, or at best an approximate heuristic. This is why Wikipedia is able to list a hundred different kinds of fallacies[1] without even beginning to scratch the surface. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of teaching rationality by exhaustively listing fallacies because it&#x27;s endless. But when maintaining a blacklist becomes too onerous, the solution is to switch to a whitelist. This turns out to be much easier, because the constructive list of techniques that work is very short. Of all the ways of reasoning that are intuitive appealing and naturally make sense to us, only two have stood the test of time:<p>1. Modus Ponens (If A implies B, and also A, then B.)<p>2. The Hypothetico-deductive model (The guess-and-check scientific method)<p>And frankly I&#x27;m a little suspicious of that second one!<p>These are better known as &quot;math&quot; and &quot;science,&quot; or &quot;deduction&quot; an &quot;induction.&quot; And yes, modus ponens is really the only inference rule you need for logic - Hilbert proved that[2].<p>The other 98% of the algorithms built into our brains are unreliable and cannot be trusted. Consider for example your optical cortex, which is attempts to patch up raw input in a dozen different ways, resulting in dozens of optical illusions, saccadic masking, not being aware of your own blindspot, and so on. We literally can&#x27;t trust our eyes... or rather, we can&#x27;t trust the instinctive processing our own brains do on raw visual input. So it is with the other parts of our brain. Or what Kahneman calls &quot;System 1.&quot;[3] It&#x27;s a patchwork of barely functional heuristics.<p>Scientists learn to shut out that 98% and use only the two reliable systems. Mathematicians take it even further and shut out 99%, leaving only modus ponens and methods of deduction.<p>People hate that this is true. They want to reason intuitively, naturally. They hope they can patch their hopelessly bugged brains into something useful if they can just memorize and avoid a list of pitfalls. I&#x27;m telling you there&#x27;s a better way. Forget about fallacies. Stop looking for shortcuts like &quot;mental models.&quot; Construct rigorous arguments inside of formal deductive systems. Use those to build formal mathematical models that describe reality. Test those models ruthlessly against experimental data, even to destruction.<p>You know this works. It put a man on the moon, for god sake. It predicted what a black hole would look like, then took a picture of it. It&#x27;s cured so many diseases and so many problems that our main problem is that we don&#x27;t have enough problems. Yet people still want to look for shortcuts. I can sympathize with that. We&#x27;re all busy. But the real choice you face is this: be rigorous, or be wrong a lot.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fallacies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fallacies<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hilbert_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hilbert_system<\/a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-23 00:20:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajsharp"],"id":[22947110],"kids":[22951505],"parent":[22944806],"text":["&quot;Banks earned origination fees of 5% on loans of up to $350,000; 3% on loans between $350,000 and $2 million; and 1% on loans between $2 million and $10 million.

A friend of mine came up with a way of doing 41-tone equal temperament on a modified guitar [1].  One of the tricks is that since 41-TET would require the frets to be so tightly packed that the guitar would be difficult to play, you simply omit every other fret and tune the guitar so that each string has the notes its neighbors on either side lack.<p>It&#x27;s a little strange not having all the notes on all the strings, but it actually works out surprisingly well.  Chord intonation is a bit nicer than 12-TET, and you get pretty good approximations of the 7-limit just intonation intervals as well.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.xen.wiki&#x2F;w&#x2F;The_Kite_Guitar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.xen.wiki&#x2F;w&#x2F;The_Kite_Guitar<\/a> (The 7-string Ibanez is mine.)"],"time":["2020-04-22 04:23:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hardmath123"],"id":[22942647],"kids":{},"parent":[22940211],"text":["Once, when I was taking a music theory class, I tried to use the Z3 constraint solver to automatically harmonize melodies… it worked surprisingly well! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kach&#x2F;recreational-rosette&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;music\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kach&#x2F;recreational-rosette&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;mus...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-22 07:49:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wgetch"],"id":[22941618],"kids":[22943042],"parent":[22940211],"text":["Always interesting to see logic programming applied to music, it is in my experience a good fit for the musical problem space. I spent some time exploring the analysis of chords using answer set programming. On the surface ASP programs look very similar to Prolog but the semantics differ; you query Prolog to answer a question or series of questions related to your program, whereas ASP produces complete &quot;stable models&quot; of your program (it answers &quot;all questions&quot;).<p>The first version of my analysis program would most likely have been a valid Prolog program, and furthermore the program was completely positive (contained no negation). After several weeks of rewrites, I ended up with a much smaller program that also took advantage of ASP &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;optimization&quot; rules. Much of the complexity was reduced by one fundamental improvement in the representation of internal facts and adjusting the rules to accommodate. In hindsight, the original version used a rather foolish approach, but like many things it took some effort to realize why and how to do better.<p>This process of rewriting and incremental improvement (and initially struggling in a less-familiar programming paradigm) gave me a great appreciation for logic systems, and also a desire to use them more often. There is something very beautiful in reducing a problem into logical relationships, and instead of focusing on algorithms just focusing on the problem space and how different pieces interrelate. It does take practice and experimentation to produce an elegant solution to a problem, but with experience it gets easier. I have no doubt the author of this article could make it feasible to discover chords and tunings as he describes in the Future Work section. Though I would recommend starting over with this goal in mind; even a naive but viable solution might reveal some property of the system that would transfer over to the original program and increase its versatility."],"time":["2020-04-22 05:01:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
