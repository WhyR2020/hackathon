The advertising is there to convince the consumer to re-purchase the nearly identical product by attaching perceived value.

Here in the US, these are closely related to what we commonly call &quot;flashbacks.&quot; For the Romans, people experiencing intrusive memories were said to be haunted by ghosts. These individuals show up in historical, philosophical, and even medical texts.<p>&gt; Josephus, who was an outsider to Roman culture, also describes this phenomenon in his history of The Great Revolt. Those haunted by ghosts are constantly depicted showing many symptoms which would be familiar to the modern PTSD sufferer. Insomnia, depression, mood swings, being easily startled, frequent eye movement, alertness all day and night, paranoia, avoidance of crowds, suicidal thoughts&#x2F;attempts, loss of appetite, shaking&#x2F;shivering, self-hatred, and impulsive violence have all turned up in association with these individuals.<p>&gt; Since in almost every case the person experiencing these things had made himself an object of public shame, the &quot;ghosts&quot; in question often came in the form of those he had killed or wronged in the past. These would either appear spontaneously to the sufferer, or would come in the form of vivid, frightening nightmares.<p>&gt; The key component to these experiences, as with modern cases of PTSD, was that the sufferer had no control over his own symptoms. Thoughts or vivid memories would occur unexpectedly and uncontrollably. It is easy to see why the Romans, who were religiously superstitious to begin with, would attribute such things to the foul play of malicious spirits.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskHistorians&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1j6ssm&#x2F;are_there_any_indications_of_combat_ptsd_in&#x2F;cbbvfib&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskHistorians&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1j6ssm&#x2F;are_t...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-27 15:43:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["papeda"],"id":[22990605],"kids":[22994880,22995619,22995052,22995655,22995902,22998888,22995900,22994926,22998310,22996263,22995137,23000662,23001207,22996795,22996080,22995704,22995327,22994961],"parent":[22990296],"text":["On a related note, a while ago I read a little about how ancient families coped with the deaths of their children. My takeaway, pretty much cribbed from this article [1], was that such deaths produced less trauma than they would today because:<p>(1) More families lost children. This lessened the trauma because a family could talk to other nearby families who had experienced the same thing. Those families would also be able to give advice. In contrast, losing a child is extremely rare (in developed countries) today. This rarity breeds isolation, which makes everything worse.<p>(2) There were established societal and religious ways to deal specifically with the death of a child. Think prescribed ceremonies that grant a form of closure and which pretty much all of your friends and neighbors subscribe to. Nothing like this exists today.<p>To me, this is very similar to the suggested explanation in the featured article for why war used to cause less PTSD: there was less stigma around war, a much larger chunk of society fought in wars, and there were universal and well-defined rituals for processing the experience.<p>The whole thing raises interesting questions about our modern understanding of trauma. I think the most common modern statement on grief is that it&#x27;s intensely personal and people should never feel that their grieving process is &quot;wrong&quot;, at least not for a long time (years?) after the event. That at least seems different than past practice.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;642999?seq=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;642999?seq=1<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-26 23:54:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sorokod"],"id":[22995761],"kids":[22995823,22996148,22996005],"parent":[22990296],"text":["I would suggest that some forms of medieval entertainment would <i>cause<\/i> PTSD in a modern person.

They have done a sadly effective job at killing themselves. I believe the reason for this (with no evidence) is because these men were prone to enjoying and seeking opportunities to kill.<p>Apart from that guessing game, I also believe that the symptoms of PTSD are all-around easy to suppress and make look like other things. Most of the behavior associated with &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; as it is currently being called can be instead directed towards a PTSD diagnosis or some kind of traumatic reaction. I am sure of this. So the fact that the ancient world had all these orders and so forth with vows and tight-knit little clans are all a sign to me that they were just like the soldiers returning from WWII who became bikers; they were rattled badly. They had to put on that cold, tightly-wound demeanor by force of the nervousness that lay underneath. All those sovereign military orders and all that? They were all PTSD clubs.<p>In opposition to this ideal, there is a book titled &quot;On Killing&quot; which describes why not all killers are susceptible to PTSD. I believe the book is fairly accurate in its claim, however it does exactly what those old military orders did: it creates a warrior ethos which allows for an in-group admission of the experiences while keeping the out-group afraid of the warriors. According to the book, there is a subsection of humanity that are naturally capable of killing without it being contrary to their values. They do not revel in it as some do. They are not triggered by it as many are. This is the chivalrous vision of being a trigger-puller.<p>My experience of events which ought to be traumatic is mostly that they only return to bother us if there is some behavior that was contrary to the individuals values. Those vary. To move the slider as far to the (?) as is necessary to justify killing on moral, religious, personal, political&#x2F;tribal&#x2F;cultural grounds, and showering killers in rewards after the fact, including great tales of valour, etc that make all those sacrifices worthy: that is the means of shielding the society from the reality of there being a fraction of the people who are extremely fucked up from having hacked&#x2F;shot&#x2F;blown people to pieces.<p>One final note: it was far more common to die from wounds and disease. Many people just plain didn&#x27;t survive the wars due to wounds and plagues. Or they were assimilated somewhat into their enemies worlds and never returned to exactly the same place where people could say: &quot;holy shit, you&#x27;re different.&quot;"],"time":["2020-04-27 18:25:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rv-de"],"id":[22997272],"kids":{},"parent":[22990296],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FSDvF6H0cks?t=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FSDvF6H0cks?t=6<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-27 18:22:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tapland"],"id":[22996002],"kids":{},"parent":[22990296],"text":["I didn&#x27;t see anyone mentioning this but it would partially explain both the &quot;there wasn&#x27;t more in a violent world so it&#x27;s weakness&#x2F;was normal&quot; arguments as well as the &quot;we haven&#x27;t changed genetically so!&quot; arguments.<p>Today we have much less violence than ever before, we live more comfortable lives, people are healthier and mistreating others is often illegal and pushed back against from both governments and the population itself.<p>Because of that people who experience horrible events are less likely to have anyone around them with that shared experience.<p>We have, afaik, less occurrence of PTSD when something horrible happens to an entire community, and less mental illness when an entire community is facing a difficult situation.<p>But for an individual experiencing horrible and horrifying events you not only have the event itself, but a total lack of anyone even remotely close to having had the same experience.<p>I have a relative with diagnosed (you really have to specify it) PTSD and I have absolutely no experience remotely close to the ones this person has faced, in an environment where there was no escape (family).

Dan is particularly interested in military history, especially ancient military history. He has an episode on Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul (which he argues in any kind of modern context would be called a genocide) as well as a series on the great Persian kings, called the King of Kings. This is specifically about the Achaemenid Empire talking about Cyrus II, Darius, Xerxes and the likes.<p>Now as Dan would say, he doesn&#x27;t find scientific and technological advancements particularly interesting (from a historical perspective). Like if Edison didn&#x27;t invent the light bulb, someone else would&#x27;ve.<p>What he finds far more interesting is historical events that could&#x27;ve completely changed the course of history and one of those was the Battle of Marathon [2]. This was a battle between the Persians and the Greeks that the Greeks somehow won. Had they lost it would&#x27;ve changed the entire history of Europe given how important Greek culture was to everyone from the Romans on. Bear in mind when this happened, Rome was a small regional power at best.<p>He talks about the psychology of ancient warfare. One thing he notes is that the closer someone is to someone, the harder it is for them to (psychologically) kill them. From a gun at a distance is completely different to hand-to-hand combat.<p>At this time, the Greeks fought with spears that were very broad. Stab someone in the guts with one of those and their insides would literally spill out to the point where the likes of Herodotus described the ground at Marathon as being soaked red in blood.<p>Likewise, ancient culture and justice must be almost incomprehensible to us. Fun fact: the origin of the word &quot;decimate&quot;. When a province rebelled against Roman Rule and Rome would crush them, insurrection was punished particularly harshly. People would be put in groups of 10 (hence DECImate) where each group was responsible for choosing which of those 10 would die and for killing that person.<p>How did people cope with these things?

Same thing backwards.<p>- The entirety of the author&#x27;s &#x27;hypothesis&#x27; (sic) rests upon ignoring that nurture, context, is highly determinant in forming psychological references, relative perceptions, hence reactions, profiles. This is wrong, nature isn&#x27;t 100%, you simply can&#x27;t take two identical beings, put them in vastly different contexts and hope they present the same behaviors and perceptions. It makes no sense. Hello Darwin, wish you were here.<p>- “the absence of evidence”... Again, wrong. Historical psychology is a thing. Author may be well-meaning, but they should adopt a transdisciplinary approach if they are to talk about multiple disciplines at once. Find a good psychologist, work together as one on the topic long enough to form a legitimate hypotheses, then maybe make some conclusions.<p>- It seems the author also neglected to take into account philosophy, which used to be 99% practical back then. Recipes for good living. Guess why it was widely taught and shared, pretty much the basis of any education, throughout life. Guess why Seneca wrote his letters. What&#x27;s the point of ignoring just about the closest thing to psychology sessions?

We just didn&#x27;t dwell on that topic as much in history (hence why, perhaps, some literature became so notorious, because it spoke of something that people weren&#x27;t used to). It was &quot;fluff&quot;. Hence why, when we made &quot;emotions&quot; a matter of science, it became a more acceptable topic, not just for a few who dared. It became &quot;mainstream&quot;. (I&#x27;m NOT a specialist, so don&#x27;t quote me on this but Freud, Jung, positivism, is probably where&#x2F;when to look for a major shift; before that it was &quot;magic&quot;, fluff, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t &quot;real&quot;, like belief in supernatural forces is &quot;magic&quot; but real to the psyche).<p>Imagine that, in the future, we turn some (currently) elusive aspect of our psyche (like belief indeed), into a form of science, of applied psycho-bio-model-mechanics (like we do cognitive sciences today, a scientific progress over prior centuries). Now imagine some author versed in history but oblivious to psychology and biology, centuries from now, claiming in some random short post that people in the 21st century did not experience any tension in that regard because they didn&#x27;t have words for it. Well, we may not have the words indeed, not yet; but we certainly experience the tensions with beliefs (supernatural or otherwise), heck we made <i>wars<\/i> because of it.

I also got larger lenses (so distortion that happens in the corner is increased because the corner is farther from the midpoint than before).<p>The main issue with the new lenses which I noticed was chromatic aberration. Unfortunately my brain can’t fix this in post though it has gotten used to it a bit. Something that I suppose I already knew was that the lens material would affect how much of this distortion you would see. I thought different refractive indices would give different amounts of dispersion, though maybe I should not have thought that as lower indices would mean thicker lenses so more distance to disperse in which might cancel out the lower disposition. In the end it doesn’t matter what I thought, the Lens material does affect the dispersion.<p>The thing I was more surprised by was that dispersion wasn’t something that came up when making the choice of lens material. Thinking back though, perhaps the only qualities discussed were “thickness” and cost. I put thickness in quotes as maybe the weight was discussed too. I feel like dispersion is quite an important thing I care about and I wonder why it wasn’t discussed. Perhaps it is hard to explain to people (I guess all the material properties are hard to explain), or perhaps it is difficult if the lenses don’t necessarily get better in every way as cost goes up.<p>There are no glasses lenses which can correct for their chromatic aberration like camera lenses, presumably because they would be too thick and delicate.<p>In a more general sense, I’m surprised that there’s so little variety in optometrists (at least in the U.K.). Basically wherever you go you get the same precision of prescription and are then given the opportunity to buy some glasses. Some studies have shown that the accuracy of the prescription you get from the subjective refractometry exam can vary a lot between practices but there is no way to know if a practice will be good or bad. I’m also surprised that there is not really a way to get a more accurate or precise prescription than the standard, as I would think that if such a thing existed it would be able to find customers at least in larger population centres. Maybe it would be impossible to improve on the status quo because of the lack of economies of scale or because glasses won’t be in a consistent enough position or because the rich people who would be expected to pay floor the service opt for eye surgery instead.<p>This comment is so far mostly unrelated to the OP though so I will make another comment: I wish the article had mentioned some of the physics behind the different aberrations, for example the reason longitudinal aberration is hard to correct in post is that it os an effect where different colours are focused to different distances and it of hard to make a colour less out-of-focus to fix it. The reason a bokeh light circle is a certain shape is that that is the shape of the lens aperture (hence usually a circle or many-gon). The misshapen bokeh effects tend To come from light coming in at more acute angles and from those angles the lens is a different shape."],"time":["2020-04-27 01:23:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["segfaultbuserr"],"id":[22996557],"kids":[22996596,23002752,22996910,22997817],"parent":[22994986],"text":["What the article didn&#x27;t mention is the possibility to build a &quot;wired wireless&quot; network using leaky feeder [0].

Princeton requires all Bachelor&#x27;s students to do two semesters of &quot;independent work&quot; their junior year, plus a thesis senior years. Engineering students have to do one semester of independent work, but they have to take additional courses and have more specific requirements. (The CS BSE degree is currently unique in not requiring a thesis.)<p>For many departments, junior independent work is a 20ish page research paper you write over the course of the semester either as part of a seminar or one-on-one with an advisor, so the CS independent work is intended to be roughly equivalent in terms of rigor. It&#x27;s my understanding that most CS students work on a significant piece of software with a writeup at the end of the semester—often (but not always) in a semester on a single topic (eg computer vision, digital audio, etc) junior fall, and one-on-one with an advisor (or in a lab) junior spring. BSE students will often do their one semester of independent work senior year, in either form.<p>It&#x27;s often pretty daunting staring at these requirements—and a lot of the onus is on you, the student, to figure out what you want to do and initiate it—so this advice seems to me to be aimed at students starting to plan their independent work.<p>Don&#x27;t take this as gospel—I&#x27;m actually not a CS major, somewhat ironically, though I have many friends who are.

In my experience many in Silicon Valley don&#x27;t understand the mechanics of long-term institutional change. In part, that&#x27;s simply because — much like entrepreneurship — expertise comes from practical experience. Tacit, not-easily-transferrable knowledge dominates.<p>I find Ezra Klein&#x27;s recent line here useful:<p>&quot;[W]hatever the recommendations, the same thing is needed: A sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions. Meta-building isn’t a popular pastime, and the patient, focused work it requires is particularly frustrating, in my experience, to entrepreneurial personalities.&quot; [1]<p>I confess that I myself find it incredibly frustrating. See a government program that&#x27;s incredibly difficult to deal with, friction-laden up and down, with reams of paperwork with legalese?<p>One <i>can<\/i> build a layer on top that eliminates most or all of the friction. But it will always be limited by the resource models that can sustain it. And many problems simply have <i>no<\/i> workable models other than state financing and operation (market failure, in other words).<p>Instead, doing the work to make that program much better institutionally involves long-term (frustrating) strategies like:<p>- Think tanks &#x2F; white papers: influencing the epistemic landscape among policymakers<p>- Organizing: shifting the Overton Window to make the change you want to see broadly accepted<p>- Coalition-building: working with allies with overlapping agendas to get more muscle behind your own priorities<p>And even... waiting. You often have to wait — years! decades! — for a window to come where you can get a big thing done. People worked on big healthcare reform for 3 decades of effectively zero progress — and then in a year they passed Obamacare.<p>That work is long, hard, much more probabilistic than product work, and much less directly-controllable by a given person.<p>BUT there are playbooks to get it done. And I do wish technologists looked to those tools more to make the institutional changes we need to make it so the opportunities (individual and societal) of entrepreneurship were more widely accessible.<p>One concrete example: I&#x27;ve long thought that a basic source of friction in public services is because user experience isn&#x27;t well-monitored, and therefore not well-considered in public policy decisions.<p>Technologists are <i>great<\/i> at measuring friction. It is a craft well-honed in an environment where conversion is a live-or-die metric. But translating that craft into institutional change requires something like a think tank, and&#x2F;or an organized movement with an agenda.<p>I think we&#x27;ll get there, but it will take some risk-takers who understand that long game and financial backers who aren&#x27;t as well-versed in it, but who have the risk tolerance of SV and the savvy to see that playbook <i>does<\/i> work, and point it at a problem with significant leverage.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;22&#x2F;21228469&#x2F;marc-andreessen-build-government-coronavirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;22&#x2F;21228469&#x2F;marc-andreessen-build...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-28 03:47:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mordae"],"id":[23001886],"kids":{},"parent":[22997371],"text":["If we did not have patents, we wouldn&#x27;t have to build in the current cities, would we?

To take a single example of a single act of buying a milk at the store: The store want a record in order to manage inventory, sale history and sale predictions. They also want location path data in order to determine effectiveness of product placements. Your bank want a record in order to facilitating money exchange and manage money laundering laws. The recipient bank want a record too to do the same for the store owner, but also to keep track of the market which the store is under. The government want a record in order to know how much money has changed hand and for what product in order to determine taxes for the seller and buyer. The mall want a record for the location of the store you bought the milk and how you traversed the mall to reach it in order to evaluate property values and advertise placements. Other milk producers and milk alternatives want a record in order to make a better case arguing for their competing product. The secret police want a secret record in order to verify that you did not buy something that could be made into a threat. The regular police want a copy of the record and a video record in case a crime happened while buying the milk. The local government want a location record in order to manage traffic of people who travel around in order to buy milk. The health department want a record to help researcher determine the potential benefit of milk drinkers.<p>GDPR is really just a small stop gap to manage a fraction of all the records we leave behind. It is unlikely to be the last one trying to create the laws needed to handle the fact that everyone a record of everything everyone does, but that we also likely going to end up where everyone has a record of everything everyone does because it saves money, makes strategies more efficient and reduces the need for manual labor. Unrestricted data records has a history full of recorded abuse, and a lot of current use today is explicitly designed to harm people by manipulation and predatory strategies. GDPR is a small step forward, but it is mostly just testing the water for the real legal work needed to make the behavior of all those data collectors safe enough that a person can do something as simple as buying milk at the store without exposing themselves to harm."],"time":["2020-04-27 16:42:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pnw_hazor"],"id":[23002388],"kids":[23005207,23002925],"parent":[22994670],"text":["IMO the only way GDPR would have worked the way its advocates hoped is if the enacting statutes created a private right of action. (I don&#x27;t even know if private rights of action is a thing in the EU.)<p>In the US some (though not enough) consumer protection or civil right laws expressly grant plaintiffs the right to bring their own lawsuit in court. There are edge conditions depending on the laws or jurisdictions involved. For example, some laws provide a private right of action only if the state agents decline to pursue the case. While other laws may require the plaintiff to give notice to some agencies first.<p>Otherwise, laws that may look bold on paper become toothless based on inaction by the state agents that must enforce them. In contrast, if a law includes a private right of action and reasonable fee shifting provisions, private attorneys will pick up the slack and then some.<p>For example, in the US, the medical privacy regime, HIPAA, is considerably weakened by its absence (as far as I know) of a private right of action. For example, if your medical privacy is violated by your HR department or your doctor, you cannot sue under US Federal HIPAA laws, you need to sue under some other law and prove real damages. Note, there may be other laws that cover the same facts, such as, state privacy laws, or the like. And, in some circumstance, proven HIPAA violations may be used as evidence of negligence, or the like, to meet the requirements of the other laws."],"time":["2020-04-28 03:38:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jp555"],"id":[22995598],"kids":[22996403,22995695,22995720,22998036],"parent":[22994670],"text":["What hasn&#x27;t worked: Expensive bureaucracy that big incumbents can easily afford to navigate but new entrants would be easily crippled by?<p>Shocked. &#x2F;s"],"time":["2020-04-27 15:26:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Cenk"],"id":[22996091],"kids":{},"parent":[22994670],"text":["Here’s a handy website to keep track of GDPR enforcement and fines:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enforcementtracker.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enforcementtracker.com<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-27 16:24:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jddj"],"id":[22994966],"kids":[22995163],"parent":[22994670],"text":["Don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of the good.<p>GDPR did a lot to shift the window back and put the behaviour of the big adtech companies in the sunlight for a while.<p>The enforcement side is definitely lacking, and black mirror might still have done more to shift opinion, but it&#x27;s not all bad.<p>Consumers all over the world now have the ability to request data takeouts and deletions, etc. And anecdotally I&#x27;ve noticed more and more sites honouring the opt in requirement for 3rd party tracking scripts.<p>It&#x27;s a solid improvement over the status quo of 2017."],"time":["2020-04-27 13:57:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Proven"],"id":[23002100],"kids":{},"parent":[22994670],"text":["Maybe because the advocates aren&#x27;t particularly bright to begin with?<p>GDPR has shown its teeth annoying the crap out of me with it&#x27;s stupid privacy notices on the few EU-based sites I occasionally visit.<p>I recall many companies simply stopped doing business in the overregulated hellhole.

At this stage, the part&#x27;s already been designed. So you take the part&#x27;s material properties, geometry, surface preparation and coatings, machined features, and so on, and check it against anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of load scenarios. You find the handful of critical load cases, and then you write up the analysis against those. The analysis is intended to be mostly self-contained, readable by any qualified engineer, and serve as a complete treatment of the part&#x27;s structural sufficiency. It&#x27;s not much of an exaggeration to say that every single structural component of an airplane is backed up by a stress analysis report running somewhere between 20 and 400 pages, written by one or more degreed engineers making what was, in the U.S. probably an average of $50-60&#x2F;hr. Airliners are made up of many, many structural parts. The costs of proving the safety of those parts add up quickly.<p>Now, if I had to guess, instruction manuals are probably a bit cheaper to produce. Tech writers probably aren&#x27;t as well compensated as engineers. But a lot of engineers&#x27; time will be eaten up nonetheless. (I once spent a memorable few weeks (!) proving that a dowel pin on a part that hadn&#x27;t been machined correctly would not, during installation, shear off, so that existing installation documentation could still be used. Yay. After that I was known as the office dowel pin SME.) Good maintenance documents sweat the details and require input from designers, stress analysts, manufacturing engineers, supply chain representatives, and others. And then as the design evolves -- the design always evolves on the way to delivering a product -- these documents must be tweaked, added to, subtracted from, sometimes entirely rewritten, and those changes must be checked by a variety of folks.<p>So, $84 million for 100,000 pages might sound like a lot. But for what is in many ways a custom built aircraft, with divergences from the base aircraft that probably run into the millions, to me, it doesn&#x27;t seem ridiculous."],"time":["2020-04-27 02:11:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["downerending"],"id":[22991522],"kids":[22991574,22991775,22998160,22991680],"parent":[22991321],"text":["I hate stories like this.

This is problematic because its easy to tell who I have had contact with. But it&#x27;s much harder to tell who has used the same door knobs or shopping trollies that I have. It&#x27;s also an exponentially larger number. You can quarantine the 50 people I&#x27;ve touched or spoken to in the last week, you can&#x27;t quarantine the 2000 who went to the supermarket the same day as me. Not without just quarantining everyone anyway, so why bother contact tracing?<p>* that I can be isolated if I am not sick. Imagine if your housemate got the disease, with proof via testing. Now what? You can&#x27;t leave the house for 2 weeks? Good luck surviving off whatever is already in your cupboards, it&#x27;s hard enough to keep people from doing things they shouldn&#x27;t under social isolation, but mass house arrest is unenforceable, at least in the west.<p>Also,the author perpetuates a myth that&#x27;s risen about social isolation. Let&#x27;s clarify: The plan is NOT to keep everyone locked away until the case count actually reaches zero, that will never happen. The plan is to work out how many infected people we can cope with at a time.<p>If you have 25k ventilators, and 5% of patients need ventilation then you know you can have 500k people get the disease simultaneously. That way, the mortality stays at the minimum rate because everyone who needs treatment can get it. Any higher and you have to ration ventilators and the death rate spirals.<p>So we will aim to have a certain number of people get it at a time. If we drop below this number, we will relax social distancing somewhat, maybe reopen schools or permit some use of restaurants in order to INCREASE transmission. But then reverse that when the infected load rises.<p>This is the real reason testing is important. It&#x27;s irrelevant whether you have the disease, it&#x27;s very important to know how many people have it (especially how many people have it now and will need treatment in 1,4,7,14 etc days). Tests should be used for population monitoring not individuals. This was a key error from day one that is still happening today. Whatever your condition, YOU do not need to be tested.<p>Eventually we will develop a herd immunity which will gradually allow more and more openness without increasing transmission rates. Until one day so many people have had it that no measures are needed to keep the rate low enough to deal with. That&#x27;s when we return to normal.<p>There are nuances to how we do this. High risk groups should remain more isolated for longer as they are more likely to die or need ventilation. We need population testing, something governments are stubbornly refusing to do. We don&#x27;t know transmission rates under various levels of lockdown. All this needs to be managed semi-locally, so London might be opening up while Cornwall remains closed.<p>This approach is clearly laid out and was at the beginning of the current measures both academically and generally.<p>This is about control, not eradication, because eradication is not possible. Any attempt at eradication will fail when we&#x27;re unable to find literally every case world wide, we relax quarantine and then suddenly it rockets back in.<p>As soon as the author started talking about eradication, he left the scientific concensus. As soon as he claimed we could return to normal life if we got contact tracing working, he made a claim with no evidence to back it up. Contact tracing is a nice to have, but not important.

It happens also when your health plan clearly states that things like preventive care are covered with no-copay and outside of the deductible.<p>The loophole they exploit is claiming ignorance about coverage that&#x27;s not under the umbrella of your deductible.<p>They can do this because when they check with the plan provider they don&#x27;t have to, or want to do a lengthy inquiry in relation to the patient&#x27;s situation and their plan. That check is usually a 2 minutes call. So they go with a blanket scenario which is:<p>“A patient is here for a consultation. Based on their coverage how much can I get out of their pocket?”<p>That&#x27;s literally the only validation they are interested in doing.<p>Of course, you can try to fight this, but the process for this is probably so long that it&#x27;s not worth your time. So they get away with it all the time. Most people don&#x27;t even want to deal with this. \nGoing to the doctor is already stressing enough, so 75 USD less is not worth it more stress. \nAnd they do this because nobody says anything and patients don’t understand well enough their coverage. The average person hardly understands the concept of a deductible.<p>If people were actually fighting back this it would be harder for healthcare providers to charge fees they are not entitled to.<p>Healthcare in the US is one of the most exploitative and unethical industries. They don&#x27;t care about the patients, they only care about their money. \nAnd I&#x27;m not talking about the nurses and doctors. Most of them are simply cogs of that system. They may have knowledge of these shady things but rarely can control them (except the ones that have private practices)<p>I&#x27;m talking about the organizations that insure patients and the organizations that provide healthcare.

What they won’t often tell you is that you’ll also be separately billed for what they call a “facility fee”. This can be anywhere from $180 to $450 and can obviously be quite a surprise. So your $20 copay can become anything up to $470 depending on your plan. Their justification for this is that they are “hospital based” even if they aren’t.

You can put your book online for free and sacrifice extrinsic reward (money) for greater intrinsic reward (popularity, impact on the world).<p>2. You can maximize your financial income by only selling the book.<p>I <i>thought<\/i> I was making that choice when I decided to put &quot;Game Programming Patterns&quot; online for free, but that&#x27;s not actually how it turned out. I have made much more money from the book than I would have if I&#x27;d gone with a traditional publisher and not put the book online for free. The model I have now is something like the classic marketing funnel. To make the most money from a thing, you need to have as many people go through this series of steps as possible:<p>1. Know that the product exists.<p>2. Decide to want it.<p>3. Be <i>just<\/i> willing to pay the price to acquire it. (Anything less and you&#x27;re leaving money on the table.)<p>4. Keep as much of that money for yourself as possible. (In other words, reduce costs.)<p>For technical books, most people don&#x27;t get past step 1. Putting the book online <i>dramatically<\/i> improves that. Of the people who do, many stop at step 2. There are so many articles out there, it&#x27;s easy to convince yourself you don&#x27;t need a acquire a whole book. Again, putting the book online helps: you can try before you buy.<p>Step 3 is the interesting one. Putting the book online <i>for free<\/i> obviously leaves, like, <i>all<\/i> money on the table. But what I have found is that there a self-selected market segmentation seems to come into play. Many people do read the book for free, but some choose to pay anyway.<p>Step 4 is the dirty secret of the big technical book publishers. They take an embarrassingly large chunk of each sale. That could maybe be justified in the old days of publishing when you needed to run a whole printing press and maintain relationships with independent book publishers and all that. But, frankly, they do not do enough to justify how much they take. Self-publishing fixes that, at the expense of having to do more of the work and management yourself. I had to find a freelance copy editor, and typeset and design the cover. But I effectively &quot;got paid&quot; to do that work at a much better rate than it would have cost me to &quot;pay&quot; a publisher to do that by giving them the lion&#x27;s share of each sale.<p>I don&#x27;t want to generalize too much from my one single data point, but it seemed that for me, the increased widening of the first two steps and the greater share at step 4 more than compensated for the money left on the table for some readers at step 3. It was a clear enough signal that I&#x27;m taking the same approach with my second book. And, equally importantly, I really liked the subjective experience of it being <i>my<\/i> book and being able to put it out into the world exactly the way I wanted to."],"time":["2020-04-26 22:55:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["railing1650"],"id":[23062959],"kids":{},"parent":[22985342],"text":["So a nobel prize winning scientist giving his opinion is banned?\nKeep bending over buddy..<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23062531\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23062531<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-04 02:04:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":{},"id":[22985542],"kids":{},"parent":[22985342],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-26 10:27:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22986399],"kids":{},"parent":[22985342],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-26 13:40:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["econcon"],"id":[22986323],"kids":[22986488,22986759,22986347],"parent":[22985342],"text":["I never pay for any book even tho I am high net worth, I always downloaded books from libgen.<p>Most of the books are not worth it"],"time":["2020-04-26 13:20:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hn_check"],"id":[22986810],"kids":[22987107,22987959],"parent":[22985342],"text":["This is one of those articles that is self-promotion disguised as a &quot;lesson&quot; of some sort, and it gets upvoted by loads of people who then want to engage in their own self-promotion.<p>&quot;Oh yes, this is true..my experiencing with my book [link]&quot;...<p>Tech&#x2F;software dev books make extremely little money.

In that — again oversimplified — model if you get 50% o the population using the app (compared to 80% smartphone usage in western Europe), it detects 80% of transmissions and (say) 50% of people follow up correctly before themselves passing the disease on, you end up with 10% of infection chains traced.

Beamforming microphones absolutely help in a huge way, because if you know the speaker&#x27;s voice is coming from 45° then knowing that any sound coming from any other angle can be removed is a really helpful piece of info.<p>Now, with beamforming microphones, the precise relative location and direction of each mic is known. The idea of creating one big beamforming mic for the room out of people&#x27;s individual mics is... insanely hard, but super cool.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me that this article is about measuring the quality of voice transcription, rather than about the quality of audio in an actual meeting. But I suppose the voice transcription quality measurement is simply a proxy for the speaker audio quality generally, no?<p>This could actually be a huge step forward in not needing videoconferencing equipment in meeting rooms. So far, one of the biggest reasons has actually been dealing with echo and feedback -- when people are in the same call with multiple devices in the same room, it tends to end badly. But if the audio processing is <i>designed<\/i> for that... the results could actually be quite amazing.<p>And it&#x27;s well-known that the &quot;bowling alley&quot; visual of meeting participants (camera at the end of a long conference table) isn&#x27;t ideal.
