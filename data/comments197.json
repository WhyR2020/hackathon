We currently have a handful of live products including the company&#x27;s in-house Transportation Management System, Customer portals, Carrier portals, mobile apps, and more.  While the majority of our products are currently built with PHP, React, and Postgres, we are always evaluating new languages, methodologies, and strategies.  The software development group is quickly growing and there are a lot of opportunities for people to make an impact daily.<p>IT department employees participate in a bi-weekly &quot;innovation day&quot; where groups form and work on projects outside the normal development sprint.  We use this time to explore new topics, enhance existing processes, and build entirely new technology.  We meet the day after as a department and discuss what we learned. It&#x27;s a great opportunity for everyone to grow together and work on things they are passionate about.<p>We have a relatively new Tech blog here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.ielfreight.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.ielfreight.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>We are looking for a Software Architect to help with our next generation of products.

We&#x27;re going to fix that, and we&#x27;d like you to help.<p>We&#x27;re founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, ML researchers, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into hospitals and beyond. We&#x27;re well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world.<p>Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio&#x2F;DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks. We&#x27;re adamant that...<p>- ...product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.<p>- ...honest, frequent, and open communication are more significant contributors to software development than technical wizardry.<p>- ...diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.<p>About You:<p>- You realize that lowering hypothesis test turnaround time from months to minutes requires applying best-of-breed DevOps concepts to the data science workflow.<p>- You can&#x27;t wait to combine your background with our unprecedented EEG dataset to blow published statistical EEG results out of the water.<p>- You will discover and formulate techniques for analysis that haven&#x27;t even been attempted with EEG outside of Beacon due to lack of data and&#x2F;or infrastructure (e.g. &quot;How might we refactor our existing spike detection algorithm to achieve high inter-rater agreement on noisy signals across a reduced set of channels?&quot;)<p>- You&#x27;ll help develop new methodologies for aggregating a vast quantity of labels from expert neurologist readers of differing backgrounds and opinions.<p>- You&#x27;ve developed a solid, heavily-exercised workflow for debugging model performance; you now know more about the limitations of automatic differentiation and distributed heterogeneous computing than you ever thought you would when you started your ML journey (e.g. &quot;How can I alter this model&#x27;s architecture to mitigate the decrease in sample throughput once I lower the minibatch size?&quot;)<p>- You will help steer engineering efforts to standardize, improve, and automate our model development&#x2F;deployment lifecycle and related tooling.<p>- You&#x27;ll provide constant feedback about what we do wrong and how we can do better.<p>- As Beacon grows, you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to build and lead teams that accomplish all of the above - tenfold!<p>- You&#x27;ll have the opportunity to co-author scientific papers whose impact pushes the neurocritical care, neuroscience, and machine learning communities past contemporary limitations.<p>- PhD in relevant field or equivalent research engineering experience.<p>Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we&#x27;re pushing &gt;70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, where we&#x27;re developing a deep learning platform for rapid hypothesis testing, sleek data visualization, and interactive analysis exploration.

You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS.

I left when I was ten during communist times, lived in Canada. I haven&#x27;t been back since, until last year. Things I noticed, compared to Canada.<p>1) It&#x27;s the whitest country I ever been to. Warsaw is a little more diverse. But otherwise, its 99.9% white people everywhere. It was a little weird. \nBut also lots of Ukrainian immigrants.<p>2) Everyone dresses super nice. When I came back, I was little shocked how sloppy people look here.<p>3) Polish people walk almost everywhere. Unsurprisingly, almost no fat people. It felt almost like being transported back in time, to one of those pictures of NY I saw from the 1930. Streets filled with tall, slander and upright people, busy walking to places.<p>4) New roads&#x2F;highways almost everywhere. Possibly designed by Germans...don&#x27;t know. But Great.<p>5) Rail Transportation is awesome. Travelled around the country from city to city by train, and airplane once. Each city has its own distinct architecture and feeling. And only a few hours away. \nCloses thing I can compare it to is if Vancouver, Toronto, \nMontreal, Halifax, where all two to three hours away from each other. And you can hop on a train that will get you there in an hour. 200km&#x2F;h trains. Very developed railway network. Probably inherited from Communist past.<p>6) Consistently, every coffee shop I went to, the coffee was excellent, and the pastries fresh. Puts Starbucks to shame. And Tim Hortons makes me want to cry. \nI only had better coffee in Hawaii. \nBut for whatever reason at home there, people still drink folgers crystals.<p>7) Lots of students everywhere. I learned since coming back, something like 30% of Polish people have Masters degrees. Highest rate in the world.<p>8) Much better built and often larger housing. So many 50+ year old small wood shacks still left over here in Canada. You pretty much have to be a multi millionaire here in Canada to build a house in the same way as they build them there.<p>9) Still very affordable to Travel, and a pretty high standard of hotels&#x2F;food&#x2F; accommodations ... you can get for about half price. If&#x2F;when Poland switched to Euro, things will probably double or triple.<p>10) Very active restaurant &#x2F; social life.

It seemed reasonable, so I accepted. Maybe I could have gotten more - but accepting has been, by far, the best decision of my career.<p>A couple of years ago, we purchased a used Tesla (2014 MS P85D+) from someone on Craigslist. The estimated value of the car in a private sale was $48-53K on TrueCar, and the buyer was asking $50K. We paid $50K. We haven&#x27;t had any problems with the car, and ended up having some roof racks&#x2F;equipment given to us for free later on by the seller because he didn&#x27;t need them anymore. We even found out he had prepaid the next 5 years of maintenance with Tesla.<p>We just went under contract on a new house, and we negotiated the deal without a real estate agent representing us. This was the extent of the negotiation:<p><pre><code>  - Us: We&#x27;ll pay 6% below list, but you can save 3% because we don&#x27;t have an agent.\n  - Them: We&#x27;ll accept 5% below list.\n  - Us: Ok.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe house had already been reduced 13% from the original list price - it&#x27;s near train tracks and we think that scared a lot of people away. But we visited open houses and listened to the trains several times and decided we weren&#x27;t bothered by it - they go slow because of a nearby turn and never blow the horn. We felt the original pricing was in line with the market for something of the same quality fit&#x2F;finish. So we got a new house for 20% less than we would have paid for a similar one in exchange for something that doesn&#x27;t really bother us.<p>Also, the builder built his own house 20 feet away. We&#x27;re going to be neighbors with the person we were negotiating with, and it would be better to be on good terms with them than to simply extract the maximum amount of value from them in the transaction. If anything in the house needs to be fixed in the future that isn&#x27;t technically covered in the builder&#x27;s warranty, they&#x27;re more likely to work with us to fix it or help us get it fixed at a low cost. Plus they&#x27;re our only neighbor and we&#x27;re probably going to invite them over for dinner every now and then.<p>However, as much as I&#x27;m a fan of win&#x2F;win dealmaking, I find it only works well when the other party is interested in a win&#x2F;win. The first thing I do when I approach the negotiating table is assess whether the other party is a smarmy Glengarry Glen Ross&#x2F;Art of The Deal jerk who is trying to rip me off. My solution to negotiating with one of these people is simple - don&#x27;t. Just walk away. Leave the wolves to bite at each others&#x27; throats and find someone else to work with.

I won&#x27;t go into rebuttal here, the author of the post did enough damage as it is.<p>PHP evolved significantly since version 4. Version 5 was the &quot;big&quot; deal, with good object oriented features. Version 7 brought the performance in, so we could get rid of Facebook&#x27;s crappy HHVM (thank you PHP team). Version 8 brings JIT, however most of the workload isn&#x27;t CPU bound but I&#x2F;O bound.<p>So, here&#x27;s something for PHP devs:<p>Swoole. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swoole.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swoole.co.uk<\/a> -&gt; this is an extension for PHP which brings in the same primitives available to people using Node.js or Golang - coroutines, async I&#x2F;O, channels, event loop control and much more.<p>What it essentially does is turn ALL I&#x2F;O from synchronous to asynchronous. Without any code change or control structure in form of async&#x2F;await or promises. Write synchronous code, get asynchronous performance.<p>From my own experience (I&#x27;ve been running swoole in production for 18 months), the performance gain I saw was minimum 500% to a maximum of 2000% (the numbers aren&#x27;t a joke).<p>As for PHP - it&#x27;s a programming language. You can use it right or you can use it badly. This rule applies to almost any language. There&#x27;s no language in this universe that can turn a bad programmer into semi-ok programmer or even good programmer. If you haven&#x27;t got the habits and knowledge, there&#x27;s no language that can rectify it. I&#x27;ve seen way too many people thinking the language of their choice is to blame, but it was always the person in the chair.<p>PHP performs well. Ecosystem is quite large and luckily there aren&#x27;t competing standards. Composer, the package manager, is wonderful. There&#x27;s plenty of frameworks to choose - for web and for CLI usage. Features are being added, slowly but steadily.<p>I use PHP with Laravel + nginx, next to Nuxt + Vuetify + TypeScript for frontend stuff. Personally, I really like how the mentioned tech can be utilized to create great apps <i>fast<\/i> - with structured code, that look good and work quick.<p>Edit: one of the best and most powerful features in PHP (starting with 7.4) is the FFI - foreign function interface. The option to utilize libraries or entire software, without the need to write PHP extensions, is what&#x27;s amazing for me (I also need it due to nature of my work).<p>PHP is way more powerful than people give it credit for.

That is, they are not a good fit for the community. I see no compelling reason to choose PHP for a greenfield project if, when used in a production environment with a stable framework, you are writing essentially the same code as you would for Java&#x2F;C#. There is hardly a feature where an ASP.NET core C# project isn&#x27;t still miles ahead of the same Symphony&#x2F;Laravel back-end.

I don&#x27;t want my PHP application to &quot;look&quot; just like a Java&#x2F;C# app. I don&#x27;t want a `Controllers` directory and `RepositoryInterface`s everywhere... I don&#x27;t want all of the same ceremony it takes to develop a .NET Core&#x2F;Spring app copied into PHP.

These are the things that have made PHP so dead-simple&#x2F;approachable over the years.<p>You want more features? Fine. Add pre-processing directives (akin to .razor). Allow for files to truly be treated as modules. Simplify&#x2F;abstract templating into the language better. That is, instead of focusing on the kinds of &quot;features&quot; that better-enable OOP (and move away from a composition of &quot;scripts&quot;), focus on making it easier&#x2F;better to compose &quot;scripts&quot;. Make _that_ safer, clearer, more ergonomic. There are _plenty_ of ways to dramatically improve PHP (as a platform) without simply updating the language semantics.

Most people are trained to not apply this skill.<p>This is so true it hurts. I&#x27;m currently working on a project in an agile structure, and it&#x27;s going like many agile projects I&#x27;ve worked on in the past. Agile is used as a buzzword for &quot;fuck planning, just write user stories and be done with it&quot;, all while team mates bitch and moan about spending too long in &quot;planning&quot; meetings. The second we took the time to actually have these meetings and plan out our backlog, we made key decisions and discoveries about how things work, what edge cases we need to think about, what doesn&#x27;t work from a user perspective, etc.<p>&gt; How kind your teammates are has a larger impact on your effectiveness than the programming language you use.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve always believed that empathy is the best skill you can have in software, and that is often paired together with kindness. An empathetic team is often a kind team, and when empathy is a core part of a team it highlights areas where certain stakeholders don&#x27;t share that trait."],"time":["2020-02-03 12:20:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["classified"],"id":[22223509],"kids":{},"parent":[22222137],"text":["Thank [insert relevant deity] I&#x27;m not a reasonable person, so I can afford to agree with all of the author&#x27;s points.
