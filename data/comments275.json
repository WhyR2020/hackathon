I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the time to fix old links, given the average lifespan of a website is 2½ years and trying to automate the detection of link rot is a fools errand (a page that goes 404 or does not respond is easy—now handle the case where it&#x27;s a new company running the site and all old links still go a page, but not the page that you linked to).

Personally, I&#x27;ve only had to pay taxes abroad, in the UK, where there was no opportunity to evade them (because they were directly deducted from my salary - I&#x27;m a PhD student now hence the past tense). I wouldn&#x27;t really say I&#x27;m an expert tax evader.<p>That said, any discussion of taxation and tax avoidance in Greece as well as the rest of South-Eastern Europe must also take into account the sorry state of public services, which tax money is meant to support. It&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem, but it&#x27;s easy to see why nobody would want to be the malakas who pays their taxes properly only for their tax money to disappear down the black hole of corruption before having any chance to improve the national health service, education, our roads, etc etc. Taxation makes sense when it&#x27;s spent to improve and maintain the commons - not to line politicians&#x27; pockets.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not absolving my fellow Greeks of responsibility. Corruption is high in Greece because we support corrupt politicians with our votes, and because we have done so for three generations since the &quot;metapolitefsis&quot;, the change to democracy after the years of the military dictatorship (ended in 1974).

We keep voting the same &quot;houses&quot; in power and then complain that they suck us dry and destroy the economy.

We <i>still<\/i> teach BASIC because one of the robotics platforms still in existence is the BoeBot from Parallax. It uses the BASIC Stamp. When I started, the rest of the team was only doing the BoeBot. I started learning microcontrollers with the BASIC Stamp and I forgot how restricting it is when you try to do much with it. I proposed we adopt the Parallax Shield bot which uses an Arduino as the brain instead of the BASIC Stamp.  \nLeadership agreed.<p>It&#x27;s actually more difficult to teach Arduino in a day or two and hope any of it sticks if the person you&#x27;re training in coming in with zero programming background. BASIC is still an easy language for complete newbie to pick up in a short amount of time. The ease of learning comes at a cost later on though. I&#x27;ve encouraged teachers to start with BASIC if their students had no prior background or if they themselves feel overwhelmed by the wider pastures of the Arduino. I underscore that the time spent learning C++ in an Arduino context is a better investment than time spent mastering BASIC. BASIC is easy to learn for the purposes of the robot, but C++ can control the robot and allow you to branch out into countless other languages. I liken programming languages to spoken languages and learning C++ is like learning Latin. It may be obtuse and difficult at first, but once it clicks, you can easily slide into any number of other languages with ease.<p>I&#x27;m now not really beating the BASIC drum anymore, instead I talk up Python now that Parallax has released a bot built atop the micro:bit. It&#x27;s limited in the amount of memory on board and python eats embedded memory for lunch. It&#x27;s time well spent learning Python. It allows students to grow into &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot; far easier. Kids that learn Python on something like this robot can easily write the same kind of code on a computer to have it do all sorts of things. Kids in camps that I&#x27;ve run (and students in my classroom years ago) love learning about the countless python libraries they can use. I casually point out &quot;mouse&quot; and they making &quot;random mouse movement&quot; scripts as a gag. I always &quot;fall for it&quot; each time. (&quot;Oh no! What?! My mouse... it&#x27;s jumping all over the place!!!&quot; - met with giggles, high fives, raucous laughter, etc)<p>So, yeah, I actually still teach BASIC on occasion, but I&#x27;m more and more turning teachers into Python lovers and C++ for the Arduino."],"time":["2019-12-12 20:38:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sixothree"],"id":[21774720],"kids":[21775317],"parent":[21774286],"text":["In one of our solutions (about 75+ projects) we have a single VB.net project with just a few classes.

The point of it seems to be to show how the recent sudden increase in temperature is unprecedented in the last 22000 years. The problem is that the data for different intervals comes from different sources. The last part showing the rapid rise comes from very accurate, yearly measurements. Historical data comes from reconstructions with much lower resolution. In a signal processing sense that means that the historical data is &quot;low pass filtered&quot;. In other words, it lacks high frequency variation. You could say that the information you need to decide whether the recent rapid temperature rise is unprecedented or not is missing from the vast majority of the chart, but it&#x27;s present in the last segment of the chart.<p>Authors of the Marcott et. al. (2013) [1] paper that the XKCD chart uses state:<p><i>Q:<\/i> &quot;Is the rate of global temperature rise over the last 100 years faster than at any time during the past 11,300 years?&quot;<p><i>A:<\/i> &quot;Our study did not directly address this question because the paleotemperature records used in our study have a temporal resolution of ~120 years on average, which precludes us from examining variations in rates of change occurring within a century. Other factors also contribute to smoothing the proxy temperature signals contained in many of the records we used, such as organisms burrowing through deep-sea mud, and chronological uncertainties in the proxy records that tend to smooth the signals when compositing them into a globally averaged reconstruction. <i>We showed that no temperature variability is preserved in our reconstruction at cycles shorter than 300 years<\/i>, 50% is preserved at 1000-year time scales, and nearly all is preserved at 2000-year periods and longer. Our Monte-Carlo analysis accounts for these sources of uncertainty to yield a robust (albeit smoothed) global record. Any small “upticks” or “downticks” in temperature that last less than several hundred years in our compilation of paleoclimate data are probably not robust, as stated in the paper.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;fresh-thoughts-from-authors-of-a-paper-on-11300-years-of-global-temperature-changes&#x2F;?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;fresh-thoughts...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-12 12:07:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21770831],"kids":{},"parent":[21770753],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-12 11:43:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["toomuchlove"],"id":[21771662],"kids":{},"parent":[21770753],"text":["Please label 2016"],"time":["2019-12-12 14:34:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dogwhistle"],"id":[21770792],"kids":{},"parent":[21770753],"text":["Hug of death .

Mueller ra[es and kills twelve boys. About roughly 00:55 Representative Adam Schiff who will also be leading an impeachment effort, also requests the same deal as Nadler, and then tries to make a case for getting more than Nadler and Mueller. Adam Schiff rapes and kills three boys. Mueller and Schiff all receive $3 billion dollars each for joing the group. Nadler came back to witness these two rape to make sure they were all bound together under one purpose: keep Trump in power, and also to confirm the payments to each, including his $10.5 billion dollar payment.\n\n    Between the Mueller and Schiff turns, the group issues orders for ten women to begin prepping more boys for rape. They are former friends and family of Brian Schlenker, and also some long standing Illuminati members who include Elsa Hosk, Gigi &amp; Bella Hadid. Again, the &quot;prep&quot; these females engage means they perform oral sex on the boys’ penis and anus, as a child rapist like Henry Porter would, while trying to remove fecal matter from the boy prior to handing them over to be raped and subsequently murdered.

The Prime was a minicomputer from the 80&#x27;s.  I worked with Primes for many years and also worked at the company as an OS specialist for 18 months.<p>Seven versions of the Primos operating system, from rev 18 to rev 24, have been recovered from disks, 9-track tapes, and 8mm backup tapes.  The company died around 1992.<p>There has been a <i>huge<\/i> amount of Prime software that as far as I know, is lost to time.  Oracle ran on it.  SPSS. A native DBMS.  Every one of the major OS revs had 5-10 minor revs.  Some software products are only available for certain revs.  I actually used rev 12, so at least half of the OS versions are completely missing.  And Prime released source for their products.  Most of that is missing.<p>For me personally, the emulator was &#x2F; is a very rewarding project, and maybe for a handful of others who are still alive and used Primes in high school, college, or work.  It&#x27;s been really fascinating to &quot;relive&quot; my Prime days now and then, and others have made similar comments.<p>But how valuable is it really?  Is it more than just a curiosity now?  Sure, for a current or future computer historian, it might be viewed as a gold mine, but as time goes on, it has less and less value IMO, especially as the people who actual used one die off.  If in a few years, only 10 people in the world care about such a thing, does it make sense to save it for all time?  I have my doubts.  And if I did have <i>all<\/i> of the versions of Primos, and all of the software ever written for Primes, would it make a difference even now, when there are people alive who actually used this computer system?  Also seems doubtful.<p>To me, an &quot;archive everything and let someone else figure out if it&#x27;s useful&quot; strategy seems impractical.  If I had my choice, sure, I&#x27;d like to have every major version of the OS and all of the products for each version.  But all of the dot-revs too?  Nope - not important.  Would I like <i>all<\/i> of the manuals?  Yep!<p>Some of the products like Oracle, DBMS, etc. were a bitch to configure back in the day, and certainly would be even harder now with very few people around to help.  So even if I did have them, I doubt I could get them running.  And even if they were running, they were a specialty product at the time, with few experts, so finding someone today that would be interested in them would be a needle &#x2F; haystack thing.<p>It all reminds me of family pictures.  Before my grandma died, she went through a large box of B&#x2F;W photos, explaining to us who all the people were, and we wrote on the back of the photos.  But just 3 generations after her, the generation after me, no one knows the people in the photos (except my mom is in some - their grandma).  In a way it seems that this family history is somehow important, but no one younger than me is interested <i>at all<\/i>.  And truthfully, I never look at the pictures myself.  I ended up scanning the photos with my mom or grandma, putting them on a digital picture frame for my nephews, and leaving the rest out.  I asked them first - they didn&#x27;t care about any of the others.<p>I&#x27;m not an archivist, but it seems to me that curation is a much more important aspect than grabbing everything and keeping it alive forever.  Not curating seems like a &quot;scale to infinity&quot; problem.  Those tend to not end well.<p>I think the IA is great project and am not intending to be critical, but giving my own perspective about preserving some very small piece of computer history."],"time":["2019-12-12 05:12:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gatherhunterer"],"id":[21764869],"kids":[21765449,21764917,21765115,21764901,21765218,21769910,21765378,21765598,21764913],"parent":[21764592],"text":["Twitter is the worst choice for publishing.

Let&#x27;s take a look!<p>100 years ago, companies on average dispersed 90% of their earnings back to shareholders as dividends. But by the 1970&#x27;s however that number fell to below 50%. Fast forward to the 2000&#x27;s and the payout ratio is down to around ~30%.<p>What happened? Companies used to distribute their profits back to their owners, the shareholders. But that isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s happening anymore. In my amateur historical analysis, I believe there are two causes for this disastrous trend:<p>1) Tax dodging<p>2) The Casino&#x2F;Gambling Mentality of Stock Market Investing<p>My theory is that the trend started with investors 50 to 100 years ago looking to dodge taxes, and gain a little free compounding. Makes sense! Right?<p>But it&#x27;s just gone too far. Now investors receive almost nothing for owning a stock. Take Apple Inc. for example. In 2019 Apple made a profit of $55 billion. How much of that did they pay back to their shareholders? $14 billion.<p>And Apple isn&#x27;t even the most egregious case. They at least pay a dividend. Google, Amazon, and Facebook combined paid $0 back to their shareholders this year!<p>So how has this insanity continued to go on for so long? The answer is simple: Adults don&#x27;t know what stocks are. They think that a stock is a thing that you buy, its price goes up and down, and the game is to try and sell the stock when the price goes up, and hope that the price doesn&#x27;t go down.

I remember one individual, in particular, we&#x27;ll call him &quot;Bob&quot;.  This guy&#x27;s ignorance was rivaled only by his arrogance.  Bob ended up taking over the team that myself and a coworker (who I shared an office with) and almost immediately started causing grief.  A series of boneheaded, and very expensive decisions were made which effectively eliminated the department at the next lay-off cycle.  Somehow the Bob not only survives another set of layoffs, he gets promoted and is now in my direct reporting chain.  Almost immediately, any interdepartmental communication was forbidden (and I&#x27;m talking &quot;Database Admins&quot; not being allowed to e-mail &quot;Unix sysadmins&quot;), and similarly, much of his department started crumbling.  I got out quick and my coworker, Greg (not really), entered a new level of hell.<p>Though my department changed, my location didn&#x27;t, and I still worked with Greg 75% of the time.  Greg felt his wrath, daily and I got a bit of it &quot;by splash&quot;.  Then Greg saw an opportunity -- he was asked to discuss a project with the CIO, our department Director and VP.  Greg didn&#x27;t hesitate to bring up Bob[0].  It went over like a lead baloon; holy cow, the whole mood in the room changed.  Something we hadn&#x27;t known -- Bob hung out with a lot of folks in the office outside of work.  He worked at the main office, which was much larger and in a different time zone than us and our Director.  The VP in the room was also from the main office.  Shortly after the meeting, he was informed by his boss that she had spent the last hour &quot;begging for them to not fire [coworker]&quot;.  Yep.  They were all friends.<p>Well, my story has a bit of an uglier ending, but not one that isn&#x27;t deserved.  The struggling company was purchased by a competitor and the CIO was replaced.  Several layers were added above Bob.  The new headquarters was in a city far enough away that they had their own networks, isolated from the old guard.  Incredibly, Bob started making in-roads well before the acquisition was complete and had already begun trying to sully the reputations of people he considered &quot;enemies&quot;.  One of those people was Greg.<p>Now, Greg had a few people who didn&#x27;t like him.  He was very cut-and-dry, blunt, but he was an &quot;attack the idea, not the person&quot; kind of guy and if you understood that, you got along well with him.  He was&#x2F;is crazy smart, articulate and has a personality of the kind that you want to get behind because you know he&#x27;s going to be doing something great.  And he&#x27;d slept at the new office the entirety of the previous week making sure that the infrastructure side of things went off without a hitch.<p>We&#x27;re in a 9-person meeting &quot;war-room&quot; for the acquisition, and the CIO walks in -- I throw him a (sadly, over-prepared question) about REST and our (non-existent) service infrastructure and he mentioned something about Clojure.  My coworker is introduced[1] him and he said &quot;So, what&#x27;s the deal with Bob? ...&quot;.  He attacked the person.  And went on for 15 minutes, deadpan, facts-only, listing every failure and its inevitable origin: a decision Bob forced down the department&#x27;s throat.  I watched the new CIO get more and more disgusted -- he was a rare beast -- a C-level at a multi-national who understood systems and didn&#x27;t have a skillset that was a decade out-of-date[2].  The CIO politely excused himself from the room, which was completely silent at this point save for my coworker and remained that way for a solid minute after the guy left the room[3].  Greg had gotten a little loud.<p>Then we remembered that we were there to watch him address the IT department on the big screen in the room[4].  Someone in tech announced that things would be getting started about 5 minutes late.  They started 15-minutes late.  Shortly after introducing himself, the CIO apologized and said he had to take care of a &quot;personnel issue&quot; that required a little more time than he had expected.  The door opened and our (new) department VP walked in, &quot;[CIO] just got off the phone with HR and Bob.  He was informed his services are no longer needed.&quot;  Greg was on his feet and the room erupted.  For literally months after that happened, people from the &quot;old company&quot; would call Greg (remote office) to thank him.  What was amazing to me was that literally everyone except for 3 people in IT management and leadership <i>knew this guy was at fault<\/i> and yet he continued to increase in his ability to cause problems.  It turned out that the prior week had been spent by the new CIO trying to wrap his head around the boneheaded architectural decisions he was inheriting.  All of these decisions had one name behind them and that guy had been with the company for 10 years!<p>[0] I don&#x27;t recommend it.  This guy, though, had stones and if given the opportunity to address the issue with someone higher on the chain, it trumped any fears of him losing the job.  &quot;If they&#x27;re not going to trust me to tell the truth when it&#x27;s hard to hear, they&#x27;re not someone I can morally work for.&quot; He had brought it up to every single person from above him up to the CIO, why not the CIO?<p>[1] That&#x27;s an understatement.  He was one of the major reasons infrastructure integration happened at all.  The CIO looked at him like he was some mad genius.<p>[2] I recognized the same on the development side when his Clojure response, despite not being a choice I would have made (unfamiliarity), was backed up with an argument that wasn&#x27;t marketing or otherwise buzz-wordy.<p>[3] Someone started with a &quot;So......&quot; at some point, I&#x27;m sure.<p>[4] The company had a studio -- really cool -- and complete stage&#x2F;audience room.

High-bypass turbofan engines have enormous cost advantages over traditional piston engines. It&#x27;s almost always more economical to use a turbofan engine to power aircraft in anything more than a short hop.<p>I see this being a classic case of something like Mainframes vs. PCs however. Most people don&#x27;t equate flying with General Aviation because GA has traditionally been so cost prohibitive, much the same way that mainframes were so cost prohibitive in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s. There are a few airlines, like Harbour Air, and Mokulele, that currently offer a short haul flights (usually over water) where people are willing to pay a lot more money. There are benefits like frequency of flights, but the big ones for me are not having to queue up for security, and being able to bring liquids on board. My wife once brought a can of soup on board Mokulele. Try doing that on Hawaiian.<p>If this can bring down the cost of short haul flights, particularly those around 200-250 miles, it could be extremely appealing, especially when coupled with ride hailing.

Since there is no bridge connecting the capital Victoria to the largest city Vancouver, they offer short flights on seaplanes that connect downtown to downtown as an alternative to ferries or larger airplanes that arrive at the airports further outside of the downtown core of either city.<p>In this constrained context it seems like an electric airplane could work really well and provide fuel savings and a quieter ride. They also seem to have some ambition with these electric aircraft to provide other short range flights.<p>&gt; MagniX CEO Roei Ganzarski said Dec. 10, 2019, will go down in history as the start of the electric aviation age, and believes the e-plane will eventually revolutionize how people travel by making short- to mid-range flights more economical than driving. &quot;It means you can stop driving for three, five, seven hours to get to a destination because there&#x27;s no other way to get there,&quot; he said. &quot;It means you can fly in a small aircraft from a small airport to a small airport....

Not cheap, but absolutely worth it for a novel one-time experience.

I was drawn in initially by the elegance of their social identity proof, and the chat that came from that. The idea of being able to send a message to someone and know it was them struck me as very powerful.<p>When they then announced KBFS I was excited. It was just as useful as chat, and makes a ton of sense as a next step for the product. My second thought was hoping that I&#x27;d be able to pay for a &quot;pro&quot; tier and they&#x27;d then become profitable and sustainable.<p>Teams I also think was a very natural progression and definetely felt like the next thing for them. Especially with sub-teams, it opened a lot of doors when combined with KBFS and chat. To me it seemed to be gearing towards an eventual free personal tier with paid-for teams funding the platform. This would be similar to the model we&#x27;ve seen work with GitHub and such.<p>What came next was months of hoping that Keybase would become more stable and easier to use. The apps were buggy, but I could deal with it. The UI&#x2F;UX wasn&#x27;t very intuitive but with some effort I, as a technical person, could figure it out. I could even explain the concepts to non-technical friends and get them excited for it. But the quality just never picked up. The pain my friends experienced came from a crappy user experience, an incredibly flakey app (mobile and desktop). They all stopped using it, and so my usage became limited as well.<p>Then after months of waiting and hoping for improvements, they announced Stellar integrat. I was confused, it didn&#x27;t really seem to have a straight forward commercial aspect. In my mind, you can sell keybase with file storage and teams, it seems like an attractive offering! Especially with hard line gaurentees of identity, that&#x27;s a huge problem which is suddenly solved. But cryptocurrency, while fitting with the cryptography theme, didn&#x27;t feel like it fit with the product they&#x27;d built. What&#x27;s more, the apps still hadn&#x27;t become more usable or stable.<p>I think my frustration with Keybase is that I thought they were using cryptography to solve problems with communication and collaboration. Instead it seems to be an excuse to for some crytopgrahy enthusiasts to build more things with cryptography. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a commercial approach, nor a true desire to make the power of cryptography accessible to the masses.<p>I really wish they&#x27;d invest in making teams, kbfs, chat, and identity easier to use and more stable. If they did, I&#x27;d find it really easy to convince my employer to give them money for the product suite. But instead they seem to want to throw in any feature related to cryptography, rather than building a product suite and applying cryptography to solve common issues.<p>I hope someone will one day take what Keybase has started, and will focus on the product rather than the tech. I&#x27;m not a cryto expert, most of what I learned was from being inspired by the Keybase articles. But at the end of the day I want to leverage this tech to it&#x27;s maximum, not just use it because it&#x27;s &quot;fun&quot;."],"time":["2019-12-12 00:34:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gjghhry"],"id":[21759566],"kids":{},"parent":[21758671],"text":["I&#x27;ve ignored every single drop so far but the idea of a crypto economy through a chat app is a really good idea."],"time":["2019-12-11 05:22:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["dxemy"],"id":[21760827],"kids":{},"parent":[21758671],"text":["I get banned from this site every week or so.

Wouldn&#x27;t you rather appeal to customers who write bug-free code on the first try?<p>To really show disdain for your customers, use a proprietary protocol so that language support is limited to the client libraries you provide, preferably as binary blobs that are never updated. If you design it carefully, a proprietary protocol can be difficult to understand and impossible to debug, too.<p>Alternatively, you can use SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). According to Wikipedia, SOAP &quot;can be bloated and overly verbose, making it bandwidth-hungry and slow. It is also based on XML, making it expensive to parse and manipulate—especially on mobile or embedded clients&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SOAPjr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SOAPjr<\/a>). Sounds like a win-win!&quot;<p>I remember when the early days of Amazon S3, trying to write Bourne shell scripts using shell built-ins and single purpose UNIX utilities to form the HTTP and interact with the servers, instead of scripting languages with libraries like Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.   This is how I interact with HTTP servers normally.  I never have any problems keeping things simple and dependency-free.<p>To do this with S3, it felt nigh impossible.  There were small errors in their documentation of how things actually worked.  It felt like they were intentional just to trip me up.  I know they were not.<p>The official recommendation back in those early days of AWS was to use one of the protocol options provided by Amazon, HTTP or SOAP.  You would think, heh, I will avoid SOAP and keep it simple.  I will just use HTTP.<p>The truth is both required using scripting languages with libraries.  Amazon&#x27;s own utilities were written in Java.  I know developers have their reasons for making these choices, but as a user, that complexity really put me off.<p>From my perspective, this ACM article is right on point.<p>&quot;When I see a top-down description of a system or language that has infinite libraries described by layers and layers, all I just see is a morass. I can&#x27;t get a feel for it. I can&#x27;t understand how the pieces fit; I can&#x27;t understand something presented to me that&#x27;s very complex.

Although the amount of liquid assets and equity in the sub-prime lending debacle was an order of magnitude larger than the student loan crisis, the outcome for the student loan crisis isn&#x27;t quite so clear yet.  Allow me to paint a scenario...<p>There is a significant difference between the two lending fiascos, but mostly in how the fallout will look.  Both the mortgage crisis and the student loan crisis started out as government programs meant to incentivize borrowing.  They succeeded, mortgage debt rose 12%&#x2F;yr in the years leading to the crisis, student loan deb at 11%&#x2F;yr.  Student loan debt now outpaces credit card and auto debt, and is 2nd only to mortgage debt.  An increase in easy borrowing lead to higher prices in both cases, in the 10 years leading up to the housing recession, home prices went up 80%.  In the last 10 years tuition prices have risen by also 80%.  Not a problem if the value of the home or degree continues to rise, but labor income for college grads hasn&#x27;t grown in 60 years.  At all.  In fact, if you adjust for inflation there has even been a slight decrease since 1960.  Currently 30% of student lending ends up in default, but this number is also growing quickly and projections show this number at 40% by 2025.  Sub-prime defaults were around 11% at its peak, so the rates of default for student lending are WAY worse than those of sub-prime mortgage lending, even though the total debt is significantly less.  The big problem w&#x2F; sub-prime lending was the inability to pay them back (obviously), and same is happening with student loans - due to a lack of underwriting.  You can&#x27;t exactly repossess a degree, and even if you could the value on the 2nd hand market would be null.  Filing bankruptcy would make mortgage lending debts go away, but that isn&#x27;t the case with student loans, which will remain in perpetuity.  True, overall mortgage debt was about 10x what student loan debt is at its peak, but there haven&#x27;t been large derivatives markets set up to eat it like what happened with the mortgage collapse.  Since the student lending default overage is going to be WAY more than what the US Government will be able to recoup from Social Security checks or income tax refunds, the person who will ultimately foot the bill for this lending crisis will not be insured banks; it will be you, the taxpayer, and ultimate the economy writ-large.  Unless payroll wages somehow magically jump high enough to cover the stagnation we&#x27;ve experienced since the 1960&#x27;s - unlikely without intervention.<p>It won&#x27;t be easy for our economy to recover from this downturn either because the issues will be cultural and systemic.  The course-corrective measures would be lenders locking out lower-income families from colleges, which prevents economic mobility and leads to a faster collapse of our middle class.  Colleges will maybe drop tuition rates slightly but tuition is largely sticky, unlike housing prices.  This may even lead to some colleges going out of business.  Loans will likely start to be under-written appropriately, but this means degrees will be prioritized based on earnings potential, which means only a narrow field of study (medical, lawyers, tech, etc) will be eligible for lending.  Schools may even price degrees differently, meaning schools will likely trend towards degree programs with the largest earnings potential, to the detriment of many other crucial fields of study.  Ultimately college will become an institution to perpetuate a narrow focus of study, and only to those already in positions of wealth - which will further hasten the collapse of our middle class.<p>The student lending crisis is already having far-reaching economic slowdown implications, from decreased home ownership, higher rental rates, to lower purchasing of goods&#x2F;services overall; with no clear indication of how to easily course-correct.  Not to mention a worsening of cultural and systemic issues already in place.  We may not be smart enough to even realize what hit us until it does."],"time":["2019-12-11 15:18:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["McTossOut"],"id":[21759286],"kids":{},"parent":[21753230],"text":["So, assume colleges overcharged.
