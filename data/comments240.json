TT1 &quot;knocked the teeth&quot; out of clock cycles if the checker-retirement unit (CRU, the hottest part of the die) got too hot. This evolved into TT2&#x2F;Geyserville (where you move up&#x2F;down the V&#x2F;F curve to actively stay under the throttle limit). We were browbeaten by upper management to prove this would not visibly impact performance and worked on one of the MANY MANY software simulators written throughout the company to prove this. (It was actually my favourite job there.) This is when the term &quot;Thermal Design Power&quot; arrived: top marketing brass to avoid using &quot;Max Power&quot; which was far higher. It is possible to have almost a 2x difference between max power (running a &quot;power virus&quot;, which intel was terrified of from chipsets, to graphics, to CPUs) and what typical apps use (thermal design power). Performance was a bit dodgy on a few apps, but not a significant compared to run-to-run vairation. (Remember this is 1995-1997 after the half-arsed Pentium fiasco in 1993 when Motorola openly mocked intel for having a 16W CPU... FDIV wasn&#x27;t thermal fiasco, but it was a proper cock up).<p>Die are sorted based on something called a bin split: die are binned immediately after wafersort based on their leakage (there are special transistors implanted near the scribe-lines that indicate tons of characteristics, as well as DFX units through out the die that are rings of 20 inverters that oscillate, also indicates tons of data on how the die behave, however testing the those buggered DFX circuits takes an enormous amount of time, and you can&#x27;t slow down wafersort, so there are proxies).<p>The bins are designed in such a way to maximize profit and performance based on the die characteristics. Thermal throttle plays a role in this and each bin (among various vectors) is allowed some tolerance, which is exactly what OP has discovered. However, this has been going on for coming up on 30 years! So nothing really new here, I just thought I&#x27;d let you know that of course Intel is aware of this, and they never claim performance numbers outside of the tolerance allowed for thermal throttle."],"time":["2020-01-06 03:13:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mlyle"],"id":[21965251],"kids":[21965386,21966000,21965326,21965369,21969418,21965358],"parent":[21965102],"text":["There seems to be little attempt to ensure the ambient environment of the processors is isothermal.

Non-Standard Evaluation - Julia has Metaprogramming[1] and Symbols[2] which provide similar ideas in a different way. It uses abstract syntax trees and is very lisp-like in that way if you wanted to get into writing Macros and such.<p>3. Package Management - Julia has a best-in-class built in package management system with versioning. Julia also has first-class support for documentation, so its very easy for developers to write relevant documentation. As an R user before RStudio, package management was a pain but RStudio hides the manual work that used to be searching for, downloading, and unpacking packages. Packages usually work really well together, usually automatically so you can often get really cool results[3] where other languages would require a lot of coordination (like Tidyverse).<p>4. Function paradigm - Julia is multi-paradigm and is conducive to functional, imperative, object-oriented, among others.<p>I&#x27;m a big Julia fan, after having gone R -&gt; Python -&gt; Julia.

My general take is that Python really is a better suited language for production workflows, while R is superb at interactive workflows.  I love R, but chiefly for RMarkdown, Shiny, ggplot and obscure stats packages rather than large machine learning codebases. Here&#x27;s why:<p>&gt; Native data science structures.<p>DataFrames are often easier to use than Pandas. However, in production workflows we&#x27;re often using more datatypes than DataFrames, and R is weaker there.  For example:<p>* Lists must be accessed with `[[ ]]`, instead of `[ ]`.  I&#x27;ve seen many silent bugs slip through due to this.\n* There are 3 competing implementation of classes. This results in classes being mystical and rarely understood.\n* R is a Lisp 2. Variables and functions may share the same name. This leads to confusing errors.\n* Catching specific types of errors can be awkward.\n* Adding elements to a list iteratively is slow [1]<p>&gt; Non-Standard Evaluation<p>This can be handy while quickly working in RStudio, but it&#x27;s not easy to maintain.  I&#x27;ve seen code that failed because it specified `f(!!variable)` instead of `f(!!!variable)`.  I like R&#x27;s formula notation, but I&#x27;m happy enough with sklearn&#x27;s API that I don&#x27;t miss it.<p>&gt; The glory of CRAN<p>CRAN is not set up for production.  It makes pinning versions very difficult [2].  Many people resort to using MRAN, which is a Microsoft supported snapshot of CRAN at a specific time, so a dev can just pretend they are installing software as if it were 6 months ago.  I have seen MRAN go down multiple times [3].  Not to mention, the owner of CRAN is notoriously prickly [4] and packages will not be accepted to CRAN unless the maintainer ensures their software runs on Solaris [5].  Hadley Wickham has done so much for the community with `devtools` and his books.  He gets a lot of praise, but it&#x27;s not misplaced.<p>&gt; Functional programming<p>Okay, this is actually pretty great.  Hooray functional programming! Not totally related, but R has a great polymorphic dispatch of functions, which really can&#x27;t be undersold (the way automatic documentation generates for this is <i>kisses fingers<\/i>)<p>Ultimately, R is a cool language. In interactive settings, I would rather work in RStudio than Jupyter any day. I like RMarkdown better than Notebooks for sharing analysis, too.  If there is a specific Bayesian model necessary only available in R, that&#x27;s fine, wrap it in a container.  But the rest of the ETL and pipeline code feels easier to write and maintain in Python.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;17046336&#x2F;here-we-go-again-append-an-element-to-a-list-in-r\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;17046336&#x2F;here-we-go-agai...<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;17082341&#x2F;installing-older-version-of-r-package\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;17082341&#x2F;installing-olde...<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;microsoft-r-open&#x2F;issues&#x2F;51\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;microsoft-r-open&#x2F;issues&#x2F;51<\/a>\n[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rstats&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2t5oqp&#x2F;dont_use_the_mailing_lists_a_love_letter_to_the_r&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rstats&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2t5oqp&#x2F;dont_use_the...<\/a>\n[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deanbodenham.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;r-package-submission-to-cran.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deanbodenham.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;r-package-submission-to-cr...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-06 04:48:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mikorym"],"id":[21966995],"kids":{},"parent":[21965248],"text":["For those interested, there is a nice Vim plugin for R called Nvim-R."],"time":["2020-01-06 07:25:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tomerbd"],"id":[21968344],"kids":{},"parent":[21965248],"text":["I used to use R because of RStudio until JupyterLab came and flipped it all over now I use only bash and python for small data analysis as well."],"time":["2020-01-06 12:36:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j7ake"],"id":[21968115],"kids":{},"parent":[21965248],"text":["I use R for the statistical packages, handling data frames, and plotting.

Here a meaningful connection is defined as one where there is a mutual sense that you can confide in each other, you understand each other, and you would be there to support each other through difficult situations large and small.<p>You can have hundreds of social connections but if they don&#x27;t have these properties, they&#x27;re of limited utility in combating loneliness. This is why even in a city where it&#x27;s easy to meet people, loneliness is still a common ailment. This is why celebrities adored by millions can still be so lonely that they end their lives.<p>It&#x27;s difficult though not impossible to develop meaningful connections during adulthood. It takes years of contact and requires social or environmental conditions that may not be easy to find. So historically, the #1 source of them has been family (though not everyone is born into a family which supports and encourages them, and the prevalence of such healthy families is decreasing).<p>The loneliness epidemic in modern times is thus attributable in great part to the erosion of family units and other early age relationships. What makes it difficult to solve is that there were a number of grievances with that model which the liberal, individualist project intended to address, such as the oppression of women who were economically dependent on their husbands, and the way in which tightly knit families often stifled self-expression. The modern system in which all adults are workers and consumers also supports the interests of capital (more workers equals cheaper labor, more consumers means bigger markets, together you get record growth). No one really wants to roll back the progress that the liberal project achieved, but the side effects are ravaging society.<p>The colloquial solution is Friendsgiving dinner--let&#x27;s still do all the things people used to do with their families, but do it with our friends. However it misses the point that meaningful relationships must be developed over years of regular contact, mutual trust, and even sacrifice--not impossible, certainly worth attempting, but hard to do reliably in adulthood with people who may develop divergent interests over time (for example, starting their own families).

The amount of money, energy and time I plowed into this was incredible, and, in retrospect, I was often taken advantage of due to my almost desperate need to belong. From the outside I was a picture of social success, especially given that I had recently moved countries and started from scratch in the middle of nowhere.<p>But you see, it is easy to completely lose ones own identity if one values themselves from the mirror of the expectations of others, or, even worse, their expectations regarding others&#x27; expectations of themselves. At some especially dark night of my soul I was forced to admit that I had no idea who _I_ was. Everything I did was, essentially, facade building, and behind that facade there was emptiness, and a fair bit of chaos as well.<p>So sometime around 35 I gave up. I cut out my toxic parents from my life, stopped pursuing romantic relationships ot of fear of being alone, stopped collecting &#x27;cool&#x27; acquaintances in real life and on Facebook and focused instead on two things:\n- building quality relationships with those few humans whom I loved, respected and who truly reciprocated in kind,\n- discovering myself and building a stable foundation to become fully me.<p>I also got a dog, not because I am a dog person, but because I figured out that I have been looking for unconditional approval no human can actually give, but dogs, from what I read, can, and do all the time. This proved to be the right decision and has helped me a lot to become my own person.<p>It was, and still is, an adventure. I have discovered many new things I enjoy and discarded equally many I only partook because it was a way to please, finally stabilised my finances and career, acquired tons of knowledge, read hundreds of sci-fi and fantasy books, developed my own style, decorated my home entirely to my taste and, perhaps most surprisingly for anyone who knows me, taken up triathlon which I enjoy so much. It is both expensive and time-consuming, but, at last, all that time, money and energy goes to myself, forming a positive feedback loop.<p>My social interactions are a lot fewer and my circle of acquaintances a lot smaller these days, but each and every one of them is cherished. My life is busy enough now that both additional social interactions and romantic pursuits perforce are subjected to a sort of cost-benefit analysis - will this activity help me grow as a person more than the one I will be skipping out on instead?<p>My main insight from this process is that it seems that we in general expect someone else to provide for us the feeling of safety, companionship and happiness that we are fully capable of giving to ourselves. It is so much easier to blame others for our own misery - it requires no effort and gives a temporary relief from pain, transforming it into anger. Empowerment starts when, instead of hoisting it off to others we can not control, but can endlessly blame, we fully take responsibility for making ourselves happy, content and safe. The &#x27;unconditional positive regard&#x27; [1] is something we can give ourselves if only we allow ourselves to do so, and in so doing, heal and become whole in a way that nobody else can do for us.<p>Similarly to @pmoriarty, holidays which are traditional to be spent with ones family can still be tough for me sometimes. But just this last Christmas (which I spent entirely by myself) I came to conclusion that my main source of sadness is not the fact that I am alone. I do not like large gatherings of people, I do not enjoy most of the traditions around the holiday and I am bored by inane conversations which are part and parcel of gatherings of people who have not seen each other for a while and do not even know each other all that well anymore.<p>No, the sadness is due to the feeling that I am missing out on something that everyone else has, which society has conditioned me to believe is the only way to be happy at this particular date and time, with the associated feelings of unfairness, jealousy and self-pity. Once I got past that, I realised that I have the freedom to choose what _I_ want to do with the evening that will make _me_ happy, most likely a lot happier than any alternatives any other humans could provide. So I took home delicious food and spent the night being cosy and reflecting on the past year and making plans for the next one.<p>So to conclude, “there are infinitely many kinds of beautiful lives” [2].

(Not arguing the merits here, personally I prefer depth of understanding to a mechanical and superficial understanding, but business needs do differ)<p>So is it fair to say boot camps are stealing your money? The same way that any for-profit educational institute might. At the same time, they have a similar function to other educational institutions in that they are largely a culling mechanism and not an educational one - but that is a problem across the board.<p>It’s unfortunate that they market and promise what they do, as it’s just unrealistic - but that doesn’t mean that they don’t do anything. I don’t have the data anymore, but from multiple cohorts what I saw was a slightly skewed bell curve, where the top of the class (~1 out of every 10 or so) tends to do well and find a decent entry level job in 3-8 months, the bottom of the class just flatlines and really don’t learn a thing (1-4 of 10), and the remaining hustle hard to break into the industry for ~2 years or decide it’s not for them.<p>I haven’t run the numbers, but I know a lot of my college educated friends are not working in what they studied, so for those that ended up not in a code related role, but did not bottom out (I.e. they did learn some basics of how code works), were they scammed by the universities? (Okay, actually, as a victim of this myself, I’d say yes here, but again, I’m just pointing out this may not be isolated to boot camps)<p>Summary: only go to a boot camp if you have your eyes wide open and know it is a culling mechanism and that if you’re not in the top of the class or exceptionally lucky, you will not have an easy time finding employment. Even the top of the class won’t have an easy time, but it’ll be easier than you.

Some of those shovels are going to be crap.  Perhaps most.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that some people aren&#x27;t running an honest business(or in this case, a bootcamp).<p>- Bootcamps are what you make of them.  If you expect them to be like a school where knowledge is just dumped on your lap by a professor, you&#x27;re going to be in for a world of disappointment.  If you&#x27;re willing to take charge of your learning and are willing to spend the time sharing knowledge with others, and dedicate yourself to maximizing your time(studying, projects, failing in a good way), then a bootcamp will be for you.  <i>I spent as much time as I could learning, and was often the last person to exit the building in the early AM.<\/i><p>- In relation to the previous point, you may not necessarily need a bootcamp.  If you have the passion and the will, you can acquire the knowledge and skills on your own.  You could take the tens of thousands of dollars you&#x27;d spend on a bootcamp and quit work for a while to study and do projects at home, go to hacker spaces, and attend developer meetups, and you&#x27;d get something pretty close to what a bootcamp will give you.  However, a bootcamp will bring you together with a bunch of other people in the same position as you in somewhere like San Francisco where there&#x27;s nonstop action going on.  By going to Dev Bootcamp, I was immersed in a world I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have been exposed to and had experiences with people I might not have had otherwise.  All in all, most of the value of a bootcamp is <i>being around people you can learn from and with<\/i>.  If you find that on your own, then you might be able to save by not having to pay that bootcamp tuition.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t completely disagree with Shaw&#x27;s tweets.  A lot of bootcamps are clearly(IMO) predatory.  Ultimately, a bootcamp can&#x27;t make any guarantees as to whether or not you get a job.  That task is ultimately up to you and, as much as it&#x27;s not fair, your success will mostly stem from your ability to sell yourself.  You can be a completely shit programmer but charm your way into a career.  Income share deals, I think, are a bad idea, even if they work out for a few.  At that point, you might as well save money by skipping bootcamp and do the learn-on-your-own approach I described earlier.  There are many bootcamps that act like they have standards but will actually take just about anyone, even if they aren&#x27;t really the type that can handle the self-responsibility of going to a bootcamp.<p>Shaw might be painting with a broad brush, he&#x27;s not totally wrong."],"time":["2020-01-06 20:59:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["draw_down"],"id":[21972142],"kids":{},"parent":[21971223],"text":["Typical replies... &quot;this doesn&#x27;t represent ALL bootcamps!&quot; Oh, I didn&#x27;t know that excuses it.

Here&#x27;s my kindest take as not-a-web-dev:<p>&gt; Static is globally fast. When you deploy, we can hoist all your static assets to a global CDN network. By removing the server from the equation, we can also maximize availability by reducing and even altogether eliminating cache misses.<p>You don&#x27;t &quot;maximize availability&quot; by shuffling from one server to another. You do it by shipping the assets as part of the app. That actually &quot;removes the server from the equation.&quot;<p>&gt; It [static] gives you &quot;O(1) TTFB&quot;, which is a fancy way of saying you get stable and predictable latency to the first byte of the screen.

Even if the engineer is encouraged to, and does, provide feedback, this feedback is, at best, in the air.<p>2. No matter the feedback, the outcome is pretty similar: negative feedback encourages the engineer to look for other options because of the desire to be valued better.

However, these skills will never end up in a &quot;core competency plan&quot; because those plans, by nature, only list skills that benefit the company.

It seems to strike a good balance - asking teams for a single top priority tends to make teams bundle all issues into one big ask, making it harder to find quick wins to slot into sprints, whereas asking teams for three or more can quickly overwhelm the PM and lets teams off the hook from making as many hard choices.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but as a PM I want to hear as much as possible from customers.  Asking other teams to prioritize e.g. two requests ensured that I&#x27;d be missing potentially valuable customer feedback which made me twitchy.<p>It&#x27;s not support or sales&#x27; job to decide what&#x27;s important.

So they made their cars heavier in their pursuit of making the cars quiet, which they accomplished quite well. They preserved much of the body styling at the expense of drag because they assumed customers would want that brand identity. They targeted the &quot;non power users,&quot; in that they held back a significant chunk of the battery from the consumer (~20% for the e-tron) so that consumers in hot climates couldn&#x27;t wreck the battery by habitually charging all the way to 100% and letting the pack sit like that, which destroys lithium ion battery chemistry.<p>Tesla on the other hand spent their complexity budget for the Model 3 on extracting as much range as possible with as little expense as they could. As a result, the car is significantly lighter, and anyone who owns a Model 3 can attest to the fact that there&#x27;s a lot of road noise. This is immediately solvable with heavier materials, but Tesla understands that the first batch of Model 3 owners strongly prefer the range over the creature comfort. And that the first batch of Model 3 owners are less likely to wreck their battery packs by habitually letting them sit overcharged for long periods of time. So they can expose the full battery packs to the consumer and get that 20% range boost over competitors who hold that back from the consumer.<p>2020&#x2F;2021 is starting to get interesting with the Ford Mach E, the Volvo Polestar 2, the LEAF Plus, the second-year Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro Electric, and the updated Bolt, together with the very rapidly expanding Electrify America rapid charging network. Tesla will continue to optimize for range and will likely keep a &quot;stats lead&quot; on the competition, but as range anxiety starts to be alleviated the second generation of EV converts may shift their demands away from range and toward other characteristics of the vehicle such as the interior and road noise isolation.

Very few people in the world have this level of freedom.<p>But life is quite a bit more interesting than it seems. Learn applied psychology to understand what drives people. Learn about all these LLCs, corps, trusts and other fun stuff. Talk to a lawyer and try to start your own company. No need to leave your current job: you can use the gained knowledge to hide traces, while still being very legal and very cool. Even if you get caught, use the learned psychology tricks to negotiate: you may even find yourself in a VP position as few people can covertly pull this type of stuff. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work, there is nothing to lose: 50 years later the only thing you will regret is not taking the risk because of some silly non competes with a company that no longer exists. Learn some Buddhism and some Tiberian phylosophy: it gives a very interesting and different outlook at life. Learn how pilot an airplane: like I said, there is nothing to lose."],"time":["2020-01-05 22:23:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pavlov"],"id":[21962658],"kids":[21964440,21966994],"parent":[21961560],"text":["I think you underestimate your value to the company.<p>“All I do is copy code from the internal codebase and patch things together until they work” — this is exactly what established tech companies mostly need from their engineers.

Don&#x27;t lie to yourself that you&#x27;re only using 10% of your capacity - it implies that given the right condition you&#x27;ll be 10x as productive, but we all know &quot;the right condition&quot; never happens.  Truly productive engineers (and I saw a lot of them at Google) bring the right conditions to themselves.  At best, you will be something like ~2.5x productive, <i>if you try your damnest<\/i>.<p>* Google still has tons of different projects.  I don&#x27;t know how easy it is to transfer internally these days, but at least try to find something that sounds interesting to you.  A lot easier than changing the company.<p>* Googlers have complained that &quot;all we do is moving protocol buffers from one place to another,&quot; since forever.  That&#x27;s part of the job: truly interesting stuff doesn&#x27;t happen that often.  And yes, I think the problem is more pronounced at Google, because really interesting problems were already solved by much better people, so you end up moving protobufs.  But all other places have similar issues, more or less (see point 1 above).<p>* If you decide to change places, do NOT look for higher hiring bars.  (I&#x27;m not telling you to avoid them: I&#x27;m just saying they&#x27;re irrelevant.)  Google already has a pretty high bar, and tons of incredibly talented engineers.

If you&#x27;ve only been promoted once in six years, especially straight out of college --- that&#x27;s not a normal career trajectory, and so it&#x27;s probably obvious to your manager and your colleagues that you have been slacking.<p>On the other hand, going to another company may or may not help that much either, and for two reasons.   First, depending on where you are inside Google, the technologies which you have picked up may not be all that useful outside of Google.  More importantly, and you&#x27;ve pointed that out for yourself, if you don&#x27;y have habit --- and the curiosity --- to deeply learn new the technologies you are working with, you&#x27;re probably going to struggle wherever you are.<p>Spending a month for each new technology that you think you need to learn is not going to be enough to deeply become an expert in any of them.   Also, it sounds like you have some not-so-great work habits, such as not doing the best possible job you can with any assignment you have been given.   Shaking those is also going to be helpful for you, no matter where you are.<p>So... here&#x27;s what I would suggest for you.   First, spend as much time working on yourself as you so working on &quot;new technologies&quot;.   Try reading books such as Steven Covey&#x27;s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective people.   I found listening to books such as Brian Tracey&#x27;s Success Audio Tapes to be helpful in my early career.  If you are more spiritually minded, some of Og Mandino&#x27;s books are old classics.<p>Secondly, try to bump your performance review ranking at least one level each cycle, until you are getting strongly exceeds expectations.   Not because you necessarily want to stay at Google, but because of the self-confidence that this will hopefully help you gain.   And tell your manager that (a) you feel that you&#x27;ve been slacking, and (b) that you want to do better.  If your manager is any good, they will want to work with you.   Try to get promoted at least once more at Google.  Why?  Because if you are going to try to strike out at some other company, people who understood Google&#x27;s performance levels will not necessarily be impressed if you have been at Google for six years, and are still a SWE III.<p>Finally, once you have a string of good ratings so it will be easier for you to try moving to another teams, you might want to consider working at some team which has contact with outside customers, especially in the Cloud PA.  This will give you a lot of contact with external technologies, since customers will use a variety of different software components.<p>Please do keep in mind, first and foremost, that it&#x27;s all about how you can add the most business value, no matter what company you happen to be working at, and no matter which customers you are trying to help.   It&#x27;s that work attitude which is going to be the most important, which is why I started this by suggesting that you work on your soft skills as much as your technology skills.   In addition to listening to various success tapes while I was commuting to work, I also made sure I knew how to read a balance sheet and monthly income&#x2F;expense reports.  I also took supplementary classes in management (which my employer paid for) for subjects such as &quot;Law for the I&#x2F;T Manager&quot; at the MIT Sloan School.   This is all going to be super useful, especially if you think you want to leave Google; at large companies, you can get by just being a technology specialist, but if you are working for yourself, or at a small company, being a well-rounded employee who can understand various business and legal issues will stand you in good stead.<p>The bottom line is you need to wake your curiosity to learn as much as you can in a wide variety of subjects; not because you want to get a good&#x2F;interesting job elsewhere, but for its own sake.   And you need to develop good work habits and have the internal drive to do the best that you can no matter where you are.  Jumping ship to some other company isn&#x27;t going to change who you are; and you may find that it is much more about <i>you<\/i> than your environment.<p>If you want to discuss this more, look me at at Google and I&#x27;m happy to chat some more.

First, the fact that labor is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his intrinsic nature; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home. His labor is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labor. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labor is shunned like the plague. External labor, labor in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else’s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. The worker’s activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.&quot;"],"time":["2020-01-05 22:14:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21962750],"kids":{},"parent":[21961560],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-05 19:03:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["catacombs"],"id":[21971406],"kids":{},"parent":[21961560],"text":["You&#x27;re making good money by not working that much.

The Clueless layer is what Whyte called the “Organization Man,” but the archetype inhabiting the middle has evolved a good deal since Whyte wrote his book (in the fifties).  The Losers  are not social losers (as in the opposite of “cool”), but people who have struck bad bargains economically – giving up capitalist striving for steady paychecks. ... The difference between [upwardly-aspiring Ryan] and the average checked-out Loser is illustrated in one brilliant scene early in his career. He suggests, during a group stacking effort in the warehouse, that they form a bucket brigade to work more efficiently. The minimum-effort Loser Stanley tells him coldly, “this here is a run-out-the-clock situation.” The line could apply to Stanley’s entire life. Stanley’s response shows both his intelligence and clear-eyed self-awareness of his Loser bargain with the company. He therefore acts according to a mix of self-preservation and minimum-effort coasting instincts. ... The career of the Loser is the easiest to understand. Having made a bad bargain, and not marked for either Clueless or Sociopath trajectories, he or she must make the best of a bad situation.  The most rational thing to do is slack off and do the minimum necessary. Doing more would be a Clueless thing to do. Doing less would take the high-energy machinations of the Sociopath, since it sets up self-imposed up-or-out time pressure. So the Loser — really not a loser at all if you think about it — pays his dues, does not ask for much, and finds meaning in his life elsewhere. For Stanley it is crossword puzzles. For Angela it is a colorless Martha-Stewartish religious life. For Kevin, it is his rock band. For Kelly, it is mindless airhead pop-culture distractions. Pam has her painting ambitions. Meredith is an alcoholic slut. Oscar, the ironic-token gay character, has his intellectual posturing.

Large numbers of publications with lots of citations, nothing else matters. So, naturally, scientists flock to hip buzzword-filled topics and churn out papers as quickly as they can. Not only is there absolutely no reward for easy reproducibility, it can actually harm you if someone manages to copy you quickly enough and then beat you to the next incremental publishable discovery in the neverending race. This is absurd and counterproductive to science in general, but such is the state of the academic job market.<p>Anyone who purports to somehow address the situation without substantially changing the fundamental predicates for hiring and funding in the sciences is just wasting their breath.
