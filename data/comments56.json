This means that actions with the mouse are optimized through the keyboard. There are &quot;hotkeys&quot; for most\ntasks you use with a mouse.<p>Vi has the idea of objects. Words, lines and paragraphs are objects you\ncan operate on.<p>Vi defines a &quot;language&quot; for operating on objects. For instance, &#x27;d&#x27; is\ndelete. You can delete a word using &#x27;dw&#x27;. You can delete 5 words with\n&#x27;5dw&#x27;. Another example: deleting a line is &#x27;dd&#x27;. Delete 5 lines with &#x27;5dd&#x27;<p>It is a modal editor. At a basic level there is an &quot;edit&quot; (insert) mode,\na &quot;navigation&quot; (normal) mode, and a &quot;selection&quot; (visual) mode.  The power\nof a modal environment means that commands and hotkeys now have a context\nand do slightly different things in different modes. While this may be\noverwhelming, once all these modes are ingrained in you, it allows you to\nbe extremely efficient since you do not have to remember new hotkeys. For\nexample, in the navigation mode, you can apply the 5dd to delete 5 lines.\nIn selection mode, use &#x27;5w&#x27; to select five words. &#x27;d&#x27; now deletes\neverything in the selection. If you&#x27;ve ever struggled to manage and\nremember your hotkeys, modal environment is your friend. (set this up in\nmac using something like hammerspoon.)<p>It includes some really nice out of the box features: Macro system to save\nyou time with repetitive tasks, regular expressions search and replace,\ntime travel through your edits, it stores your edits in a tree so you can\nnavigate to your changes even after multiple undo&#x2F;redo. &quot;.&quot; repeats the last change. You can also apply a number before it to\nrepeat the change n number of times. I am surprised how often I use this\nthat this is and this is first thing I miss when using another editor.<p>Vi is worth learning as it will improve your productivity.

We export a lot for all kinds of modern cartoons.”<p>He cites an example, but obliquely: “Let’s say you’re making a cartoon, and you are outsourcing the work. So you go to Romania, because you know it’s very cheap.” But the Romanian company knows of an even cheaper option. Its representative flies to Pyongyang and makes a deal for the same work at half the cost—and then gets 50% of the fee without employing anyone. “This has happened,” he says. He will not name movies. Nor popular video games. North Korean labor is also behind websites and crypto, he says. The shadow hands of globally sanctioned socialist labor are all around us.&quot;<p>I am particularly interested in the double outsource example he mentioned involving Romania. We know it&#x27;s a shady country however, I think this happens more often and in more parts of the world. So it is entirely possible that companies that outsourced work from the US have paid for labor in North Korea without knowing about it or knowing about it and wanting to take advantage of a better project quote. \nSounds like a good investigative story for a tech journalist to pick up.<p>This could also be a security and privacy risk.

I made it to the leader board under my old handle about a month after I got back into housing and then I changed handles cuz reasons.<p>When I do post links, I tend to post a few links within about an hour because I&#x27;m checking the news as part of my daily routine and if I see anything interesting, the odds are good that&#x27;s when I will see it. And I do that in part because I am a demographic outlier and I have a pretty terrible track record of trying to predict ahead of time what will fly on HN and what won&#x27;t.<p>So I try to look for a certain level of quality and that&#x27;s about it. I really, really suck at trying to predict what HN wants to read.<p>I also post a lot of my own stuff, which ironically gets me flak at times. Some people complain that the only thing I post is my own writing, which isn&#x27;t actually true. So that kind of feedback makes me feel like I &quot;should&quot; be posting a certain amount of stuff not by me in order to be acceptable to the community. Though, in practice, as my life gets busier, I simply fail to post as many articles to HN because I simply don&#x27;t have the time to do that.<p>But some people are interested in some of the things I write and some of what I write does well and makes it to the front page. Among other things, I still write about homelessness and some people here are actually interested in my perspective on that topic. So I do continue to post my stuff here and let it sink or swim based on votes because I suck at predicting what will do well.<p>I&#x27;m not asking or even suggesting you change your process in some way. I&#x27;m just telling you what I see from my perspective and I&#x27;m doing that because I&#x27;m an indie writer who takes Patreon and tips to support my work. Most of my sites have no ads on them and I handle things the way I do so I can give a fresh perspective on topics.<p>I post my own blog writing because other people almost never post my stuff. That&#x27;s extremely rare and my stuff would never see the light of day if I didn&#x27;t post it myself.<p>So to my ear it sounds kind of like you are looking for people like me and your formula for flagging stuff probably already has me flagged. Which you may be perfectly happy with. You may know who I am and you may be reading this going &quot;Good! You are one of the people I&#x27;m tired of hearing from!&quot;<p>You do with that feedback whatever the heck you want. I don&#x27;t need a reply or an explanation or a justification. I don&#x27;t care.<p>Have a good evening."],"time":["2020-05-07 07:17:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["optimuspaul"],"id":[23096370],"kids":[23096509,23096857,23096528],"parent":[23093990],"text":["&gt; A user is flagged if :<p>&gt; He posted more than 2 two links in the last 1 hour<p>&gt; He posted more than 5 links in the last 5 days<p>&gt; He has posted more than 5 links in the last 30 days and among the posts he posted 30% were flagged<p>What if the user is not a he? do they never get flagged?

There&#x27;s some great discussion about the value and appropriate use of data in software engineering, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in.<p>What we&#x27;ve seen is that engineers inherently want to be productive, and are happiest when they can work friction-free.  Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to get visibility into roadblocks that slow down developers (e.g. overly nitpicky code review, late changing product requirements, slow&#x2F;flaky CI), especially for managers who are one or two levels removed from programming. These are situations where data-backed insights can be helpful for diagnosis.<p>After diagnosing issues, with data or simply qualitative insights from a retrospective or 1:1, we also see teams sometimes struggle to set goals and achieve desired improvements. A common theme is the recurring retrospective item that people agree is important but doesn&#x27;t seem to be resolved. When it comes to implementing improvements, data can be useful to make objectives concrete and make progress visible to the entire team.<p>It’s important that metrics do not become the objectives themselves, but rather serve as a way to demonstrate the true outcome was achieved. Metrics also are not a strategy, and quantitative data cannot be used alone to understand performance of teams.<p>When quantitative data is used properly in combination with qualitative information, strong communication, and trust, we’ve found the results can go beyond what can be achieved without metrics."],"time":["2020-05-06 22:12:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stephc_int13"],"id":[23095441],"kids":{},"parent":[23092966],"text":["Wow, things are getting a bit clearer now.<p>Am I paranoid?<p>For me this the signal that it&#x27;s time to opt-out from vscode and github.<p>I was really impressed with the work done on vscode, the performance was really good for a hosted web-app.<p>Also: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodhart%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodhart%27s_law<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-06 21:45:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["minimaxir"],"id":[23093096],"kids":{},"parent":[23092966],"text":["This might be used more for narc&#x27;ing on unproductive coders than for productivity. :P"],"time":["2020-05-06 18:38:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nimish"],"id":[23093900],"kids":[23094630],"parent":[23092966],"text":["Yuck, when metrics become a target they cease to be useful."],"time":["2020-05-06 19:35:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mgoblu3"],"id":[23093099],"kids":[23093624,23094163,23094339],"parent":[23092966],"text":["Is this what they did with the PullPanda acquisition?

The Italian territories destabilized by the Borgias are ripe for conquest.  Everyone in Europe wants to go to war with everyone else and Italy will be the biggest battlefield.  Machaivelli’s job now is to figure out who to ally with, and who to bribe.  If he can’t predict the sides there’s no way to know where Florence should commit its precious resources.  How will it fall out?  Will Tudor claims on the French throne drive England to ally with Spain against France?  Or will French and Spanish rival claims to Southern Italy lead France to recruit England against the houses of Aragon and Habsburg?  Will the Holy Roman Emperor try to seize Milan from the French?  Will the Ottomans ally with France to seize and divide the Spanish holdings in the Mediterranean?  Will the Swiss finally wake up and notice that they have all the best armies in Europe and could conquer whatever the heck they wanted if they tried?  (Seriously, Machiavelli spends a lot of time worrying about this possibility.)  All the ambassadors from the great kingdoms and empires meet, and Machiavelli spends frantic months exchanging letters with colleagues evaluating the psychology of every prince, what each has to gain, to lose, to prove.  He comes up with several probable scenarios and begins preparations.  At last a courier rushes in with the news.  The day has come.  The alliance has formed.  It is: everyone joins forces to attack Venice.<p>O_O      ????????<p>Conclusion: must invent Modern Political Science.<p>I am being only slightly facetious.

This is a modern assumption.<p>What this article doesn&#x27;t delve into is the idea of <i>virtù<\/i> itself, and specifically how (someone like Nietzsche) sees this value and the Renaissance in general as a return to pre-Christian, pre-Platonic ideals of excellence, ones that precede modern ideas of good and evil. It is an idea intimately tied up with aesthetic concerns of self-mastery, clarity, and the dispelling of Platonic (subsequently Christian) idealism. Machiavelli himself was quite interested in the ancients, so this is not surprising.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;machiavelli&#x2F;#PoweVirtFort\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;machiavelli&#x2F;#PoweVirtFort<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtù\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtù<\/a><p>This excerpt from <i>Twilight of the Idols<\/i> (Nietzsche) is maybe the best brief description of the idea. Sorry for the length, the part about Machiavelli specifically is in the third paragraph.<p>--<p><i>I am not indebted to the Greeks for anything like such strong impressions; and, to speak frankly, they cannot be to us what the Romans are. One cannot learn from the Greeks—their style is too strange, it is also too fluid, to be imperative or to have the effect of a classic. Who would ever have learnt writing from a Greek! Who would ever have learned it without the Romans!... Do not let anyone suggest Plato to me. In regard to Plato I am a thorough sceptic, and have never been able to agree to the admiration of Plato the artist, which is traditional among scholars. And after all, in this matter, the most refined judges of taste in antiquity are on my side. In my opinion Plato bundles all the forms of style pell-mell together, in this respect he is one[Pg 114] of the first decadents of style: he has something similar on his conscience to that which the Cynics had who invented the satura Menippea. For the Platonic dialogue—this revoltingly self-complacent and childish kind of dialectics—to exercise any charm over you, you must never have read any good French authors,—Fontenelle for instance. Plato is boring.<\/i><p><i>In reality my distrust of Plato is fundamental. I find him so very much astray from all the deepest instincts of the Hellenes, so steeped in moral prejudices, so pre-existently Christian—the concept &quot;good&quot; is already the highest value with him,—that rather than use any other expression I would prefer to designate the whole phenomenon Plato with the hard word &quot;superior bunkum,&quot; or, if you would like it better, &quot;idealism.&quot; Humanity has had to pay dearly for this Athenian having gone to school among the Egyptians (—or among the Jews in Egypt?...) In the great fatality of Christianity, Plato is that double-faced fascination called the &quot;ideal,&quot; which made it possible for the more noble natures of antiquity to misunderstand themselves and to tread the bridge which led to the &quot;cross.&quot;<\/i><p><i>And what an amount of Plato is still to be found in the concept &quot;church,&quot; and in the construction, the system and the practice of the church!—My recreation, my predilection, my cure, after all Platonism, has always been Thucydides.<\/i> Thucydides and perhaps Machiavelli&#x27;s principe are most closely related to me owing to the absolute determination which they show of refusing to deceive themselves and of seeing reason in reality,—not in &quot;rationality,&quot; and still less in &quot;morality.&quot; <i>There is no more radical cure than Thucydides for the lamentably rose-coloured idealisation of the Greeks which the &quot;classically-cultured&quot; stripling bears with him into life, as a reward for his public school training. His writings must be carefully studied line by line, and his unuttered thoughts must be read as distinctly as what he actually says. There are few thinkers so rich in unuttered thoughts. In him the culture &quot;of the Sophists&quot;—that is to say, the culture of realism, receives its most perfect expression: this inestimable movement in the midst of the moral and idealistic knavery of the Socratic Schools which was then breaking out in all directions.<\/i><p><i>Greek philosophy is the decadence of the Greek instinct: Thucydides is the great summing up, the final manifestation of that strong, severe positivism which lay in the instincts of the ancient Hellene. After all, it is courage in the face of reality that distinguishes such natures as Thucydides from Plato: Plato is a coward in the face of reality—consequently he takes refuge in the ideal: Thucydides is master of himself,—consequently he is able to master life.<\/i><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;52263&#x2F;52263-h&#x2F;52263-h.htm#THINGS_I_OWE_TO_THE_ANCIENTS\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;52263&#x2F;52263-h&#x2F;52263-h.htm#THI...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-06 07:03:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jerzyt"],"id":[23087840],"kids":[23088058,23088074,23087859,23088785,23088009,23088685,23089406,23088815,23087857],"parent":[23086290],"text":["It just occurred to me that Machiavelli could be grouped with Sun Tzu and Saul Alinsky - each one of them wrote an incredibly insightful and influential book on strategy or leadership.<p>Are there any other authors&#x2F;books in this category?"],"time":["2020-05-06 06:14:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_0ffh"],"id":[23088890],"kids":{},"parent":[23086290],"text":["I&#x27;ve recently read &quot;The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom&quot; [1] and I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a read for anybody interested in Realpolitik and it&#x27;s intellectual history.

Those that survive a bypass surgery may live longer. But it will shorten the life of those that it kills. \nChemo therapy can kill you immediately, but if you survive the procedure, it may have also killed the cancer that then will increase your life expectancy.<p>I also think many medical procedures are not really changing the course of the disease.\nAnd being in a hospital is inherently risky. You are exposing yourself to other very sick people, and possible human errors in treatment.<p>ITs easy to fool yourself into thinking that what you are doing is having an effect.

Basically they argue that the mind is identical to the brain given that brain process A causes mental&#x2F;internal process B. With that reduction we should either eliminate language for mental experience or root it entirely in the corresponding physical process.<p>This sort of reduction is more or less a scientific reduction in that it serves an explanatory purpose. However, some philosophers reject the idea that scientific reduction is sufficient for a philosophical reduction which is something along the lines of brain process A completely explaining mental experience B. The problem that a philosophical reduction poses is that of internal experience.<p>Non-reductionists would argue that no amount of physical data could explain subjective experience. Brain scans can show what happens physiologically when you are happy, but not the &#x27;what it&#x27;s like to be happy&#x27;. Whether or not that&#x27;s convincing to you is a matter of personal preference.<p>The bottom line seems to be that there is a major physical aspect to the mind, but also that we feel like we are more than chemical reactions.

These employees that Tim is standing up for were the opposite of that, distracting everyone with loud activism and probably not focusing on their own jobs either.<p>To provide a counter to Tim&#x27;s account: Chris Smalls was told to quarantine himself and not come to the work site because he was in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;regulation&#x2F;labor&#x2F;490805-fired-amazon-striker-demands-bezos-protect-workers-in-open-letter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;regulation&#x2F;labor&#x2F;490805-fired-amazon-str...<\/a>). He came to the site anyways to protest. Why wouldn&#x27;t he get fired for putting others at risk? People who think this firing was malicious are speculating. If this was a topic that Hacker News readers had a different group perspective on, they would call it a conspiracy theory. Someone would surely be quoting Hanlon&#x27;s Razor by now.<p>Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham were the most visible ringleaders of activists pretending to be employees. They clearly were not doing their job as well as they could, because they had time enough to engage in lengthy political discussions on mailing lists during the workday. They were also repeatedly disrupting everyone else&#x27;s work. They, and others from their group, would spam hundreds of company mailing lists repeatedly. They would send long political rants, links to activist events, and even solicit employee information. It was very over the top, and pleas from list moderators to stop spamming were ignored or met with baseless accusations of racism (or another -ism). That reaction, to shout down opposing views with absurd justifications, is the mental gymnastics of intersectionality at work. It&#x27;s the unfortunate culture of intolerance that this aggressive flavor of progressive activism has taken on in workplaces like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.<p>I&#x27;m also dismayed at the public reaction to these events. For some reason, the general public simply craves stories attacking winners, and the same is true for Amazon. If you want to balance out the info you&#x27;ve been exposed to, check out Amazon&#x27;s official blog on the large number of changes they&#x27;ve made in response to COVID-19, at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;amazons-actions-to-help-employees-communities-and-customers-affected-by-covid-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;amazons-actions-to...<\/a>.

When it comes to those fired employees he is standing up for, Tim is willfully overlooking their clear abuse of Amazon&#x27;s employee rules, company resources, and other employees. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accident that he&#x27;s leaving all those details out.

I&#x27;m going through the charts on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info<\/a> and I notice something. There&#x27;s different tabs for &quot;cases&quot; and &quot;active cases&quot;, and you can drill down into some individual countries (like the USA), and you can drill down into some individual States (like California).<p>So I&#x27;m going through it today, and one of the columns is total deaths. So for the purposes of this thread, Closed Cases = Deaths + Recoveries, and while there isn&#x27;t a column for recoveries specifically, you can infer a couple of things from the data that is there.<p>First, the data sucks. Each State and in some cases, each county health department is responsible for reporting their own cases and deaths, but it seems not every place is making good efforts to track recoveries. If you drill into California and check San Francisco, and it&#x27;s not limited to just San Francisco, you can see the &quot;Active Cases&quot; over in about the sixth column is only Cases - Deaths instead of Cases - (Deaths + Recoveries). Not all 58 Counties are like this, but you also have outliers like Humboldt where apparently 52 of 54 total cases are recoveries because there aren&#x27;t any reported deaths and there&#x27;s only 2 reported active cases.<p>It isn&#x27;t limited to just individual counties in California. If you go back up a level to the USA and look at various States, you can see that New York is making some effort to track recoveries because at a glance, Active Cases does not equal Cases - Deaths, it&#x27;s actually quite a bit lower than Cases - Deaths, which is good. But if you look below New York at New Jersey which has had the second highest number of cases, it would <i>seem<\/i> like every closed case has been a death, because Active Cases = Cases - Deaths, same probably with San Francisco County in California.<p>So when I last looked a few hours ago, the United States had about 964K Active Cases. This is probably both an overcount and an undercount. It&#x27;s certainly an undercount because we obviously have no idea how many people are actively carrying it right now. But it&#x27;s also an overcount because of the verified cases, recoveries are being underreported.<p>This bloody chart in the NYTimes is annoying. It is seemingly trying to apply some corrective measures to people&#x27;s expectations about how much the curve is actually flattening in the country, that it is not equally flattened, and that reporting is fine. It&#x27;s leaving out half the bloody story which is: recoveries. If the goal is to lead and not mislead with this piece, then by not attempting to address the discrepancy in reported cases and active cases, and how many closed cases are closed because of recoveries and not because of deaths, it will leave people with a sense that maybe the country is in worse straits than we think, or at least different pockets.<p>To be blunt, nobody knows. They don&#x27;t know, the Administration doesn&#x27;t know, apparently half the bloody Governors don&#x27;t have a clue about a big part of the situation in their own States in addition to almost every other part of the situation, and if you assume that in terms of closed verified cases, recoveries outnumber deaths 4:1, then New Jersey should probably be subtracting somewhere around 30K Active Cases (assuming there have been 4x as many recoveries as their reported 8K deaths).<p>A lot of people are dying or dead, but what about the other side of this coin? How many are recovering, and why don&#x27;t we know? Is it really the case that in New Jersey, not a single person has reportedly recovered and all the closed cases are actually deaths? The number that&#x27;s getting trotted out by the media in terms of cases is 1.2M (implicitly, verified cases rather than actual cases). But we don&#x27;t currently have 1M verified active cases, we may not even have 900K (yet) but the best available data I can find doesn&#x27;t even reflect that."],"time":["2020-05-06 14:02:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["amelius"],"id":[23089860],"kids":[23089877,23089942,23089933,23089934],"parent":[23089564],"text":["What&#x27;s that strangle blip in the last days of Sweden&#x27;s data?"],"time":["2020-05-06 13:42:04"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chasd00"],"id":[23089976],"kids":{},"parent":[23089564],"text":["there&#x27;s enough metrics and ways to manipulate them to support any agenda. we&#x27;ll probably never get any real insight until after the US election."],"time":["2020-05-06 13:59:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foolzcrow"],"id":[23101889],"kids":{},"parent":[23089564],"text":["We flattened the curve and now we know this is global government attack. 0.1 deathrate is comparable to flu.

The powerful typically owned land and they knew if non-landowners could vote, they would outvote the landowners.<p>When the right to vote became available to everyone&#x2F;most people, the landowners shifted to using their wealth in order to influence government&#x2F;politics in their favor. This has worked out well for them, since as a general rule people either are too naive or politically apathetic to come together to outvote the landowners. Despite being grounded into dust by them, the common person still feel that they have much to lose by going against them. This reminds me of a fictional gambling game from an anime I&#x27;ve watched called E Card.<p>&quot;The game is starts with each player holding five cards, four of which are Citizens and the last being either a Slave or an Emperor. Who holds which card is decided beforehand, and is played like that for three turns before switching. The game lasts for a total of twelve turns, meaning each side gets to play Emperor twice. The players choose one card from their hand (Emperor side lays first) and place them face-down on the table. They are then flipped over to reveal the winner of the match.<p>The three card types are Citizen, Emperor and Slave.<p>The Citizen card represents the common man, and cannot defeat the Emperor who sits at the top. It can, however, defeat the Slave, who resides at the very bottom of the system. Two citizen against each other results in a tie.<p>The Emperor represents the one at the top of society. This card can defeat the citizen, but will lose to the Slave.<p>The Slave is presented as the one at the very bottom of society. Seeing as how it has nothing to lose, it can overthrow the Emperor in one last attempt at revenge. This card will lose to a Citizen, but will win against the Emperor card.&quot;<p>My thought is that we have a large population of people who have been fooled into thinking they are the Citizen, when they are little more than Slaves. They believe that they are different, more than Slaves. So they have something to lose. Thus they can never go against the Emperor, and in fact, play their role as the Citizen in keeping down the actual Slaves who could do something about that Emperor if they actually got together.<p>Now do I think people will wake up and realize they are the Slave? Probably not, but there&#x27;s a non-zero chance, depending on how the government decides to act during this crisis. Most likely though, the Citizens are going to be given some scraps, just enough that they have something to lose and keeps them under the illusion that they are more than a Slave."],"time":["2020-05-07 01:29:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mark_l_watson"],"id":[23097101],"kids":[23097239,23097253],"parent":[23096722],"text":["I am in the USA, but similar situation.<p>I believe that if, big if!!, the public would cooperate, that a plan like Hong Kong’s makes a lot of sense.

Just yesterday we noticed that queries that use now() can&#x27;t use indexes. Searching github&#x27;s thousands of issues for &quot;now() index performance&quot; I get ~500 hits.  Thankfully they are fast to respond to questions on slack &#x2F; forums.  But they _really_ need to clean up the hundreds (thousands?) of little bugs - some of them have been around for years. Most of them are near-non-issues, except for the time you waste looking into it.<p>Finally, performance seems worse than it could be. Running in single-node-mode with an _in memory_ database (for our integration tests) is still slower than postgresql. Restoring a 150mb dump file (just a bunch of inserts) takes over 2 minutes.

Several drugs with in vitro potential against SARS-CoV-2 virus have been proposed. Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro anti-viral and immunomodulatory activity, but there is no current clinical evidence of its effectiveness changing the outcome of the disease. Methods: We enrolled all 18-85 years old inpatients from Central Defense Hospital “Gómez Ulla”, Madrid, Spain, who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definitive outcome (dead or discharged). We used a statistical survival analysis to detect treatment differences associated with in-hospital death. Results: We analysed first 220 medical records. 166 patients met the inclusion criteria. 48,8 % of patients not treated with HCQ died, 22% of those treated with hydroxychloroquine (p=0,002). According to clinical picture at admission, hydroxychloroquine increased the mean cumulative survival in all groups from 1,4 to 1,8 times. This difference was statistically significant in the mild group. Conclusions: in a cohort of 166 patients from 18 to 85 years hospitalised with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine treatment with 800mg added loading dose increased survival when patients were admitted in early stages of the disease.

This is the nature of the beast, all things that appear glamorous on the outside ( Hollywood, Finance, Tech, many nonprofits) is very rotten on the inside.<p>You can&#x27;t change the past, but you can recalibrate your expectations and medidate on what went wrong. Here are some thoughts, and I will be very harsh:<p>1. Your co-workers may be amazing, but they were never your friends. You ran a business and rented their years to help them build a nest egg, of which you would claim the majority share had it hatched. Alas, the business failed and thus, you no longer add value to each other&#x27;s lives. Move on.<p>2. There&#x27;s what you love, and there&#x27;s what you do. It&#x27;s best to keep some distance: because no one cares about what you love. VCs are vultures and this is well known, but they are also reflecting the reality of the market. In the market you&#x27;re just a vendor. Think about all the food stands that you have walked past in your life, within each stand is an immigrant family who slave away for decades hoping for a better life. Have you ever thought about them and gave them time&#x2F;money for their suffering? No, you only cared them inso far as they can cook for you. This is how others saw you.<p>3. Big companies, and indeed most big institutions is made by a silent majority of the defeated. Many have experienced what you have said and have long made their peace. They found joy elsewhere, and found distance between themselves and their work.<p>4. Find self worth and self-love outside of your role in the machine, there&#x27;s the product you produce to trade time for money, and then there&#x27;s you. They are different things. Imagine Instagram influencers who post pictures of themselves but feel depressed when they don&#x27;t get enough likes.

I&#x27;ve gone through ups-and-downs in terms of what I call &quot;creative energy&quot;, which I will refer to as coding &quot;mojo&quot;.<p>1. You have a limited amount of mojo that you can throw at a problem. When you&#x27;re young, this focus and energy is easy. You can throw it at problems that you may not be that vested in for a reward like money. It&#x27;s also easy to recover. These times are great.<p>2. As you get older, mojo will become more cyclical. When you&#x27;re in the troughs it will be difficult to focus your energy on a problem if you&#x27;re not that vested with it. When you work on projects that fail, this will be extremely draining. At this stage, you will need to build &quot;refresh&quot; mechanisms into your schedule. It will help to work on non-tech yet creative passions on the side that have easy to reach end-states. I personally had this successfully going for over a decade.<p>3. Sometimes instead of being cyclical, your mojo will just totally flat-line. Sometimes it was too many death-march projects, sometimes it&#x27;s personal health related, dealing with aging family members, or the stress of being a parent. If you haven&#x27;t built in a refresh cycle that works for you yet, it&#x27;s going to be very difficult to get your mojo flowing again. At this point more drastic measures are necessary.

I began to believe I really was an imposter: good at programming contests, interviewed well, but incapable of actually accomplishing anything.  That spring I quit, and spent the summer volunteered at a dance camp, where I worked 12h a day doing mostly manual labour.  I had never been happier or more hard-working; the only thing that could dent my productivity in the slightest was if the kitchen ran low on grub.<p>I seriously doubted I would ever go back to working with software again.  I had no desire to do it whatsoever; indeed, I had lost confidence in my ability to hack any kind of actual job.<p>For the next seven years I did a lot of dancing, traded my skills as a photographer for passes &amp; expenses attend events I wanted to go to, volunteered doing manual labour and A&#x2F;V work in the summers, and eventually started teaching dancing locally.  The latter at least brought in a little income, though not nearly enough.<p>During those years I did (checks spreadsheet) a mere 18 hours of coding spread over a dozen days - mostly writing small tools to automate my photo editing workflow.<p>Then, in 2016, a good friend of mine proposed to more or less create a job for me, working on what might be described as a modern rewrite of LambadMOO.  It was my dream job, offered to me on a plate, but I wasn&#x27;t sure I dare take it.

In a pond, you can&#x27;t see very far in the water, the bottom is mucky and soft, there are all sorts of other creatures, and something bad may very well happen to you.<p>A swimming pool is not a natural system. It takes lots of work and diligence to keep it running, and even then, bad things happen. Fortunately, a swimming pool is a system with a mostly finite set of parameters to change and a similarly-small set of outcomes to manage.<p>Technology, startups, and BigCorps are natural systems. They&#x27;re like the pond; they evolved over time without any one person managing any of it.<p>It took me a long time to realize that many things in life were like that pond when I was thinking most of the world was like a swimming pool. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with diving into various ecosystems that have emerged out of human complexity. In fact, you can find pleasures there you can find nowhere else. But there are significant differences that nobody tells you about. These systems are emergent, they have tons of variables you might never encounter or understand, and they change based on the actions of thousands, perhaps millions of people, all of whom are not aware that they are, in effect, managing the system. (Even if they knew, no one person has the mental ability to manage all of that.)<p>I said all of that to say this: natural systems do not have your best interests in mind. You form a startup? Ok, there&#x27;s a preexisting set of &quot;ramps&quot; you are supposed to get on: bootstrap, niche, unicorn, etc. People who see you in the startup world see you as being on one of those ramps. That is how they process your existence. Same goes for BigCorps: the rule there is to get along, not make waves, and have people think of you as energetic, competent, and friendly.<p>These are not necessarily bad systems, but you have to keep in mind everyday you interact with them that it is ultimately you who are responsible for your emotional and personal safety, not the system (No matter what they might say to you)<p>So yes, be disillusioned.

I was fresh out of college and worked on an email product which was in an area I was interested but quickly learned how enterprise software is actually made. There is one interesting part which is the core and that’s the MVP. Working in this stage is exciting and fun to make and then there are years and years of slog smoothing out the edges and making it ready for production, which left me similarly disillusioned especially when my view of the real world fresh out of college was that every product that exists is interesting and perfect. Long story short, I worked on that boring project for two-ish years and saw the horrible political environment begin to deteriorate my once-ok team. I say once-ok because I convinced myself during that time that I liked my work because by all measures of society, I was successful, and having no knowledge of other teams I didn’t think there was an alternative. This was all I ever knew and thought every team in tech is like this. Which for the most part is actually true. Despite what Google and other big tech companies’ flashy recruiting and marketing, something like 99% of the engineers in those companies are doing boring shit to keep the money flowing . I also went through the exact same thought process where I thought my spirit had been drained and I could never get the excitement back because of this realization. I also often wondered if I had been permanently changed because of the experience and thought I would never feel creative again. However I made a big decision and took the leap to join a new team and couldn’t have landed in an environment that is more the polar opposite. And that is what gave me my spirit back. You need to find a product in a FAANG, or startup that you actually are passionate about and get to grow your own team and that will give you your passion back. Find a position which is an exact match for your skills and do not settle at all. If a position is not perfect do not even consider it and ask as many probing questions as you need and contact current members of the team to check for inconsistencies.

What you&#x27;ve said about how your business failed and how few people still want anything to do with you afterwards tells me you were not prepared, you do not understand how to run a business and you lack even a minimal competency when it comes to leadership. I do not want you to think I am being harsh and unfeeling, I am being critical because it&#x27;s what you need to know if you ever intended to work in the tech industry again.<p>Almost everyone wants to be in charge and believes they could succeed in such a role given the chance. Of those who attempt to start their own businesses only about 10% have what it takes to merely stay in business. Fewer than 3% of business leaders have sufficient ability in the field they already work in to create a genuinely profitable business, and less than 0.3% have what it takes to found an industry disrupting company.<p>Investors will always behave the way you described because they&#x27;re basically playing roulette and they&#x27;ve bet on a bunch of things in the hope that 10% of their investments will pay off because they know the statistics I just told you. Your friends abandoned you however, because as a boss you make them promises and promising things to your friends which you probably cannot deliver always damages the relationship.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s time for my advice. One, you need to remove your ego and emotions from your work as this will always eventually damage working relationships and burn you out. Two, work is always a marathon, never a sprint. A lot of startup guys will tell you that you have to work 70 hour weeks, but this is not maintainable and will just result in failure later on as opposed to delayed sustainable success. Third, if it wasn&#x27;t clear from my initial statements, you are not well suited to being high level management and changing that about yourself would likely take so long as to waste the rest of your career in pursuit of a highly stressful goal that is unlikely ever to feel worth the effort. I suggest you take an engineering position or stick to no higher than mid-level project management at an established company. Finding somewhere relaxing where you can limit your work hours to 40 or less per week is the only real chance you have at reversing the burnout, but only if you can remove your ego and emotions from your past and future professional work. I strongly recommend mindfulness meditation to help with getting past your former business failings and MO e forward into a career that you can find fulfilling."],"time":["2020-05-06 01:42:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tvanbeek"],"id":[23079979],"kids":{},"parent":[23072333],"text":["Do not listen to anonymous people online but talk to a professional like a coach or psychologist."],"time":["2020-05-05 15:49:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RIMR"],"id":[23079984],"kids":{},"parent":[23072333],"text":["You&#x27;re not disillusioned with technology.

You could have chosen to do this software as a side project, or via slow bootstrap, sans the shark investors. You didn&#x27;t.<p>&quot;But I can sleep at night fine.

Yet it&#x27;s only your investors that you call &quot;bloodthirsty vultures&quot;.<p>You blame everyone but yourself for becoming &quot;soulless&quot;. Your very use of this word reveals a great lack of soul. You misuse it to describe working like a machine, an automaton. The nurse who is working like a machine to save lives at great risk to her own has the most wonderful, beautiful soul. What makes you soulless is that you&#x27;re only thinking about yourself and &quot;new products&quot; (ways to make money) without any hint of a conscience troubled by the decisions made and actions taken in pursuit of those profits, and what that says about who you are. Or maybe the depression was a conscience trying hard to speak out, but it got snuffed by drugs rather than getting heard.<p>You can&#x27;t &quot;see past the cynicism&quot; when you are the cynicism.<p>Spend less time figuring how much you can get and more time one what you can give. Ditch your transactional mindset. Give for giving&#x27;s sake. Use your talents to make the world better, fuck the profits. Chose the more moral job over the more profitable one. The people you&#x27;ll work with in those jobs will have lots of soul and it will rub off on you.<p>---<p>[I know this post will not be well received here on Hacker News, the techie Twitter.

A couple of observations:<p>1) Part of what you experience is just gaining wisdom with age. You see how things really work, and you get disillusioned. The thrill of early experiences, does diminish over time. And that&#x27;s not just software. The thrill of your first bicycle ride, is not reproducible. The sense of freedom you had, after that, riding around unsupervised -- that goes away too, obviously.<p>2) The word &quot;tech&quot; has changed radically over the years. I joined my first &quot;high tech startup&quot; in 1988. We really were doing technology that was just barely feasible at the time. The entire company was seven people -- founder, biz&#x2F;ops guy, VP of engineering, four engineers. That was FUN. Figuring out how to solve these problems, seeing the parts come to life, seeing the whole thing come together, seeing it work for users as planned. In an environment like that, you really feel like you are doing something special, that you are lucky to be there, and you just want to spend all of your time on it. The fact that it might actually be worth serious money someday -- even better.<p>This incredibly exciting sense of being in a tech startup spread. Large companies would entice you by saying, this group is just like a startup within Megacorp. And I never understood how that fooled anyone. In that situation, you aren&#x27;t scratching your itch, you are scratching Megacorp&#x27;s itch, and that&#x27;s a lot less exciting. There aren&#x27;t seven of you. Outside your group, there are 700 or 7,000 or 70,000. Maybe you get a little bonus, or equity, but you don&#x27;t own a chunk of the company YOU started.<p>However, Megacorp and similar companies definitely saw the advantage of getting their employees to commit to their work in the manner of startup employees, and so you get places like Google that gradually switch the incentive. First you want to be there all the time (back when Google was a startup). Then they make it enticing to be there all the time (campus, massages, gourmet dining, on-campus laundry and exercise, etc.). And finally, it&#x27;s just expected. Being available and productive (or at least seeming to be) 24&#x2F;7 is just the way things are at Megacorp these days.<p>And then finally, the last piece of it goes away: the interesting tech. &quot;Tech&quot; companies are no longer solving barely solvable, new problems. They are doing more of the same, implementing dull and possibly harmful goals for the sake of Megacorp. Megacorp is no more a tech company than it is an electricity company. It uses both to meet its goals, and you are merely someone familiar with either bits or electrons, using them in well-worn ways for the sole purpose of enriching Megacorp.<p>This is both a great pop song, and the lyrics really capture the disillusionment that sets in, although in a very different environment: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V1-EPTAFE0o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V1-EPTAFE0o<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-05 18:08:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kyleee"],"id":[23076539],"kids":{},"parent":[23072333],"text":["Text of the gist since it&#x27;s a bear to read on mobile:<p>&quot;I was drawn to programming, science, technology and science fiction\never since I was a little kid.

Now we don&#x27;t talk.<p>I spent a lot of time thinking about how I contributed to these failed\nrelationships. I learned a lot from that too. It wasn&#x27;t my finest\nhour, but I can sleep at night fine. So I eventually decided it&#x27;s\nmostly nobody&#x27;s fault. This is just the reality of what happens to\npeople when extreme stress ends in failure.<p>Then I worked for a tech giant, and then for a high-growth unicorn. It\nshocked me how dilbertesque they both were. Full of politicians, and\nburnt out engineers in golden handcuffs who can&#x27;t wait to get out, and\nmeaningless business speak, and checked out employees who pretend\nthey&#x27;re &quot;excited&quot; about everything all the time. The young, wide-eyed\nengineers seem hopelessly naive to me now.<p>So the worst case scenario is that you get eaten by vultures and lose\nfriends. And the best case scenario is that you&#x27;re in a soulless\nmachine that turns everyone into an automaton. I know that&#x27;s not the\nwhole picture. It&#x27;s not even most of the picture. But that&#x27;s the part\nI can&#x27;t unsee.<p>For a long time I couldn&#x27;t focus on any remotely intellectual pursuit.\nI even thought I permanently damaged my brain. But eventually I\nstarted exercising, went on anti-depressants, and started therapy.\nThen I got a job that has nothing to do with technology. Slowly my\nhappiness returned, and with it my ability to focus. I do a lot of\nsports now and hang out with my non-techy friends and my wife. I cook\na lot. I got into knot theory. I find it fascinating and can do it for\nhours. I&#x27;m surprisingly not bad at it. So I know I still have my\nfaculties.<p>But I still can&#x27;t program, can&#x27;t write, can&#x27;t think of new products,\ncan&#x27;t read science fiction. I&#x27;m mostly happy, but there is always a\nhint of dissatisfaction underneath. I miss the creative, optimistic\nperson I once was. I want to see past the cynicism. I want to write\nprograms and make things. I want to work with a ragtag team again to\nbring something to life that didn&#x27;t exist before. I want to learn how\nto see past the bullshit and be creative again. But I can&#x27;t get myself\nto do it. I hear the call and I know there&#x27;s still a spark. But when I\ntake even the smallest step everything turns bleak and mundane. It&#x27;s\nlike the magic has been bled out of me and I don&#x27;t know how to summon\nit back.<p>Has anyone been through this who managed to recover their optimism and\ncreative spirit?

It&#x27;s important to find what is.<p>First, my heart goes out to you. It really does stink to be where you are.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a matter of expectations. The &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; is &quot;Don&#x27;t have expectations, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&quot;<p>Sounds good. I have yet to meet anyone that truly meets that bar.<p>We all have expectations. It&#x27;s human nature.<p>The deal is how we <i>react<\/i> to those expectations.<p>I get my expectations trounced on a regular basis. That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.<p>Except for Dilbert&#x27;s corollary: <i>&quot;That which does not kill me, leaves me weak and exhausted.&quot;<\/i><p>When you signed up for a tech career, <i>why<\/i> did you sign up for it? What did you expect?<p>In the 1980s, there was an explosion of doctors and lawyers. Medical schools were so crowded that people had to study abroad.<p>The reason was that a doctor could look forward to a six-figure salary (and a six-figure insurance bill); right out of the starting gate. Lawyers...maybe not as much, but LA Law was a popular show, back then, so everyone thought it was the best career move ever.<p>That resulted in a <i>ton<\/i> of mediocre doctors and lawyers. They didn&#x27;t <i>love<\/i> what they did.<p>My father was a Harvard-graduate lawyer. Top of his class. Silver Star war hero (planted in Arlington). He could have written his own checks.<p>But he hated it, and joined the CIA, instead (which he later quit in disgust). I think he felt that he should have learned a different career, all his life. He was never happy, and that broke my heart.<p>SO HERE&#x27;S WHERE I MAKE IT ALL ABOUT ME:<p>It also taught me that it&#x27;s <i>really important<\/i> to be happy with my vocation.<p>So here I am...refactoring myself to be happy.<p>I was a manager for a significant part of my career. I was very good at it.<p>And hated it. Being good at something is <i>not<\/i> the same as being happy doing it.<p>I <i>love<\/i> tech. My worst nightmare is to feel the way you do (talking to the poster). Nothing gives me more joy than to craft a superb application, and know that it is as close to perfect as God will allow.<p>That means that I have to be careful who I let have any control over my work. The current tech scene is absolutely <i>nuts<\/i> about money and prestige. People are more than willing to peddle cow flops, if they can buy a Tesla with the proceeds.<p>Others use money as a leash and a lash, to tie us down and force us to do their bidding.<p>People like me are nothing but transient resources to be used up and discarded.<p>So I have enough set aside to be...OK (not rolling in dough); even after this current kerfuffle. It allows me to be picky about what I do, and who I let have control of my work.<p>I&#x27;m really <i>really<\/i> into quality software. You might say that I&#x27;m obsessed. To me, it&#x27;s a craft.<p>Think of me as the old Swiss guy, making cuckoo clocks in his garage. There&#x27;s not much of a market for cuckoo clocks, but my clocks are gonna be the best clocks you can get. I won&#x27;t let anyone force me to use crappy pine, when walnut is what works best, and I won&#x27;t mass-produce them.<p>But I&#x27;m a happy little old clock maker, and if anyone wants <i>really good<\/i> cuckoo clocks, they know where to go. They just have to work with me, and not expect me to be hog-tied by bling.<p>I sincerely wish you the best, and hope you get your groove back."],"time":["2020-05-04 23:49:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[23074834],"kids":{},"parent":[23072333],"text":{},"time":["2020-05-05 02:02:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["dilandau"],"id":[23073586],"kids":[23073963,23078359,23077592],"parent":[23072333],"text":["Interesting venue to post this on.

As an example, draw a straight line between 2^4 (16) and 2^5 (32). The floating point numbers in that range are evenly spaced on that line.<p>Another explanation using the window + offset terminology used in the post is that the offset is a percentage of the way through the window. So, for a window of 2^x, the difference between an offset of y and y + 1 is 2^(x-23) or 1&#x2F;2^(-23) of 2^x. Put another way, floating point numbers do not have absolute error like integers (each number is within 1 of a representable value), but % error (each number is within 1&#x2F;2^(-23) of a representable value). Essentially, floating point numbers use % error bars instead of absolute error bars.<p>Using this model you can even see how to create your own floating point numbers. Just pick a % precision you want, for single FP that is 1&#x2F;2^(-23) and double FP 1&#x2F;2^(-52), that defines the range of your mantissa (offset). Then pick a range of x values you want to represent, that is the range of your exponent (window).<p>As an aside, subnormal numbers do not respect this principle. They extend the expressible range for very small numbers by sacrificing % error for those numbers. In the very worst case of the smallest subnormal number you can get 25% error (it might actually be 50%). As might be imagined, this plays havoc on error propagation since if you ever multiply by a number that just so happens to be the smallest subnormal, all your multiplies might suddenly be off by a factor of 25% instead of the normal 100 * 2^(-23)% which is 2,000,000 times the % error which is quite a bit harder to compensate for. This is why many people consider subnormals to be a blemish.<p>[1] The approximation is actually offset in the x direction for the bias. If you want to be more accurate, you are actually graphing 2^(x - 127)."],"time":["2020-05-05 20:41:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["commandlinefan"],"id":[23082512],"kids":[23082588,23082747],"parent":[23081924],"text":["Wow, that&#x27;s a much easier way to convert from decimal to floating point than I had ever seen.

Are there places where, if you could choose, PHP is not a good choice in the stack, Yup.<p>My personal view of it is that it is part of our eco-system and will not go away, how eager some of us may be to have it disappear, so seeing it getting better as a platform should make the world a little better for a lot of people that need to use it in systems that are built with parts in PHP.I cant see how that is a bad thing.<p>The thing I dont understand is, if you for some reason do not like to use a specific language or tech, why bother trying to convince others not to use it?<p>Few of the people I worked with have only one tool in their belt, and they can work in any language. We all have some favorable setup that we think is best for us&#x2F;others to use in order to build better software with quicker iterations. But all of us (hopefully) also know that few, if any, stacks are 100% solid and consistent after a couple of years. There is always some parts that we wish would not exist, some script that magically does stuff that we do not dare to touch, some service that is written in some fancy language by that awesome dev that worked here 10 years ago or some really central part of our software that is written in Python, talking to a module written in C that needs to be compiled with a specific compiler that went dead 4 years ago. Even if we dream about the perfect system that just works (LIKE I WANT IT) and has a fantastic setup, it is only at specific snapshots of time systems work like that. Time, people, organizations, product requirements, marketing efforts, buzz, hacks, fixes, playfulness, boredom etc all makes system degrade over time and while it is important to manage these debts, it is more or less impossible to have a system in a state where it will always have the tech stack you want right now. That way, we will always have to address bugs in PHP, old Python-versions, rage over custom compiled nginx or whatever. Whether or not PHP is a good language or not is a meta-discussion IMO. If languages that are used by a lot of people gets better over time, that is awesome in my book.

I can write a simple PHP application that handles thousands of concurrent requests without even thinking about threading, synchronization, memory leaks or anything like that because handling that stuff is basically built-in.<p>PHP has a really good ecosystem. A framework like Laravel can do just about anything you&#x27;d need in an application out of the box. Routing, rendering HTML, generating URLs, handling sessions, logging, validating requests, an ORM, translations, encryption, sending emails, queues, schedules, caching - it&#x27;s all there. I&#x27;ve never seen anything quite as fully-featured in any other language. On Packagist, I can find packages for pretty much anything from clients for obscure SOAP APIs to libraries for handling GraphQL. There&#x27;s also a lot of great tooling, with a good package manager, static analysis tools like Psalm, code formatters etc. Also, PhpStorm is a fantastic IDE.<p>Outside of PHP, I mostly have experience with Java and JS.<p>If you know Java, modern PHP isn&#x27;t all that different. Java has some nice stuff that I hope we&#x27;ll get in PHP some day (generics is the big one). I built an application using the Play framework (Java version) a couple years ago and it was quite similar to modern PHP frameworks. However, there was always a bit more complexity with Java. Everything was just slightly more complicated. So with the trade-off basically being performance (which is better in Java) vs. ease of use and developer experience (which I think is better in PHP), I&#x27;d choose PHP most of the time.<p>Now, when comparing it to JS, I&#x27;m <i>really<\/i> glad I mostly get work with PHP instead of JS.

When starting work in teams instead of solo and coding nontrivial business rules, this ease of doing died for me. Moved on.<p>Many years of JavaScript, doing nodejs since 0.4, it was just like having superpowers and doing isomorphic things. Mixing things every other month with coffeescript, babel, typescript and trying a different framework for every new project. What once felt refreshing is now just exhausting and JS projects tends to end in rewrite loops.<p>Before&#x2F;Inbetween&#x2F;After there were many languages, from C at university, to C#, Ruby, Go, ... . Mostly the tech didn‘t change much, but over time emotions change for me. Longest streak of love had ruby, shortest had Go (just a few weeks before it became disgusting for me). I believe thats Personal and different for everyone.<p>After all my reflections I finally settled with just two choices of techstacks: Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix for all things Web and Rust for everything else.<p>Writing highlevel businesscode , interactive exploration of things, CRUD things and realtime frontends in Phoenix is a breeze. But this ease of use has tradeoffs as always, I always feel that this dynamic code is somewhat „fluffy“, but ist seems that this is a key to prototype and ship things rapidly.<p>When i do want to do things that feel more „substantial“&#x2F;„meaningful“ than just assembling yet another web product, I Switch to Rust. Producing a statically linked, crosscompiled binary that is „proven“ to work after discussing with the compiler is deeply satisfying for me. Unlike those „fluff“ &#x2F; yet-another-web-product work.<p>Full Circle to PHP: awesome to see static typing available now! But this alone doesn’t make it feel so heavily baremetal for me, still fluffy with types bolted on. It is the fastest php ever, but still in the ballpark of scripting languages. It has mature, productive frameworks, but Phoenix feels superior and leading the way (next rails? Dunno), so why bother if php plays catch up to moving targets?<p>Software Development has become somewhat like fashion now, and PHP looks like those jeans jackets people had in east germany. Not inherently bad, fully functional for its purpose, but once you experience the taste of freedom in the western world you insist to have „real“ things.

I&#x27;ve used the language for a <i>long<\/i> time, I think starting with the 3.x days, and it&#x27;s come a long way. There&#x27;s a lot of good things about it.<p>But.<p>I recently joked in frustration that I missed the days when PHP was a cargo cult version of Perl rather than a cargo cult version of Java. It&#x27;s a joke, it&#x27;s not a fully fair criticism, but I can&#x27;t help but feel there&#x27;s some truth to it. PHP is a fast dynamic language literally designed for embedding in web pages, with a batteries included mindset that shoves all sorts of useful things into the language itself (yes, kind of haphazardly and occasionally in slipshod fashion). If I want to know what the path of the request is, for instance, I could just do:<p><pre><code>    $url = parse_url($_SERVER[&#x27;REQUEST_URI&#x27;]);\n    $path = urldecode($url[&#x27;path&#x27;]);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBut that&#x27;s not The Right Way anymore, is it? Instead, I should use a PSR-7 compliant request object, and do this:<p><pre><code>    $request = Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals();\n    $uri = $request-&gt;getUri();\n    $path = $uri-&gt;getPath();\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&quot;Okay, Chipotle, but that&#x27;s just one more line, stop whining.&quot; Sure, but it&#x27;s three lines that instantiates a Request object that in turn instantiates Stream and Uri objects and importa two Traits and implements, I don&#x27;t know, let&#x27;s say four? four Interfaces, and--<p>&quot;Come on, it&#x27;s still fast.&quot; Yes! Sure But you know what&#x27;s faster? Looking at the $_SERVER variable. I can&#x27;t help but paraphrase a famous quote:<p><i>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &quot;I know, I&#x27;ll use a design pattern.&quot; Now they have two problems.<\/i><p>I know. I know. Using factories and dependency injection containers and tying yourself into knots to avoid anything that <i>remotely<\/i> looks like a global makes things testable and composable and decoupled, but it is <i>so freaking heavyweight<\/i> compared to other dynamic languages. Python&#x27;s Flask web framework has a global context object just called &quot;g&quot;, which is essentially a singleton that lets you arbitrarily store properties on it, not just variables but database connections. OMG GLOBAL RUN AWAY AAAA no, you know what? It&#x27;s fine. Yes, in some sense it&#x27;s probably more dangerous because someone could come along and blow away your database connection by overwriting the &quot;g.db&quot; property, but maybe sometimes the simpler answer is &quot;well, don&#x27;t do that.&quot;<p>Look, I&#x27;ve used Symfony, and CakePHP, and Laravel 4. I think I even contributed a test to Laravel 4&#x27;s testing framework way back when. They&#x27;re great. And I&#x27;m not saying &quot;let&#x27;s all just throw out objects and all separations of concern and mix HTML and business logic like it&#x27;s 1999, baby.&quot; But PHP is virtually a framework on its own, and at times it feels like many smart people have put a great deal of effort into building entirely different frameworks on top of it, paradigms that PHP wasn&#x27;t intended to fit into.<p>So for my new project, I&#x27;m just... rolling it all from scratch. I don&#x27;t have a composer.json file because I don&#x27;t need PHP-FIG compatibility--although the four-line autoloader I have would technically <i>load<\/i> any PSR-4 compatible module if I wanted to. It&#x27;s using the front controller pattern, it has regex-based routing, it has a simple template system with layouts, it has request and response objects, it uses type hinting. It&#x27;s probably not super great, but it&#x27;s... kind of refreshing to write this way.<p>I love PHP despite its warts, and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s learned so much from Enterprise JavaBeanServerNetSwingPattern land.
