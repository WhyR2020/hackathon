Minions in Hearthstone can attack the opponent&#x27;s minions or the opponent themselves - and most decks try to do the former efficiently (value-trade) and only attack (the opponent&#x27;s) &#x27;face&#x27; if they can&#x27;t (either because all enemy minions are gone or there are no good trades to be had). The reason for this is that each player starts with a pretty big pool of health, so bringing that down to 0 must be a long term goal and going for that too greedily will cause you to lose board control and never get there. Only the most aggressive decks break this rule (&#x27;face is the place&#x27; goes the aggro motto). But interestingly one of the skills of the best players when playing slower decks is to know when to &#x27;break character&#x27; and just go for &#x27;face damage&#x27; instead even if it only puts the opponent low on health rather than outright killing them. At that point, the opponent is forced to make any trade they can in order to protect the little life they have left - they are in check. You &#x27;reframe the conversation&#x27; by putting your opponent on their back heel.<p>Anyways, reading about Zugzwang made me wonder if there is a similar concept in Hearthstone too. And coincidentally, the latest expansion comes with a card that kinda fits the bill [1]. It generates powerful minions for you whenever you take damage, but is itself a minion with a lot of health, so it&#x27;s hard to take down. When played against an aggressive deck with a lot of small minions, they get the choice of 1) Doing what they normally would do - attack your face - resulting in building you an army that would win you the game in a turn our two 2) Trading into the big minion to try to get rid of it - these are very inefficient trades and likely to not even succeed this turn or 3) Do nothing - which is probably the last thing they want to do, as the window of opportunity for an aggro deck to win gets smaller over time.<p>Obviously having this as a specific card isn&#x27;t as elegant as the way this can be generated from the existing rules with a specific board state in chess, but I find it interesting to see how many of these more advanced game concepts can be put into a more casual game.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hearthstone.gamepedia.com&#x2F;Zzeraku_the_Warped\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hearthstone.gamepedia.com&#x2F;Zzeraku_the_Warped<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-15 11:18:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bladedtoys"],"id":[21793682],"kids":{},"parent":[21793353],"text":["You can construct a cool game out of non-transitive dice that does this on the very first move but in a completely counter-intuitive way.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nontransitive_dice\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nontransitive_dice<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-15 02:08:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andrepd"],"id":[21793831],"kids":{},"parent":[21793353],"text":["An extremely rare zugzwang with <i>10<\/i> pieces +kings and pawns on the board. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immortal_Zugzwang_Game\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immortal_Zugzwang_Game<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-15 02:37:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lspears"],"id":[21793657],"kids":{},"parent":[21793353],"text":["Poker has the concept of positional advantage.

Stories like this are why I don’t use it.<p>A couple of years ago I inherited managing Dropbox for a company I was at. I’d never really used Dropbox in a more daily use company.<p>I discovered Dropbox wasn’t very IT admin friendly. If you share out a personal folder as your team folder, IT can’t find your folder to share it to new members of your team. The person who owns the folder has to share it out. So when new employees ask why IT can’t access and share the folder, we had to explain that’s how Dropbox works.<p>The other crappy thing I discovered about Dropbox from that time. I have no way to audit or tell who has what folder. If someone was sharing something illegal from their folder, I had to turn on the auditing capability and download logs as they were generated. It was confusing because if someone were sharing something and I was the admin of that account, I should have access to all files and accounts. Nope. So we dumped Dropbox before I left to avoid scrutiny down the road for any acquisitions of the company.<p>Dropbox is still a consumer product trying to be a workplace tool IMO.

Then in reality the user uses 1% of these buttons, and the rest is just there eating screen space. For writing, programming and graphic design this can be quite a lot of space. Automatically shrinking that space by removing buttons the user never used after months could help some users a bit I think. It&#x27;s not the first time I encounter people complaining about screen estate while sitting in front of an unconfigured Visual Studio instance with menu bar, 2 rows of buttons and status bar all on.

What I always <i>liked<\/i> about MacOS was that there weren&#x27;t too many menubar icons to begin with.<p>Back in the days of Windows 98, it became typical for every application you installed to make a little icon in the &quot;System Tray&quot;.  Each app wanted to advertise itself and its (usually useless) features.  The System Tray became a dustbin of crap.  Eventually windows had to auto-hide them, just like you do with a dustbin.<p>Windows also burdened users with useless notifications, for things like &quot;Battery charged!&quot; and &quot;Battery at 80%&quot;, that would constantly distract you.  This happened so much that PhDs in Computer Science wrote entire dissertations and approaches to use machine learning to determine the optimal time to interrupt the user with notifications, in an attempt to intelligently unburden users from this nonsense.

They didn&#x27;t provide an API for app developers to add menubar icons.  So few did.  But then developers wrote hacks to do so.  Now there are so many that they&#x27;ve become a dustbin again, and we need a new app to hide them.  It&#x27;s Windows 98 all over again.<p>Here&#x27;s an idea -- if you are noticing useless menubar icons, get rid of them.  Don&#x27;t invent a new icon, that has the ability to hide other icons, and then try to come up with a UI (or machine learning system) to discern which icons need to be shown and hidden.  Just get the design right in the first place.<p>Ahh... I know I know...

EU citizens, non-EU partners of EU citizens, EU partners of UK citizens, non-EU partners of UK citizens who entered via EU treaty rights, non-EU partners of UK citizens in well paid jobs who entered not-via-the-EU (different rules and status apply to them), the same but in non-well-paid jobs, EU citizens in well paid jobs, EU citizens in poorly paid jobs, children of EU citizens, students, recently graduated students, etc.  And it seems that quite a lot of people don&#x27;t know, yet, what class they are in, or whether they will be allowed to stay in the UK, either in the short term, or the long term.<p>A huge number of people regularly travel between UK and EU for work, holidays and family visits.  Travelling between EU countries is almost like travelling between states in the USA - a lot of people do it fairly casually, and some do it almost as a commute.<p>Because of the changes, a fair number of people are interested in rules around dual citizenship, changes of citizenship (either people whose home is in the UK but they didn&#x27;t need citizenship before, or people from the UK settled elsewhere in the EU who are now deciding whether to apply for change of citizenship to continue where they are), what rights they may have based on ancestry or other family connections which they previously did not need to investigate, the rights of their children, how much they need to earn to obtain different rights, how long applications take and how much they cost, etc.<p>On top of that, travelling across the border can jeopardise a person&#x27;s applications, because it creates discontinuities of residence and the institutions judge such things arbitrarily, some of the time.<p>So information on visa requirements, conditions, and how different rules apply to different people may be something people will really need starting fairly soon.<p>Just saying, as I think the information could prove useful to many if it&#x27;s made presentable and accessible (and isn&#x27;t misleading), and for your site there might be a lot of visitors if it&#x27;s the place to find out."],"time":["2019-12-15 17:16:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["robjan"],"id":[21797032],"kids":[21804011,21797073],"parent":[21796088],"text":["TIL that my home, Hong Kong, has been demoted to &quot;developing&quot;"],"time":["2019-12-15 17:35:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["enraged_camel"],"id":[21797011],"kids":[21797055],"parent":[21796088],"text":["It would be great if you could include alternative spellings and shorthands in the country dropdown at the start.

This was a solution to visa issues I faced when I wanted to travel. Since then it&#x27;s grown to 100+ countries and now features visa exemptions, dual passport requirements and many data points like flight prices, weather, distance, economy status and travel advice. I’m adding new countries every day so that you can use Visa List for all your visa requirements.<p>Visa List makes money mostly from ads and affiliates. Most of the site is freely usable but to use some filters, community chat and visa advice, you need to pay. Users pay monthly, annual or once for a lifetime membership. Revenue ranges from $5,000&#x2F;m to $6,000&#x2F;m. It became profitable after 2 months of launch.<p>But it didn&#x27;t start making $5000 immediately, it started with $500 per month and grew slowly over the span of a year.<p>Initially I placed ads on visa list and was getting around 100K pageviews around a month. But the ads revenue was not that great at all. I tried to apply for skyscanner partnership because I knew that there would be good need after getting visa, but unfortunately I got rejected. I think the main reason was it was I was not getting a lot of traffic.<p>With a heavy heart I tried different ad networks like video ads, content ads but none of them improved the revenue. All this while, i never lost sight of my goal to increase the SEO and along the way get more users to Visa List.<p>Suddenly after a month I got an email from skyscanner from saying that they are interested in partnering with, this was another team. I was so happy and realised that things come around eventually. In a month I integrated skyscanner and it started a good stream of revenue from visa list.<p>After 5 month around june, people from iVisa contacted me. They provide visa service and visa assistance across the world which was perfect. I was very happy to partner with them as well and thus opened 3rd revenue stream.<p>Along the way I also learning AdOps so i could monetize the traffic I was getting and finally after 6 months things started working out. So my first channel also started contributing a good chunk to overall revenue.<p>After around 8 month i started an experiment with Visa List membership which i have been sitting on it for a long time. I was not really sure what was the most valuable information that travelers really need so they won&#x27;t mind paying. Looking at Nomad list and starter story, i finally put in a set of features that i thought can be useful for Pro members. I&#x27;m happy that the experiment paid off adding to the 4th revenue stream.<p>So looking back, it was not a single thing but a lot of small things done right over a year.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visalist.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visalist.io<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-15 14:21:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sillycube"],"id":[21796505],"kids":{},"parent":[21796088],"text":["Why not directly check the visa requirements on Google?

I&#x27;ve been directly involved in similar types of international negotiations, albeit at a smaller scale and unrelated to carbon markets. Talking to people involved in the carbon market negotiation made it abundantly clear why there will never be a useful outcome.<p>Most of the governments involved in negotiating a common international agreements on carbon markets unofficially represent for-profit interests seeking advantage in the structure of the carbon market. There is an enormous amount of profit that can be realized here, and the good faith actors are in the minority. This is quite normal even in small international agreements but it becomes exponentially harder to arrive at an agreement that is minimally corrupted with respect to its nominal purpose as the profit incentive to corrupt the agreement increases. The last time I looked in on the current state of the carbon market negotiations, it had been corrupted beyond redemption. I have no faith that something useful will result.<p>This is why international agreements are unlikely to have a material impact on climate change. International agreements tend to only be effective when there is minimal profit or advantage to be gained by corrupting the purpose of the agreement.

Civil forfeiture, on the other hand, does not require a criminal charge—only a suspicion that a piece of property was involved in a crime, or that it was obtained illegally.<p>&gt; But neither of those legal processes were used against Clavasquin, his coplaintiffs, and the estimated “hundreds if not thousands” of others just in New York City that they represent in the lawsuit.

(...) The fear took two forms. First, if conversations became matters of record in the same way as letters or other contracts, managers felt that customers\nwould abandon the telephone for critical negotiations and return to the mails, where a slip of the tongue would not prove fatal. (...) Second, if conversations could be recorded, matters of an illegal or immoral nature, which some executives estimated made up as much as one third of all calls, would no longer be discussed by phone. (...) Although one might expect that managers would stress the economic half of this equation, in fact they paid far more attention to the question of trust and image. During this period AT&amp;T had constant public relations problems, largely the result of antitrust investigations. Thus, the fact that magnetic recording might create a major upset with only a minor gain for a few customers who could afford to have their calls answered automatically was simply not acceptable for managers concerned with preserving AT&amp;T&#x27;s good name.&quot;"],"time":["2019-12-15 11:45:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Merrill"],"id":[21796183],"kids":[21798674],"parent":[21783792],"text":["The 1947 anti-trust lawsuit was settled by the 1956 consent decree which forced AT&amp;T to exit all businesses not related to providing a national telecommunications network and which also required royalty-free licensing of all patents.

In fact, telephone answering machines became popular only after the development of low cost Phillips cassette recording technology driven by entertainment markets.<p>Note also that the gating of technology into the Bell System from Bell Laboratories via Western Electric was by design. Bell Labs was set up independently of and funded by AT&amp;T Headquarters and Western Electric. This allowed Bell Labs to research (AT&amp;T) and develop (WECo) technologies  independently of short term business needs in order to prevent the Bell Operating Company regulated monopolies from stagnating, and it also prevented the system from being disrupted by short term engineering hacks.

Those who are patient with their kids were patient before having children.<p>The chemical high from having a child doesn&#x27;t necessarily change who you are. If anything, it simply amplifies existing traits by putting you through a high pressure, long-term project.<p>The biggest (positive) child-related change I&#x27;ve noticed? The sudden and prolonged surge of happiness when those children are out of the house. Everything else tends to be the effects of time blunting the worst of the negatives.<p>As a point of reference, I have no children of my own, but I had two teenage girls adopt me as their father.

Seems like being a founder or even just trying to advance aggressively in a standard career is a lot harder if you have dependents.<p>There’s also two key trade offs I see too: money vs. energy. The more financially well off you are when you have children, the easier things will be (affording the house in the right neighborhood, daycare, etc.).

They definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was already together, you&#x27;re going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you&#x27;re going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s how kids are, or because it&#x27;s the only way to integrate their lives with adults&#x27;, but once you have kids, you tend to have to work on their schedule.<p>&gt; You will have chunks of time to work. But you can&#x27;t let work spill promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had kids. You&#x27;re going to have to work at the same time every day, whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be times when you have to stop, even if it is.<p>&gt; I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But if there weren&#x27;t something real there, why would I squirm? The fact is, once you have kids, you&#x27;re probably going to care more about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum game. Only one idea at a time can be the top idea in your mind.

Well, why would it be different for humans, other than the exquisite vanity of our <i>wanting<\/i> it to be different? Our wanting the universe to be governed by a god who looks like us, for example. Our wanting to be &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;fulfilled&quot; and so on. No, we&#x27;re basically animals, just mentally a bit more complicated. So I think our lives are pretty much all about reproduction too, but with an overlay of &quot;meaning&quot; that is completely arbitrary. Your life can be about reproduction if you want, or it can be meaningless, or it can be filled with whatever meaning you want to fill it with (i.e. make up from whole cloth, or borrow from the collective). I find this freeing, because it puts me in control, but your mileage may vary.<p>Anyway, my challenge to everyone here is to try and unify the pre- and post-children mindsets. The stuff you&#x27;re interested in doing before you have kids might be the same stuff that later interests you about your kids. Take the statement, &quot;Shoot, I have kids, so I can&#x27;t go out anymore.&quot; Well why were you &quot;going out?&quot; Was it &quot;to meet people?&quot; That&#x27;s kind of just code for &quot;meeting sex partners&quot; and don&#x27;t tell me this is not at least in the back of your mind, hovering near the threshold of consciousness (if not an explicit goal). And well, you know what sex is for. It&#x27;s not so you can have a good time; it&#x27;s what evolution uses to trick you into making more humans.<p>When you&#x27;re attracted to someone, you&#x27;re really just assessing them and deeming them reproductively fit. Those traits might include a fit body indicating health&#x2F;robustness; a nice face indicating (studies have shown) the person is near the average of the gene pool and therefore carrying tried-and-true genetic material; a personality that indicates a good chance they would behave kindly toward any offspring; and an intellect that shows they could solve any problems that come up.<p>Working with computers or doing any other challenging mental problem, playing an instrument, having a bunch of money (or things that cost a lot of money), doing feats of daring like base-jumping or whatnot, all of these are ways of displaying your fitness for mating. Before some of them became &quot;occupations&quot; you could earn &quot;money&quot; with, they would&#x27;ve been used for solving problems to protect or feed or clothe (etc.) the village or tribe and its progeny. (Not base-jumping specifically, but challenging oneself with risky feats of daring, and coming out on top, that does prove something about your courage and skill, which would at the very least be useful in hunting or defense.)<p>School and all childhood learning are preparation for mating, or for learning one of the above preparations for mating, or for &quot;being an adult&quot; which equals mating. Interestingly some of that involves sheltering the child from mating concerns, which is consistent with how we train noobs everywhere. We don&#x27;t be givin&#x27; you the source code for the compiler during the &quot;Write your first hello world&quot; tutorial, for example.<p>Life is meaningless, or it&#x27;s about mating, or it&#x27;s about whatever bullshit you want.

Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men; which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public. Yet it were great reason that those that have children should have greatest care of future times; unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges. Some there are, who though they lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with themselves, and account future times impertinences. 1 Nay, there are some other that account wife and children but as bills of charges. Nay more, there are some foolish rich covetous men, that take a pride in having no children, because they may be thought so much the richer. For perhaps they have heard some talk, Such an one is a great rich man, and another except to it, Yea, but he hath a great charge of children; as if it were an abatement to his riches. But the most ordinary cause of a single life is liberty, especially in certain self-pleasing and humorous 2 minds, which are so sensible of every restraint, as they will go near to think their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles. Unmarried men are best friends, best masters, best servants; but not always best subjects; for they are light to run away; and almost all fugitives are of that condition. A single life doth well with churchmen; for charity will hardly water the ground where it must first fill a pool. It is indifferent for judges and magistrates; for if they be facile and corrupt, you shall have a servant five times worse than a wife. For soldiers, I find the generals commonly in their hortatives put men in mind of their wives and children; and I think the despising of marriage amongst the Turks maketh the vulgar soldier more base. Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity; and single men, though they may be many times more charitable, because their means are less exhaust, yet, on the other side, they are more cruel and hardhearted (good to make severe inquisitors), because their tenderness is not so oft called upon. Grave natures, led by custom, and therefore constant, are commonly loving husbands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam prætulit immortalitati [he preferred his old wife to immortality]. Chaste women are often proud and froward, as presuming upon the merit of their chastity. It is one of the best bonds both of chastity and obedience in the wife, if she think her husband wise; which she will never do if she find him jealous. Wives are young men’s mistresses; companions for middle age; and old men’s nurses. So as a man may have a quarrel 3 to marry when he will. But yet he 4 was reputed one of the wise men, that made answer to the question, when a man should marry,—A young man not yet, an elder man not at all. It is often seen that bad husbands have very good wives; whether it be that it raiseth the price of their husband’s kindness when it comes; or that the wives take a pride in their patience. But this never fails, if the bad husbands were of their own choosing, against their friends’ consent; for then they will be sure to make good their own folly."],"time":["2019-12-14 19:21:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tunapizza"],"id":[21791808],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["TL;DR having kids is cool."],"time":["2019-12-14 21:03:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fnord77"],"id":[21793484],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["one of my biggest regrets is not having kids.<p>I had the chance, but I squandered it."],"time":["2019-12-15 01:32:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sgwealti"],"id":[21793185],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["Graham not being able to appreciate something until he experiences it himself is peak PG."],"time":["2019-12-15 00:39:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["haimez"],"id":[21794844],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["Paul, what’s it going to take for you to get a free SSL cert on your personal blog?"],"time":["2019-12-15 07:39:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vearwhershuh"],"id":[21791617],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["Yes.<p>We should structure society so people can have kids.

While your work is important for the obvious reason of supporting yourself and your family, raising your children well is far more important in many ways. Unfortunately, the cause and effect or investment and reward of parenting is far less tangible than that of work. Many of us spent a lot of exhausting, sleepless days and nights in college. It was an investment in ourselves to prepare us to live independently and successfully. These exhausting, sleepless days and nights that we spend as parents is a similar investment, but this time it isn&#x27;t an investment in ourselves: it&#x27;s an investment in our children. Are they worth the investment? Of course they are, and I don&#x27;t think anyone here is suggesting that they are not. People are just trying to grapple with the struggle. One of the ways to handle an arduous struggle is to meet it with a healthy mindset; a different mindset than the one we&#x27;ve developed to that point in life.<p>Mindsets are not always easy to change, but changing them is part of life and sometimes the changes are forced on us. For example, when we lose jobs, we have to change our career mindsets; the old career that we may have loved may no longer work in our lives. That&#x27;s life. Life isn&#x27;t a static state and sometimes the states change whether we want them to or not. We go through stages of life and we change as we grow older. Yes, we developed hobbies, made friends, and had fun before we had kids, but when we have kids, they should be one of our new “hobbies”. They should be a new “job”. They can be our new “friends” and new fun. Parenting shouldn&#x27;t be something that gets in the way of your life; it <i>is<\/i> your way of life. These little people depend on you to make them into functional people who can meet the demands of life. We can&#x27;t just be task-masters who change diapers and shovel food into their mouths. Meeting their needs well will develop their senses of security, responsibility, and belonging in life. We have to treat them like the people that they are; we&#x27;re getting to know them and they&#x27;re getting to know us. It&#x27;s far more important than that though, because we&#x27;re shaping them and they&#x27;re shaping us.<p>We also have to pay attention to how we socialize with them. How we interact from the very beginning is going to help determine how they interact with us and with others. I&#x27;ve seen so many parents who mindlessly fall into antagonistic relationships with their kids and spouses, without a philosophical idea of how this impacts the development of their personalities and our relationships with them. And here&#x27;s the kicker: how we interact when they&#x27;re babies and toddlers will help determine the nature of our relationships with them as they grow older. Contrary to what so many people say, it is helpful to reason with children long before they understand the full ramifications of the reasoning process. It&#x27;s like on-the-job training of life: you&#x27;re teaching them to reason. If there&#x27;s a reason why they shouldn&#x27;t be doing things, explain to them what the reason is instead of spanking them or dismissively saying, “because I said so.” Your willingness to invest the time with them when they&#x27;re young and your determination to make that time meaningful will help make it more likely that you&#x27;ll have meaningful time with them as they get older. Having teenagers who wanted to hang with dad was so much more rewarding than my peers whose kids wanted nothing to do with them.<p>Big picture thinking. It doesn&#x27;t give us more energy, but sometimes inspiration does. Another thing that may help is looking at your little children and imagining how helpless they are in this world. And they&#x27;re looking at you with awe, believing in you and depending on you to make their lives work."],"time":["2019-12-15 12:51:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Myopic_PG"],"id":[21791192],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["There&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve noticed that&#x27;s always conspicuously absent from Paul&#x27;s writing: The ability to view the world from a perspective other than his own.<p>I&#x27;m sure having kids was great when you were rich and it was the &#x27;90s.

I see the angst in some posts and would like to let you know it&#x27;s possible to have time for what matters to you and good relationships with a spouse and children.<p>First off -  I&#x27;m 44 and have 5 kids, expecting my 6th.<p>TLDR;\nLots of kids, lots of (good) coffee, lots of love and laughs.<p>My wife and I are expecting our 6th child, a boy, in April. We live in a suburb 25 min North of NYC having previously lived in Manhattan. She&#x27;s from NYC, I&#x27;m from he Midwest. Neither of us come from big families.<p>Anyway, my kids are an 11 yo girl, 7 yo boy, 5 yo boy, 3 yo girl, 18mo boy. I&#x27;m sure people think we are nuts. We are not religious, we are not particularly wealthy, we don&#x27;t have nannies or even a baby-sitter for that matter,  we just want to have a big family and figure it out as we go.<p>Before I get into details, I highly recommend investing in a very good espresso machine and very good coffee. It&#x27;s pretty important ;)<p>The way we have things set up is as follows:  I run the business (small web dev consultancy that&#x27;s basically me plus a few freelancers) while my wife runs the household, schedule and logistics for he family. This is key. Good planning makes everything flow. Kids like to understand what to expect and it enables them to contribute appropriately too.<p>I work from home as much as possible so that I can take my kids to&#x2F;from school and schedule calls and meetings when I know the little ones are napping. I am capable of completely tuning out noise and getting into the zone so I can work from the couch if I feel like being in the mix with the little people running around. Usually I manage to snap out of my work trans at key times like when someone wants my help or attention and then return to whatever I was doing without being totally derailed.<p>Work&#x2F;life balance? What&#x27;s that? I&#x27;ve been documenting the good life with kids from my perspective for eventual release in a &quot;dad&quot; blog (for a change since there are so many mommy blogs) and I work at times when other people sleep, on vacation, pretty much anytime&#x2F;anywhere but I like it.<p>It&#x27;s gotten easier with practice, all of it.  Easier to really listen to what people of all ages are really saying. Easier to share how I feel about things and elicit exchange. Easier weed out drama and incompatible clients, taxing relationships and unfulfilling habits.<p>Basically, the necessity to be on track with right livelihood has made the distinction between work and life kind of unimportant because I just do what needs to be done and what needs to be done is what I want to be doing... It&#x27;s kind of liberating and feels remarkably clear and carefree given the responsibility I have.<p>It has not always felt like this. I have bouts of worry and anxiety that peel away to the eventual &quot;back on track&quot;. 11 years into fatherhood I feel happier than at any time in the past and with greater stability.<p>Sometime around the time my third child was born, I had developed the &quot;tune out noise&quot;, &quot;tune out bullshit&quot; and &quot;focus on what counts&quot; skills to recover from anxiety, work stress and life&#x27;s surprises out of necessity. The skill arrived little by little, pretty much automatically without any conscious effort on my part.<p>On that note, my 3rd child was the hardest psychologically (in the months leading up to his birth) and to some extent logistically. Thoughts of &quot;Where will we live?&quot;, &quot; How will we afford to provide the things we want to?&quot;, &quot;What if I can&#x27;t do it?&quot;, &quot;What if I can&#x27;t pull it off?&quot;. The poor guy brought up all of my suppressed insecurities - in my mind going from two children to three was turning things up to ELEVEN! Turns out, he was suer cool, I was able to pay rent, we figured it out...<p>After an adjustment phase replete with lots of changes (moves, business changes and more) things became clearer on their own and what do you know, life went on!<p>I told one of my colleagues in Vietnam who is thinking of staring a family about the fear of not being able to provide or live up to some ideal and he told me a nice proverb:<p>&quot;The earth gave birth to an elephant and then gave birth to grass&quot;<p>I like that better than &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention&quot; it seems kinder...<p>My 4th and 5th children have been the easiest from the &quot;have time&quot; perspective...because I know how it works now.<p>Whether or not it&#x27;s accurate, I perceive myself as having more time now, with five children, than how I felt with two children.<p>I imagine that 6 will be pretty overwhelming at first because I&#x27;ve been feeling the scale of meals, laundry, bathing, schedules, transportation, any activity we do as a group... but I know that we&#x27;ll find a rhythm and it will work out.<p>Regarding work with kids schedules, they punctuate my workday to say the least but it&#x27;s great. I spend a lot of time with them and get a huge charge from our relationships.<p>Will I ever retire? Probably not, even if I could. Do I have a lot of money to throw around, nope, not yet. I am ok with this. I would pay more than I could earn without kids to have the relationships I have with my children and to facilitate them growing up together.<p>Before my first child was born, I had a sort of flashy lifestyle and no sense of continuity or meaning beyond striving. Goals would be set and meet and followed by either a desire for more or emptiness. I no longer feel this way in the least.<p>I attribute that shift in large part to the quality of relationships I have with my wife, our children, our family and community. I am focused on things that are important to the people I care about and it works for me.<p>I doubt I&#x27;ll ever regret the time I&#x27;ve spent with my kids or the &quot;sacrifices&quot; I&#x27;ve made to accommodate having a large family. I think each age offers magical opportunities to learn, connect, nurture, grow. I think that the time and investment I make in family causes me to enjoy the present, focus on what is really congruent with what matters to me, our family and our needs.<p>Have you ever heard of someone proclaiming any of the following on their death bead?<p>&quot;I wish I had spent less time with my children&quot; or &quot;I wish I had been a bigger success and much richer instead of having a family&quot; or &quot;If I&#x27;d only had fewer children, I would have lead a fuller life...&quot;<p>:)"],"time":["2019-12-15 05:41:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21792585],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-14 22:59:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["anon1253"],"id":[21792056],"kids":{},"parent":[21790396],"text":["ight, so this will probably come across as self-centered an pathetic. But it’s what I feel right now. I’m a 28 year old male, have a significant other, good income, and an education in Artificial Intelligence and Epidemiology (PhD drop out to start my own business). So nothing to be ashamed of, I don’t think. I run a small team, with nice, friendly, competent, and hand-picked colleagues. I have family that cares about me. But every day, all day, I spend looking at a computer screen. Day in, day out, I’m glued to my screen. Some days it’s exciting, some days it’s mind numbing and boring. Some days I go for a walk, alone. And no days, for the past year or so, I’ve felt like I connected with someone. I tweet about 10 tweets a day, I get favorites, a retweet occasionally. I work from home. I’ve alienated all my friends. I’m barely in contact with the people from high-school or university. I don’t know why, I just forget or neglect to message back. You can do that twice, then they forget about you too. I rarely forget though, they still linger in my mind daily.<p>So what’s the problem? Is there a problem? I worry a lot. I think we’re headed for a disaster. As a species, as a culture, our days are numbered. I read the reports, I’ve done enough math to see the implications; climate change will kill us. There might be some things to stop it, but they’re too few, too late. I worry, a lot. In my day to day business I don’t deal with this. I do machine learning for evidence based medicine, natural language processing basically. But what occupies my mind is the disaster we’re headed. It’s all connected. That sounds like something a mad man would say, in a delusional rage rant of incoherent sentences. Maybe it is. But, the thought fills me with a cognitive dissonance, a numbing and parallelizing feeling of nothingness. Are we even worth saving as a species? Why are we here? Why am I here. I did some philosophy reading. I like Sartre, Camus, Karl Jaspers. The absurdity of your own choices, your own life. Am I doing the right thing? Wouldn’t it be better to spend my, arguably well educated, skills on the more pressing matters in life?<p>I made the choice not to have children. It’s stupid to have children. We’re overpopulated, and our resources are stretched thin. Unless we make space colonization or transhumanism a priority there’s just a finite amount of “stuff”. We’re reaching the finiteness of that stuff. Maybe not today, but growth is exponential, the cup will be half full before it’s full. Things change slowly, then quickly. Some people think it’s arrogant not to have children. But what makes your genes so special? I sequenced mine, all of it, it’s nothing special. I might get a tattoo with my special genes (the ones with a low minor allele frequency). Perhaps some people get children because they’re lonely. I’m lonely. What’s left in life? What will be my contribution? If it’s not another random soul on a planet headed for disaster, then what is? I’m thinking about planting trees. A lot of them. I spend months thinking about preventing climate change, and “trees” is all I could think of in the end. Besides, I cherish and romanticize the post-melodramatic idea of walking in my own forest.<p>What is the cause, what is the symptom? Where does my own hubris end, and do the problems of the world start? I am not so sure anymore. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. My ideas go unvalidated, they run amok in the days glued to my screen. The moments I’m in “the zone”, and can focus on nothing but the code in front of me, are meditative. There’s a spirituality in connecting with computers, alone. It’s often neglected in the hipster computer science culture, with their faux new-atheist movements. Experiences can be mystical, there is a desire to transcend. I used to identify as an atheist, read the cruft by Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins. I don’t think they hold water anymore. Mostly because they turn out to be assholes. I like the term Humanism. I like rationality, science done proper without the dogma. Our human condition is more than that though. I guess Jaspers would call it the “encompassing”. Or some such, never got that figured out. Neither did he, probably.<p>Why am I here. I’m 28. With my health habits, I’ll probably die of myocardial infarction at the age of 50. A BMI of 26 and bad genes does that to you. Male European genes are bad, mind you. Males are the weaker gender, don’t be fooled; just look at the flimsy Y-chromosome. What will be my legacy? Does it even matter? I’ve been thinking of moving to Iceland. It makes sense to me: good sources of energy and water, small population. With the increasing climate change it might even be good for farming. Climate change has upsides. Migration coupled with fascism is the big downside, that and death of course. I had an idea for a short story: I’ve migrated to Iceland. Under a bright aurora I decide to go outside. The world has gone to shit. I didn’t see the aurora coming. The NOAA satellites were deemed strategic assets for what was left of precision agriculture, and hence shut down for public access. I look up and see the bright green filaments move across the sky. I decide to take a look uphill, take my camera. I’ve made it, I’m happy. I still got it, I got my self-sustaining home, my books. I watch our insignificance as I ponder the implications of basic nuclear physics. I trip. And as I fall down the hill, breaking every bone, I gasp in my last life’s breath “well isn’t this ironic”.<p>It’s all been done before hasn’t it? It doesn’t matter, what matters is that you do something with your life. I’m a mess. Not on the outside, I give talks in my domain, I’m respected in the very narrow subfield I’m in, do the laundry, keep my teeth clean. I even take care of my body, although not as much as I like. But it’s my mind. It’s my goddamn mind. We’re headed for disaster: I can see it when I close my eyes.<p>Once you’re caught in one of the migration streams, trying to catch the next plane or boat, you’ll think of the endless queues in Disneyland. That is what will happen.

I couldn&#x27;t have told you what rules were required to get the system to accept the password, but it well beyond the default&#x2F;typical AD policy[0].  To &quot;enhance security&quot;, ours included a requirement that none of the prior 10-or-so passwords could be used, had a 12-character minimum[1] which IIRC, required also setting the &quot;Store passwords using reversible encryption[2]&quot;.  We allowed 30 bad logins, but a good login had to occur before lock-out or it required tech staff intervention.<p>We would have been better off having a non-resetting password policy with a reasonable minimum length.  For the first 9 months of my career, I was top-tier end-user support[3].  It took about 2-months before I stopped asking people for passwords. 95% of the time, the password was &quot;MonthNameYearNumber!!!!&quot; with bangs filling in the rest, i.e. &quot;March19991!!!!!!!!&quot;, or some variation.  However, the frequency with which it was <i>exactly that pattern<\/i> was amazing.  So that gave me 12 tries to get a password.  I rarely locked out an account.<p>As is usually the case ... there&#x27;s a law of unintended consequences.  People will seek to reduce the friction to getting their job done and aren&#x27;t great at assessing risk.  In addition, the risk to an individual password is low.  Even the result of a successful breach of a user&#x27;s password is often not devastating to the individual who was attacked when that password is a LAN login (chances are you&#x27;re <i>not<\/i> storing your own personal financial information on your work PC).<p>One of the odder unintended consequences -- figuring out the appropritae incantation to generate an acceptable password for the system was ... way more difficult than it should have been.  I&#x27;m fairly certain one of our security tools was just broken.  We had something that applied far more strict rules about password history than what AD could enforce, looking <i>specifically for<\/i> people using patterns, along with some other <i>odd<\/i> ones, like &quot;you cannot repeat the same character&quot;, so &quot;umbreLLa&quot; was rejected.  They, literally, reduced the number of possible passwords that a brute-force attack would require.<p>There was an interesting bug there -- we discovered that after the account was created, if only one password was in the password history, it would pretty much <i>refuse<\/i> to allow any password that <i>didn&#x27;t<\/i> contain half of the characters, in the same place, as the prior password.  Then, future required password resets would refuse all passwords that were similar to the previously rejected ones which were used on that account.  However, if you used one of those rejected passwords on an account that <i>hadn&#x27;t<\/i> had them rejected on that first reset, they would be allowed for <i>that<\/i> user.<p>I&#x27;m guessing they reversed a boolean somewhere (no similar past passwords) and that the security software stored a history of rejected passwords for future validation (no idea why this would be done, but then, no idea why it&#x27;d be illegal to duplicate characters), but security ditched all of those products when AD was upgraded and the tools stopped working.  I know one of the reasons for the odd password rules were that we synced passwords to the Mainframe accounts, and they had a set of nonsensical rules that were very similar.<p>[0] If memory serves, default was 10 bad passwords before 1 hour lock-out, password had to have at least one number, one lower-case and one upper-case letter with an 8-character maximum and 90-day reset.<p>[1] I believe there&#x27;s a study or two that indicates somewhere around 7-10 is typical for what a person can memorize easily.  I&#x27;ve always wondered why.  In my childhood, memorizing a 7-digit or 10-digit phone number for several people was something everyone did, so it&#x27;s arguable that people my age have that ability out of necessity.  I wonder what would be found if that were re-done, today, with people who are too young to remember days before speed-dial.

Because what is being presented by default is a practical absurdity.<p>What if someone promoting utility wind approaches you and claims that wind is the future?  BUT in place of today&#x27;s standard size 3MW turbines it absolutely must be a far greater number of 1MW turbines.

Utility scale electric is geared to multiple ~1GWe+ solutions per plant, the round number that could practically be multiplied into a feasible grid solution.<p>Aside from industry desperation I also wonder if SMRs are being promoted by a few billionaires, not from a desire to supply lesser developed countries (all of whom should never go in for less than 1GWe), but to power their own offshore enclaves, their survival retreats in places like New Zealand.  Call it my pet conspiracy theory.  They wish to see the technology put to practice on our collective dime as soon as possible.

Adam Schiff rapes and kills three boys. Mueller and Schiff all receive $3 billion dollars each for joing the group. Nadler came back to witness these two rape to make sure they were all bound together under one purpose: keep Trump in power, and also to confirm the payments to each, including his $10.5 billion dollar payment.<p>Between Mueller and Schiff turns, the group issues orders for ten women to begin prepping more boys for rape. They are former friends and family of Brian Schlenker, and also some long standing Illuminati members who include Elsa Hosk, Gigi and Bella Hadid. Again, the &quot;prep&quot; these females engage means they perform oral sex on the boys’ penis and anus, as a child rapist like Henry Porter would, while trying to remove fecal matter from the boy prior to handing them over to be raped and subsequently murdered.

It is hard to imagine a state in the US that is more employee friendly so I would be surprised if you found your situation better elsewhere. Besides possibly another country? Even then I’d be surprised. Things tend to trend the other direction outside of California.<p>That being said, many have told you to discuss with a lawyer. And some have even warned that it can cause unnecessary conflict if you do. They aren’t wrong but you can always talk to a lawyer just to see what they think your options are. If this is as much of a slam dunk case in favor of your employer as I assume it is, I like to think a good lawyer would be able to let you know.<p>On the bright side, if your employer does take it over and they still allow it to be open source, that’s super great! Getting paid to do open source is a blessing. There are also so many benefits to being the creator of a valuable tool in your company. These things can often lead to promotions, bonuses and all kinds of personal fulfillment at work.<p>If you do learn that you’re going to have to hand it over, find a way to spin it into a good thing. Don’t let it make you bitter. And next time you build something on the side, consider your employment contract and decide if you want to build something that doesn’t relate with your employer so you might have a better shot to align your desire to keep it.<p>Try not to let this make you bitter.
