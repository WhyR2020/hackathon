Customers are often led into decisions by their own developers who are more interested in learning new things or in making themselves attractive for the next job. Yes sales people from the providers also help make this happen but more often than not the customer walks themselves into walls.<p>The providers hawk shit like it&#x27;s magic and overstate their capabilities ad nauseum. <i>Everything<\/i> is sold like fucking magic. AI has been so fucking overhyped that it is mind numbingly hard to even deal with peers who should know better.

(Everything I am saying pertains to the US only.)<p>I rescued quite a few children, it&#x27;s hard to see in this video because the video quality is poor and the camera is at an angle that is worse than what the lifeguard in the video is seeing.   Overall this victim is fairly active and should not have been very hard to spot in person for a well trained lifeguard.  (And they did spot the child.)<p>This is a weird video because:<p>There are lifeguard(s) but yet the pool is full of non coast-guard approved tubes and floatation devices such.   Most places with well trained lifeguards would not allow this.   They don&#x27;t work, can be more dangerous than no PFD, and they make it harder for the lifeguards to see.   The worst drowning incident I witnessed involved a child in a tube who got flipped upside down and couldn&#x27;t get out of the tube or flip back over.  (I was not a lifeguard yet when I saw that.)<p>I think things from my perspective are in a terrible state in terms of water safety compared to 20 years ago.<p>Something must have changed with insurance liability, as most places just don&#x27;t even have lifeguards.   Resort pools I see these days are designed in a way where sight lines are so poor lifeguards&#x2F;parents cannot even see children in the pools unless they are in the pool and stay within 10ft of the child.   Very different than things used to be.   Pool designers have reduced depth &amp; eliminated diving boards resulting in a false sense of security.  Meanwhile the pools are no longer even sufficient to be used for teaching up to a point where a person can be considered a swimmer.   I just got back from vacation and the resort we stayed at had a pool which absolutely terrified me.  I was 100% in lifeguard mode the entire time my child was in the pool, and the pool was so bad I couldn&#x27;t sit in one spot and see him, I had to walk the edge of the pool to maintain sight lines.   (The pool in the video is not like this FWIW)<p>Fewer young people are supposedly physically fit and able to get to advanced swimming levels and pass tough standards like Red Cross.   There are fewer places that even have Red Cross accredited programs these days as a result.   Red Cross level instructors command high pay, and most places teaching swimming lessons these days are money making businesses that pay instructors near minimum wage and try to make the franchise owner wealthy.  This is a relatively large change from non-profit Red Cross programs back in the day.<p>Red Cross has always refused to act as insurance for pools&#x2F;resorts&#x2F;water parks, and alternate private organizations now certify lower quality lifeguards &amp; swim instructors and we have new things like &quot;Shallow Water lifeguards&quot; that can be paid minimum wage. These alternate private certification orgs train to a lower level but do act as insurance so they&#x27;re very attractive.<p>I have a 7 year old, he&#x27;s been through 4 private orgs so far.  None have had Red Cross accredited programs.   All of them have been super expensive but they&#x27;re the only choice available.   3 of them did not have deep enough water and their instructors were not trained at a level for teaching to a full &quot;Swimmer&quot; level.   None of the programs seem to focus on water safety and have strange practices like trying to teaching 5 year olds the butterfly and other high energy&#x2F;low safety strokes without teaching elementary backstroke, breaststroke, sidestroke, etc.. which are more useful in emergency water situations.  Most of the instructors I&#x27;ve seen teaching my child show poor enough form they&#x27;d have not passed a Water Safety course 20 years ago.<p>The whole thing is a giant mess.  I have been considering getting re-certified to take over finishing my child&#x27;s swimming lessons, but the course is hard to take these days.  Which also explains why not enough 16-20 year olds manage to take it.   And there are almost no pools left to use that are not privately owned and have deep enough water.<p>Also at least by the old standards when someone who was a Red Cross WSI calls someone a swimmer we&#x27;re talking about a pretty high level.   Someone who can&#x27;t swim for 30 minutes to safety in deep water is not necessarily a swimmer IMO.   Maybe standards have reduced.  But that was a requirement at one point.   And this is not something that requires elite physical fitness or stamina when you are trained to swim well.  Some of the strokes are barely more physically taxing than walking if you&#x27;re proficient.  Non swimmers get a false idea about this because they mostly see competitive swimming which uses the taxing&#x2F;fast strokes."],"time":["2020-03-04 16:21:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["minimonk"],"id":[22483345],"kids":[22483583,22483794,22483450,22483782,22483399,22484281,22488456,22483512],"parent":[22482731],"text":["One of the important lessons I learnt from a lifeguard is that movies depict a very inaccurate representation of drowning.

The reasons for this are complex and sad.<p>Anecdotally, as a child, my family wasn&#x27;t well off (and at least once homeless), and for a while lived in a lower class urban neighborhood that just happened to have a nice public pool. However, I know that my swimming education started as a toddler with my mother taking me to the local recreation center for early swim classes. Later when I was maybe 6 or 7 my older brother, a champion high school swimmer, further reinforced this until I was very comfortable in the water and had no problems even at the bottom of the deepest parts of the pool. All through my early, middle and high school years I had countless opportunities to swim, and to learn new skills around water. When I was 17 I could easily complete a mile-long endurance swim, or pull a bucket of rocks 20 feet up off the bottom of a pitch black lake.<p>My African-American friends, starting way back at that housing complex, had no such similar experience. I remember long summer days with my friends teaching our black friends to swim so we could have more fun in the pool as a group. As children, it wasn&#x27;t entirely unusual that one of us kids couldn&#x27;t swim, as maybe their parents just hadn&#x27;t gotten around to teaching them, so we took it upon ourselves -- never really noticing the pattern that <i>only<\/i> our black friends hadn&#x27;t learned to swim yet. What we didn&#x27;t understand is that most of their parents would <i>never<\/i> teach them, as many of them in fact couldn&#x27;t swim either or discouraged it for various reasons -- creating a generational problem.<p>Now, older, I&#x27;ve come to see and understand the sadness of the situation and hope it continues to be addressed in a more systematic way.<p>Please, if you can&#x27;t swim, learn to. Teach your children or have your children taught. Water sports are tons of fun, but your safety is mostly on your ability to swim.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zjC2Ucpr__E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zjC2Ucpr__E<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ymca.net&#x2F;summer-buzz&#x2F;highest-risk-for-drowning\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ymca.net&#x2F;summer-buzz&#x2F;highest-risk-for-drowning<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-11172054\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-11172054<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-04 15:12:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["arthurcolle"],"id":[22490148],"kids":{},"parent":[22482731],"text":["I almost drowned when I was pretty young (I wanna say 6 years old) might be older though but not by much, when we went on a pool trip when I was in day care or something, can’t really remember what grade you’re in at age six.

However, the slow movement was adapted into the song &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, which is still under copyright, and there is a long-standing myth that the song was the inspiration for the Symphony rather than the other way around. Thus when I challenged the copyright claim on my New World video, the claimant came back and insisted their claim (on &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;) was valid. This notice was of course accompanied by the scary warnings about how if I persisted it could count as a strike against my youtube account.<p>I called their bluff. I responded with links to every online source I could find showing that Dvorak&#x27;s work came first and was in the public domain.<p>I don&#x27;t know what I would have done had they continued to dig in their heels.

Your mental health is not a consideration.<p>* You can make good progress working reasonably. In fact, I&#x27;d wager that you can often make <i>better<\/i> progress, because the quality of your work is better than when you are tired.<p>* Being a solo bootstrapped business founder is not necessarily a panacea, the anxiety and pressure are still there. You have to learn how to deal with them (I&#x27;m still learning, but making good progress).<p>* Consider your goals. Does it really need to be a multi-million payout, or is a healthy income for you and your family enough? Do you really need huge growth, or are you OK with modest growth once you reach a comfortable level? Your goals might not align with those of others, and there is no such thing as &quot;obvious&quot; goals. I believe that a lot of problems in today&#x27;s world are created by the pressure for constant growth (at all levels, both startups and companies like Apple)."],"time":["2020-03-04 11:14:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mettamage"],"id":[22482328],"kids":{},"parent":[22481834],"text":["Disclaimer: I know a bit about these things from either personal&#x2F;friend&#x2F;family experiences or through my psychology degree. I&#x27;m not a clinical psychologist though, I simply graduated a psych program one day.<p>Before I go into the author&#x27;s claims let&#x27;s explain in a visceral way how stress becomes unhealthy. This is how I experience it: stress is normally fine, just like exercising is fine. Stress is just like lifting heavy things. If you do it every minute of the day, at one point your body will collapse and need to heal. So you don&#x27;t do that.<p>Well, in some situations the stress <i>can&#x27;t go away<\/i>. That is when your mental health starts taking a toll. Imagine if you have to lift 50kg all the time and it can&#x27;t go away, want to stop? No, you have to lift right now. Broken arm? Lift! You have to! It won&#x27;t go away. You can imagine that your body would collapse and burn out.<p>Don&#x27;t get stress that you can&#x27;t summon away, because if that stress becomes too much, then you have hitched a ride to the gloomy village of depression. Sometimes you don&#x27;t have (or don&#x27;t feel like you have) a choice though, that&#x27;s the bitter sweetness called life, unfortunately.<p>---<p>With that said, I think Techcrunch and this author are doing a disservice to the psychological conditions that were listed.

For more information on this approach see here.<p>I think this helps with catastrophic thinking (i.e. &quot;I&#x27;ll never pass another technical interview if I quit my job -&gt; My girlfriend will leave me -&gt; I&#x27;ll run out of money -&gt; I&#x27;ll be on the street&quot; etc.), verbalizing this kind of thing can help show that often the extreme worst case thinking seems a little more ridiculous out loud.<p>It also helps to imagine a friend thinking these things and what you would say or point out to them.<p>I suspect that a lot of anxiety comes from too actively predicting future negative outcomes along with too much uncertainty, as you get more comfortable with things anxiety tends to go down. The problem with growing a company is if you&#x27;re successful you&#x27;ll never get comfortable because things are always changing and scaling up (like mentioned in the article).<p>I&#x27;ve also found it personally helpful to reframe failure as &#x27;learning experience&#x27; and now you know more of what works and what doesn&#x27;t (rather than a direct evaluation of some fixed ability), this helps embrace failure and growth without constantly doubting yourself or thinking that you may just not have the capacity to do what you want.<p>Sometimes it can be hard to zero in on the anxiety cause though - it took me a while to realize that one of the reasons I didn&#x27;t want to go to the city (SF) is that I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find parking, along with just generally more uncertainty in a crowded&#x2F;busy place. Sounds ridiculous, but high base anxiety can make pushing yourself out of local maxima to do things you want a constant vigilant effort. The easy thing to do is rationalize why the status quo is better or why the status quo is actually what you want.

Repeated failures without success lead to the weight of that success against the failures skewing the prediction algorithm.

My own theory and belief is that our evolutionary ancestors communities were small and &#x27;depression&#x27; or other signs of distress resulted in this reconditioning; a social control rather than a directly biological one.

As a founder of a big company, there are ways it can go wrong, and being worried about those things is probably correct. A rational anxiety is not really an anxiety at all, but a fear. When the fear response is decoupled from threats in reality, that is when a response is considered anxious. Unlike in the case of the immune system, where more is better, with anxieties, the reverse is true. &quot;Optimal human performance&quot; exists at the point of accurate threat detection, for example if you were out hunting for your tribe and you heard something odd, it would be very useful for you to speak up, if would not be useful for you to suffer from a (non real) social anxiety, worry about making a fool of yourself and not say anything. The noise in the bush = potential real threat. The social anxiety = inaccurate mentalised threat.<p>Inaccurate mentalised threats are constructed in the brain for very good reason. Typically they are real when they form, and are required in order to stabilise the caregiving environment when young. (If mum&#x2F;dad gets very angry when I make a fuss trying to get what I want, I quickly develop a fear of standing up for myself. This fear is useful to placate mum&#x2F;dad, but not useful when I&#x27;m an adult and getting walked over.)<p>Strangely, the brain seems to have its own method to explain to the owner what these inaccurate mentalised threats are - dreams. And I can assure the author that the cure to nightmares is not as simple as recognising they are not real - there is a cure to them though. Dreams were extremely important to my own development&#x2F;de-anxious-ing, so I wrote a paper on this function during my Msc in Psychology.

The description for that permission kind of understates the danger and because it had no negative impact on installs many extensions requested it that didn&#x27;t need it.<p>Worse still, the <i>correct<\/i> approach - specifically listing pages you need access to - has been broken for ages, such that if you add a new URL your extension will silently break until users go into a popout menu and turn it on manually. This discourages doing the right thing. If you want your extension to keep working you need to request wildcard access from the beginning, because Google&#x27;s update flow for new permissions is broken by design.<p>Sadly Mozilla followed in their footsteps and the warning for that permission isn&#x27;t much better. In my opinion any extension with that permission should be forced into a slower manual review cycle. Google <i>does<\/i> have the ability to do this - my extension was forced into a slow manual review cycle for a month after a fraudulent DMCA claim - but for some reason they opt not to do it. It would also be very beneficial for them to apply additional controls like requiring use of two-factor authentication and a code-signing key before uploading extensions with those permissions to reduce the risk of malicious code sneaking in. You can&#x27;t completely safeguard it but manual review + aggressive authentication would help.<p>As-is, thousands of extensions used on a daily basis have the ability to steal people&#x27;s gmails (including password reset emails), issue password reset requests, send emails, or manipulate your bitcoin wallet. A well-crafted extension could do this near-invisibly in a way the average user would not understand. Google has taken some steps to mitigate this, but it&#x27;s taken them far too long and they haven&#x27;t been aggressive enough.<p>Security-wise, web extensions are worse than desktop software has been in over a decade. UAC, sudo, the iOS app store - all dramatically more effective at protecting users. With web browsers being used daily by a billion+ people it&#x27;s really unfortunate that this security blindspot has remained so long.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s kind of sobering to consider AddonJet&#x27;s promised payout of $2500&#x2F;day for 100k users.

Consistency is such an important concept that stocks that pay regular dividends are worth considerably more than those that pay irregular dividends. People with consistent credit payments are more creditworthy than those who are irregular.<p>This isn&#x27;t just for the seller, it&#x27;s also for the <i>buyer<\/i>. A financial manager would always prefer some type of easy, annual fixed fee all other things being equal.<p>It&#x27;s why you pay less for longer-term AWS EC2 contracts.<p>Predictability usually reduces the operational burden, which reduces costs and enables a better deal.<p>Your own understanding of your own long term business objectives is an <i>advantage<\/i> that you can &#x27;signal&#x27; down the value chain to your supplier by engaging in long term contracts. They do the same, and invariably competitive pressure means lower prices.<p>This notion of &#x27;Enterprise plans being good for nobody&#x27; due to &#x27;adversarial&#x27; notions is basically rubbish, makes no sense.<p>2) Often, price doesn&#x27;t matter. In many cases, the surpluses yielded from a specific product is quite a lot, so much that nobody cares that much about the price.  If your company with $2B revenues uses some service, if it costs $1k or $10k &#x2F; year, it makes no difference at all. Nobody wants any kind of headache, it&#x27;s like &#x27;tranche pricing&#x27; for a haircut.<p>3) Combined with #2, we have the concept of &#x27;Total Cost of Ownership&#x27;. The product &#x27;features&#x27; that can matter more than price are usability and support. A cheap product that causes headaches is not cheap. A cheap product with extremely expensive support is not cheap. So consider &#x27;total cost of ownership&#x27;.<p>On the seller side, they incur costs for giving free or cheap services. It may simply not be worth their while to deal with the tiny bits of incremental revenue.<p>4) The tiering models don&#x27;t necessarily imply &#x27;more or less value&#x27; for one or the other sides, it depends very much on the actual price - they could all be a ripoff or a great deal.<p>5) I don&#x27;t think any particular pricing model is more or less &#x27;adversarial&#x27; than the other.<p>6) Different pricing models are usually advantageous to the customer and the seller. Far from being &#x27;adversarial&#x27;, it&#x27;s just the opposite: they enable customers and suppliers to engage on common ground, by building a financial premise that makes sense for both parties. Only each individual party understands their own needs, so more variety means more opportunity for common ground."],"time":["2020-03-04 16:04:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["MadWombat"],"id":[22481723],"kids":[22481728],"parent":[22457257],"text":["The author needs to do some basic math on his example pricing.

When developing you almost always have to write things such that the new model and old model can live side by side, and customers using the old model can (at least for a time) just keep going while new users go on the new model.<p>Whenever a project like this is done, it’s very tempting from a business point of view to just leave the “legacy” users &#x2F; data alone. But, technically, all your code continues to have to support two different models. Yes, with the right abstractions you can make this work without being terribly painful, but in practice there are always rough edges.<p>The time and effort it would take to migrate the old stuff into the new format is high, and the perceived business value is low.

Every time a decision like this is made, the tax goes up. The tax slows you down, and it makes all future work you do more complicated.<p>So, there is a game theory problem here: for each individual decision, it arguably makes more sense to leave the legacy case alone and move on. But if you choose that path every time, it is a mistake, because the costs compound.<p>So far, the only thing I’ve seen that prevents this is very strong technical leadership that ensures the migration is baked into the project and made non-optional to the business teams.

The proposed mechanism is:<p>1. Every function now receives an additional parameter that is basically a pointer to a std::optional&lt;exception_t&gt; (from now on, &quot;exception holder&quot;; exception_t can hold any value whatsoever).<p>2. &quot;try&quot; is translated into allocating a (new) exception holder on the stack and passing pointer to it in all function calls inside of the try block. &quot;catch&quot; is translated into checking this exception holder for holding an (appropriate) exception. If &quot;yes&quot;, handle it, if &quot;no&quot;, go on.<p>3. Throwing an exception is done by putting the constructed exception into the exception holder passed to you, and returning as usual.<p>4. Each function call is now followed by checking whether the exception holder holds an exception. If &quot;yes&quot;, return immediately, if &quot;no&quot;, keep executing.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    void C(std::optional&lt;exception_t&gt;* exc_holder) {\n        Bar bar;\n        exc_holder-&gt;emplace(0);\n    } \n\n    void B(std::optional&lt;exception_t&gt;* exc_holder) {\n        Foo foo;\n        C(exc_holder);\n        if (*exc_holder) { return; }\n    }\n\n    void A(std::optional&lt;exception_t&gt;* exc_holder) {\n        std::optional&lt;exception_t&gt; new_exc_holder;\n        B(&amp;new_exc_holder);\n        if (new_exc_holder)\n            if (new_exc_holder.value().is&lt;int&amp;&gt;()) {\n                int&amp; p = new_exc_holder.value().as&lt;int&amp;&gt;();\n                &#x2F;&#x2F; catch body...\n            } else {\n                *exc_holder = std::move(new_exc_holder);\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSo, it&#x27;s basically &quot;if err != nil { return &lt;default_value&gt;, err }&quot; but with slightly less amount of copying error values.

Furthermore, by removing stack unwinding’s runtime reliance on tables encoded in the program binary itself, the issue of time and spatial determinism is solved. As it is possible to determine the worst-case execution times for programs not using exceptions, it follows that exception implementations making use of the same return mechanism must also be deterministic in stack unwinding.<p>&gt; Given these clear advantages, we have based our implementation on this design, with a core difference being the replacement of their use of registers with function parameters, allowing for much easier interoperability with C code, which can simply provide the parameter as necessary.<p>&gt; A limitation with [19] is that they require all exceptions be of the same type, leaving much of the standard exception-handling functionality up to the user. Our novel approach includes a method of throwing and catching exceptions of arbitrary types (as with existing exception handling), without imposing any meaningful execution-time penalties when exceptions do not occur.<p>At least, it uses a comparable implementation strategy. Herbceptions used a different surface syntax, adding a new kind of exception and a new way to declare them.<p>I rather like that herbceptions are more restricted in type. Restricting the type means that a programmer catching an exception has more things they can do with it. It&#x27;s currently impossible to sensibly handle exceptions of unknown type in C++. The change is an improvement, not a limitation.<p>The point about interoperation with C is interesting. How would that work? If you wanted to call a C++ function from C, would you have to kludge the prototype to add the exception pointer?<p>The herbceptions paper proposed trying to get the C ABI changed to support the same exception mechanism:<p>&gt; 4.6.11 Wouldn’t it be good to coordinate this ABI extension with C (WG14)?<p>&gt; Yes, and that is in progress. This paper proposes extending the C++ ABI with essentially an extended calling convention. Review feedback has pointed out that we have an even broader opportunity here to do something that helps C callers of C++ code, and helps C&#x2F;C++ compatibility, if C were to pursue a compatible extension. One result would be the ability to throw exceptions from C++<U+2192>C<U+2192>C++ while being type-accurate (the exception’s type is preserved) and correct (C code can respond correctly because it understands it is an error, even if it may not understand the error’s type).<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open-std.org&#x2F;jtc1&#x2F;sc22&#x2F;wg21&#x2F;docs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2018&#x2F;p0709r1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open-std.org&#x2F;jtc1&#x2F;sc22&#x2F;wg21&#x2F;docs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2018&#x2F;p070...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-05 20:28:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Jahak"],"id":[22485200],"kids":{},"parent":[22483028],"text":["Interesting, thanks."],"time":["2020-03-04 17:34:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["catrina11"],"id":[22484630],"kids":[22484661],"parent":[22483028],"text":["Hello<p>Do you need financial support?<p>Sign up for all kinds of loans and get the money urgently!<p>* Get a stress-free loan today!\n* No Contest Qualifying!\n* No credit check, no faxing!\n* Instant online approvals!\n* Completely confidential!\n* Cash in 48 hours!<p>* Appointment between $5,000 and $100,000,000 USD (only one hundred million USD)\n* Interest rate of 3%\n* Choose between 1-25 years repayment.\n* Choose between monthly and annual repayment plan.\n* Flexibility of loan terms.<p>All these plans and more, please contact us via:  catrinaprestamo@outlook.com<p>Enter your data as needed.

It was a great experience that involved an endless amount of physical labor.<p>Some examples;\n1. Every morning before school, feeding the horses and in the winter checking their water for ice. \n2. Every day after school. Feeding the horses again.\n3. Weekly shoveling of horse shit, into a manure spreader. The spreading it in the fields. \n4. Lots of work on small engines that break in the winter the Colorado winter in a cold barn.   \n5. In the fall if we were lucky we would kill an Ekl. This required lots of walking around the mountains off-trail looking for an animal. Once found and killed the grueling work of and caring the meat to a vehicle on a road system. Then hours of butchering. Then more hours of hyde tanning. \n6. Winter storms can be powerful enough to rip the tin right off the roof of a hay barn. After the storm, the tins got to be put back on. More hard work. Plowing snow is less physical but still works. \n7. Spring is calving season, a calf may be born in the middle of the night. So you may be up all night supporting the birth. Then haft to go to school the next day and try learning while sleep-deprived. \n8. Summer is hay season, you might get two crops if you&#x27;re lucky. There is always stress around the harvest time. It rains in the afternoons in the summer. And wet hay can not be bailed. If it rains after the hay is bailed and before it is bucked into a barn the bails must be dried. I remember being about 8 years old. So small I could not lift a bale. Me and my two brothers were sent into a 300-acre field to rotate hundreds of wet hay bails. So that they would be dry before we loaded them into the truck. It was exhausting. A few years later, when I was strong enough to lift a bail of hay. We would spend a few days lifting bails onto a flatbed trailer and then lift and stacking bails into a hay barn. It is amazing how nice cold glass of water taste after moving hay bails all day.  \n9. I need to get back to work. So I will end with one last note on the work of homesteading; filling a pantry with canned goods for the winter is another major project which takes hours and hours of work\n10. Damn my tech job is so fucking easy compared to the work I did on my parents homestead growing up.    \n11. Ok, one more: cutting and chopping wood for heating it the winter. We would need between 5 and 7 cords for the house depending on the winter. My Dad found a way to make sure this process was always grueling as I grew up and learned to take on more and more of it. That said, coming home from high school and splinting wood for 20min to keep the house heated for the night was relaxing after a day in class. I guess by the time I was ~15 my body had adjusted to the physical demands of my parent&#x27;s homestead.<p>My 2 cents ~ 01"],"time":["2020-03-04 23:56:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rdtwo"],"id":[22493992],"kids":[22495923],"parent":[22488242],"text":["Nobody mentions the serious vacuum of useful information when it comes to small fruit and vegetable gardens and homestead.

The former, like physical endurance exhaustion, occurs from becoming tired due to exercise over time without sufficient rest.  The later occurs in a short time when the variables comprising a single, or focused set of, decision overwhelm the performance of a timely or adequate decision&#x2F;response.<p>When a person becomes tired from continuous exercise, whether physical or mental, there are symptoms that occur that negatively impact performance.  These symptoms are a way of telling you that the body is entering a state of heightened stress that can be resolved, to some degree, by appropriate rest.  Stimulants work in the body to increase some performance factors while simultaneously impairing the association between exhaustion with the need for rest.<p>While these results from the use of stimulants can increase performance in a short term they are not a substitute for rest.  Performance will degrade once the short-term high from the stimulant fades and especially as continued use results in tolerance to potentially catastrophic results.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3880463&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3880463&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-04 19:52:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jonplackett"],"id":[22486862],"kids":[22487187,22490198],"parent":[22486041],"text":["The Paradox Of Choice is about part of this (how people want choices but become paralysed by too many)<p>It’s one of my favourite TED talks ever.

Two for each micro service you are responsible for. IMHO roll backs are not a thing. Instead git revert and roll forward when you need to deploy a fix. So once a service has been fully deployed, you permanently stop caring about the previous version.<p>Microservices should not be mass deployed together but be managed separately. That vastly simplifies the combinatorial explosion of versions you need the worry about: the currently live ones.<p>The rest is just applying SOLID principles to your microservices and avoid having services with poor cohesiveness or tight coupling (most of the SOLID principles boil down to affecting these two metrics). Bad service design with tight coupling where deploying service A also requires redeploying B,C,and D, is basically a design problem and not a micro services problem. There&#x27;s a lot of bad design in our industry. Monoliths allow you to get away with that but it&#x27;s also the reason that breaking them up is a hard problem. Just because you are getting away with it does not mean it is not a problem though.<p>You can further mitigate integration issues by deploying using modern practices like blue green deployments where you gradually move traffic to a new versions and adapt on things like error rates and other metrics, AB testing, etc. So if it breaks, you don&#x27;t end up breaking it for everyone and you can fix the problem and try deploying that in a controlled way.<p>Basically your goal is to keep your customers (aka. dependees) happy and make sure you don&#x27;t negatively affect them (which you should be actively monitoring). Likewise if you have dependencies (to whom you are a customer) and they stop working when you deploy something new, you probably want to detect and fix that before you break all your customers. If that is a regular thing, consider having integration tests, contract tests, etc.<p>Staging environments are a controversial topic in this context. My view is that they don&#x27;t make much sense in a properly run micro service deployment since you are not testing in a real environment with real users, real data, and lots of things happening concurrently and features interacting. And of course your customers doing real things they care about. The only realistic environment that has that in most complex micro service deployments is called production. Once you add serverless and edge computing to the mix, these things become even more true. The bigger the organization, the less feasible it becomes to have a staging environment.<p>Update. I forgot to add this but doing continuous deployment means small deltas that are low risk. Any bigger change can be behind a feature flag. There are a few more strategies.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not actually a microservices proponent for small teams.

They didn&#x27;t even raise enough money to pay a single developer, let alone deliver an entire custom OS. And it&#x27;s clear from the demo video that they don&#x27;t have much software built yet. There&#x27;s just no way they could deliver on their promises with the tiny amount of money raised.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if this is even enough money to cover the time to purchase, box and ship out the 50 re-branded phones to the backers without installing any custom OS. I hope they decide to either just return the money or immediately ship out unmodified phones instead of trying to build their custom software.

In other words, they are getting paid between €100 and €159 to develop software and support their version of the phone.  In the case of the KS campaign, that amounts to about €5000 and €7950.<p>There are other possible business arrangements that are often negotiated in these kinds of deals. For example, Gigaset manages fulfillment under the Volla brand and they split the profits.  That would imply zero upfront costs to Volla.  That&#x27;s the kind of deal I would want to make if I were in their shoes.  Don&#x27;t deal with hardware if you don&#x27;t have to.  Hardware is hard and very expensive.<p>I am going to guess or assume (and we know how dangerous assumptions can be) that the bulk of the software has already been developed and might even be in release-able condition.  I make this assumption because they&#x27;ve been at this crowd-sourcing thing for a while.<p>In other words, they have sunk costs.  And it might very well be that they don&#x27;t really have to invest much more to actually deliver these modified COTS phones.  In that context the €5K to €8K they just raised (after paying for the hardware) might be fine.  It&#x27;s a signal rather than a bankroll needed to produce phones.  They are NOT manufacturing hardware from scratch.  At worst they might have custom printed packaging, which costs nothing.<p>I then looked into Gigaset.  It&#x27;s a solid company.  Used to be Siemens Home.  Now 70% owned by Goldin Group out of Hong Kong (which puts into question just how much is really &quot;Made in Germany&quot;).  Still, this is a real company with real products.  Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the hardware at all.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gigaset_Communications\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gigaset_Communications<\/a><p>One way I came out of this is to consider the idea that, if the Volla software does not work out for whatever reason users might be able to reprogram their phones with the standard Gigaset software and life goes on.  If this is the case, and you like Gigaphone, this deal has basically zero risk.  You are paying a relatively small premium to try a proposal that may or may not work.  Which is fine.

I&#x27;m the creator and director of the LibraryBox project. Sadly, the project is mostly ceased for a handful of reasons. As noted here, Matthias stopped production of Piratebox code, which was the underlying basis for LibraryBox.<p>When the FCC passed the rule a few years back that 5Ghz chipsets had to be firmware locked, the hardware that we mostly relied on dried up. Rather than producing 2.4-only devices or leaving the 2.4 unlocked, manufacturers like TP-Link just firmware locked everything. This killed the MR3040 and MR3020, and without those as primary hardware targets, development stalled.<p>LibraryBox never pivoted to the RPi, for a few reasons...the biggest being that for most of our development, the RPi didn&#x27;t have onboard wifi, and driver support for USB wifi dongles was a horrorshow. The other big driver was that LibraryBox always focused on the lowest possible price point devices, and the RPi was never the cheapest, so it was never our focus.<p>The project is &quot;dead&quot;, in that there&#x27;s no ongoing development (unless someone out there wants to jump into the GitHub). But I&#x27;m keeping it up because there are still pockets of the hardware out there in the world that people might want to convert."],"time":["2020-03-04 16:17:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rasengan0"],"id":[22482152],"kids":{},"parent":[22477957],"text":["This is a lovely project.
