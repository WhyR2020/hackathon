So far they have been allowing a way out on a per-device, per-account basis, [3] so it&#x27;s interesting to see whether they&#x27;ll be willing to close that loophole now, although it seems to be hardly in Google&#x27;s interest and contrary to the very purpose of Android.<p>1. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openhandsetalliance.com&#x2F;oha_members.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openhandsetalliance.com&#x2F;oha_members.html<\/a>\n2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gdsa.com&#x2F;en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gdsa.com&#x2F;en<\/a>\n3. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lineageos.org&#x2F;Google-Play-Certification&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lineageos.org&#x2F;Google-Play-Certification&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-22 12:52:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hilbert42"],"id":[22389171],"kids":[22389484,22389330,22389372],"parent":[22388379],"text":["I wouldn&#x27;t be seen dead using Google&#x27;s GApps on my mobile.

His essay has a hint of despair: that it is impossible to persuade most people, and that the minority of humanity that are open to being persuaded (i.e., to learning something novel) are precisely the kind of people who are too intellectually rigorous to be influenced by rhetoric. Thus, persuasive writing is a waste of time?<p>Not a week goes by where I am persuaded of something that is true, that I had not previously accepted as true because... well... because I had not yet been persuaded.<p>PG isn’t really arguing that persuasion is unimportant. He is trying to persuade us that persuasion, as a rhetorical art, is a fools errand. And to give him credit, he uses the very method of persuasion in his essay that he promotes: unvarnished condensed truth.<p>“People believe whatever they want to believe, so you might as well tell them the truth bluntly, accurately, and simply. Even though they won’t listen to you, you’ll be better off for it. And who knows, if you reach 10 other people it will have been worth it. See the single starfish thrown back into the ocean? It mattered to her.”<p>Having said all that, I’m inclined to agree with PG, because almost no one will change a belief they already hold because of an essay. There’s a good book called “Changing Minds” that explores why people change their beliefs, and very low on a long list is intellectual insight. High on the list is what your peers believe and what beliefs serve your self-interest. It takes a heart of a hero to believe something no one else believes, especially when such a belief requires you to act against your own welfare.<p>The most useful essays are those that change lives. The sweet spot is to attack those areas of life that people tend to not have a formed opinion about. And this is where PG’s genius lives: at the edge of technology, where few live, let alone believe. That’s where he is at his best. I for one would devour and re-devour an essay about privacy, or AGI, or VR, or even about Twitter. Here’s hoping that this is PG’s opening salvo in more essays that are as powerful as this one, but as relevant to startups as his earlier writings.

The line about not being thermonuclear and the description of the device in question (a sphere with lasers) points towards an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device.  Most of the fusion research eggs are in the thermonuclear basket, specifically magnetic confinement fusion.  It is good to research a diverse set of approaches, but there are more engineering challenges to ICF reactors than there are to MCF reactors.  Pulses on the order of 1-2 Hz requires a mechanical system that can cycle out the exhaust and replace the pellet in that time.  Going to reactor scales also requires high load thermal cycles.  MCF ain’t easy, and brings it’s own engineering challenges.  The ones I always hear are things like wall materials and fuel recycling, but these are largely solved or in the process of being solved.  The engineering challenge I see as the most difficult for MCF are related to steady state operation.  Tokamaks have no way of being steady state.  Stellarators do, but now the next problem is wall conditioning.  Wall materials outgas in hot plasma.  A lot.  Like more than the fuel puffed in.  The way this is handled in science machines is with glow discharges of various species: plasma just below the temperature to cause wall sputtering, coating the wall with carbon and boron for their absorptive properties, etc.  No one’s run a steady state hot plasma before, so no one knows if these will be a non issue in reactors.  Keeping the plasma clean may be a challenge to keep the plasma from terminating.  Aside from that MCF is ready for prime time.  It needs a big reactor for scaling laws to make it energy profitable (and potentially money profitable).  We just need some very expensive test reactors to smooth out these issues."],"time":["2020-02-21 16:01:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["detritus"],"id":[22382846],"kids":[22382951,22382894,22383022,22383345,22388525,22385032,22383856,22384253,22382875,22384292,22383390],"parent":[22382618],"text":["This seems.. too good to be true?<p>I don&#x27;t have the Physics chops to untangle the likelihood of this tech and the credibility of the process and its authors, so I&#x27;m hoping the HN crowd will be able to pad out the story behind this.<p>Certainly, from my layperson&#x27;s perspective, their website isn&#x27;t exactly encouraging... <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hb11.energy&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hb11.energy&#x2F;<\/a><p>- ed re: last line - &quot;books and covers, and all that&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-21 14:21:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andreiklochko"],"id":[22384224],"kids":[22384364,22385111,22384857],"parent":[22382618],"text":["To shed a different light on this: think of temperature as walking through mud.

Yes, partly the results of this study are due to increased compute, but I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s only about 50% of the secret sauce. The other 50% is attributable to many very recent developments in the field ML which are gradually coming together in solutions to a range of problems - deep learning, convolutional networks, new architectures (GAN, transformer, RNN, LSTM, autoencoders, etc), regularization techniques, gradient control, hyperparameter optimization...the list is quite long, and every SOTA neural network inevitably incorporates a large proportion of these small steps towards the massive leaps that are being taken in the applied ML space. The concepts of perceptrons and gradient descent may be 50+ years old, but an entire body of theory has been explosively developed in the last decade, such that comparing modern ML to what was being done just a decade ago is akin to the difference between, say, programming theory now and 100 years ago. And for the same reason - just as compute advances enabled development of computer science, so to have recent hardware advances unlocked a new level of machine learning.<p>But I&#x27;d like to point out that, even moreso than software development, very little of the grand breakthroughs we will soon see will be possible without multidisciplinary domain knowledge. It is very difficult to effectively apply ML without a solid technical understanding of the properties of the applied data space, which for real world applications are constrained by physical laws and represented and communicated best by mathematical descriptions. ML engineering is a generalist&#x27;s game - and what we are going to find is that the most successful ML engineers come from broadly applicable, math heavy backgrounds - physics in particular, electrical engineering, to a lesser degree mathematics, etc - because ultimately training a neural network comes down to adequately sampling a problem space and curating data with an intuition which is most ideally developed by the study of mathematics. It is a very general view of the world which is difficult to communicate to someone who is not experienced with higher math.<p>The current wave of applied ML startups will see a high rate of failure - because ML is still being treated as an extension of programming, in the sense that you expect to be able to hire a bunch of pure developers to translate a specialist&#x27;s knowledge into code. But this emerging field is different, the few startups that succeed in the applied ML space will be those that are able to find the rare domain experts who have picked up ML along with their math and science experience. There will effectively emerge two classes of ML engineers with substantially different levels of compensation - the coveted generalists who have cross-pollinated with math heavy disciplines, and the rest."],"time":["2020-02-21 10:03:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lngnmn1"],"id":[22381830],"kids":{},"parent":[22380380],"text":["Why, yes, pattern recognition is what ML really is and should be used for.<p>Aside from pattern recognition everything else is a new astrology, with estimated (straight from one&#x27;s ass) probabilities instead of planets and constellations."],"time":["2020-02-21 10:00:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["ErotemeObelus"],"id":[22380771],"kids":{},"parent":[22380380],"text":["This method might be generalizable to prions."],"time":["2020-02-21 04:41:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["DoreenMichele"],"id":[22380945],"kids":[22381377,22381000],"parent":[22380380],"text":["<i>...in mice.<\/i><p>It would be nice if we spent as much time, money and attention on figuring out prevention.

Under the definition of arms understood at the time of the Constitution (as written by James Madison in Federalist 46), the internet and any digital tools which may be used in the defense of the nation are &quot;arms&quot; and therefore protected by the second amendment.<p>Further, because the internet is ubiquitous in modern society as a means of communication, much more so than letters were at the time of the constitution, the government has no right whatsoever to restrict access or use of the internet. Even if there were a disagreement over this interpretation, there can be no doubt that the general public &#x27;assembles&#x27; and &#x27;petitions&#x27; using the internet. This petition itself is being written on the internet. All this ignores the simple truth that the internet is the most common means of distribution for the press worldwide.<p>Finally, because the federal government has singularly supported, with enormous sums of taxpayer dollars, the internet infrastructure which is now (against the interest of the public, for which the federal government is a trustee) owned by private corporations, all internet infrastructure should be treated as public property, and ISP&#x27;s should act only in a capacity of providing a utility service.<p>In summary - there should be no privatization of internet infrastructure. There should be no government or corporation monitoring anyone&#x27;s use of the internet (without a proper warrant, signed by a judge, on a case-by-case basis). A person&#x27;s digital information should be treated as &#x27;papers&#x27; and &#x27;effects&#x27; as they are considered to be by the general public and by most experts in the subject.

Also our classes aren’t designed to communicate the semantics the Product team is trying to capture, and there’s also no way for Pendo to know that the selector it generated uniquely captures whatever event the user wants - it’s entirely possible that the same selector could occur on a different screen.<p>We’ve been asked to “stabilize” our class names for the product team, so that Pendo doesn’t “break”, but we have resisted as fundamentally this is not what CSS is meant for.

JavaScript has a complicated early history and even though one can use objects as a key value map, it’s not quite a map, in JavaScript. EDN does have the advantage of being a clean implementation of its idea.<p>On a different topic, I’ve read that almost 50% of computer programming work is just building database views and providing GUIs so non-technical people can interact with databases. Making this work easy used to be a major goal of multiple corporate products. One reason VisualBasic had such a devoted following is that it made it so damn easy for novices to build a GUI for a database.<p>In recent years the industry has moved towards HTML as the default way to build an interface for anything on a network, but HTML continues to lag when it comes to forms. You have to use a mountain of JavaScript to get the form functionality of VisualBasic. We’ve actually gone backwards on ease of creating database GUIs. Yes, in theory you can use something like React to build forms, but the dev using VisualBasic would be done with the project while you’re still waiting for npm to finish downloading your dependencies.  And React requires more skill. VisualBasic had a wonderfully gentle learning curve. Likewise, Ruby On Rails (and other frameworks including Symfony and Django) have scaffolding that allows the fast construction of HTML forms, but, again, HTML is a limited method of building forms.<p>I’d love to see Clojure succeed in this space, building corporate GUIs for databases. How to do that? Is a new GUI technology needed? Towards that end I’d love to see EDN used as a config language to define a scaffold for forms. There are elements of Swing that worked well and could be rescued from the larger wreckage of Java GUIs. And JavaFX represents a huge “road not taken” for the whole industry.<p>The tech industry has had eras when it focused on opening the door to beginners. Those eras gave us HyperCard and Flash and VisualBasic. Right now the industry seems to be undergoing an episode of gatekeeping. We are requiring beginners to learn React, which is a big eco-system, and also stuff like Docker, which is tough for beginners. The point of making so much tech mandatory for even simple projects inevitably keeps some people from discovering the joy of programming.<p>Clojure is the most fun language that I ever worked with, and it’s conceptually simple and it has EDN as a data literal language, all of which is a kindness for beginners.

These employer premiums are equivalent to a 12.29% tax on payroll exceeding the first $2 million... Therefore, any payroll tax less than 12.29%, our upper bound in the SHIFT interface, would result in savings for employers.<p>This excerpt makes it glaringly obvious that no economists were consulted when writing this paper. Checking the list of authors confirms this. While they may be experts in public health, they&#x27;re making one of the most elementary errors in Econ 101. That is they&#x27;re assuming that a private expenditure (employer provided healthcare insurance) can be transformed into a public tax with no loss of efficiency.<p>Deadweight loss[1] is the very first consideration in tax policy analysis. The reason it exists is very simple. Private actors have an incentive to minimize taxes in a way they do not with private expenditures. If you cut your company&#x27;s health insurance plan, your employees will be unhappy and you&#x27;ll either lose workers or have to raise compensation in other forms. If you restructure your company to avoid payroll taxes, your employees still enjoy the same access to single-payer healthcare.<p>Many M4A advocates try to hand-wave away this problem. It&#x27;s the equivalent of declaring &quot;Then a miracle occurs&quot;. In this case the authors assume that the current employer-paid premiums are equivalent to replacing with a uniform payroll tax matching this aggregate. While 12.29% is the <i>average<\/i> across the entire economy, there&#x27;s still wide variance between employers. Approximately half of employers are currently paying less than this. A significant proportion are paying substantially less than this.<p>If the current system was replaced with a uniform payroll tax, the cost of labor for employers falling into this category will rise. In response that means those employers will lower their demand for labor, which results in either both economy-wide reductions in employment, wages and ultimately investment and GDP. Those results will mean that not only will the hypothetical new payroll tax not raise the revenue the authors are projecting, but current pre-existing taxes, like income and capital gains, will also see revenue shortfalls relative to baseline.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deadweight_loss#Tax\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deadweight_loss#Tax<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-21 22:36:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["threeseed"],"id":[22386779],"kids":[22386806,22386924,22386802],"parent":[22386440],"text":["Pretty disingenuous study.<p>If you move to a Medicare for All policy it would shift employer health care costs to the government.

I am thinking in such things like parallel backtracking and optimization algorithms for robotic control or board games, for example.<p>However, threads are notoriously difficult to handle cleanly and safely in larger programs. Here, Clojure (which in my eyes is a very Scheme-like Lisp) offers a very elegant solution with its concurrency primitives of Futures, Atoms, Agents, and STM. After some experimenting, I believe they are very, very attractive for many concurrent server tasks (like a web server), but not that well suited for computing-intensive parallel algorithms like the ones I mentioned above, which I am highly interested in.  Part of the reasons are that such algorithms can become quite GC-heavy. Also, the Clojure compiler has limits on how much primitive types can be passed as parameters in one functions. This means that a complex backtracking algorithm in Clojure can still be two orders of magnitude slower than in C (which is somewhat disappointing, but one has to remember that Clojure was not designed for this).<p>Racket has had, so far, only limited concurrency capabilities. It had Futures, however they could easily become blocked by GC. It also has Places, which are a very safe and clean solution of splitting parallel computations into separate processes. However, I think that places are not the first choice for heavily parallel algorithms with strong interdependencies.<p>Now, Racket can run on top of Chez, and Chez has fine-grained concurrency capabilities on top of pthreads, which seem to be on par with Common Lisp. Also, Racket has strong support for functional and side-effect free programming, including some data structures. In my impression, this seems to open a wide range of new possibilities, including providing look-alike primitives for Clojure&#x27;s Futures, Agents, and Atoms.

Their contention that EM fungi store more carbon than AM fungi, for example, is dubious, but I’ll have to dig into the source paper to see their citations.<p>The realty is both AMF and EMF will sequester carbon. AMF for example produce a substance called glomalin which is a carbon store and soil glue basically, but in soils where mycorrhizal fungi are present, glomalin alone can make up up to 30% of the soil carbon. And glomalin effectively only comes from AMF (from the genus Glomus). Hence my hesitation to accept that EMF are responsible for more carbon sequestration than AMF.<p>Besides that nitpicking, it’s great to hear this dataset is now available tho because, amongst other things, it’ll be incredibly useful for helping predict good matches between mycorrhizal inoculant and any particular ecosystem of interest.

Though generally with purely physics based solutions, you quickly run into exponentially growing simulation time scales as well as a lack of accuracy due to a currently insufficient understanding of molecular mechanics.<p>The other approach has been to take the problem and look at it purely as a translation problem, ignoring simulation of intermediary steps, to go directly from sequence to folded protein target.<p>With the advent of deep learning and a massive repository of data from an existing Protein Data Bank (PDB) et al., this approach has become increasingly popular, and for protein structure competitions like CASP, has quickly become state of the art within the field.

The Cedar language is a superset of Mesa, the\nmajor additions being garbage collection and runtime types. Neither the language nor the\nenvironment was originally intended to be portable, and for many years ran only on D-machines\nat PARC and a few other locations in Xerox. We recently re-implemented the language to make\nit portable across many different architectures. Our strategy was, first, to use machine dependent C code as an intermediate language, second, to create a language-independent\nlayer known as the Portable Common Runtime, and third, to write a relatively large amount of\nCedar-specific runtime code in a subset of Cedar itself. By treating C as an intermediate code\nwe are able to achieve reasonably fast compilation, very good eventual machine code, and all\nwith relatively small programmer effort. Because Cedar is a much richer language than C, there\nwere numerous issues to resolve in performing an efficient translation and in providing\nreasonable debugging. These strategies will be of use to many other porters of high-level\nlanguages who may wish to use C as an assembler language without giving up either ease of\ndebugging or high performance. We present a brief description of the Cedar language, our\nportability strategy for the compiler and runtime, our manner of making connections to other\nlanguages and the Unix operating system, and some measures of the performance of our\n&quot;Portable Cedar&quot;.<p>PCR implemented threads in user space as virtual lightweight processes on SunOS by running several heavy weight Unix processes memory mapping the same main memory. And it also supported garbage collection. Mark Weiser worked on both PCR and the Boehm–Demers–Weiser garbage collector.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boehm_garbage_collector\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boehm_garbage_collector<\/a><p>This is the 1988 &quot;Garbage Collection in an Uncooperative Environment&quot; paper by Hans-Juergen Boehm and Mark Weiser:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hboehm.info&#x2F;spe_gc_paper&#x2F;preprint.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hboehm.info&#x2F;spe_gc_paper&#x2F;preprint.pdf<\/a><p>&gt;Similarly, we treat any data inside the objects as potential pointers, to be followed\nif they, in turn, point to valid data objects.

When you own a financial instrument with great upside it means it also carries a lot of risk. So, according to some, profiting from high interest rates is dandy but when it&#x27;s time to pay the piper (your borrower made YOUR risk materialise) they don&#x27;t want to get bankrupt, just transfer back the risk you took in the form of debt.<p>And of course the loaned money is not used to re-invigorate the local economy. It is going back into the French &amp; German economies because the local economy of Greece is destroyed and their companies go in and undercut the local competition. e.g That&#x27;s how shit-show supermarket chains like LIDL wiped out of existence very solid Greek supermarket chains that existed and were profitable for multiple decades before the financial crisis, but then had to do mergers or shut-down.\nGenius plan. And that&#x27;s why Greece didn&#x27;t <i>deceive<\/i> anybody to get into the Eurozone - the members just looked the other way.<p>The Greeks should have had defaulted and let the creditors who where profiting all those years from junk bonds (because that&#x27;s what Greek government bonds were) take the hit.
