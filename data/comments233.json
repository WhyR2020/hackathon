Life in America has become, increasingly, reliant on it. “Food and water has become food and water and electricity,” as one D.O.E. career staffer put it. Back in 2013 there had been an incident in California that got everyone’s attention. Late one night, just southeast of San Jose, at Pacific Gas and Electric’s Metcalf substation, a well-informed sniper, using a .30-caliber rifle, had taken out 17 transformers. Someone had also cut the cables that enabled communication to and from the substation. <i>“They knew exactly what lines to cut,” said Tarak Shah, who studied the incident for the D.O.E. “They knew exactly where to shoot. They knew exactly which manhole covers were relevant—where the communication lines were. These were feeder stations to Apple and Google.”<\/i> There had been enough backup power in the area that no one noticed the outage, and the incident came and went quickly from the news. But, Shah said, “for us it was a wake-up call.” In 2016 the D.O.E. counted half a million cyber-intrusions into various parts of the U.S. electrical grid. “It’s one thing to put your head in the sand for climate change—it’s like mañana,” says Ali Zaidi, who served in the White House as Obama’s senior adviser on energy policy. <i>“This is here and now. We actually don’t have a transformer reserve. They’re like these million-dollar things. Seventeen transformers getting shot up in California is not like, Oh, we’ll just fix the problem. Our electric-grid assets are growingly vulnerable.”<\/i><p>&gt; In his briefings on the electrical grid MacWilliams made a specific point and a more general one. The specific point was that we don’t actually have a national grid. Our electricity is supplied by a patchwork of not terribly innovative or imaginatively managed regional utilities. The federal government offers the only hope of a coordinated, intelligent response to threats to the system: there is no private-sector mechanism. To that end the D.O.E. had begun to gather the executives of the utility companies, to educate them about the threats they face. “They all sort of said, ‘But is this really real?’ ” said MacWilliams. “You get them security clearance for a day and tell them about the attacks and all of a sudden you see their eyes go really wide.”<p><i>Edit<\/i><p><i>Personal Interpretation:<\/i> Someone hired highly trained mercenaries (?) to operate on US soil to test destroying critical infrastructure that led directly to Apple + Google. Large, stationary, expensive infrastructure that is lacking in redundancy.<p>They knew exactly what targets to hit. It follows that they knew that there was backup capacity in the system. This was a test run. And bullets are cheap.<p>What if instead of one team for one location, it had been three teams for three locations? Or, four? Five? Six?

This means that the data you operate on intrinsically consist of many timestamped data points. It&#x27;s easy to apply an operation to each point of the data, and it&#x27;s also easy to apply operations on a rolling window, or on successive points. This makes the language have the feel of an array-based language, but even better because the elements are timestamped and the array can be sparse.<p>Furthermore the presence of fields in each data point adds more dimensions to the level of aggregation (not just the inherent time-based). Now the language has the feel of a native multi-dimensional array language. It feels amazing to program in it.

My team&#x27;s job was to let the contracts for developing plans for new&#x2F;improved national roads across England.<p>The Algorithm: roads cost a lot of money to build; every proposed route had to demonstrate significant value for money through a cost-benefit analysis for each project, considering a number of different detailed options for the new or improved road. One of the main costs was how much money needed to be spent on buying and securing the land, and compensating the owners for loss of business, etc. In cities and towns, this favoured putting bypasses through the poorer parts of the (sub)urban environment. In more rural areas it favoured routing roads through less productive farmland. The least productive land was land that wasn&#x27;t being farmed or mined. Routes put through these areas would be given an acquisition cost of £0&#x2F;meter[1]<p>... Which is why in 1993 the Government settled on developing an improvement scheme for the A303 which put a new double-lane carriageway straight through the middle of Stonehenge.<p>The proposal didn&#x27;t go down too well. 30 years - and several administrations - later, the Government is still trying to get the proposal through planning[2]<p>[1] - Though in fact highway lengths were still measured in &#x27;chains&#x27; and &#x27;links&#x27; back in the early 1990s: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chain_(unit)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chain_(unit)<\/a><p>[2] - Current proposal for the project: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.highwaysengland.co.uk&#x2F;roads&#x2F;road-projects&#x2F;A303+Stonehenge&#x2F;Environmental+Non+Technical+Summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.highwaysengland.co.uk&#x2F;roads&#x2F;road-projects&#x2F;A30...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 15:08:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["KingMachiavelli"],"id":[24314374],"kids":[24314870,24315379,24315777,24316781,24324333,24314892,24316469,24316959],"parent":[24313825],"text":["As some others have mentioned, I don&#x27;t think that induced demand or the failure to prevent congestion are failings of the model itself. A congested 5 lane road still has a higher throughput than a congested 2 lane road.<p>However, the largest problem I see which the article briefly touches on is the failure to even consider building something  besides a freeway. A `correct` model should be screaming to build public transport.<p>However, consider the following circumstances:<p>1. As it is many people are forced to have a car even if public transport can serve their main commute but often public transport is more expensive than the marginal cost of driving a vehicle (i.e gas + upkeep) so they choose to drive unless the congestion is extreme (i.e one of the worst commutes in the US).<p>2. Even if public transport is pretty decent (commute + groceries), they just happen to already have a car because their previous location did not have public transport. So we are back at #1. Or I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll move in a year or two so might as well keep the car.<p>3. OR now that I have a car , I would probably not want to have to pay for expensive parking (&amp; housing) in an area with public transport plus now I&#x27;ll have to pay a mechanic a premium to even change the oil. So instead I live further away thus reinforcing the need to keep the car.<p>4 &amp; etc. I need to travel &gt;50 miles (skiing, hiking), renting is a pain and long trip ride sharing is expensive. Groceries are easier to do with a car especially when buying in bulk (Although, if&#x2F;when I can get Costco delivered same or 2-day with perishables at &lt;=10% premium, then this is a moot point).<p>Cars are pretty (at least marginally or per mile) cheap in America and we do a very poor job making the alternatives attractive if not impossible. Anyone who has a car seems to drive it even if public transport could be used (again outside of super specific commutes in a few cities). Until we can either make car ownership&#x2F;use more expensive or greatly increase the practicality of not having a car at all, anticipate having a car and being stuck in traffic at least part of the time."],"time":["2020-08-29 09:27:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nicolaskruchten"],"id":[24315831],"kids":{},"parent":[24313825],"text":["I broadly agree with the article, but one point where it falls short is that it doesn&#x27;t mention that the 4 stages of the model can be (and sometimes even are!) iterated in various ways to account for the way real people actually behave: modellers in the 21st century aren&#x27;t quite as naive as all that (and probably the ones in the 50s weren&#x27;t either but they had less data&#x2F;computer power).<p>For reference, the four stages go like this: you start with &quot;trip supply and demand&quot; by zone, then inter-zone trips are generated by matching those up, then mode choice is computed per trip based on cost and travel time priors, then assignment to the network which results in actual trips and computed travel times based on route selection and congestion.<p>The travel times can then be fed back into mode-choice and iterated on: people will make the transit-vs-car choice differently based on the relative costs (in time and money and inconvenience) so iterating the last two steps can go a ways towards modelling that equilibrium.<p>Folks can exert some amount of choice around which trips they make (as mentioned in the article) and where they work, based on how easy it is to get there, so feeding the travel costs back into trip-generation can account for some of that, and over a longer horizon, both workers and employers can exert some control over where they live&#x2F;site their facilities, so all 4 stages can be iterated as well.<p>None of this is perfect, and it&#x27;s not always done, and the rest of the article&#x27;s points stand, but I just wanted to say the modelling is not all that primitive :)<p>Edit: I studied this stuff in university 15 years ago with Professor Eric Miller, who wrote this book on how to integrate all this stuff in an iterative way... <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11067-005-2630-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11067-005-2630-5<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 15:10:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["massysett"],"id":[24315574],"kids":[24320752,24320178,24317017],"parent":[24313825],"text":["Ironically this article exposes the fallacy of “induced demand.” Proponents of this mindset, such as the author of this article, claim that more lanes inevitably lead to more traffic.

The idea was subject to criticsm, though not directly from inside the field of psychometrics itself (which is usually a big red flag):<p><i>Other criticisms<\/i><p><i>Perhaps the most famous critique of the construct of g is that of the paleontologist and biologist Stephen Jay Gould, presented in his 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man. He argued that psychometricians have fallaciously reified the g factor as a physical thing in the brain, even though it is simply the product of statistical calculations (i.e., factor analysis). He further noted that it is possible to produce factor solutions of cognitive test data that do not contain a g factor yet explain the same amount of information as solutions that yield a g. According to Gould, there is no rationale for preferring one factor solution to another, and factor analysis therefore does not lend support to the existence of an entity like g. More generally, Gould criticized the g theory for abstracting intelligence as a single entity and for ranking people &quot;in a single series of worthiness&quot;, arguing that such rankings are used to justify the oppression of disadvantaged groups.[61][176]<\/i><p><i>Many researchers have criticized Gould&#x27;s arguments. For example, they have rejected the accusation of reification, maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as g as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences. Critics have also suggested that Gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis, and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field. While different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests, solutions that yield a g factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis, including the phenomenon of the positive manifold, the fact that the same g can emerge from quite different test batteries, the widespread practical validity of g, and the linkage of g to many biological variables.[61][62][177]<\/i><p><i>John Horn and John McArdle have argued that the modern g theory, as espoused by, for example, Arthur Jensen, is unfalsifiable, because the existence of a common factor like g follows tautologically from positive correlations among tests. They contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of g with Spearman&#x27;s original two-factor theory which was readily falsifiable (and indeed was falsified).[30]<\/i><p><i>Joseph Graves Jr. and Amanda Johnson have argued that g &quot;...is to the psychometricians what Huygens&#x27; ether was to early physicists: a nonentity taken as an article of faith instead of one in need of verification by real data.&quot;[178] <\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;G_factor_(psychometrics)#Other_criticisms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;G_factor_(psychometrics)#Other...<\/a><p>Note in particular: &quot;<i>solutions that yield a g factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis<\/i>&quot;."],"time":["2020-08-29 15:17:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rishav_sharan"],"id":[24318228],"kids":[24319009,24319099],"parent":[24302395],"text":["Arangodb has always been the db that I always keep checking back every few months.

Maybe the smart people reading this comment section would have some ideas.<p>It is frequently more efficient to perform energy minimizations of molecules in a basis of &quot;internal coordinates&quot;, in which parameters such as the distance between bonded atoms, the angle formed by three sequentially-bonded atoms, and the dihedral angle[0] formed by four sequentially bonded atoms are used as a coordinate system for minimization. This coordinate system is a lot more complex than the more natural Cartesian coordinate system, but it&#x27;s more efficient for large molecules because you can e.g. twist a molecule along some central bond without screwing up the bond distances on the far ends of the molecule. Implementing optimization using internal coordinates is not entirely trivial, as the manifold of physically-meaningful internal coordinates is not flat, and internal coordinates tend to be over-specified, but it is often worth implementing despite the complexity.<p>Anyway, one major problem with this approach is that if three sequentially-bonded atoms ever become collinear (which admittedly is not super common, but it&#x27;s common enough that we have to consider it), the Jacobian of that angle relative to the Cartesian coordinate system becomes ill-defined (because it is physically impossible to increase the angle, and the angle will decrease if any of the atoms moves in any direction orthogonal to the line that the 3 atoms lie on). Worse, any dihedral angle involving those 3 atoms becomes ill-defined, and if a structure passes through a configuration where the 3 atoms are collinear, the dihedral angle will discontinuously change by 180 degrees.<p>This causes all sorts of problems during energy minimization. The standard way to &quot;solve&quot; this problem is to define &quot;dummy atoms&quot;, fictitious sites that are only used to construct well-defined bending and dihedral angles. But to prevent the dummy atom from &quot;drifting away&quot; since no real forces are acting on it (and to counteract the creation of 3 physically meaningless degrees of freedom), it becomes necessary to add constraints. So now we&#x27;ve turned an unconstrained minimization in a non-euclidean coordinate system to a constrained minimization in a non-euclidean coordinate system. And it&#x27;s very ambiguous where the best place to put this &quot;dummy atom&quot; is, or how to define its constraints. And what happens if <i>4<\/i> atoms become collinear? Moreover, this is usually done manually, using &quot;chemical intuition&quot;, and I am interested in writing code that works automatically for high-throughput applications where it would be infeasible to manually define dummy atoms.<p>My hope was that there would be some way to augment the traditional definition of the dihedral angle to avoid this singularity&#x2F;discontinuity, but my attempts at implementing this failed to improve upon anything. My current approach tries to automatically add these dummy atoms, but I find that this has a tendency to make optimization performance drastically worse (presumably due to the sudden addition of constraints).<p>This problem has been on the backburner for some time now, but I would like to engineer some sort of solution that is more consistent and performant than my current approach, while still being entirely automated, without needing any &quot;chemical intuition&quot;.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dihedral_angle#In_stereochemistry\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dihedral_angle#In_stereochemis...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 08:38:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["peter_d_sherman"],"id":[24318641],"kids":{},"parent":[24313728],"text":["&gt;&quot;Generalizing to N-dimensions<p>To generalize this solution to higher dimensions we need two things:<p>A way to represent rotations.

They basically have no need for DevOps, because they have no need to provide fast-moving, competitive products, and silos are a natural fit in a world of sensitive financial information.

It might be possible to fly planes fuelled by hydrogen or ammonia, but many of the planes currently flying today should still be flying in 2050 -- not necessarily a bad thing because building an airplane isn&#x27;t exactly low-impact.

That&#x27;s the situation when often the most savvy move is to disengage from a person who doesn&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; and look to how you can protect yourself. Selfishly speaking, giving advice at work can go bad for you several ways. Maybe they hear your advice, but now you&#x27;re getting involved and taking responsibility for a sinking situation that might not be your problem to deal with. Maybe they bristle at being told what to do and you damage the relationship without actually helping. Maybe there is a personal component to the situation (one that you, a coworker will never get to learn about) and your advice will come off as incredibly tone deaf and clueless. Maybe it&#x27;s in your interest to let your competition fail so you look all the better. And for the record, while I think this is a common attitude, I will always be grateful for advice at work and will put myself at political risk if I think I can really help another person. Life is too short to treat others like shit.<p>In the personal world where we love our family and our friends, you&#x27;re damn right I&#x27;m going to give advice.

At the time Knuth&#x27;s LR parsers took prohibitive amounts of time and memory to construct. LALR fixed that by discarding the look ahead.  It made the problem of automatically building a LALR parser from a grammar tractable, but limited the grammars that could be used so much you had to really work to get a working grammar for a real language.<p>That&#x27;s all changed.  LR parsers written (eg <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lrparsing.sourceforge.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lrparsing.sourceforge.net&#x2F;<\/a> can compile grammars) in a reasonable amount of time, and its written in an interpreted language.  The Python parser it creates can process input in about 25us per token, which isn&#x27;t too shabby.  It doesn&#x27;t insist you write productions directly, but rather has a more succinct language that compiles to productions.  This language has the same &quot;power&quot; (it, can parse the exact same class of languages as BNF), but handles most of the things people struggle with when using raw LR productions - like lists, associativity and precedence.  And, the old clumsy error messages that required a PhD in computer parsing are gone, replaced by messages most people can understand.<p>LL parsers aren&#x27;t are powerful as LR (meaning the can recognise less real world languages).  But, and it&#x27;s a big but, a human can hand code a LL parser for a language whereas noone in their right mind would manually construct a LR parser by hand.  The hand written LL parsers are usually called recursive descent parsers.  Because they are hand written the humans writing them can cheat.  They can look ahead an arbitrary number of symbols, they can collate and refer to information a LL or LR grammar can&#x27;t use, like types.  The result is they can more than make up in the difference in power between LL and LR.  But it comes at a cost.  The cost is mixing of concerns.  Your parsing, type, macro, and generation code gets intertwined.<p>Still in my view LL and LR parsers win the day.  They both take a fixed and and very small time to process each token, and also fixed and very small amount of memory.  The language they recognise is always well defined, by with I mean if there default action if they don&#x27;t know what language is to stop, whinge and refuse to produce a parser.  Whereas parsing techniques plough on anyway.  God know what language they are recognising if you get it wrong."],"time":["2020-08-30 02:16:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["avmich"],"id":[24321565],"kids":{},"parent":[24303419],"text":["Tomita isn&#x27;t mentioned :( .

It was demand #2 on their initial emails to Apple from Tim Sweeney [1].<p>&gt; <i>Because of restrictions imposed by Apple, Epic is unable to provide consumers with certain features in our iOS apps. We would like to offer consumers the following features:<\/i><p>&gt; <i>1) Competing payment processing options other than Apple payments, without Apple’s fees, in Fortnite and other Epic Games software distributed through the iOS App Store;<\/i><p>&gt; <i>2) A competing Epic Games Store app available through the iOS App Store and through direct installation that has equal access to underlying operating system features for software installation and update as the iOS App Store itself has, including the ability to install and update software as seamlessly as the iOS App Store experience.<\/i><p>&gt; <i>If Epic were allowed to provide these options to iOS device users, consumers would have an opportunity to pay less for digital products and developers would earn more from their sales. Epic is requesting that Apple agree in principle to permit Epic to roll out these options for the benefit of all iOS customers. We hope that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers in order to make software sales and distribution on the iOS platform as open and competitive as it is on personal computers.<\/i><p>Apple&#x27;s official statement [2]:<p>&gt; <i>We are disappointed that we have had to terminate the Epic Games account on the App Store. We have worked with the team at Epic Games for many years on their launches and releases. The court recommended that Epic comply with the App Store guidelines while their case moves forward, guidelines they’ve followed for the past decade until they created this situation. Epic has refused. Instead they repeatedly submit Fortnite updates designed to violate the guidelines of the App Store. This is not fair to all other developers on the App Store and is putting customers in the middle of their fight.

There are few exceptions and discussions under blockchain-related posts are the a prime example. I will disclose right away that I wholeheartedly think that blockchains are here to stay and to solve many problems. The general sentiment on HN, and this thread so far is an example, seems to be animosity toward the idea in general lightly veiled by pretext of pointing out technical challenges (which are numerous, I do not think the most ardent blockchain proponent will deny). Every time I try to point some great ability of &quot;smart contracts&quot; in return I hear blanket unthoughtful responses like &quot;well how is it better than a database&quot; or &quot;how is it better than a REST call&quot; (for example this exchange about the Baseline protocol <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23824584\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23824584<\/a>).<p>Perhaps starting with a general accusation of the community is not the best method. But I&#x27;ll move on... There are things that are very important to understand about blockchain. The most important one is that the technology and the systems built on it are _extremely_ young. Blockchain is like the 80s of computing. I would compare it to editing Unix system settings with &quot;nano&quot; to adjust a basic setting of your operating system - lots of horror stories for sure. The big difference is that people are out there to make money off of your mistakes. Yes, it can be a hostile environment. As the article alludes to - full anonymity of transactions is still in the pipeline! I do no know a single blockchain project out there that allows to interact with contracts anonymously yet. If blockchain is still alive a few years from now (and I have little doubt about that) then things like Optimism (mentioned in the article) will have made a whole array of shortcomings obsolete. Awesomeness does not happen overnight, it took _decades_ for the internet to become the ubiquitous integral thing that it is now.<p>Actually, I&#x27;m glad the author used Uniswap as an example, because it is a simple and powerful system that would not have been possible without blockchain. (Aside: Uniswap is actually one of the first products to create a POC of running on top of Optimism&#x27;s Optimistic rollups, so they are no unaware of issues). It was conceived initially by Vitalik himself and implemented as an Ethereum grant. The basic idea is that a contract controls two pools of tokenized assets. The assets are provided by people who get a cut when a trade happens. The price of assets being exchanged is equal to the ratio of their quantities in every pool. That is it!!<p>Now, why do I think that a system as Uniswap is awesome. Right now most tokens are either tokens for other projects or USD. As the variety of tokenized assets grows (for example some Japanese banks are looking to create a digital Yen, and there are clues that suggest it might be on Ethereum) what you get is an extremely simple no-middlemen system for exchanging things of value. Now, in theory, any programmer can write a program, say, for currency exchange in one evening - no middlemen, no 3rd parties to trust, no banks, no clearing houses and a basic API anybody can integrate. The system is not perfect, and that&#x27;s what the article is about. But the concept can be revolutionary.<p>The blockchain money-grab is disgusting to look at.

Their 1080p video quality is god-awful compared to Amazon. They may even have made it worse: from the &quot;ladder&quot; comparisons, it looks like they jump to higher resolutions at lower average bitrates now, so if you&#x27;re stuck at 1080p you&#x27;re going to be getting worse quality after these changes than before.<p>Also, something that&#x27;s kind of weird about all this is that encoders (x264, x265, etc) already have their own rate control algorithms that decide on a frame or scene basis how many bits to use. Netflix taking an approach like this is equivalent to claiming that they&#x27;re capable of doing a better job than these codecs in an automated way - so why not just contribute the code needed to achieve these improvements back to the projects they&#x27;re using?<p>Last, it&#x27;s very weird to select individual frames from an encode and not a selection of frames. The comparisons purport to show that the lower bitrate encode is better than the higher bitrate encode, but in fact (if I understand how they&#x27;re using rate control correctly) what they are showing is <i>a single frame<\/i> in the lower bitrate encode that uses <i>more bits<\/i> than the same frame in the higher bitrate encode. So it&#x27;s arguably not a fair comparison. And even with that, depending on how sensitive you are to artifacts, some of the &quot;optimized ladder&quot; encodes still look worse.<p>Edit: here is an example of what I mean when I said that they may have made the quality at 1080p worse. If what you end up watching is the highest bitrate 1080p available, you would get higher quality on the old latter than on the newer one. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;rzPR7Sh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;rzPR7Sh.jpg<\/a> Actually, on some of the examples, even 720p on the older ladder is better than 1080p on the newer one!"],"time":["2020-08-29 02:25:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["radley"],"id":[24311173],"kids":[24311353,24311258,24311483,24311699,24311265,24312529,24314768,24321691],"parent":[24310104],"text":["&gt; Sometimes we ingest a title that would need more bits at the highest end of the quality spectrum — even higher than the 16 Mbps limit of the fixed-bitrate ladder.<p>From just a cursory inspection using my Apple TV 4K, 12 Mbps is their target bitrate but their ceiling was ~16 Mbps.<p>That&#x27;s still only a third of what AppleTV+ offers (36&#x2F;48) and only 2&#x2F;3 of Disney+ (18&#x2F;24).
