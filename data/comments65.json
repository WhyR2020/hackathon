The speed-of-light in a medium depends on its relative dielectric constant K of the insulator material. For standard SiO2, it&#x27;s approximately 4, giving a speed of 0.5c, or only 15 centimeters per nanosecond (coincidentally, a typical circuit board has roughly the same dielectric constant, even coax, CAT-6, or fiber optics cables are not far off from it, 15 cm&#x2F;s is an useful number to remember).<p>In the history of process node improvements, various doping techniques have been developed for decreasing (or increasing) the K for better performance.

Take France for example, people used to pay around $10&#x2F;GB not so long ago. A new player came on the market and yes, didn&#x27;t have the same quality of service at first, but clearly cut the price and now a GB is 10x cheaper. Better, they now provide unlimited data for ~20$&#x2F;month (!!). As some have also mentioned, unlimited is something clearly missing as it can make the price&#x2F;GB completely meaningless in some cases. I currently live in Georgia and at the moment there are plans for ~1.5$&#x2F;week for truly unlimited data - speed is also great with ~50-100mbps and I live in a metropolitan, dense area.<p>A last point is roaming.

Sometimes even better as it gives me the ability to switch between networks when coverage is low.<p>I know from friends who have been working in the industry that, prior the shake in France, carriers used to sit back and relax while making tremendous profits.

Solo founders are most often devs, which means they focus 90% of their energy on dev and what little remains on marketing. Unfortunately this is a easy trap to fall into and you should invest equal if not more time doing&#x2F;learning SEO, content marketing (which you&#x27;ve done here very successfully btw) and building an audience.<p>2. Making a product without any user feedback. You work 1 year on a product and realize people don&#x27;t get your idea. That&#x27;s why it is essential to get feedback every step of the way and your spouse doesn&#x27;t count :D<p>3. The good news is being a solo founder is no longer very unique thing. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are doing this and hang out on online communities like indiehackers, makerlog, etc.<p>4. After trying out hundred tools I&#x27;ve found that nothing beats trello. To each his own though but you really need a todo tool when working alone to keep on track. I&#x27;ve actually written a local trello for myself with one twist - the tool assigns me a task daily and as soon as mark it as complete it assigns me the next item from the list.

Life is not easy, so you should treat yourself well :) I spent time building scripts to make dev &amp; ops easy. I rented a WeWork desk (first 6 months), then upgraded to a private office (2 years), then moved out wework (recent 6 months, due to covid-19). I bought SaaS products from other companies - I like spending money to save time.<p>2, Make it easy for others to contact myself. I put my contact on every page of my website [1]. The happiest moment of my day is always the time when I talk to inbound emails from some strangers. Yes, there will be trolls, but most people are nice &amp; with good intention. Nowadays, I spend at least 1&#x2F;3 of my time reply emails everyday.<p>3, Share progress on the Internet. I write a monthly email newsletter to report my progress [2] and some blogs to share my experience &amp; thoughts [3], which help me make some friends on the Internet :)<p>4, Meet people offline. Quite a few of my former coworkers are doing startups now. We hanged out a lot pre-COVID-19.<p>5, Unfollow some people on social media (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook…) and avoid seeing news from TechCrunch and other unhealthy VC-focused online media.

The hardest part of persisting is the emotional game. Improve your motivation by doing things in a way that even a failure of your primary business goal still leaves you in a better position career&#x2F;skill-wise than when you started. Also: figure out how to separate your identity from your business, otherwise every tiny failure or criticism will sap your energy.<p>2. For many — maybe most — products within reach of a solo founder, marketing will take up at least as much time as development. Unlike programming, marketing is shrouded in something not unlike the fog of war in RTS games. It is highly exploratory and experimental in nature. But dealing with this uncertainty carries its own intellectual appeal, one that you can learn to embrace — or even enjoy.<p>3. Outsource as much as can. If some work can be done for less than your hourly rate as a freelancer, then, overall you&#x27;re more efficient to code for $$$ then pay someone to handle that part of your business.<p>4. The technical skills that are most useful to a solo founder are more to do with system design than programming languages and frameworks. You should focus on things like data integrity, uptime, redundancy, error-tracking, rapid response to production issues, integration testing, etc. rather than which React.js state library is better.<p>5. Get to know other solo-founders.

Working solo has taken a heavy toll on me in many ways, both good and bad. I didn&#x27;t want to work alone but the people in my network only had excuses for why they wouldn&#x27;t work together.  During the time that I&#x27;ve worked alone, competitors have entered the market, thrived, and even successfully exited.  It has been crushing for me knowing that my vision and market were spot on accurate, and here I am watching others succeed at what I knew was real a long time ago.  Yet, they have taken a far more risk averse approach, leaving the holy grail for someone like me.  I didn&#x27;t want to work alone but I persist because working alone on this dream is worth more than not working on it at all.  Hope remains.  Things are finally changing this year, but it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve given up working alone without trying to raise funding.  My risk profile has changed during my solo career. I&#x27;m not going to fail to fundraise because I&#x27;m solo, anymore.  I&#x27;m bringing strong, modern tech assets, expertise, and validated business strategy to the table.  I&#x27;m going to crush any reservations that investors will have about me for being a solo founder.  The fact that I&#x27;m solo is nothing more than one person&#x27;s excuse for not getting involved.  Being solo was a legitimate concern years ago, but it&#x27;s not anymore.  I don&#x27;t need a founder.  I&#x27;m a hardened soldier who doesn&#x27;t need a shoulder to cry on but rather CBT, exercise, and sleep.  I have enough love in my life to carry on, and am very fortunate for that.  Moving forward is a frightening experience, but I will remain no matter the outcome.  I accept my fate and will fight like hell to arc towards the positive.<p>For the Dune fans:\nFear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

There’s so many people you will have to interact with that are <i>not<\/i> your co-founder. There’s so many people you can share your feelings with that are <i>not<\/i> your co-founder. And having a co-founder is no guarantee you won’t be lonely; a technical co-founder spends most his time heads down coding and a sales co-founder spends most his time out making deals. Occasionally you may have meetings about customer feedback and high level strategies but that’s about it; the intent of the relationship is not to spend weekends hiking or riding bikes together or other social activities. If you are feeling lonely the source of that must be coming from other aspects of your life.<p>Most of the time the loneliness a founder feels comes from the fact that almost no one that matters is enthusiastic about their idea, or at least not enough to pay for it.

He calls his product a friendly privacy oriented photo organizer. First off, drop the word friendly, that’s a meaningless word when describing apps and usually just a way to say an application has some decent UX, which is expected by default anyway. Second, “privacy oriented” is a red flag unless your startup is deliberately targeting people who have something they feel they need to hide. This will do nothing to move the needle for most mass market consumers who already consume tons of products without any regard to privacy. A lot of your marketing will have to rely on first making people paranoid so they seek out a privacy focused product, which is kind of scummy. Third, what you’re left with is essentially a photo organizer, whose novelty is questionable in a world that has no lack of photo organization. There’s no way this will be a successful business at this rate.

Since you&#x27;re scraping the metadata, you should be able to generate recs for Amazon items from their own catalogue. This might be an interesting product &#x2F; demo for potential customers.<p>- Once you hook up your system to your customer&#x27;s back end, how do you learn from the behavioral data you get from them? That&#x27;s straightforward for cf&#x2F;mf, but can be tricky to integrate into what you already have.\n- You talk about Stripe pooling the data from their customers. I think the analogue for you would be pooling the behavioral data from your customers as opposed to the metadata. Have you thought about this?<p>- It sounds like you&#x27;re doing nearest neighbors on the vector representation. You may already know this, but LSH is a fast way to do this when you have many items.<p>- Do you embed all items from your different customers into the same vector space? That would be ideal from the POV of creating a pooled dataset that would be helpful for all future customers, but sounds tricky given that everyone likely has their own idiosyncratic system.<p>Best of luck!

The formation of carbon–nitrogen bonds from N2 typically has required reactive organic precursors that are incompatible with the reducing conditions that promote N2 reactivity1, which has prevented catalysis. Here we report a diketiminate-supported iron system that sequentially activates benzene and N2 to form aniline derivatives. The key to this coupling reaction is the partial silylation of a reduced iron–dinitrogen complex, followed by migration of a benzene-derived aryl group to the nitrogen. Further reduction releases N2-derived aniline, and the resulting iron species can re-enter the cyclic pathway. Specifically, we show that an easily prepared diketiminate iron bromide complex2 mediates the one-pot conversion of several petroleum-derived arenes into the corresponding silylated aniline derivatives, by using a mixture of sodium powder, crown ether, trimethylsilyl bromide and N2 as the nitrogen source.

One of my favourite secondhand bookshops, Sedgeberrow Books in Pershore, has recently gone that way - the shop has closed but the operation lives on as an Abebooks dealer. Pershore still has a secondhand bookshop, which is a lovely relic that doesn&#x27;t even take debit&#x2F;credit cards. Many of the survivals seem to fit that mould: intentionally arcane dealers who&#x27;ve chosen not to move with the times."],"time":["2020-08-23 23:13:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pratio"],"id":[24253841],"kids":{},"parent":[24251417],"text":["Setting aside the damage done by the advent on internet which helps with search and deliveries, i feel that there&#x27;s a change in the attitude of people today.

On the tech side, it was interesting to see online marketplaces taking off, how ordinary people use computers, the sorry state of single-purpose software meant for a small group of paying customers. I also got to learn a lot about books, which ones are more likely to be valuable, which ones have no values (I have no problems throwing books away), and where to find books online.<p>Now the book business... The best used book marketplace at the time was Abebooks. There&#x27;s been some consolidation, and they got bought by--who else--Amazon, but I ordered something from them recently, and as far as I could tell, it wasn&#x27;t just Amazon sellers. Amazon and Ebay looked like huge markets to tap, we we never had much luck on either. Ebay, especially around 2000, was more auction-oriented, and those work great for mid-price, in-demand products. For books, to hit the price range for making a good listing make sense, it would have to be rare, but how many people are in the market for a first edition of &quot;The Jungle.&quot; The smaller marketplaces made more sense because that&#x27;s where the buyers were. It was a hard business, even then. The bookstore closed its storefront and moved everything into a second home because the rent&#x2F;mortgage was cheaper. The other thing that became clear is that &quot;rare&quot; books weren&#x27;t as rare as people thought once they started surfacing online, so prices dropped. I have no idea how Amazon sellers selling copies of old, but popular books for $2 can turn a profit.

On the one hand, I&#x27;ve spent many happy hours browsing round second-hand bookshops (a particular favourite memory was discovering the unabridged Gulag Archipelago while on a trip to NYC). On the other, the democratising effect of publishing leads to things like this - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;focus&#x2F;2020&#x2F;aug&#x2F;16&#x2F;literary-world-overwhelmed-by-600-books-to-be-published-on-one-day\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;focus&#x2F;2020&#x2F;aug&#x2F;16&#x2F;literary-world...<\/a> - which, while potentially problematic on the surface, means that a much larger number of people can be published, no matter what their social status or connections. I&#x27;ve recently been reading Bruno Schulz - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bruno_Schulz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bruno_Schulz<\/a> - and if it wasn&#x27;t for the intercession of someone powerful in the Polish literary world we would never have read his work (and, thanks to the Nazis, unfortunately we had even less than we might have had). What gems by marginalised authors might we not have read without this &quot;excess&quot; of publishing? Personally, I think this abundance of new published writing (including really interesting examples of self-publishing like Your Name Here by Helen Dewitt) is part of what makes second-hand bookshops less attractive. There is simply so much great stuff being written now by people who would never previously have had an audience, as well as unjustly-neglected authors being rediscovered. I used to feel like I knew most fiction authors&#x27; names in second-hand bookshops, even if only by reputation, but I&#x27;m not sure that would be the case any more. On balance I think I&#x27;d rather have a broader set of voices than a limited selection of second-hand books. And when you also have access to older titles that you might be interested in on abebooks, you can follow your own literary path rather than be guided by someone else&#x27;s opinions about what&#x27;s &quot;important&quot;.<p>Edit: Thinking about this more, maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in my late 40s now, but I get a lot of good recommendations from friends who have been reading all their lives, so I don&#x27;t feel the need for anyone else to recommend things. My &quot;to read&quot; pile is huge as it is! I guess one thing second-hand shops were good for was suggesting things to me that I might not have read otherwise. But personally I think the internet, particularly Wikipedia and niche blogs, gives me a really good route to the next thing I want to read.

In situations of bullying, people who remain silent may be afraid, may be disenfranchised in some other way to make them powerless, or may simply feel powerless. I&#x27;ve been seeing arguments like this crop up in other contexts as well, from social issues to personal disputes and it&#x27;s more than just wrong, it can also be tactically unsound, and can lead to worse social outcomes.<p>In terms of tactics: the organizer who uses this tactic is trying to accomplish two things, they&#x27;re trying to rile up their supporters and they&#x27;re trying to recruit new supporters. This tactic is extremely successful in the former, by artificially generating a new out-group to unite against: the innocent bystander. The tactic of attacking bystanders is however abysmal at recruiting new supporters, no matter one&#x27;s beliefs, they&#x27;re less likely to side with the person pointing the finger at them.<p>Use of this tactic has bad social outcomes for the very same reason. Getting pepople riled up makes them less likely to make logical decisions, it makes them more likely to turn to violence, it makes them more likely to entrench their views and polarize.<p>Given all this, why do people use this tactic when they&#x27;re trying to rally people? Why would you spend energy attacking people with no power to help? Unfortunately there&#x27;s a perverse incentive to do so. When your supporters are fervent, they support you more wholeheartedly, increasing their financial contribution as well as contributing to your power. For the supporter, it <i>feels<\/i> like you&#x27;re helping when you attack people, period, whether they&#x27;re actually your opponent or not, and the innocent bystander is both powerless to stop your attack and is less likely to fight back.

Here are a few examples of question overlap, for context.<p><pre><code>    Test Question:  who plays max voice in a goofy movie\n    Train Question: who does max voice in a goofy movie\n    Answer:         Jason Marsden\n\n    Test Question:  when will the 2018 oscar nominations be announced\n    Train Question: when are the oscar nominations for 2018 announced\n    Answer:         January 23 2018\n\n    Test Question:  who has scored more goals in the premier league\n    Train Question: most goals scored by a premier league player\n    Answer:         Alan Shearer\n\n    Test Question:  where are the cones in the eye located\n    Train Question: where are cone cells located in the eye\n    Answer:         retina\n\n    Test Question:  who led the conquest of the incas in south america\n    Train Question: conquistador who defeated the incan empire in peru\n    Answer:         francisco pizarro\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt makes sense that questions like these are especially susceptible to brute memorization. These are certainly bugs in the benchmark—and, in fact, about a third of questions in each dataset have this issue.<p>The paper also considers answer overlap; that is, when the answer to the question also occurs in the training set. This alone does not imply memorization, but it does open the door for some shortcuts. Some examples from the paper are:<p><pre><code>    Open Natural Questions\n    Duplicated: Phil Simms, Brian Johnson, 8, the Indians, the 1830s\n    Unique:     Cloves, Matt Monro, 1,020 – 1,080 kg, Hermann Ebbinghaus, Matt Flinders\n\n    TriviaQA\n    Duplicated: David Bowie, Battle of camlann, Heligoland, Henry VII, Niagra Falls\n    Unique:     Death in the afternoon, Clash of the Titans, ice-cream sundae, Camshaft, Cumberland\n\n    WebQuestions\n    Duplicated: Harvard, Alderaan, India, 2011, Zeus\n    Unique:     Queen Victoria, Braslia, Paddington, Tom Corbett, Gary\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt&#x27;s less obvious how to treat answer overlap. In particular, removing answer overlap might bias the dataset towards harder questions. Some of the reduction in model scores is presumably because models have to work harder to understand the question, as merely looking for topical similarities will be ineffective, but it also removes questions whose answers are general enough to apply to many questions, like ‘8’, ‘the 1930s’, ‘Harvard’, ‘2011’, etc. This means that reductions in the score don&#x27;t clearly say how much cheating happened. However, the success of the BERT-based Nearest Neighbor model, which retrieves the answer of the most semantically similar fine-tuning sample, scores similarly to BART, which seems much too high for comfort.<p>It should be noted that a lot of the discussions about causal knowledge and intelligence aren&#x27;t too relevant to these questions, as they are largely tests of memory or retrieval. It is expected that these models answer the questions by searching their training data or their document index. The issue is that their training data isn&#x27;t meant to contain copies of the test questions, just the information sufficient to answer them."],"time":["2020-08-24 01:17:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rndmize"],"id":[24252755],"kids":[24254742,24256496,24256527],"parent":[24249949],"text":["I bet this kind of mess is exactly what Zuck was trying to avoid when he didn&#x27;t want to implement free speech restrictions or fact checking, because there&#x27;s no solution to be found here - if you don&#x27;t mark anti climate change material as false, your fact checkers are worthless and you&#x27;re kowtowing to political&#x2F;moneyed elements that are against it; and if you do, those elements will declare you biased, claim censorship, and seek political action.

Your users WILL notice and complain about performance. Instead, use the native WebBrowser control in .NET for Windows and WebView using macOS to display your UI. Disable right clicking and highlighting using HTML&#x2F;JS. To the user, it&#x27;ll feel like any other native app. Add this meta tag to the HTML file to ensure the WebBrowser control knows to use new versions of IE to render the UI: &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;x-ua-compatible&quot; content=&quot;ie=edge&quot;&gt; (and&#x2F;or look up how to add the FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION registry key)<p>3) Use the built in script calling functions to transfer settings back and forth between the UI and main app in JSON. Do the back end stuff in native code.<p>4) You can then re-use most of the UI code you wrote to easily port over to macOS. Use the same functions and logic you wrote on Windows to make your Swift functions.<p>* I&#x27;ve been making a living from building&#x2F;maintaining my desktop application for about 5 years and had no regrets setting it up this way.

On one end there is Electron which makes it easy to build but then if its a trivial app and your users are not likely to &#x27;ve faster machines - your users are likely to suffer. Chrome the culprit is pretty much a joke. And on the other end there is QT, GTK which are awful to say the least.<p>* More than building, it is the publishing these apps that is painful which gets rarely discussed here. It costs you both time and money. By time, on how bureaucratic the process is involved in procuring the SSL from a licensed vendor, its verification and so on. And money to get the code signing licenses which are separate for both MAC and windows. And good luck publishing them without code signing - apss will be treated like malware by OS. However popular apps still go ahead and do this (notepad++ etc)<p>I would say use electron if you do not have sufficient resources to build natively for every OS. With some webpack optimizations you can squeeze in the app size to less than 300 MB but many electron apps without these optimizations go upto 650+ MB.

Javascript is single threaded and blocks rendering when it’s executing, just like most major UI frameworks. You have to run everything outside the main UI thread and marshal data back to the renderer. In JS the furthest most go is using promises with async&#x2F;await, which lets you not block during a long-running request, but the continuation callback is still executing within the same thread. If you implemented an app using a web worker internally and kept the main thread just dispatching events and doing quick render updates, it would perform amazingly well. CSS and JS are crazy efficient, there is no reason that an electron app can’t refresh at 144hz. The limitations are purely architectural. Most other UI frameworks put all deferred callbacks into a separate execution context and force martialing (eg in WPF, having to use dispatcher.BeginInvoke). JS doesn’t force this but is possible.<p>The ram usage is going to be higher than a native app, and so is the exe size. Those issues can’t be comparable. but the performance of the electron itself is not so poor as people believe.
