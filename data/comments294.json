The layoffs are a consequence of their strategy for finding alternate revenue streams being simply too weak to produce tangible results. Certainly not anywhere near levels that would allow them to justify having the ambitions of a big VC founded silicon valley based company with offices in e.g. the middle of the real estate bubble called Mountain View (as well as several other premium locations world wide).<p>What they do technically with their browser product is fine however and worth protecting. I just don&#x27;t see that costing in the order of hundreds of millions&#x2F;year. A couple of million goes a long way to keep a world wide collective of developers going. Many OSS projects manage with far less. It doesn&#x27;t require maintaining offices in the downtown areas of SFO (in addition to Mountain View), London, Paris, Portland, Berlin, Taipei, etc.<p>I use Firefox exclusively; like many other users. The wider community of Firefox developers and users has plenty of ways to keep the project going long term in one way or another.<p>Same with Rust. Rust will be fine without Mozilla. It&#x27;s widely used and loved by engineers useful to quite a lot of companies. IMHO the rust community is actually much less dependent on central management by anyone (including Mozilla) than the Firefox browser. Most long lived OSS projects need independence like that and thrive because of their independence.<p>Luckily, Mozilla has a very decent licensing policy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;MPL&#x2F;license-policy&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;MPL&#x2F;license-policy&#x2F;<\/a>) that crucially does not include any copyright transfer. That means their role is strictly as a facilitator of development; not as an owner of the copyright to the code. That means that in principle there is room for other companies to get involved or for independent developers to get involved.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m not worried about the project surviving the drama of their mother organization imploding or not.

But we&#x27;re past the point where that might do any good with respect to salvaging Firefox or Mozilla&#x27;s name.<p>Mozilla Corporation&#x27;s role today is to siphon away any attention or enthusiasm that might otherwise be directed towards the ideals that Mozilla was originally created to facilitate.  The Mozilla Corporation was supposed to have been set up to further the ideals of the then already extant movement that had been operating on a shoestring budget.  The imprimatur should have been to direct its paid staff towards doing the boring work that unpaid (but highly effective) volunteers weren&#x27;t interested in—not to wrench control away and consolidate power within a (now-proven ineffectual) company making ill-conceived commercial plays while trying to fit in with the culture of the Valley and squandering billions.<p>In the early 2010s, I attended a conference—one sponsored by Mozilla—and brought in on their dime, having been a fairly involved contributor for a few years, but not someone on the corporate payroll.  Another guest and I mentioned how poor a job the travel agency had done, essentially fleecing Mozilla and doing much worse than if we&#x27;d arranged for travel and accommodation ourselves and then forwarded the bill.  &quot;Mozilla has <i>a lot<\/i> of money&quot; was the response.  After the better part of a decade, Mozilla&#x27;s revenue has only grown, and so has their propensity to squander money.<p>The best option we have now is for folks to wake the heck up, to realize that the Mozilla that exists is not the one portrayed in either its messaging or fixed in the minds of casual slacktivists, to start a grassroots effort (a la early Firefox) to work on an independent browser—where, unfortunately, the best bet at this point is probably in leveraging WebKit against Chrome and Blink, given what an untameable mess the modern Web has become (not helped by the FirefoxOS efforts; nor the mess that Gecko codebase has become)—and most importantly <i>never allow that effort to be subverted in the way that the Corporation managed to cannibalize and take over Mozilla<\/i>.<p>But that&#x27;s not going to happen, because Mozilla continues to position itself as the organization where folks with a casual interest in the health of the Web are supposed to direct their good vibes, while thoroughly proving itself to be unworthy and incompetent at upholding the principles it&#x27;s supposed to be fighting for, and while time and time again, the public have proven themselves to have short attention spans on the order of months—so, by the end of the year Firefox and Mozilla will be back to being perceived as your old chum that&#x27;s fighting the good fight, instead of being steered by a bunch of clueless, well-salaried Bay Area devs LARPing as some motley crew with your best interests at heart, all while the term &quot;non-profit&quot; gets bandied about in public discussions, much to their delight."],"time":["2020-08-15 10:27:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24167983],"kids":{},"parent":[24166385],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-15 13:03:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["GNOMES"],"id":[24171584],"kids":{},"parent":[24166385],"text":["I have been forcing myself to use Firefox the last two months.

Conflicting preferences are normally no big deal. You just, y’know, weigh them, make your tradeoffs, and reach a decision. But when the preferences apply at different timescales (pie now, thinner later) humans suffer from a massive irrationality which philosophers call akrasia and economists call dynamic inconsistency and normal people call … being stupidly short-sighted, or in the case of time management: procrastination.<p>Commitment devices are a way to change your own incentives so that willpower is a non-issue.

I’ve gone by this adage that “a little bit each day” is better than doing a lot in a single day with a few days off. For instance with exercise (Running) instead of saying no to doing it I say ok maybe half the distance. And as a result it turns into a habit which I think is the single most important tool we have to improve ourselves. It’s kind of taking this situational approach and applying it every day. Another example from my life is soda. I read a lot about the negative effects sugar has on my body and as a result I feel guilty when I buy it, this is another way to motivate myself into a habit of “not buying soda” I started to buy less and now when it isn’t even available my laziness prevents me from leaving the house to go get it :) this is really similar to another comment that said “create systems” where the inevitable outcome is your goal, and I find parallels between this “system” idea and culture in general.

If it has, say, a 40-50% false negative rate, I don’t really care how cheap and fast it is, that sucks.

Not a projection of fiction on a dead existence, but actually meaningful and intelligibly so (i.e., not some kind of mere passing feeling). Ideologies have attempted to create simulated meaning time and again, silly beliefs that drive people into madness, great and small. They have always failed because the &quot;meaning&quot; they provided was bogus, a deception that might animate people for some time, but is ultimately a fiction that ceases to maintain a lasting grip precisely because it is false. Only someone crippled by nihilism, stupidity, or opportunistic vice could latch onto something like that.<p>The trouble is that we have been sliding into nihilism for some time. Nietzsche observed this slide during his era. He did not believe in God himself, but he saw atheism as a dreadful, horrible thing. In his parable of the madman, the madman frantically asks the people in town where God is. They are amused at the spectacle, suggesting in jest that perhaps God is hiding beneath something over here, or other there. The townsfolk represent the people of his day, the atheists of the 19th century. The madman, of course, realizes the consequences of God&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; the horror of which the townsfolk have not yet come to understand. They are still dwelling in that twilight of the idols, fragmented and perverted pieces of the whole that was once held together by God before the earth was unchained from the sun and lost its orientation (Nietzsche gave the cult of Science some noteworthy attention as an example of one of these idols). The twilight does, sooner or later, come to an end, of course, and that&#x27;s when even the idols can no longer pacify our fears.<p>I think most people are like those townsfolk. True nihilism is unbearable. Anyone who claims otherwise is like the foolish teenager who is merely spiting his parents in an act of rebellion. Some of us sense the nihilism festering in our souls and begin to attach ourselves to various causes, fads, fashions, distractions. Anything to avert our gaze from the horrific void within us and before us. And America has always been a land of heretics (to borrow a characterization from Douthat), so perhaps the diversity of bizarre superstitions should be greater in the US than elsewhere. At the same time The &quot;mainstream&quot; pop culture is also vacuous, commercial, ideological, and stupid, itself dripping with hedonistic escapism from nihilism as much as any fringe movement (you should also expect a ascetic reaction for every hedonistic indulgence; each excess breeds its corresponding deficiency). Actually, we are in the throes of a kind of new gnosticism, a new Albigensian movement wherein the &quot;true meaning&quot; of the world, the &quot;true self&quot;, is beyond the world of facts and can in fact contradict the facts. The facts are an illusion, not the &quot;really real&quot;. They&#x27;re &quot;socially constructed&quot; much like the material world is the deceptive construction of the evil creator god of the Old Testament, at least according to the gnostics. It is a dangerous, noxious amalgamation of pride and delusion, a slide into self-destruction, something Man has always excelled at. It is not unreasonable to think that gnosticism is, for many, an attempt to escape their nihilism into a world of pure imagination, giving their perverted appetites an inviolable infallibility and sanctity. We don&#x27;t need AI and robots to create the Matrix. Many of us are in it now."],"time":["2020-08-15 22:44:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["anm89"],"id":[24172011],"kids":[24172760],"parent":[24169794],"text":["I think the narrative of people using these subcultures as a way or fill the void left by the lack of  traditional societal structures that people used  to find meaning in life is spot on.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how half of the people in these subcultures seem to be in on the absurdity of it and the other half aren&#x27;t but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to matter to a lot of them."],"time":["2020-08-15 22:17:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["trynewideas"],"id":[24171984],"kids":{},"parent":[24169794],"text":["Most of AGNB is great, but I wish the protest videos at least included resources from local jouranlists alongside it for context.<p>Especially the Minneapolis and Portland protest ones recently put up — they showed a narrow slice of what was happening to drive home some really salient points, but if you watch them and think &quot;THAT&#x27;S what&#x27;s it&#x27;s like in there&quot;, it&#x27;s off base by quite a bit compared to the less entertaining local journalists (or even just streamers with a camera on a pole) who&#x27;ve been out there livestreaming, interviewing, and documenting for months instead of weeks or days.<p>Context is important; I can&#x27;t speak for Minneapolis, but the Portland protests weren&#x27;t just (and aren&#x27;t just, and for most of the nearly 70 straight days of them haven&#x27;t ever been) about the federal courthouse or the federal officers.

I actually thought &quot;that was too harsh&quot; considering I had nothing but praise for how user-friendly Ghost was (and how great Ghost support was - shoutout to Sarah, whoever you are, you shouldn&#x27;t be there).<p>The one thing you don&#x27;t expect is that a CEO of a company would take the annoyance of an account with circa.350 followers seriously and respond with what is apparently vitriolic rage, not only cussing me out, but then immediately going to shut my website down even though I was talking to a support rep at Ghost about upgrading and getting migration underway.<p>The main problems are this:<p>1. An automatic upgrade within 7 days that triples in price is sleazy, there&#x27;s no two ways to look at it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an American thing, but in Europe, a company would be crucified for doing this. You always have offer and acceptance before agreeing to something. It would be very easy for Ghost to simply put a popup stating &quot;you cannot add more staff users as you are on the basic plan - please upgrade here to do so&quot;. Again, no excuses here, it&#x27;s clear that some customers are being caught out by these automatic charges, judging by the dozen people that have expressed similar issues with Ghost since I published my post. So much for being a non-profit.<p>2. Something I forgot to add to the story - the main reason I went over the 2 staff users I was permitted to have on my account was because I had invited Ghost support in as a staff user to help with migration. This made me really annoyed as I had some friends on to help with setting up the website and I had to kick them to avoid being charged triple - for bringing Ghost in to help with some stuff.<p>3. The CEO going from cussing on twitter to deleting my website (all within 15mins, as I was working on it) is unacceptable, again, from any POV. The people here talking about this being an acceptable practice to deal with &quot;toxic customers&quot; have clearly never actually been in a customer-facing role.

And we are currently running a campaign called “Think OMNI” to introduce the entire US (for now) to a form of thinking that I call Omnidisciplinary Thinking.

In essence, the boundaries that we put around our thoughts and ideas are useful tools yet we forget that such boundaries do not truly exist.<p>Think OMNI aims to show people how to use Omnidisciplinary Thinking pragmatically today! in order to provide solutions in three areas: personal, interpersonal, social.<p><i><\/i>Personal<i><\/i>: Powerfully reason by analogy to better understand the world and one’s true capabilities<p><i><\/i>Interpersonal<i><\/i>: Engage with Root of discussions to better communicate with others, <i>especially<\/i> when their views seem in opposition to one’s own.

One is to show companies how to decompose talent because Keyword Bingo doesn’t work when entire industries need to shift into others. Furthermore, training efforts need to build on whatever is already there with a person’s skills rather than start from scratch.<p>At its most pragmatic, an Omnidisciplinary Thinker should be able to leverage every single piece of knowledge and experiences that one possesses to figure out how to meet basic needs in order to build Breathing Room to pursue other things. In general, it will allow for people to seamlessly blend insights across all disciplines. And the ultimate Omnidisciplinary minds will be able to powerfully and accurately draw insights from incredibly disparate subjects for pragmatic outcomes. (Imagine  reasoning about medicine in terms of painting.)<p>Leading into the US election, the intent is that people of all social-political backgrounds, ages, etc.  can use this to have the difficult discussions that we were not able to and still are not able to have with one another today. As a response to COVID, this tool must help employers and job seekers be more fluid with what a person’s skills actually are and what a role entails.

When Google Reader shut down, we realized the importance of self-hosting and data ownership. Initially, we started writing our own apps but mid-way recognized that there is already a plethora of self-hostable (especially opensource) software out there. It&#x27;s just that those apps are really hard to deploy. So, we now make a smart server platform that you can install on any cloud server or home server and you can easily install and maintain those apps.<p>Over time, we had to make many decisions around outside investment, salaries and target audience. We make choices based on whether it has social impact and whether our day to day work solves problems that we personally care about and for other privacy minded people like us. For example, we did not pursue outside investment (despite offers) and decided to retain 100% ownership of the company. We felt taking funding will make us focus on large enterprises and the product will take a different direction (k8s anyone?), quite far from any social impact. Investors, who we met, seemed to care more about 100x growth than our cause and some even laughed at the idea - &quot;who wants to selfhost email?&quot;.<p>Same for salaries, we took a heavy pay cut for the initial 2-3 years just to to get product going along (and so many pivots). What kept us going is that we felt there is a social aspect to the product and if we don&#x27;t do this nobody will. With a bit of luck, today we are profitable and can pay ourselves decent salary now (fwiw, I am based in bay area).<p>Just wanted to share our story, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant to what you are asking :) Ultimately, we want normal people and businesses to self-host and have complete control over their data (I wish we had the resources to make a hardware appliance that sits alongside the router).

That&#x27;s a nonsensical value which doesn&#x27;t make sense in terms of the business logic.<p>Generally, when you have types which permit values like this:<p>- Someone (you or a coworker) will eventually write some code that constructs such nonsensical values.<p>- This means that you need a lot of tests to ensure that all code using this type works correctly when given such nonsensical values.<p>By using the second definition of `Session`, you don&#x27;t have to worry about this at all. Nonsensical values can never exist so you will not accidentally construct them. Therefore you need less tests to ensure your code is correct.<p>- - -<p>For some reason, people are really keen to get into code like this when boolean flags are involved. Consider the following code (this time in Python):<p><pre><code>    from dataclasses import dataclass\n\n    @dataclass\n    class Options:\n        connect_tls: bool\n        verify_cert: bool\n        some_other_setting: int\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt does not make sense to have `Options(connect_tls=False, verify_cert=True, ...)`.  There is no certificate to validate when you connect without TLS.<p>(This generally happens when someone is tasked with implementing the `verify_cert` option. They see the existing options type, the existing flag for `connect_tls` and just add a second boolean.)<p>When I review code like this, I generally advocate for using Enums:<p><pre><code>    from dataclasses import dataclass\n    from enum import Enum, auto\n\n    class ConnectionOptions(Enum):\n        # Could also be: `PLAIN = &#x27;plain&#x27;` or `PLAIN = 1`\n        PLAIN = auto()\n        TLS_UNVERIFIED = auto()\n        TLS = auto()\n\n    @dataclass\n    class Options:\n        connection_options: ConnectionOptions\n        some_other_setting: int\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt&#x27;s almost the same safety level as in Haskell (although the Enum has a default serialization, which you need to think about e.g. when you store it in a database).<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ProgrammerDude&#x2F;status&#x2F;1249088936892346371\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ProgrammerDude&#x2F;status&#x2F;124908893689234637...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-15 16:36:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["city41"],"id":[24169199],"kids":[24169307],"parent":[24166594],"text":["The TypeScript EvenList&lt;T&gt; type at the end does not work as the author is implying.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;play?#code&#x2F;C4TwDgpgBAogbhAdgGQJYGdgB4AqA+KAXigG0BdKAH1JwBoo7YEUNt8yBuAKC4GMB7RJigAjAFxMkaTFkQBXALYiIAJwLESARloAmTn0HCAhhPhTWsxcrVFS2nbQDMtACz6gA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;play?#code&#x2F;C4TwDgpgBAogbhAdgG...<\/a><p>I am not a TS type expert by any means, but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to express an even list in TS&#x27;s type system.<p>But with that said, I enjoyed the article and I agree with the points its making."],"time":["2020-08-15 16:40:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["layer8"],"id":[24168561],"kids":[24170341,24170264],"parent":[24166594],"text":["What the article describes is a simple consequence of the Curry-Howard equivalence, that function types correspond to logical implication, and constructors are just a special case of function types."],"time":["2020-08-15 15:03:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jabl"],"id":[24167540],"kids":[24168719],"parent":[24166572],"text":["So VMS has gone full circle in terms of target architecture type.

This ensures security - the characteristic where the grid is resilient to any single failure. Because load is not normally controlled (i.e. people can turn loads on and off without permission from the system operator), the system needs to be able to respond to that as well as contingencies like a line or generator trip.<p>Imagine, for instance, that you&#x27;re fully maxed out on generation with no reserve, and one generator trips offline. You will now need to trigger emergency load shedding very, very rapidly (within seconds) to arrest frequency decline and a cascading, wide-area outage.<p>So you carry a margin of operating or spinning reserve, essentially generation that is available to very quickly ramp its output up or down in response to system conditions. When that margin starts to get eaten away by lack of capacity, you can do controlled load shedding, where you remove loads that have been already marked as low-priority to get some of your margin back.

(2,3) There is &quot;no way to implement interfaces or abstract classes using an expression&quot;. The author&#x27;s example is simple, but one could imagine a comparison involving captured variables where the separate class complicates things, because any captured variable needs to be shoved in a constructor.<p>I&#x27;ve hit 1 and 2 directly, 3 comes naturally from 2 (when you can define an object expression, you want a simple syntax for the constructor), as well as 4 from 1.

The biggest advancement seemed to be Intel&#x27;s uop-cache in Sandy Bridge (a concept that was first tried in the Pentium4, so not really a &quot;new&quot; innovation).<p>Even ARM chips are more of the same. Wider SIMD (see A64fx: #1 supercomputer in the world for 512-bit SVE), deeper out-of-order execution, better branch prediction. Its rare to see something new<p>----------<p>In contrast, whenever I see GPU-architectures, everything is so hugely different. True, GPUs all have a &quot;SIMD focus&quot;, but there&#x27;s so many exciting things about SIMD that just haven&#x27;t been explored yet.<p>NVidia has Tensor-cores, Raytracing cores. It was already crazy that NVidia had a full matrix-multiplication implemented in its FP16 processor in Volta, but Ampere is now pushing sparse matrix multiplication at the chip level (!!).<p>AMD GCN and RDNA push GPU&#x2F;SIMD architecture in a different direction. While a chunk of RDNA can be described as &quot;more of the same&quot;, the &quot;SubVector execution&quot; feature grossly changes how Wave64 wavefronts are executed to save on register space and potentially have a better memory access pattern. Innovation continues in the AMD space for sure.<p>Intel finally enters with their GPU &#x2F; SIMD architecture, and they start of with... SIMD8 + SIMD2 (instead of the Wave32 of RDNA&#x2F;NVidia or Wave64 for GCN). Finally, Intel is minimizing hardware scheduling (saving on die area), and focusing on software to schedule the instructions.<p>Three very, very different architectures. Three very different ideologies for how SIMD compute &#x2F; GPUs should be built. The SIMD &#x2F; GPU architecture space remains more innovative than the CPU-architecture space by a longshot. Its exciting to see.<p>--------<p>I&#x27;m not saying that CPU-advancements are dead per se. AMD did make chiplets a hot commodity (but chiplets were already experimented with Power5, and chiplets seem like a natural evolution to dual-socket or NUMA architectures... just cheap enough for a consumer now). Intel&#x27;s new Tremont Atom core has this cool &quot;dual-decoder&quot; design (where one decoder works on one-branch, and the 2nd decoder works on a 2nd branch in parallel). There are certainly new ideas being tested in the CPU world. But nothing as majorly game changing as what Intel &#x2F; AMD &#x2F; NVidia are doing to the GPU space. (Or Google if we include TPUs in the discussion. A TPU isn&#x27;t SIMD, but it shares some degree of similarity, especially to NVidia&#x27;s Tensor cores)<p>I guess big.LITTLE (and Intel&#x27;s Lakefield platform) was a big change in the last 10 years. But that hasn&#x27;t really seen much success in the Desktop&#x2F;Server markets."],"time":["2020-08-15 22:31:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["reikonomusha"],"id":[24169502],"kids":[24169566,24170013,24170659],"parent":[24169237],"text":["My opinion on the matter is that RC was unfairly heavy handed.

While it’s clear the author missed the 7am meeting because he goofed, I could imagine other individuals who would have missed because (for example) they have children and didn’t sleep, or they have depression and slept too much. It seems to me that zero-tolerance negatively affects such individuals, and pushes them out of programs like these."],"time":["2020-08-15 17:23:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nkrisc"],"id":[24169694],"kids":[24170079],"parent":[24169237],"text":["&gt; It turns out there was a “Welcome Event” held on the morning of the first day that I was supposed to attend.
