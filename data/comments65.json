I don’t know.<p>Take this DP-3T project for example. It’s really interesting tech, and a great group of people behind it. But the government doesn’t care for this nuance of what is privacy preserving tech and what is not. For now, maybe at the beginning, privacy will be emphasized. But the important part is conditioning citizens to be okay with the underlying idea of technology assisted self-surveillance, and compliance with notifications on their phone telling them to stay inside.<p>Schneier raises the point of false positives, which is important with regards to this idea of conditioning. What do you do when you get a notification that someone “nearby” tested positive? Do you take time off work and isolate yourself in your house for two weeks, just because some beacon passed within two meters of you within the past two weeks? Even if you have no symptoms at all? Just because you got a notification on your phone? This just seems unrealistic to me.<p>My other worry is the classic “slippery slope.” Maybe people are okay with these apps in their current form, if they’re privacy-preserving. (Personally, I doubt anyone outside tech can recognize the difference anyway, but let’s assume the wider populace takes its lead from us). Isn’t there a risk that eventually people will forget about the underlying details and privacy will be deemphasized?<p>“You were okay with TrackingApp 1.0, why wouldn’t you be okay with TrackingApp 2.0?”<p>If we give an inch now, will the government take a mile later?

The main issue with it is that no one actually knows that much, and so whichever faction of experts is most influential or savvy or popular gets to dictate the so-called consensus. That being said, while I still vehemently disagree with censorship, I don&#x27;t think there is immense harm in taking down a video that advocates, say, psychic consultation to prevent COVID.<p>Once a culture becomes a censorship culture, the calculus changes. While right now in America, the effort appears to mostly be an attempt to weed out information that these experts believe is untrue, we have seen that in China, the censorship explicitly weeds out information that <i>is<\/i> true. The so-called conspiracy theory about the virus leaking from either the Wuhan CDC or the Wuhan Institute of Virology in November that has since been corroborated in multiple Western mainstream publications was discovered mostly due to Chinese officials engaging in fairly heavy-handed censorship. The Wuhan Institute of Virology was scrubbed of information about one particular young woman who was working as an intern there, and has been named as a possible &quot;patient zero.&quot; A paper released by researchers at the South China University of Technology also suggested the Wuhan CDC as a probable point of origin, and this was also scrubbed by Chinese Communist Party censors. Every instance of this is like a canary for lies being propagated by the CCP. And they have helped astute Western observers of China find the trail of the truth just by looking at differences in what has been censored without a trace.<p>This is why I am so opposed to censorship (and torture and deplatforming and partisan violence and the list goes on): every time it becomes a regular tool, it becomes twisted only in a way to serve those in power and punish their enemies, often when the authorities are spreading lies and their enemies are daring to tell the truth."],"time":["2020-05-01 04:23:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cvwright"],"id":[23037437],"kids":[23040624,23039042],"parent":[23036326],"text":["&gt; But the difference between the stupidities cherished by the Idiocracy set injecting fish cleaner, and the ones pushed in places like the Atlantic, is that the jackasses among the “expert” class compound their wrongness by being so sure of themselves that they force others to go along.<p>Damn.

It’s Red Hat&#x2F;IBM, really, who should be interested in making sure the bus factor of libinput is &gt; 1. Thus the problem should be raised within Red Hat’s management, and they should _hire_ additional people for fair buck to help. Otherwise it looks as if someone who’s paid for X input stack maintenance is seeking free labor to help him.<p>If I asked someone to help me do my paid job for free, open source or not, I don’t think it would even be ethical.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;who-t.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;libinputs-bus-factor-is-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;who-t.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;libinputs-bus-factor-is-1....<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-01 22:06:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["montebicyclelo"],"id":[23039768],"kids":{},"parent":[23039515],"text":["Having used a Macbook for the last 10 years, I can confirm that the trackpad feels better than trackpads on windows laptops, Chromebooks, and Macbooks with Linux installed (IMO, that I&#x27;ve tried).<p>However, I think the tracking may change slightly with major MacOs releases.

No surplus, no need to cut production.<p>Then Agricultural American puts out an article showing that data on oranges is being reported by farmers as oranges are picked, whereas data on apples is being estimated based on much fewer reports. The conclusion is that the apples-to-oranges comparison should be taken with a grain of salt.<p>This is in addition to reports that show orange yields are likely underreported based on overall measures of fruit on the market[1], as well as anecdotal reports of fruit storage being overwhelmed by oranges[2].<p>Ok I think we can go ahead and report this analogy as another COVID-19-related death.<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;world&#x2F;coronavirus-missing-deaths.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;world&#x2F;coronav...<\/a><p>[2]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.sky.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;coronavirus-body-bags-begin-to-fill-new-yorks-makeshift-morgues-11969170\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.sky.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;coronavirus-body-bags-begin-to-fi...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-01 16:30:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pmorici"],"id":[23045081],"kids":{},"parent":[23041619],"text":["The surprising thing here is that the often quoted flu death number isn&#x27;t an actual count it is a statistical estimate based off the must lower recorded count.

To this day, I find this to be an amazingly complex and interesting industry from an cash-flow perspective.<p>Insurance is also a weird product from a consumer stand-point: for most people (at least in Canada) there is little  to no difference between company offering. If you take P&amp;C, there is a lot of competition for pricing, and a lot of the &quot;end-stream&quot; innovation is about containing costs (fraud, company-owned repair shops, avoiding litigation).

I think that participating life was a game changer, and even then, its popularity is really tied to the market. There is a lot of research being done as well to better assess risk without being invasive (fluids, extensive questionnaires, etc.). But when you&#x27;re on the hook for a long period of time, your mistakes along the way tend to stay for a long time. And going under is -- I think -- worse than any other industry. You pay premiums to insurance companies because you trust they&#x27;ll be alive in the future!<p>Speaking of loss ratio, most companies are also now heavy towards automation, again to reduce costs.

However, insurers and banks can sell infinite policies&#x2F;loans so long as the price is low enough.

Most insurers are garbage at writing policies, with the P&amp;C industry averaging around mid-single digit ROE in a year with average catastrophe losses. When I checked a few years ago, aggregate combined ratio (sum of losses &amp; expenses divided by premiums) is in the high 90&#x27;s percentage.<p>- Loss costs are getting ridiculous these days (trial lawyers, social inflation), almost across the board, so you&#x27;re seeing insurers start raising prices across the board.

The length of a lunar cycle is 29.5 days.<p>That they are so close is unlikely to be coincidence.  In fact a close-knit group of women in primitive conditions will synchronize their cycles to each other and then the group synchronizes to the Moon.  An evolutionary explanation can be found in the fact that predators can smell the blood from menstruation.  Therefore there is a real advantage to having women do this all together, when the moon&#x27;s light makes defending them easier.<p>It would be more convenient still if women didn&#x27;t menstruate.  However periods seem to have evolved when primates lived in trees.  There was no barrier to this since smell is less important for arboreal animals than ground dwelling ones. And once evolved, it is hard for it to unevolve.<p>A side note of evolutionary speculation.  Our arboreal ancestry seems to have been when primates lost most of their sense of smell.  However in temperate zones, smell is very important for finding food under snow.  Is it a coincidence that there are only two species of primates that live in the temperate zone?

I anonymized it and posted it below.<p>----------------------<p><i>ssh_config_best_practices.md<\/i><p><pre><code>  CanonicalizeHostname yes\n\n  ##############\n  ### GitHub ###\n  ##############\n\n  Host github.com\n    User jdoe\n    IdentityFile ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa_github\n\n  ##################\n  ### My Company ###\n  ##################\n\n  Host myproject-dev-*\n    ProxyJump bastion-dev\n\n  Host myproject-prod-*\n    ProxyJump bastion-prod\n\n  Host bastion-dev\n    HostName bastion.myproject-dev.mycompany.com\n    ProxyJump bounce.myproject-dev.mycompany.com\n\n  Host bastion-prod\n    HostName bastion.myproject-prod.mycompany.com\n    ProxyJump bounce.myproject-prod.mycompany.com\n\n  Host *.mycompany.com myproject-dev-* myproject-prod-*\n    User john_doe\n    IdentityFile ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa_mycompany\n\n\n  ##############\n  ### Common ###\n  ##############\n\n  Host *\n    ControlMaster auto\n    ControlPath ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;sockets&#x2F;%r@%h\n    ControlPersist 2h\n\n    # On OS X, UseKeyChain specifies that we should store passphrases in the Keychain.\n    IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain\n    UseKeychain yes\n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n<\/code><\/pre>\n- &quot;CanonicalizeHostname&quot; ensures the config is re-parsed after hostname canonicalization. This means that when you SSH into &quot;bastion-dev&quot;, SSH re-parses the config using the full hostname &quot;bastion.myproject-dev.mycompany.com&quot;, which then correctly matches the entry &quot;Host * .mycompany.com&quot;.<p>- &quot;ProxyJump&quot; was added in OpenSSH 7.2 (2016) and is simpler and more powerful than &quot;ProxyCommand&quot;.<p>- &quot;bastion-xxx&quot; hosts are the only ones whose hostname can be resolved from the bounce gateways. To connect to other hosts, the trick we use in this config is to do two ProxyJumps: your machine --&gt; bounce --&gt; bastion --&gt; target host.<p>- &quot;ControlMaster&quot; lets you do SSH multiplexing, which in our case is particularly useful when channeling multiple connections through a bastion host. It also persists SSH connections for a while after we disconnect, which speeds up future connections, and avoids typing the password all the time.<p>- When you ssh into a host, you must enter your LDAP password twice: first for the bastion, then for the target host. If you then ssh into a second host, you must enter your LDAP password only once, since ControlMaster reuses the SSH connection previously established to the bastion. Also, if you close those SSH shells, the connections will persist for two hours (see ControlPersist), so you won&#x27;t need to type your password for those two hosts if you try to SSH into them again in the next two hours.<p>- Using this ssh_config, there is no need to add an Host entry for each host. It is not even needed to specify the IP addresses, since they will be resolved using the DNS on the bastion host.<p>- With this configuration, you can easily copy a file using scp between your local machine and the target host, without needing to first copy it to the bastion, then ssh to the bastion, then copy it to the target host, then remove it from the bastion...<p>PS: an ssh_config is parsed from top to bottom, so specific comes first, generic comes last.

The primary use case for WinRT&#x2F;UWP is making apps for the Microsoft Store, where most of the time you&#x27;re going to be sharing code also targeting Google Play and the Apple Store given those markets are vastly larger (and have viable ad-platforms; Microsoft is shutting theirs down on June 1st).<p>The C++&#x2F;WinRT and C++&#x2F;CX language projections are incompatible with compilers that target Android and IOS due to WinRT reference specific syntax and keywords such as the &#x27;^&#x27; reference indicator.<p>As an alternative, it is possible to access all of the same WinRT&#x2F;UWP platform functionality in pure C++ without the C++&#x2F;WinRT syntactic sugar extensions, allowing you to cleanly abstract the WinRT&#x2F;UWP platform APIs relative to Android and IOS.  This is not well documented but by far a superior option for folks familiar with COM and Windows internals.<p>Furthermore, avoiding things like &#x27;^&#x27; reference operator syntax gives you tighter control over object lifetime as C++&#x2F;WinRT and C++&#x2F;CX hide to some degree the mechanics of COM object lifetime and gives a pseudo-environment much more like C# on .Net.<p>Microsoft does provide the WRL pure C++ template library, which is in many ways a spiritual successor to the ATL COM template library.  WRL is in my experience the best way to interact with COM objects surrounding WinRT and UWP.<p>(Source: developer of several top 10 apps (at times) on Microsoft Store).<p>Glossary of Microsoft terms:<p>WinRT&#x2F;UWP (WinRT (Windows Runtime) the old name used in Windows 8&#x2F;8.1 for what later was renamed to UWP (Universal Windows Platform) in Windows 10).  WinRT&#x2F;UWP was originally intended to be an object-oriented replacement API for Win32 but hasn&#x27;t lived up to its charter due to only being useful for Microsoft Store apps and being significantly less capable than Win32.<p>COM - Component Object Model; an object-oriented API style used by some Win32 APIs, this style was used near-exclusively as the basis for the WinRT APIs.  COM can be unweildy to deal with so there are several C++ template libraries like WRL and ATL to make it easier.<p>C++&#x2F;WinRT (and C++&#x2F;CX) are Microsoft specific C++ extensions that require MSVC and hide the complexity of dealing with COM relative to WinRT&#x2F;UWP APIs."],"time":["2020-05-01 01:10:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["znpy"],"id":[23036203],"kids":{},"parent":[23033451],"text":["I want to reply to many other comments but I want to make this more visible: Microsoft does not do Embrace-Extend-Extinguish anymore today (or at least, it does a lot lot less).<p>You know who does Embrace-Extend-Extinguish?

The old editor had nice shortcuts, like h1. - h6., {code}, {blockquote} etc. When you create a ticket - it&#x27;s the old editor, but when you edit a ticket or write a comment, it&#x27;s the new editor! This new editor has none of the markdown-ish shortcuts the old editor had.<p>Confluence is also changing it&#x27;s editor and the old wiki pages do not have a 1:1 match to the new wiki pages. This means you have to go through each page, convert it, and edit it to fix the broken things - because depending on what you use, it will be broken. For example, there is no longer a note, warning, or error macro - instead it gets turned into a info macro that you have to go in and edit it to the style you previously had. Code blocks no longer let you pick the color scheme you had, instead they&#x27;re all generic. There&#x27;s even more here I&#x27;m not listing.<p>Confluence has also just been wonky lately.

I understand why, but I am really going to miss it. Git is way more powerful but Mercurial is (at least to me) way easier to use and pick up.

Some feedback for your journey: Drop the focus on languages. Choose one (popular) language and focus on understanding it well. The best thing you can do, is find some open source project with high quality code in that language, and study it. Slowly, how long it takes does not matter. The end result is you will pick up best practices and styles you did not know exist. Concomitantly, study a few frameworks in your chosen language. Ex: If you select python and are doing web development, learn how Django and Flask work. Learn how the requests library or a forms library works. By reading good code, and studying frameworks and libraries that solve peoples real problems, you will build a foundation for how to put together higher quality and longer lasting code. That will not only make you better as a programmer, and better in your chosen language, but you&#x27;ll start to find that a substantial portion of what you learn will start to transfer."],"time":["2020-04-30 17:03:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dave_aiello"],"id":[23030125],"kids":{},"parent":[23029489],"text":["Think of this essay as a barbell, in the investment sense of the word.

JavaScript is required by the business, so the Java developer fake it until they make it.  They still have no idea what they are doing then give up and require a framework.  Epic fail.
