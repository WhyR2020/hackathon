That doesn’t necessarily mean twice as many bugs, but it is suggestive.

Outside of drives and fans, the virtually all of the power used in your system is exclusively 12v; either from the 12v pins on your ATX24 or P4 or EPS12 connectors, or via the PCI-E connectors; very little non-drive or non-fan power is supplied via 3.3 or 5v rails.<p>Second, almost all PSUs today use 12v DC to 3.3&#x2F;5v DC converters to increase efficiency given how little 3.3v and 5v is required. The PSU itself is often designed internally as a high efficiency multi-module single rail 12v-only design.<p>Third, Intel is not in a position to dictate anything. Intel has tried to float many changes in the standards (such as the WTX board standard (with matching incompatible mobo plug), and the BTX board standard (using ATX plugs)), and all failed. The only thing that stuck was using 4 and 8 pin PC Minifit Jr plugs (the same ones ATX, PCI-E and countless other plugs come from); and, annoyingly, somehow not compatible with PCI-E&#x27;s pinout.<p>Fourth, Intel is also not the dominant player in the field now, AMD is. They failed to get major changes through as the dominant player, what makes them think anyone cares to hear what they have to say today? It is unlikely AMD will ever ship machines that don&#x27;t ship with normal ATX unless they just jettison the ATX24 altogether.<p>Side note: 12v capacity: ATX24 144w, P4 192w, EPS12 336w, PCI-E 6 75w, PCI-E 8 150w, and the PCI-E slot itself 75w.<p>A modern desktop could theoretically be ran off a dual EPS12 and a PCI-E 8+8 for the GPU; modern mobo designs run the CPU and RAM VRMs off the EPS12 entirely, modern GPU designs run the GPU VRMs off of PCI-E plugs and the VRAM VRMs off the PCI-E slot power, very little power of any voltage is supplied to the system via ATX24.<p>Another side note: Any board that has a legitimately clean 5v rail for USB is <i>not<\/i> feeding it off the PSU directly. Any board that has absolutely garbage USB power probably committed this sin."],"time":["2020-03-10 00:00:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulDavisThe1st"],"id":[22531732],"kids":[22532002,22534570,22535875,22532031,22531927,22535044,22534341,22533169],"parent":[22525091],"text":["I love computers with 12VDC native power jacks.

But sometime in the mid-2000&#x27;s, something changed. My guess is that someone figured out how to shrink the necessary converters to a size that made it more &quot;sensible&quot; to put them inside the monitor. Result: almost impossible now to find a monitor you connect to a 12VDC supply. The one I have in the van took me months to find on ebay back in 2015. The only exception are &quot;TV&quot; monitors specifically made for RVs, which is great and all, except that most of them are crap compared to a modern monitor.<p>One small problem with plugging 12VDC native computers into a solar system: it&#x27;s not atypical for the solar charge controller to drive the charge voltage over 14V, at which point most internal &quot;PSUs&quot; designed for 12V will shutdown.

Would more or fewer &quot;at-risk&quot; people become infected?<p>These are some other factors to consider:<p>- Could a short term quarantine for at-risk groups (shorter because the faster general infection rate would result in faster herd immunity) be more effective? Do quarantines and social distancing measures suffer from &quot;quarantine fatigue&quot;?<p>- What are the comparative mortality rates between people with medical care and those without it? (i.e. those in an overwhelmed system due to the fast spreading scenario)<p>- Does recovering from the illness result in strong immunity?<p>- What are the comparative costs of quarantines to society and economy at large?<p>- At what point is a vaccine or treatment likely to be widely available (if it is soon, then the slower spread is obviously crucial).<p>I suspect the answer is very nuanced.

There are other places where the editor does not know what to do with your code, because it is not pure JS. Vue is much worse with this since so many things are just strings; React really shines with editor support. This makes a big difference when you are using a large project where you didn&#x27;t write the code.<p>* I don&#x27;t love that you have to re-assign a object&#x2F;array variable to get Svelte to notice it changed, and you can do that inside a Svelte template to a const variable and you won&#x27;t get a complaint from the compiler.<p>* Much smaller ecosystem compared to React and Vue, which is expected at this point.<p>Other than this, I absolutely love Svelte.

Relevant to the current outbreak is the ability to easily return graded items to the students through the service. You can even handle regrade requests, should you choose to enable them. They also now seem to have some test-administration capabilities, but I&#x27;ve never used that.<p>The process for using it goes like this:<p>1. Upload a blank exam and mark where names and answers are (so, e.g., they&#x27;ll know where on each exam to expect the student&#x27;s answer to 2(b)).<p>2. Scan and upload the finished exams. Most copying machines can handle this pretty easily.<p>3. Use an OCR-assisted process to match exams to names or student ID numbers. Without ID numbers, this took me under 2 minutes for 40-50 students.<p>4. As you grade each problem, you make notes and deductions as you go. e.g. &quot;You forgot the +C, -1 point&quot;. If you see the same error again, you can use a hotkey to affix the same note and deduction to subsequent exams. You can also grade additively, if you prefer. And you don&#x27;t have to deal with stacks of paper exams.<p>5. If you decide to alter a note, or that you were to harsh or lenient on a particular error, the changes are applied to all exams with that mark. This takes a lot of pressure off of your initial grading decisions (&quot;Oh, shit, it looks like getting that was harder than I thought. Should I go through all the exams and lower their deductions?&quot;). The notes support LaTeX math symbols.<p>6. Once you&#x27;re finished grading, you don&#x27;t have to tally and enter the grades. No more worrying about final-grade-altering addition errors. You can export the results as a spreadsheet. You get granular, question-level data on how everyone did. You can publish the results to students. If you choose to accept regrade requests, you can do so without worrying about post-return alterations of answers.<p>This is all without their upgraded AI-assisted service. It slashed about 75% off of the time I spent on grading and 90% off the stress of grading fairly and consistently. And it gets even better if you have multiple graders with their team service; no more coordinating the passing around of exams!

Yes the message sizes are larger in byte size with JSON but using the jsmn[1] parser I could avoid dynamic memory usage and code size was small. The jsmn parser outputs an array of tokens that point to the buffer holding the message (ie start and end of key name etc), so overhead is quite limited.<p>For JSON output I modified json-maker[2]. It already allowed for static memory usage and rather small code size, but I changed it to support a write-callback so I could send output directly over the data link, so I didn&#x27;t have to buffer the whole message.

I have always considered low-gravity to be quite a big issue for any planetary colonization. Unless some cure is invented like a genetic mutation, it would seem that there is no way of coming back to Earth after spending a lifetime in eg 0.2 G.<p>This in mind I have always thought that Venus would make the best candidate in the solar system. With 0.9 G it would be as close as we could possible get to Earth yet however I have to admit, having no magnetosphere would be a giant pain in the ass. But since Venus already has a thick atmosphere, it would seem that after the required amount of gas has been removed, it would stay stable whereas in Mars you&#x27;d constantly have to offset the escaping gas. Possibly though that would not be an issue, since we are pretty great at the green-house gas generation.<p>But yeah, Mars would definitely be the easiest to terraform.

Similarly to GNU Pass, you need to sort out syncing yourself and have the additional hassle of maintaining a shared secret, and alternatively a shared keyfile. If one is compromised, you need to make everyone rotate, which in practice leads to lazy teams never rotating keys and even using keys they know probably are compromised already.<p>LastPass is horrible, in my experience.

There was the disastrous evacuation of Tallinn at the beginning of the war, the battle (and evacuation) of Odessa, the loss of Crimea, and the Leningrad front with immense civilian and military losses.

When I started there they had a retirement savings program where they would sell you BNR stock for half price (though you had to have it in your retirement savings).  I said &quot;No thank you&quot; and a lot of people thought I was crazy.  At the time the company was pulling in $18 billion a year and was making about a 5% profit (later it was found that the &quot;5% profit&quot; was actually accounting fraud but nobody knew that at the time).<p>From my perspective, I looked at the business and realised that we were selling hardware at a 90% margin, but only eking out a 5% profit.  Where was the rest of the money going?  Well, obviously to a very inefficient rest of the company that included the software developers (me ;-) ). Later it was discovered that it was also being imbezzled, but we didn&#x27;t know about it at that time...<p>It occurred to me, though, that the only thing that was stopping a company from eating our lunch was that telecom hardware was a capital intensive industry.  So you had BNR, AT&amp;T and Seimens capturing practically the entire market, each being as incompetent as the other, but with very little distinction between them.  All you needed was a few billion dollars to shake the industry to the core.  And, of course, that happened.  It took only a couple of years (less than 5 I think) for Nortel to go from 100K employees to zero (with the executives slurping up the retirement fund to pay for their own &quot;retention bonuses&quot;, because what would have happened if the executives bolted as soon as bankruptcy proceedings started???

I used to be the A&#x2F;B test engineer for Travelocity.  Here are some of the motivations I have observed that introduce bias generally (not just in science):<p>Passive<p>* communication style<p>* a lack of self-reflection<p>* inadequate tests<p>* dishonesty (cognitive complexity)<p>Active<p>* prejudice<p>* dominance<p>* dishonesty (lying)<p>I often found that people are rarely introducing bias intentionally, though that does happen.  The reasons people attempted to intentionally introduce bias was generally a way to improperly persuade people for a variety of unrelated motivations.<p>Bias can be as simple as confusion as to a goal, such as when a person states one thing but is actually hoping for something different.  This is a disconnection between a person&#x27;s goal and the terms with which they are willing or capable to express that goal.  Reasons for that disconnect could be offense or cultural conventions.  This is more easily observable in children who haven&#x27;t yet mastered the communication skills to mask this confusion.<p>Sometimes bias creeps in because a person has a strong opinion of a subject and instead of attempting a proof to qualify or disqualify their position on the subject they will shift the evidence as necessary to manipulate an audience.  This is common in politics, particularly when the audience themselves are preferentially biased to the emotionally loaded language they are hearing over any complete or partial evidence supporting that language.  To some degree this sort of political manipulation is also most commonly unintentional, though it appears exceedingly intention coming from many career politicians.<p>Most frequently people introduce bias casually to achieve a form of social agreement, because facts and evidence are less important, to many people, than kindness and conformance.  There is a sort security provided from achieving stronger social bonds even if that means shifting ground to conform to a different set of norms and values preferred by a group.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t think any of this line of thinking would enter science or experimentation, especially when those conducting the experiments are experienced professionals, but it does.  I have learned through other professional experiences that objectivity is a personality trait that can be tested for and measured.  Objective personality types are rare.

That ultimate trespass becomes the lens through which all of modern life is viewed, no matter how remote it sits in the past. Like a religion, wokeness can&#x27;t help but try to insert its core values of humility and service of the Higher Purpose into everything, no matter how inappropriate. Its adherents are pushy about how they want you to think, and what they want you to value, because they believe there is a higher truth that pervades any worldly endeavor. It has certain non-negotiable tenets, which it refuses to compromise on despite the massive cognitive dissonance required to achieve such a stance amidst the avalanche of evidence against them. If scientific or practical empiricism seems to conflict with these pre-commitments, they will muddy the water and move the goalposts. And of course, woke disciples reserve the right to be massively offended if you blaspheme against one of these core principles. Wokeness is perfectly eager to put its hand out to the state to get a leg up on its authoritarian, missionary purpose. But they do this because, like any other religion, they know that this will be best for all of us in the end. And just like other religions, I imagine it finds comparisons of this sort to be absurd; of course all of _those_ religions are evil, they&#x27;re the wrong ones!<p>Wokeness, just like a religion, gathered a following based on some fundamentally decent ideas that lie near its center. But they come packaged with a one-size-fits-all worldview that tries to bite off far, far more than it can chew. Just like a religion, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect overmuch about its practitioners that they have converted. That fact indicates at most a slight inclination towards credulity and collectivism, as opposed to individualism and free thinking. But just like religion, it could just as easily represent the bad luck of growing up in the wrong area, or with the wrong parents, or perhaps just bad enough circumstances to need that kind of structure and externally-sourced meaning.<p>It seems that the agenda to put the whole world off of religion has not been as successful as the average coastal intellectual might have thought. I can&#x27;t help but wonder whether we will be subject to the same ebb and flow of authoritarianism that generations of Judeo-Christian and Islamic constituencies exercised in the past. The church bumping against truth is a story as old as time, but it seems like it&#x27;s harder than we thought to really learn that lesson.<p>Here we have a classic piece of Woken apologia trying to square classic Woken ideals with the reality that there are groupings of genes amongst people. It wants to smuggle faulty, incomplete understanding of genetics to avoid the evidence written on the wall. It&#x27;s not doing this for a nefarious purpose - the Woken believe that all men and women should be treated equally, which is a noble ideal. But the reason they think this is derived from a deeper truth, which is that all men and women are fundamentally born as the same creature, and then shaped purely by experience. They believe that because It Is Written. Because that is True, things get tricky when they try to square the Truth with the reality that there are non-trivial separations of historical development in the human genome, and those genetic lines end up looking different because of the forces that shaped them along their unique genetic history. Of course this is common sense - anybody can tell that there are distinct groupings of slightly-phenotypically-different people in the world, and the science confirms this intuitive fact. So the Woken need to muddy the water by reminding us the limits of our knowledge. What really counts as a race - can you count me all the races? What are the motivations of these so-called scientists trying to prop up the &quot;theory&quot; of race, a theory that need I remind you became intimately linked to the Nazis?<p>When you read something like this, try to picture a Creationist with the same general motives. The Creationist&#x27;s letter wants to smuggle a faulty, incomplete understanding of biology to avoid the evidence written on the wall that evolution is real. It&#x27;s not doing this for a nefarious purpose - Creationists believe that we should all love and respect our fellow man. But the reason they think this is derived from a deeper truth, which is that men and women are God&#x27;s people, made in God&#x27;s image, as documented in the Bible. They believe that because It Is Written. Because that is True, things get tricky when they try to square the Truth with the reality that the evidence for the nature of evolutionary history is written everywhere, and the fossil record plainly confirms this. Of course, this is common sense - anybody can see the inevitability of evolution once it&#x27;s explained to them. So the Creationists need to muddy the water by reminding us of the limits of our knowledge. How many of these connecting fossils have we really found?

For a long time, it was thought that the cerebellum learned liked a perceptron neural network, i.e. that an error signal was computed and used to change the strength of synapses within the cerebellum to result in the correct output signal to guide motor control (and, we know now, cognitive control). In other words, the cerebellum was a <i>supervised learning<\/i> machine [1]. But how these error signals were actually computed using the neuronal circuitry was never made clear; most arguments centered around the microcircuitry of the inferior olive. In a perceptron, an error signal is the difference between the correct output and the predicted output. But how is the &quot;correct output&quot; supplied?<p>As far as I know the first to propose the cerebellum learned by reinforcement learning was the famed cerebellum researcher Richard Thompson [2]. Unfortunately, the idea was only vaguely sketched out the field didn&#x27;t take this very seriously and continued on with the general belief that the cerebellum learned by supervised learning.<p>To me and my collaborator, Tadashi Yamazaki, it seemed a more natural signal that the nervous system could capably supply would be a graded reward signal. Moreover, this meant we could interpret the structure of the cerebellum within the theoretical frameworks of reinforcement learning such as the actor-critic framework [3,4]. This is the second reason these finding are a big deal: the paradigm shift to the cerebellum being a reinforcement learning machine, if correct, will be a boon for building better models of it. In the last few years there has been some impressive work done with reinforcement learning in artificial neural networks that could be applied to models of the cerebellum, especially within context of the brain at large.<p>[1] Doya, Kenji &quot;What are the computations of the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex&quot; (1999)\n[2] Thompson, Richard &quot;The nature of reinforcement in cerebellar learning&quot; (1998).\n[3] Lennon, William &quot;Towards more biologically plausible computational models of the cerebellum with emphasis on the molecular layer interneurons&quot; (2015) \n[4] Yamazaki and Lennon &quot;Revisiting a theory of cerebellar cortex&quot; (2019)"],"time":["2020-03-10 17:16:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["awb"],"id":[22536162],"kids":[22536187],"parent":[22534726],"text":["It&#x27;s this just a quote?

I might be overexplaining some parts and underexplaining others, please let me know if it&#x27;s clear.<p>Here&#x27;s what gain of function means in a biological context. When you have a mutation occur to a protein coding gene, one of two overall things can happen - nothing or something. Genetic code has some built in redundancies that mean that you can swap out some DNA base pairs and end up with the same protein in the end. If something happens, there&#x27;s broadly two types of thing that could happen to the resulting protein. You could have a loss of function - where the gene basically breaks, or a gain of funciton - where the gene either works better or gains the ability to do something new. (Of course &quot;nothing much happens&quot; is also an option here if the new protein is similar to the old one).<p>One important context this comes up in is cancer. You have genes in your genome that are actively stopping cancer from forming and spreading (tumor suppressor genes) as well as genes that would, if allowed to work unrestrained ( think a gene that signals for cell growth) would cause cancer (proto-oncogenes). A gain of function mutation in a proto-oncogene turns it into a cancer-driving oncogene, and a loss of function gene in tumor suppressors opens the door for oncogenes to do their work unrestrained.<p>In the context of this virus, the authors identified a mutation in the spike protein (one of the important proteins in the virus involved in a lot of its biological processes including infeting a cell) that is not present in it&#x27;s evolutionary cousins. Basically, this particular coronavirus spreading right now, even though it is very closely related to previous coronaviruses, seems to ahve this one bit in its genetic code that is starkly different, suggesting that this strain&#x2F;subspecies&#x2F;species picked up this mutation recently. Now, seeing that the new coronavirus has this genetic feature could indicate one of two things. Either, it&#x27;s just an artifact of the founders effect where the small population of viruses that jumped from that bat or snake or pangolin to a human would have genetic differences just by chance, and because that small population got blown up to a huge population, the mutation is just along for a ride. Or, it could be a factor in allowing this species to succeed in the first place.<p>OK, now to the actual mutation. The authors argue the latter - that this mutation might be important in the virus finding the success that it did. They basically found that this mutation leads to that part of the spike protein being more easily able to be cleaved (cut) by the protein Furin. This cleaving of the protein would better prime the virus to be able to infect cells and allow it to infect humans more specifically, and they note that Furin is highly expressed in the lungs as well. They note that a lot of experimental work has to be done to validate this, so it looks like they identified this computationally&#x2F;with sequence analysis, but it could prove an important lead in terms of figuring out why is this coronavirus more infective than others in humans and provide a new therapeutic target for tackling this strain of the virus.<p>So to summarize, there are many species of coronaviruses out there, including many related to this particular strain. In this strain, however, there&#x27;s a mutation that seems to be unique to it. THis mutaiton is a &quot;gain of function&quot; mutation, meaning that it allows the spike protein the mutation is in to work better or get new functionalities compared to SARS&#x2F;MERS viruses. (If it was a loss of function mutation - then you could reason that you would get something less infective since the protein wouldn&#x27;t be able to work). The hypothesized mechanism of gain of function in volves of protein highly expressed in the lung that could help explain why it&#x27;s so much more contagious than previous coronaviruses and also provide a target for therapeutic intervention. More experimental work needs to be done to validate it.<p>I hope that was clear and noot too detailed or too high level - please let me know if any aspect was confusing and if that was a helpful explanation."],"time":["2020-03-10 17:16:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jacobra2"],"id":[22536676],"kids":[22536816,22536717,22536792,22536713],"parent":[22535916],"text":["Given that:<p>* Almost none of the commenters understand what this post is about<p>* It spiked to the top of HN, despite that<p>* There are a handful of comments suggesting covid-19 is a bio weapon<p>I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this very post is manufactured to spread the bio weapon conspiracy."],"time":["2020-03-10 17:10:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["ohmanjjj"],"id":[22536585],"kids":{},"parent":[22535916],"text":["When will world governments finally admit we are dealing with a bio weapon engineered in a lab by a rogue group or nation."],"time":["2020-03-10 17:01:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["gumby"],"id":[22536463],"kids":[22536532],"parent":[22535916],"text":["Note that this is not sars-cov-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) though closely related."],"time":["2020-03-10 16:49:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["JohnJamesRambo"],"id":[22536625],"kids":[22536910],"parent":[22535916],"text":["Not to be tinfoil hat but isn’t this exactly the sort of thing you would add to it if you were making a bioweapon in the only BSL-4 lab in China which is a few meters from the wet market they are saying was the epicenter?<p>&gt; Strikingly, the 2019-nCoV S-protein sequence contains 12 additional nucleotides upstream of the single Arg<U+2193> cleavage site 1 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) leading to a predictively solvent-exposed PRRAR<U+2193>SV sequence, which corresponds to a canonical furin-like cleavage site (Braun and Sauter, 2019; Izaguirre, 2019; Seidah and Prat, 2012).
