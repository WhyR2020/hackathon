Both boil down to copying the bytes from the old object to the new object.  So there is never any benefit to calling std::move on such an object.  This is different from out-of-line containers like std::vector, where the std::vector object itself consists only of a pointer and some lengths. In that case, the move constructor just copies the pointer and length values themselves and nulls them out in the original object, without copying the underlying data.  But the copy constructor has to allocate a whole new heap buffer, copy the underlying data, and initialize the new vector object with <i>that<\/i> pointer.<p>- The godbolt links are building without optimization enabled (without -O settings)!  GCC apparently still performs (non-mandatory) NRVO in this case, probably because that optimization is implemented on the frontend rather than the backend, and the frontend tends to care less about -O settings.  But GCC does not perform the usual suite of backend optimizations, including inlining and memcpy elimination.  If optimizations were enabled, GCC might be able to optimize both versions into the same thing, depending on what actually happens in “&#x2F;&#x2F; Do some computation”.

Django 3.0 is going async which looks great on paper but in reality it needs work. It doesn&#x27;t have a built-in asset pipeline for modern js development on the front-end. It needs plugins for basic stuff like social, api auth etc. Python has libraries for almost everything but the web is not always a first class citizen.<p>PHP: It is by far the most popular backend language. Libraries are tailored for web development and are probably well maintained because they are used by huge projects(wordpress, magento etc). For the same reason it won&#x27;t disappear any time soon because it handles most of the information on the web and also billions of dollars in online commerce. Symfony has the most contributors than any backend framework and Laravel is probably the easiest framework to create an MVP with. Developers love Laravel and the community is huge. PHP is also improving and adopting new language features with a more advanced type system.<p>So the real question is why shouldn&#x27;t someone learn PHP in 2020 ?"],"time":["2020-08-21 20:16:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tambourine_man"],"id":[24235994],"kids":[24236106,24236161,24236169,24236410],"parent":[24235440],"text":["PHP is seeing a renascence and renewed interest similar to what happened with JavaScript a few decades ago.<p>A language that&#x27;s easy to make fun of but widely used is an attractive target for improvement."],"time":["2020-08-21 18:02:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toupeira"],"id":[24236267],"kids":[24237140],"parent":[24235440],"text":["Article with an overview of the changes: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stitcher.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;new-in-php-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stitcher.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;new-in-php-8<\/a><p>Some highlights are union types, a JIT compiler, named arguments, annotations, and match expressions.<p>The approach to named arguments is interesting.

Jet engines, like car engines, are not described by the &quot;Carnot cycle&quot;, and their efficiency is not governed by it. The Carnot cycle describes closed-system equipment like refrigerators and Nuke plants. Jet engines, like (our now obsolete) cars, start with new working fluid -- air -- at the intake, and discard it at the end -- exhaust. Their theoretical limit of efficiency is technically 100%, not the 30-40% typical of Carnot equipment. In practice, they don&#x27;t get close, but those huge ship engines do achieve up to 55%: they all take in air much, much cooler than their exhaust.<p>2. The change to the thrust vector is <i>not<\/i> a consequence of moving the engines forward. It is a simple result of the bigger engine diameter making the center farther below the wing. Moving the engines forward and up <i>reduced<\/i> the size of the change to the thrust vector -- just not enough so to match the old one. But the move had other effects, besides...<p>3. The added aerodynamic lift of the engine nacelles has <i>nothing<\/i> to do with more power being produced by the bigger engines. It is purely a product of the angle relative to the direction of air moving past. Bigger barrels have more area, and more lift, and moving them forward gave them more lever arm to apply their lift to rotate the plane instead of just holding it up, as wing lift does.<p>4. The change to the thrust vector is what makes punching the throttle <i>also<\/i> apply a force to rotate the airframe to a higher pitch angle. So there are two independent forces -- off-center lift, and off-center thrust -- both causing the same effect: pitching the plane up more than the pilot asked for. How much you get of each is a very complicated product of all the details of how the plane is flying.<p>5. On all 737s of any vintage, the controls really are still directly, physically connected, by steel cables, to the control surfaces -- the hinged bits at the back edges of wings and wing-shaped things. But there are hydraulics that also yank on the cables, and other stuff yanks on the control column, to doctor the pilot&#x27;s experience."],"time":["2020-08-21 20:33:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ppod"],"id":[24234147],"kids":[24234456],"parent":[24233339],"text":["Great article.

And the lift they produce is well ahead of the wing’s center of lift, meaning the nacelles will cause the 737 Max at a high angle of attack to go to a higher angle of attack. This is aerodynamic malpractice of the worst kind.<p>&gt;Apparently the 737 Max pitched up a bit too much for comfort on power application as well as at already-high angles of attack. It violated that most ancient of aviation canons and probably violated the certification criteria of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.<p>Pure bullshit.  Many low wing passenger aircraft have this tendency somewhere in their flight envelope.  You can tone it down with some aerodynamic trickery but it&#x27;s just a fundamental trade-off you get when the engines are below and forward of the wing, the load is above the wing and you pin the throttle.  The reason we got ht MAX debacle was because the new 737 had this tendency to a degree and in a portion of the flight envelope different than the old 737 which meant it couldn&#x27;t ride on the old 737&#x27;s cert without a bandage over that.  The 737 MAX8 handles perfectly reasonably for an airborne bus.  What it does not do is handle perfectly reasonably for a 737-800 hence the reason they overlaid half baked software taking inputs from less than adequate hardware systems (well they were adequate for the less critical systems they were designed to feed into).<p>&gt;Let’s review what the MCAS does: It pushes the nose of the plane down when the system thinks the plane might exceed its angle-of-attack limits; it does so to avoid an aerodynamic stall.<p>No.  It (when it&#x27;s no malfunctioning and trying to put you in a dive) pushes the nose down when you&#x27;re getting into the portions of the flight envelope where the MAX flies differently than the old 737 in order to fudge the same handling as the old 737 thereby skating by on the old cert.<p>Big disasters require many small things to go just right.  If the software was more robust this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the hardware was more robust this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the UX had been compatible with the pilots existing knowledge this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the airlines were willing to pony up for type certs this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  If the FAA had been hard asses this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.  To play it off as &quot;Boeing tried to fix a bad plane with software and failed, whoopies&quot; is exactly the kind of naive  surface level postmortem that results in nothing being learned and these kinds of failures happening again.

It&#x27;s about one-offs. You are not hiring them for a year, in which time they will do an indeterminate number of pieces of work. That is what an employee with a salary is for. You are hiring them to do a particular piece of work. That is why you <i>pay them<\/i> per piece of work. So to me, the simplest (and only) test should be: &quot;are you paying them per piece of work?&quot;. If yes, contractor.

Both Lyft and Uber have appealed the order, and the trial court stayed the injunction for ten days to allow them to seek relief in this court. Lyft (in case No. A160701) and Uber (in case No. A160706) have each petitioned this court for a writ of supersedeas. The People have filed an opposition to the petitions. The petitions for writ of supersedeas are hereby consolidated for purposes of decision. The petitions are granted and the preliminary injunction is stayed pending resolution of Lyft and Uber&#x27;s appeals, subject to the condition that, by 5:00 p.m. on August 25, 2020, Lyft and Uber shall both file written consents to the expedited procedures specified herein. If Lyft and Uber do not both file such written consents, the stay shall expire at 5:00 p.m. on August 25, 2020.<p>The procedures are as follows:<p>1. Lyft&#x27;s and Uber&#x27;s appeals shall be consolidated. Lyft and Uber may file separate briefs or combined briefs as they prefer.<p>2. Lyft and Uber shall proceed with an appendix in lieu of a clerk?s transcript on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.124.) They shall cooperate to prepare and file a single combined appellants&#x27; appendix, rather than separate appendices, which they shall file no later than the date they file their opening briefs. The appendix shall include a full copy of the index at the beginning of each appendix volume, and the digital copy of the appendix shall include pdf bookmark tabs for each entry on the index.<p>3. Briefing shall proceed on the following schedule. The appellants&#x27; opening briefs shall be filed no later than September 4, 2020. The respondent&#x27;s brief shall be filed no later than September 18, 2020. The reply briefs, if any, shall be filed no later than September 25, 2020. Absent unforeseen extraordinary circumstances, there shall be no extensions. Oral argument shall be scheduled for October 13, 2020.<p>4. On or before September 4, 2020, each defendant shall submit a sworn statement from its chief executive officer confirming that it has developed implementation plans under which, if this court affirms the preliminary injunction and Proposition 22 on the November 2020 ballot fails to pass, the company will be prepared to comply with the preliminary injunction within no more than 30 days after issuance of the remittitur in the appeal.<p>5. Should Lyft or Uber fail to comply with these procedures, the People may apply to this court to vacate this stay.

It was with Goldman. Accidentally, went long something like 10,000 shares of AMGN at the time. I remember it was an Amgen &#x2F; Biogen pairs trade. Clearly it was an &#x27;out trade&#x27; or mistake. I called Goldman&#x27;s desk immediately (the trading was of course all automated). Anyway, I talk to a Goldman trader. He looks up the order. Again, I&#x27;m long a lot more AMGN than I should&#x27;ve been and it&#x27;s very unusual. Back then you could call trading desks - not sure how automated it is now... If there was an accident involved, the fair thing to do is to &quot;bust the trades&quot; (originally based on trading floors, trading pits, etc.). And lots of trading firms had these relationships with brokers like Goldman back in the day. AMGN is trading up a bit from when these orders came in - so I&#x27;m actually making a little money off this mistake, but I just want to unwind &#x2F; exit this mistake. He agrees. I breath a sigh of relief.<p>I go back to trying to figure out what stupid infinite loop triggered this issue and make sure I&#x27;m completely out of everything (note, this was a huge learning lesson in my programming career in terms of always building in safety checks). 30 minutes go by and the trades aren&#x27;t busted. I call Goldman back and now am worried, as by this time Amgen stock has started to go down, so now these trades are really hurting more and more (20k, 30k, etc. in 2005 dollars for a young programmer&#x2F;trader). Now it&#x27;s in Goldman&#x27;s favor and I speak to another guy and they refuse to bust the trades.<p>Why do I mention this? Because again it&#x27;s all a matter of churn. They made implicitly the calculation of - is this going to jeopardize the trading activity our firm is giving Goldman and cause us to split up? If not, if the expected cost of churn is less than they can make via a short-term reward, they don&#x27;t care.<p>I now work for Amazon, and I recall Bezos saying he&#x27;d always be happy to make up a loss for a customer instead of losing them as a customer. While I think this is a good thing in the world, in a way it all comes down to churn (and LTV). And the true price of your reputation for future customers based on your reputation for treating customers.<p>Brigade Capital has to make that call. For me, Goldman as a company is doing fine (despite my never trusting them again after that) - so perhaps it was the right call for them to make (re: their culture -- certainly, an argument can be made that they&#x27;re not liable; however the other argument that they agreed verbally to the bust and then went back on their word...).<p>I&#x27;ve since left the trading industry, and strongly believe in long-term value &#x2F; valuing the relationship with the customer above all and, economically, the LTV of a customer. But I&#x27;m savvy enough to know that indeed an Amazon LTV is way way more than a single cost of an item. Now Amazon can&#x27;t refund every single order that is lapsed or it will really start to eat up LTV, but it makes a lot of economic sense to protect the customer relationship (it&#x27;s not just being nice).<p>But there&#x27;s always a tradeoff. Is 176.2 million worth it v. the reputation hit and increase in churn rate for existing customers + the lowered expectation of new customers? Perhaps for them it is. (Are they a 1B under management company? a 100B under management company?

For example, if you want to go from B to C, and there is a medium-distance bus covering B-C route, and one covering A-B-C-D route, the latter cannot accept you (you could also think of this as a mandatory gentleman&#x27;s agreement).

New space-based capabilities will be central to how militaries command and control their forces. Even more than today, future kill chains will flow through space, enabling militaries to distribute the process of understanding, deciding, and acting across large networks of systems rather than depending on single platforms to close the kill chain on their own. The result will be a dramatic expansion of &quot;time-sensitive targeting&quot;: the ability to find moving targets, track them, and strike them before they have moved away.<p>The proliferation of satellites, however, is only the beginning of the new space race. Spacecraft have always been limited by the impracticality of refueling them. They have only as much fuel as they could carry into space, and when it is gone, they cannot actively propel themselves any farther. This has restricted spacecraft to orbiting Earth, but emerging space technologies are changing that.<p>These technologies are being developed now. In the coming years, it will be possible to service, assemble, and manufacture complex orbital infrastructure in space that would be impractical to launch from Earth. This could include vast space-based solar power arrays to capture more of the sun&#x27;s energy than is possible on Earth, where our atmosphere absorbs or deflects it. Power-beaming technologies will transfer that energy around space. Space-based mining technologies could extract ice from the moon or asteroids, utilizing the underlying oxygen to fuel rockets and support human life in space. The means of production to support space operations will increasingly shift off Earth and into orbital bases and perhaps onto the moon, where spacecraft and other critical space infrastructure could be produced using 3-D printing and advanced manufacturing. It sounds like fantasy, but it is not.<p>In time, space will be transformed into a unique warfighting domain, and this will inevitably have military applications. Space operations in the coming decades will come to resemble maritime operations in the nineteenth century, when industrial age great powers built global networks of coaling stations and other infrastructure to project naval power in defense of their expanding commercial interests. A similar dynamic will occur in outer space, and the two states that will most shape humankind&#x27;s spacefaring future will be China and the United States. It is hard to imagine their strategic and military competition will remain confined to Earth.<p>Source: The Kill Chain, Defending America in the future of high-tech warfare, Christian Brose, Hachette Books, 2020."],"time":["2020-08-20 19:22:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ackbar03"],"id":[24226004],"kids":[24226623,24229151,24226408],"parent":[24224199],"text":["Does anybody have any ideas as to what opportunities might open up for lightweight start ups from the general trend of decreasing launch costs?

The scenario in the Docker image is I believe the exact one that this is intended to provide sanity for, since you have two Pythons in play— the Debian-packaged python and also the built-from-source Python. Things get hairy once you start using the pip from either of these pythons to start installing pypi packages, especially if those packages or their dependencies have compiled parts which may not work for the other Python. Anyone who has used a Mac with brewed Python has also likely experienced this pain— especially in the days before wheels, where you basically had to use brewed Python for scientific work unless you wanted to compile big packages like numpy from source.<p>So the deal is that the system-supplied Python can get deps from apt packages, or from pip (into ~&#x2F;.local, or as root into &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local), but either way will install them into a dist-packages directory. This keeps them separate from the packages which the built-from-source Python installs into site-packages.<p>Upstream Python has put a bunch of pieces in place to address this natively, for example with the &quot;magic&quot; tags that keep compiled assets separate in a directory of packages being potentially used by multiple different interpreters (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-3147&#x2F;#proposal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-3147&#x2F;#proposal<\/a>).

I mean, it&#x27;s not a PhD thesis or anything, but there&#x27;s some insights worth pondering, tucked away in this article.<p>The gist is here:<p><i>Now, we are approaching a new barrier — ideas that require not just extreme depth in one field, but depth in two or sometimes even more fields simultaneously.<\/i><p><i>Take synethtic biology and the future of pharmaceuticals. There is a popular and now well-funded thesis on crossing machine learning and biology&#x2F;medicine together to create the next generation of pharma and clinical treatment. The datasets are there, the patients are ready to buy, and the old ways of discovering new candidates to treat diseases look positively ancient against a more deliberate and automated approach afforded by modern algorithms.<\/i><p><i>Moving the needle even slightly here though requires enormous knowledge of two very hard and disparate fields. AI and bio are domains that get extremely complex extremely fast, and also where researchers and founders quickly reach the frontiers of knowledge.<\/i><p>I would agree with that sentiment in the general sense. And there&#x27;s probably some interesting things to be gained by thinking deeply about how to address that problem.<p>The only part of this I found myself disagreeing with somewhat is here:<p><i>We’ve gone through the generation of startups you can do as a dropout from high school or college, hacking a social network out of PHP scripts or assembling a computer out of parts at a local homebrew club. We’ve also gone through the startups that required a PhD in electrical engineering, or biology, or any of the other science and engineering fields that are the wellspring for innovation.<\/i><p>While I agree that it&#x27;s probably getting <i>harder<\/i> to come up with something really innovative without that &quot;fusion&quot; approach alluded to above, I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s not possible. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t see being &quot;the next no code startup&quot; or &quot;the next cryptocurrency startup&quot; as being a Bad Thing - so long as you do it in a way that&#x27;s appreciably better than &quot;the other folks&quot; doing the same thing.<p>Sure, inventing something Brand New is nice, but you can make money making a &quot;nicer version of something that already exists&quot;, or by just innovating on business model while the product is unchanged (or mostly so)."],"time":["2020-08-19 22:13:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hogFeast"],"id":[24218751],"kids":{},"parent":[24208828],"text":["If you are in SV, it can seem like the world is moving very fast (and within SV, the number of things that people are trying and call &quot;technology&quot; is much larger than the number of things that people outside SV either want or need).
