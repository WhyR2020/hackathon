Which meant that the expectations of what my team could accomplish, was wildly inaccurate.<p>So for the year I stayed on.

It feels like there is nothing else to care about besides work; I am single and while I had an active social life that&#x27;s naturally very limited during COVID. Often on Saturday and Sunday I&#x27;m just waiting for it to be Monday, and at least once I worked through Saturday afternoon since I had nothing else to do.<p>All the extra work feels completely unappreciated. I got wrapped into a roller coaster of a conflict with my lead - within one week he said I wasn&#x27;t performing at entry level, then was begging me not to leave the team. That just keeps escalating (it&#x27;s dragging through HR now, but nobody is, according to them, going on a PIP). The experience is, I think, driven by COVID - my lead&#x27;s mental health is degrading, and I&#x27;m suffering as a result.<p>I&#x27;m working hard, with no clear expectations, and no clear understanding of what the point of that work is. I was promised a new position when I joined this team, and I don&#x27;t know if that will ever come (it&#x27;s been  close to 2 months since my lead and I can have a normal conversation). I am paid very well (yay, the stock is up) but there&#x27;s no way to spend that money (clothes nobody sees?  Trips to closed down cities?).<p>Meanwhile all my other outlets for energy are cut off. Most of my friends are either sliding into depression or screaming at me to somehow care even more about the political disaster of the day. There&#x27;s no dating, there&#x27;s no bars, there&#x27;s no clubs. All the events I look forward to every year are canceled. All my spots are permanently closing down one at a time.<p>So there&#x27;s only work, and the story there isn&#x27;t very different from my friends; mental health is declining among everybody I know. Sick days are up, people are asking me how my conversations with HR about depression went last year since they&#x27;re going to have one soon.

The reason, of course, is that it would have been seen as inefficient and profit-robbing.<p>&gt;Seen in this light, at least some inefficiency is like an insurance policy. Think about your own situation. Every year that you don’t get into a car accident and your house doesn’t burn down and you stay healthy, you could think to yourself that you have ‘wasted’ your money on various pointless insurance products, and that you’d be financially better off without all those insurance premiums to pay.<p>This is a faulty claim. Traditional economic efficiency would say we _should_ stockpile medical supplies if it were more efficient for the markets in the long-term, which it would have been. The issue here is that _governments_ and experts didn&#x27;t work together effectively (despite experts regularly noting the possibility of a pandemic, for example, Gates et al.) and the fact that our government generally isn&#x27;t Keynesian.

We could solve it by being &quot;less efficient&quot; (extracting less from the earth — and in fact, a Keynesian approach to that would be taxation to slow growth in harmful industries) but zoomed out, if we deal with global warming, we are more efficient over the long run. Moreover, we want to be _efficient_ in our development of green technologies.<p>The trouble isn&#x27;t so much efficiency, it&#x27;s zeroing in on making particular processes efficient to the detriment of the whole across time and in the present moment."],"time":["2020-08-22 03:50:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devilduck"],"id":[24237199],"kids":{},"parent":[24236489],"text":["Pace is relative and I think teams will generally average out in terms of pace.

As the post states, it was clear as far back as 2010 (and honestly earlier), that XUL extensions were both Firefox&#x27;s killer feature and also the reason that it got its ass kicked by Chrome (and to a lesser-extent, Safari). Extensions were amazing but the tax it created for performance, development, and security ended up becoming what made the browser so slow. Chrome and Safari didn’t have extensions but they had speed and built-in features that replicated many of the most popular extensions. And once Chrome added extensions support — and support that didn’t require that add-on development tax — it was over.<p>I found this bit of the post really telling:<p>&gt; And yet, there was no choice for Mozilla. Every day that Mozilla didn’t ship Electrolysis was one day that Chrome was simply better in terms of architecture, safety and security. Unfortunately, Mozilla delayed Electrolysis by years, in part because of the illusion that the Firefox benchmarks were better enough that it wouldn’t matter for a long time, in part because we decided to test-drive Electrolysis with FirefoxOS before Firefox itself, but mostly because we did not want to lose all these add-ons.<p>&gt;In the end, Mozilla decided to introduce WebExtensions and finally make the jump towards e10s as part of the Quantum Project. We had lost years of development that we would never recover.<p>This aligns with what has always been my personal view which is that Mozilla waited too long to make the changes it needed to compete with Chrome and by the time it finally did the hard thing and lose extensions and start over.<p>When you consider that there was still time after Chrome was released but before Quantum where IE had the largest browser share (it wasn’t a long period of time post-Chrome, but it existed), that’s indicates to me that there was time both before and after Chrome&#x27;s introduction for Mozilla to rip the band-aid off and drop XUL for the greater good of the browser. After all, IE didn’t have extensions in any comprehensive way, which could have given Firefox to refactor and approach.

I think things have improved a lot in early 2000s when better build scripts were introduced and you actually had links to packages you needed: back before that, there was no way anyone would build a LFS system over a weekend, as I see people reporting here (not the least because most Internet access was dial-up).<p>So first up: have time and desire to learn.

I just wish the brief tangent about BBSes had also mentioned dial-up BBS MUDs, but I understand the omission considering the article&#x27;s length, as well as BBS MUDs&#x27; lack of geographic ubiquity. The most compelling aspect of dial-up BBS MUDs was community locality: all of the players generally lived in your metro area.<p>In the 90s, the only popular BBS MUDs ran on the MajorBBS&#x2F;WorldGroup BBS software, which was technologically impressive for its time -- it could handle dozens of modems and concurrent users on a single PC running DOS, and supported pluggable games&#x2F;modules using an event-loop callback architecture. However, it was also incredibly expensive for the SysOp to purchase, as were its games. This meant that any given metro area typically only had a few MBBS&#x2F;WG BBSes, and they tended to be pay-for-access systems.<p>By far the most popular MBBS&#x2F;WG MUD was MajorMUD, although there were also some fairly successful predecessors (e.g. TeleArena, Mutants, Swords of Chaos) and successors (e.g. The Rose: Council of Guardians). These games were typically &quot;stock&quot; -- they had sprawling game worlds but were identical on each BBS, with little or no built-in ability for the SysOp to edit the world. Despite that, each game&#x27;s &quot;feel&quot; still naturally differed between each BBS just based on the local community.<p>As a teen MajorMUD addict, I always wanted to run my own board one day, but the cost was prohibitive. This eventually inspired me to write my own BBS MUD as an affordable doorgame for hobbyist&#x2F;lower-end systems, which at ~20K LOC was the first large program I ever wrote. It did relatively well for its time period (BBSes were dying out by that point) but rarely achieved large concurrent user counts on many boards, which was an inherent downside to aiming for the smaller boards."],"time":["2020-08-21 16:26:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevesearer"],"id":[24234596],"kids":{},"parent":[24221010],"text":["I spent an embarrassing amount of time playing MUDs beginning in high school all the way throughout and after college.<p>Perhaps all MUDs did this, but my MUD of choice (Revenge of the Jedi RotJ) tallied your total playing time in your player stats.<p>The way I got started was that a few friends from school were playing and talking about it.

Around 1992 or so, our family bought our first computer (when I was around 5 years old) which was an Acorn A3000 running (if I recall correctly) RISC OS 2 on ROM. The school I went to also had Acorn computers (including the RISC PC toward the latter half of the 1990’s).<p>Nowadays I consider myself extraordinarily privileged to have experienced RISC OS on Acorn hardware in its heyday.\nI see so many things in modern computing inspired by RISC OS. The taskbar in modern era Windows and Mac OS is remarkably similar to RISC OS 2 which was released in 1988. RISC OS was also an early pioneer of anti-aliasing fonts and had it years before it appeared in Windows.<p>However, sadly, there are many things now lost to history. A machine running RISC OS 2 booted in literally &lt;3 seconds. It was basically just a console screen with “RISC OS 2048K” (or something along those lines) and a second or two later you were at the desktop. It is near impossible to find any modern computing device that boots as quick as the A3000 running RISC OS did.<p>RISC OS also had a wonderful file-save dialog which was simply the file icon—which you were to simply drag and drop directly to the folder you wanted to save the file to! Given you usually had the right folder open anyway, it was usually a case of just dragging to your already open folder. So much more sensible than having to search for a folder in a small explorer window.<p>Thanks to all involved. Acorn and their RISC OS sparked a lifelong interest in computers.

I don&#x27;t know if you remember, a second processor was done with that 32016 and Nat Semi had produced a poster that said &quot;32016 is not a late 16 bit machine it&#x27;s an early 32 bit machine&quot;, a year later we crossed out &#x27;early&#x27; and wrote &#x27;late&#x27; on it.

They generate Load&#x2F;Store, add, subtract, and&#x2F;or, compare, branch, that&#x27;s about it really, the rest of them, unless you&#x27;re writing in assembler, you just don&#x27;t use them, so they&#x27;re a complete waste.<p>Now, the aforementioned, Arthur Norman, who had written the LISP interpreter for the BBC Micro, and was in and out of Acorn the whole time, had come up with a design for a machine with 3 instructions called the SKI machine.

It has been mankind’s oldest and greatest tool for reshaping the natural world. “Tool,” however, is not quite the right word; unlike an inanimate knife, fire has a life of its own. It is, at best, a “semidomesticate,” appearing unbidden and, if not guarded carefully, escaping its shackles to become dangerously feral.<p>Hominids’ use of fire is historically deep and pervasive. Evidence for human fires is at least 400,000 years old, long before our species appeared on the scene. Thanks to hominids, much of the world’s flora and fauna consist of fire-adapted species (pyrophytes) that have been encouraged by burning. The effects of anthropogenic fire are so massive that they might be judged, in an evenhanded account of the human impact on the natural world, to overwhelm crop and livestock domestications. Why human fire as landscape architect doesn’t register as it ought to in our historical accounts is perhaps that its effects were spread over hundreds of millennia and were accomplished by “precivilized” peoples also known as “savages.” In our age of dynamite and bulldozers, it was a very slow-motion sort of environmental landscaping. But its aggregate effects were momentous.<p>Our ancestors could not have failed to notice how natural wildfires transformed the landscape: how they cleared old vegetation and encouraged a host of quick-colonizing grasses and shrubs, many bearing desired seeds, berries, fruits, and nuts. They could also not have failed to notice that a fire drove fleeing game from its path, exposed hidden burrows and nests of small game, and, most important, later stimulated the browse and mushrooms that attracted grazing prey. Native North Americans deployed fire to sculpt landscapes favored by elk, deer, beaver, hare, porcupine, ruffed grouse, turkey, and quail, all of which they hunted. The game they subsequently bagged represented a kind of harvesting of prey animals they had deliberately assembled by carefully creating a habitat they would find enticing. Quite apart from being the designers of hunting grounds—veritable game parks—early humans used fire to hunt large game. The evidence suggests that long before the bow and arrow appeared, roughly twenty thousand years ago, hominids were using fire to drive herd animals off precipices and to drive elephants into bogs where, immobilized, they could more easily be killed.<p>Fire was the key to humankind’s growing sway over the natural world— a species monopoly and trump card, worldwide. The Amazonian rain forest bears indelible traces of the use of fire to clear land and open the canopy; Australia’s eucalyptus landscape is, to a considerable degree, the effect of human fire. The volume of such landscaping in North America was such that when it stopped abruptly, due to the devastating epidemics that came with the European, the newly unchecked growth of forest cover created the illusion among white settlers that North America was a virtually untouched, primeval forest. According to some climatologists, the cold spell known as the Little Ice Age, from roughly 1500 to 1850, may well have been due to the reduction of CO2—a greenhouse gas—brought about by the die-off of North America’s indigenous fire farmers.<\/i><p>Scott, James C..

My reasons, in no particular order:<p>First, it was Yet Another Communications Channel to Check.  You know, email, phone, voicemail, meetings, standups, calendar appointments, and so on.  It was one more place I had to scan through on an event loop.  I would pay more attention to Slack only to miss something somewhere else.  Where was communication happening?  Anywhere.  And Slack made it worse because we had a skillion channels proliferate, so it wasn&#x27;t as if Slack were <i>one<\/i> email inbox, it was dozens.<p>Second, Agile Cosplayer #1 was busy posting random things like his Spotify playlist for the day (I don&#x27;t have Spotify) and other stuff.  You can&#x27;t even &#x2F;ignore like in IRC.<p>It seemed especially silly when all of us were within ten feet of each other.<p>Partially my fault: I was late to the smartphone game and have no idea what roughly half the emojis meant, and so I was missing whatever emotional tenor of a lot of messages.<p>Probably the worst part was that the expectation was that always had one eye on Slack instead of, you know, focusing on programming.  There was no &quot;getting back to&quot; someone on it.  It was expected I would have it on my smartphone (newly purchased) and have it just running all the freakin&#x27; time.<p>Most of this comes down to local implementation, hence I can point the finger quite a bit at Agile Cosplay, but boy oh boy, does Slack enable and encourage some lousy local implementations."],"time":["2020-08-21 16:36:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chundicus"],"id":[24230697],"kids":[24235683,24248569],"parent":[24230447],"text":["A lot of my CEO and founder friends talk about this&quot;... rephrased: &quot;My CEO and founder friends are upset that their employees use a piece of software to talk about the toxic culture my CEO and founder friends have cultivated&quot;"],"time":["2020-08-21 02:43:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["outworlder"],"id":[24230875],"kids":[24231012,24230944],"parent":[24230447],"text":["Oh, they are doing &quot;unprofessional&quot; things in a tool that facilitates informal communication now, are they?<p>Well.
