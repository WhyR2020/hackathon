The symptoms sounds suspiciously like Covid19. Two people die. [1]<p>2) Three months later, on October 18, 2019, French athletes that attended the Military World Games in Wuhan reported testing positive for the Covid19 antibodies.

They report it to the W.H.O. on December 31, 2019.<p>5) China checks past records, and determines an earlier infection was on November 17, 2019. [3] About a month before their previous first known case.<p>6) A New Jersey mayor tests positive for the antibodies, and claims he got sick in November 2019, a month before China detected their first known case. [4]<p>7) December 27, 2019, A woman in Seattle [5], with no travel history to China, who tested positive for the antibodies, claims she got sick two days after Christmas. This is 4 days before China reports the virus to the W.H.O. And three weeks before Seattle’s first official case.<p>8) Jan 26, 2020, The Lancet theorizes that the virus did not originate from the seafood market.

With mugur, you only have to define one big list in your init.el file, with all the layers and keys in a single place. No other extra code needed. After playing around with it for a bit, I find it is easier and faster to explore all kinds of usage scenarios to squeeze every bit of potential from these wonderful programmable machines.<p>I&#x27;m already using mugur to generate the Ergodox configuration that I&#x27;ve used to write by hand before. By hand, meaning writing C code. I&#x27;m expecting there to still be bugs and little wrinkles, but now, at the beginning of an enterprise, it is the best time to try things out and ask for missing features or point out horrible mistakes. So I&#x27;ll gladly hear your thoughts on it. I&#x27;m only supporting Ergodox at the moment since this is what I own and this is what I use. If there really is a need for other keyboards, it is my belief that that can be fixed in the future. If there is no such need, there is no point for me coding stuff for a distant future that never comes.<p>Mihai"],"time":["2020-05-20 11:27:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nickdrozd"],"id":[23254260],"kids":[23254745],"parent":[23244891],"text":["I&#x27;m not an Ergodox user (yet), but this looks pretty cool.

(&#x27;cmov&#x27; is an instruction that implements &#x27;(a=c?b:a)&#x27; without a conditional branch.)<p>Partition is an essential component of numerous key algorithms; almost half of C++ STL algorithms depend on it. A key primitive to implement partition is the &#x27;swap_if&#x27; operation. Performance of this operation thus directly determines the performance of many important algorithms. For best performance with word-sized arguments, &#x27;swap_if&#x27; must be implemented with a pair of back-to-back &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions.<p>Gcc got its fingers burned a few years ago from emitting &#x27;cmov&#x27; in loop contexts where the condition was predictable and the result immediately depended upon in the next iteration, creating dependency chains that slowed execution of some benchmarks by a factor of 2. Now, Gcc will never, under any circumstances, emit two &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions in one basic block.<p>Clang is happy to emit a pair of back-to-back &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions, which enables it to perform partition operations very substantially faster than Gcc. However, it fails to generate &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions in important cases.<p>The fully general expression  of &#x27;swap_if&#x27; looks like:<p><pre><code>  template &lt;typename T&gt;\n  bool swap_if(\n    bool c, T&amp; a, T&amp; b)\n  {\n    T v[2] = { a, b };\n    b = v[1-c], a = v[c];\n    return c;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nIt may be used in the inner loop of quicksort&#x27;s partition operations as<p><pre><code>  right += swap_if(\n    *left &lt; pivot,\n    *left, *right);\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA &#x27;swap_if&#x27; implemented with &#x27;cmov&#x27; makes quicksort fully twice as fast as, e.g., current &#x27;std::sort&#x27;.  However, neither Gcc nor Clang recognizes this &#x27;swap_if&#x27; as a place to substitute &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions for the pointer&#x2F;offset accesses. (The latter are slower, probably because they produce more L1 bus traffic.)<p>Clang will happily emit &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions for a specialization like<p><pre><code>  template &lt;&gt;\n  bool swap_if(\n    bool c, int&amp; a, int&amp; b)\n  {\n    int v[2] = { a, b };\n    a =  -c&amp;v[1] | 1-c&amp;v[0];\n    b = 1-c&amp;v[0] |  -c&amp;v[1];\n    return c;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nwhere Gcc emits exactly the &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;or&#x27; instructions.\n(Interestingly, Gcc&#x27;s code for both definitions, despite failing to use &#x27;cmov&#x27;, runs quicksort quite a lot faster than std::sort; just not 2x as fast.) Clang will also emit &#x27;cmov&#x27; instructions for<p><pre><code>  bool swap_if(\n    bool c, int&amp; a, int&amp; b)\n  {\n    int ta = a, tb = b;\n    a = c ? tb : ta;\n    b = c ? ta : tb;\n    return c;\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nbut Gcc will only produce very slow (i.e. badly predicted) branches for this case.<p>If we had &#x27;std::swap_if&#x27; in the C++ Standard Library, probably all implementations would produce good code for it.<p>(As an aside, I find it odd that changing the second line of the template &#x27;swap_if&#x27; above to<p><pre><code>  a = v[c], b = v[!c];\n<\/code><\/pre>\nmakes it much, much slower when compiled with Gcc for recent Intel.

Don&#x27;t use them.<p>It&#x27;d be nice if rants like this also reflect on why these frameworks <i>do<\/i> exist. Then people would actually learn something.<p>Here are some of the tradeoffs I considered when evaluating JAMStack vs flask&#x2F;jinja server side rendering.<p>1. Low latency interactivity unlocks all kinds of user interaction optimizations for us. The size of the initial download is amortized over hundreds to thousands of lightening fast interactions.<p>2. It&#x27;s difficult to manage complexity around large html&#x2F;css deployments, since CSS is a global namespace. Devs use all kinds of conventions for modularizing CSS. You can definitely succeed with these strategies, but when you&#x27;re juggling tens of thousands of lines of CSS, it&#x27;s a lot easier to solve these problems using a real programming language and its module system. We anticipated thousands of lines of CSS over time.<p>3. Immutability makes whole classes of race conditions unlikely to impossible. Do things still race in React? Of course. Are they vastly less likely to happen? Yes.<p>4. Managing interactivity through server-client interaction shifts a ton of complexity to the backend that the browser could otherwise handle. If you&#x27;re designing a multi-stage form, for example, you often have to save incomplete user submissions in servers, depending on use case. Offloading this to localstorage on the frontend is a lot easier to author and maintain.<p>5. If you host your frontend statically on CDNs, that&#x27;s several orders of magnitude less traffic you have to scale your web servers for. The vast majority of my company&#x27;s traffic is handled by Cloudfront, making our operational footprint tiny.<p>Are there also reasons the modern stack sucks? Yes.<p>1. Configuring react and webpack is incredibly, incredibly hard. Webpack exposes a vast array of knobs that most applications don&#x27;t benefit from tuning.<p>2. Time to first load is absurdly slow and server side rendering is, again, very complex to implement. React is not the right choice for a blog or anything that is sensitive to bounce rates.<p>3. MUI&#x27;s documentation and APIs are painful, as OP notes.<p>For these reasons, and because most of our application was interactive, not read-only, we went with JAMStack.<p>I definitely think there&#x27;s a place for the traditional HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;jQuery stack. Read-only sites, for starters, with limited feature complexity. Everything I&#x27;ve built in the last several years has grown in complexity and features at a faster-than-linear rate, however, and these new technologies make managing such codebases vastly simpler."],"time":["2020-05-22 00:46:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chad_strategic"],"id":[23266138],"kids":{},"parent":[23265129],"text":["One time I had to use Ember as the front end and drupal API as the backend.

Scanning localhost is a dangerous way to fingerprint the user if there are local open ports.<p>If you are not using Tor Browser and want to fix the security hole without disabling WebSocket completely, running the web browser in a separate network namespace is a workaround - you get a loopback interface which is independent from the main namespace, and you create a NAT interface within the network namespace to allow outgoing traffic. It&#x27;s also a possibility for a website to probe other machines, such as the setting page on your router. For better protection, you should block all the local addresses defined by RFC1918 via netfilter&#x2F;iptables as well.<p>For developers who needs less restrictive blocking for debugging, you can run multiple Firefox processes in different profiles (<i>firefox -P --new-instance<\/i>), each running in a different network namespace - to make it easy, you can code everything in a shell script and create desktop icons for them.

Port scanning is just about checking to see what services a host is offering you. It&#x27;s like going to a random shop at a mall and asking what services they provide.

Maybe the response was a mistake on the programmers part, maybe it was a mistake in how the shop owner used the script (a configuration error).

Two very obvious related guesses from my experience:<p>1.  Fingerprinting a user to help identify account takeover (ATO).  Open port signatures is probably a pretty good signal for that kind of thing (and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be measured in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panopticlick.eff.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panopticlick.eff.org&#x2F;<\/a>).<p>&gt;  However it is also a valid tool used by administrators for remote access to machines, or by some end user support software, so the presence of VNC is a poor indicator of malware.<p>2.  In a Bayesian sense, this probably isn&#x27;t right.  I don&#x27;t know what eBay&#x27;s traffic looks like but I&#x27;m willing to bet that all other things being equal, traffic coming from a machine with an open VNC port is riskier.  Fraud detection is a game of probabilities, so the existence of a valid user showing a particular characteristic doesn&#x27;t mean that the characteristic isn&#x27;t useful in a fraud model.  The example I always give is that when I was doing this (quite some time ago), we could have had a 99% accuracy rate for a simple rule banning IPs from Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria, and Vietnam.

One is that applications supporting accessibility or scripting interfaces are really, really important: they let other apps interact with your program in ways you may have never imagined, &quot;for free&quot;.<p>Another is that platforms have been locking down on cross-application access for quite a while, for security reasons. Reading or writing a process&#x27;s memory is a big no-no these days, since it effectively lets you inherit the privileges of that application, and some operating systems will prevent you from doing it altogether no matter how much privileges you have. The latter operating systems have also begin to lock down the APIs that give programmatic control as well, which is somewhat sad…<p>Finally, when doing things like this try to see if you can find the &quot;highest level&quot; to do such hackery at. Ideally, the app has functionality built-in to do what you want, and if that doesn&#x27;t work see if the accessibility APIs can help. Then see if you can find functions in the binary to call, and then as a last resort you can touch data structures in memory. This is because using higher-level APIs is more likely to keep things working: you might be changing the string in memory, but some code at a &quot;higher level&quot; might not expect that and misbehave. Perhaps it cached the string&#x27;s length or thinks it has exclusive access to that memory so it overwrites your modifications.

Not sure if this was an oversight by the MS windows group, or it was intentional to allow for developers to obfuscate text output in various ways. Thing is, this breaks screen readers. So microsoft got to create a library that unbreaks their API, which I personally found very amusing at the time.<p>Also you should know, that the library makes it obvious it&#x27;s being used if the client has enough privileges. I don&#x27;t remember the details because I never needed to care. But it&#x27;s some combination of adding a process in task manager, and making an obvious fingerprint in memory. I think this was to appease complaints of use by more nefarious purposes than screen readers. My understanding is that companies like Blizzard know how to find you&#x27;re using detours, if you don&#x27;t go out of your way to modify the library before compiling it.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;project&#x2F;detours&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;project&#x2F;detours&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-20 22:40:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aabajian"],"id":[23248715],"kids":[23251432,23253284,23250403],"parent":[23246221],"text":["I&#x27;m a radiology resident.

It also means that when dependencies change, we just update our nix config, and the new dependencies will automatically be fetched for all of our engineers and CI machines — no need to manually re-run the setup script.<p>This is my favorite part of Nix — you can do `nix-shell --run &quot;&lt;some command&gt;&quot;`, and it will make sure you have all of the correct dependencies (downloading if necessary), then run the command with those exact dependencies.

You need to internalize their advice and techniques (as OP managed to do on their own), and therapy is about creating a facilitative environment to alter that conception of self.<p>In therapy, you are unconditionally accepted with positive regard, which facilitates viewing yourself more clearly without the need to lean on self-defeating coping mechanisms, like self-pity or shifting blame. As social creatures we instinctively perform a lot of mirroring of others&#x27; mental state, so simply by being accepted we are able to try on what it is like to accept ourselves. It&#x27;s leveraging an additional set of tools baked into us at a deep level to build self awareness and a more positive, realistic self model.<p>If you&#x27;re struggling, I&#x27;d like to echo others and strongly recommend you reach out to a psychiatrist and psychologist if they are within reach for you.

I imagine this is what lepers felt. Everone goes out of their way to stay safe. Being close might make you sick. I and you are hosts for the viral plague. Out to cause our fellow human beings with unneccesary suffering with our pesky needs to see other human faces. See a strangers frown or smile. \n2 days ago I went to the mall for some food and just get, once completely  norma, take away coffee. I met an old collegue and she broke all protocol and just spontaniosly hugged me. \nI started to sob. Unctrollably. I think the last time someone touched me was march. Or maybe late february. \nI have a therapist. Losing access to her did not bother me all that much. \nI have no financial issues or physical ailments. \nI have spent these past few months sobbing, randomly. Pulling myself out of bed, wondering if its tuesday or saturday. Wondering why I could not just die in my sleep so I dont have to face another day of being an absolutely useless piece of space that no one cares about.\nThat hug broke something awful and my poor chocked collegue may never know what an incredible gesture that completely normal sentiment was for me. I no longer feel like a disgusting host for viral pestilence. The gym opens in a week. And if it closes down again. At least this time I know what to expect and can prepare."],"time":["2020-05-21 00:00:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brutusborn"],"id":[23252667],"kids":{},"parent":[23250234],"text":["I read this after another sleepless night and it made me cry.<p>I have had &quot;go back to therapist&quot; on my todo list for too long.

Seen a handful of psychologists, and wished they worked. As mentioned in the article, it takes an enormous amount of time to get someone else &#x27;up to speed&#x27; on you, your history, your proclivities, and your hypothesizes. I did it a few times, but had mixed experiences. Still think psychologists are a very good resource, its just takes time to find a good one.<p>During treatment, I tried a multitude of the standard anti-depressants, which merely masked the symptoms for myself. For others, these options work much better.<p>After being frustrated from my last therapist, I decided to dive into the research, and self-experiment. After 5 or so years, the following has helped immensely. I still have my lows, but they feel normal, and expected:<p>* Exercise: My constant irritation against those that just wanted to help, made it hard to let them in. So my anger and resentment was turned to weight lifting, and focusing on muscle building. I tend to overthink, so this was a good way to still continue to analyze, but also tire me out into a meditative-like state. The key for me was not to just go through the motions of the workout (though some days that&#x27;s all I did), but to feed into that primal urge for aggression, put on intense workout music (mine was heavy rock), and exert as much energy into defeating my sets as possible. I agreed to do 10 reps for this last set? F-that, I&#x27;m doing 12. Nope 14. (within reason)<p>* Food: If you&#x27;ve read my past comments, you&#x27;ll know I eat carnivore. This isn&#x27;t to proselytize the diet, though it has had the largest positive impact on my emotional well being compared to anything else. Rather, its to point out that diet plays a key role. If you&#x27;re eating something that&#x27;s inflammatory to your gut, your emotional state may be the victim. This isn&#x27;t the case for all instances of depression, but the research is mounting [0][1] Though these resources contradict my attitude towards many (not all) plants, the point is find what diet is right for you, even to at least eliminate that possibility. For me, if I stray into a problematic food, I am intensely depressed for at least a day or more, reminding me of what I worked to &#x27;cure&#x27;.<p>* Time to yourself: As others have pointed out, meditation is great. So is yoga (especially hot yoga, if you like a challenge). Start slow, but what I&#x27;ve found for myself is that as my self-discipline increases, my confidence and mood do as well. From normal yoga, to 80 degree, to 95 degree, the challenge and (enjoyable) &#x27;pain&#x27; in the moment, leads to a euphoric bliss of calmness after.<p>* Sun: Vitamin D deficiency is shown to have many issues related to depression, immune health and others. Depending on where you live, and how much melanin you have, you may need more than you think. Spend time outdoors during sunny periods (without sunscreen) for a time that&#x27;s appropriate (you&#x27;ll have to test yourself to find your optimal amount). Ask your doctor for vitamin D tests on a regular basis, so you have data to test your hypothesis.<p>* Socializing: Introvert or extrovert, some communication (whether in person or over the web) is generally seen as a positive thing for many. At times I didn&#x27;t want to interact with anyone, as I would just hate my own existence, and their happiness as well. So in times like those I&#x27;d join forums or play games with people online. Something to get out of your own head. Or immerse yourself in a book, &#x27;socializing&#x27; with the characters.<p>Hope this helps someone, I understand all too well the deep, endless darkness that is depression. It&#x27;s always lurking around the corner, and sometimes I forget how bad it is, until I slip up. But there is a way out, it just has to be your way.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;diet-and-depression-2018022213309\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;diet-and-depression-2018...<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;mind-and-mood&#x2F;food-and-mood-is-there-a-connection\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;mind-and-mood&#x2F;food-and-mood-i...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-20 23:24:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ryanianian"],"id":[23251763],"kids":{},"parent":[23250234],"text":["This is such an uplifting article.

Comments like this only serve to reinforce the stigma around these medications. This stigma is the part of the reason why I held out from seeking help for years.<p>My experience taking Mirtazapine has been the exact opposite. At the deepest point of my depression, that is when I was &quot;numb&quot;. Like many people I would listen to sad music when I was depressed, but eventually sad music didn&#x27;t make me feel sad anymore, I literally just felt nothing.<p>Since being on Mirtazapine, my depression is gone for the first time in 13 years and it&#x27;s completely changed my life. I still have the full human emotional range - I have good&#x2F;bad moods (mostly good), days where I feel bored&#x2F;meh, I cry at the sad parts in films. The antidepressants cured my depression, they haven&#x27;t given me a false sense of inflated happiness. The question of &quot;am I actually happy?&quot; doesn&#x27;t even really cross my mind. I&#x27;m just content.<p>The only side effects I experienced were 3 days of extreme tiredness when I first started taking them, which then subsided. And my appetite increased, so I have gained a few pounds, but since I was already quite skinny and had started lifting weights, this has been a net plus.<p>I found this lecture by Stanford professor Robert Sapolsky highly insightful - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc<\/a> - We all get depressed, it&#x27;s a normal part of life, but depression is a disease which causes you to stay depressed for no reason, and it&#x27;s as real of a disease as diabetes (we know this because the brains of people with depression look different, even when they&#x27;re sleeping)<p>What&#x27;s weird is that, when I was depressed, I already knew everything that he says in that video. I doubt this will make sense, but it was as if I knew it, without really &quot;knowing&quot; it. I knew I had depression. I knew how depression affected the brain. I knew how antidepressants worked. But if you&#x27;d asked me if I wanted them, I would have said no.<p>One thing that I have come to realise, is that I had to unlearn all the negative preconceptions I had about &quot;happy pills&quot;, and be ready to accept that the medication had the _potential_ to work, in order for it to work.<p>During the 13 years that I was depressed, there were still lengthy periods of time when I felt relatively happy. Unfortunately, this led me to the (incorrect) conclusion that I could cure my depression myself if I just found the right combination of lifestyle choices. I started exercising, eating better and trying to get enough sleep. I tried to maintain good relationships with my family and friends, and explore my hobbies. The depression always came back.<p>Ironically, all this time spent trying to get better without medical help, probably extended the years of suffering, yet it was absolutely necessary to create the conditions that were needed for me to actually get better. The final pieces of the puzzle were: to truly accept that I had a disease, caused by unresolved trauma in my childhood, to seek counselling to resolve those issues, to lose the preconceptions about antidepressants, and to start the medication.<p>This process alone took around 2 years. I am one of the lucky ones, I genuinely count myself as lucky that I &quot;only&quot; wasted 13 years. Depression is an insidious disease.<p>The final thing I will say is that I often felt at the time that the therapy sessions weren&#x27;t achieving much - it is only looking back that the impact becomes clear. (Also, you don&#x27;t have to be depressed to benefit from counselling.)<p>Talking to friends and family can have just as big an impact, but therapists are trained listeners, you don&#x27;t have to explain &quot;why&quot; something was traumatic, they just get it."],"time":["2020-05-21 13:32:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sas3bot"],"id":[23256153],"kids":{},"parent":[23250234],"text":["you can add one more thing to that trello accomplishments list. vishnu.tech ! not all techie vishnus around can have a cool domain like &#x27;vishnu.tech&#x27;. just one.  :)"],"time":["2020-05-21 10:40:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwaway95568"],"id":[23252238],"kids":{},"parent":[23250234],"text":["I think there are a lot of misconceptions about medications and people are pretty down on them, but they have been a literal lifesaver for me. For the sake of someone who may be considering medication, I&#x27;d like to share my experience.<p>I went through a pretty rough period of depression several years ago, but I realized later that I had cycled in and out of medium to mild periods of depression in cycles throughout my life. I wouldn&#x27;t have said I was depressed at that time, because I had the common image of a person who can&#x27;t get out of bed in mind. While that is certainly the case for some people, depression comes in many flavors. I was always irritable and had a hard time being patient for anything. I also experienced anhedonia, which is often described as &quot;lack of pleasure.&quot; I feel like that is not necessarily the best description, and it&#x27;s hard to describe it unless you&#x27;ve experienced it. It was more of an emotional flatness. Sometimes I felt like a robot: I sensed that it was a sunny day, food tastes good, but didn&#x27;t have any positive feelings. It was like watching a movie that you&#x27;re not invested in and don&#x27;t care how it ends. While I didn&#x27;t really notice it at the time (part of therapy is learning to pay attention to your thoughts more), I would also often ruminate on negative thoughts: how much I was disappointing people at work, how inadequate I was as a husband, father.<p>When someone talks about depression, well meaning people often suggest things like meditation and exercise. I don&#x27;t think that is necessarily bad advice, but I do worry that this may trivialize how hard it is to climb out of the hole when you&#x27;re depressed.<p>The one good habit I did have before and during the time that I was depressed was I consistently worked out 3-4 days a week, running, crossfit, lifting free weights. I would recommend exercise to anyone and I certainly think it helped me. But it wasn&#x27;t enough to overcome my depression.<p>I was also meditating quite a bit at the time. I found a zendo near me and would often duck out during lunch time to sit for a half an hour. I also found the Headspace app really useful for short 10 minute sittings during the day. I would recommend meditation to anyone, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to overcome depression.<p>At some point, I hit a point where everything seemed to be unraveling and I started talk therapy. I would say this is one of the most important things I&#x27;ve done in my life, as I realized I had a lot of maladaptive mental patterns. Therapy isn&#x27;t an easy road. My first therapist was good, but not a fit for me. When you are in therapy for depression, often your assessment of how well therapy is going starts to factor into how you feel, and I began to become hopeless that I would ever feel better. After almost a year, I sent my therapist a text out of the blue one day saying I wasn&#x27;t going to come any more, which probably wasn&#x27;t the best way to handle it. Someone else who encouraged me to go in for a last session. The therapist and I both agreed it wasn&#x27;t a fit. I found another therapist that was much more effective for me, and made a lot of progress. I got better at catching myself having negative thoughts or ruminating. But I still felt very flat. My therapist asked what I would do if I never felt good again. At the time, I said &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to go on.&quot; But shortly after that, I accepted that this may be the way I would feel from then on, and, while I didn&#x27;t feel great, it was, in some hard-to-describe way, better.<p>Finally, after several years of therapy, still feeling flat, I decided to try medication. The first one I tried was Wellbutrin, which has relatively benign side effects. I knew it could take a long time to find the right medication and dosage, so, while I was hopeful, my expectations weren&#x27;t too high. When I first started taking it, I didn&#x27;t notice anything, not even side effects. But one morning, after being on it for a while, I was driving my car to work in rush hour and suddenly realized that I felt at ease; I was enjoying the drive. It was so amazing I wanted to cry.<p>People like to describe these medications as &quot;numbing,&quot; as if they were some sort of opiate, but that&#x27;s not my experience at all (I&#x27;d add that I subsequently also added an SSRI for anxiety). They more shifted my perspective, gave me more space to be mindful of my thoughts and emotions. Some people have had very bad experiences with these, and I don&#x27;t to minimize that in any way, but I&#x27;d also say medications are useful for some people."],"time":["2020-05-20 23:45:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["preya2k"],"id":[23251962],"kids":{},"parent":[23250234],"text":["Thanks so much!"],"time":["2020-05-20 23:23:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rogerkeays"],"id":[23274302],"kids":{},"parent":[23250234],"text":["By an odd coincidence, I wrote about the same topic recently.

If you have an endpoint with a dynamic IP address (like your home router), but you give wireguard a DNS name, it doesn&#x27;t store the DNS name. It only stores the resolved IP address.<p>The official solution is a script they have in their contrib repo that you stick in cron and it scans for changes and resets the endpoint if your DNS changes.<p>Wireguard also can&#x27;t bind to a specific adapter on a multi adapter server. Since it doesn&#x27;t respond with anything with unauthenticated packets, the official solution is that is shouldn&#x27;t matter. Just iptables on everything and only accept packets on the adapter you want public.<p>The problem is, the egress packets will just go over the default adapter, so now you have incoming and outgoing packets taking different routes.<p>Overall thought, I like wireguard way more than OpenVPN.

Snippets that are meant to be copy+pasted from documentation or how-to articles. In that case, it’s often not easy to distribute a separate script file, so a CLI “one-liner” is preferred.

Firstly, I&#x27;m glad to see that people noticed... :-)<p>Firstly, to paraphrase Monty Python, &quot;Drill&#x27;s not dead yet.&quot;  There are some efforts to get corporate sponsorship, but it will take time.  HPE&#x27;s withdrawal was expected, but disappointing none the less.  With that said, we are still gearing up to release Drill 1.18 which will have a considerable amount of enhancements, including new formats (SPSS, HDF5, possibly SAS) as well as new storage plugins to enable Drill to connect to Druid as well as REST APIs.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve always felt that Drill was marketed to the wrong audience. As everyone notes, there are many competitors in the big data analytics space: Spark, ES, Splunk, Presto, Impala to name a few.  Where I see Drill as filling a rather unique niche in the market is the small-to medium size data analytics with complex data.<p>For instance, if you have a CSV file, you use Excel.  If you have 100 CSVs you have to code. Or what if you have an Excel spreadsheet and you want to pull data from your corporate reference API, which happens to return JSON and uses OAUTH authentication?  Drill is the kind of tool that can bridge this gap and allow analysts to rapidly get value out of these situations.<p>As an example, here&#x27;s a demo of me building a COVID dashboard from a REST API and spreadsheet in about 15 min with zero data prep: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oEOhFWm3D9A\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oEOhFWm3D9A<\/a><p>Another example: incident response.  Let&#x27;s say you have a PCAP file, use Wireshark. What if you have 10GB of PCAP files?  Most likely you&#x27;ll have to code up some solution.  With Drill however, you can query that w&#x2F;o coding, which means that you can get the value out of this data faster.<p>I know there are people using Drill. I know when I demo Drill to analysts, they love it. (Ok.. I&#x27;m biased here but I would say that&#x27;s an accurate representation of the response to my presentations)  What Drill lost was an active developer community.  I hope over the next few months, that Drill&#x27;s users will step up a bit and contribute to code reviews and&#x2F;or actual code contributions.  I&#x27;ve been thinking about creating a security focused fork of Drill as well so we&#x27;ll see what happens.<p>If you have ideas&#x2F;comments&#x2F;questions, you can email me at cgivre@apache.org."],"time":["2020-05-21 15:33:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulHoule"],"id":[23251064],"kids":[23251093,23256226],"parent":[23250314],"text":["How many Apache projects are there in the &quot;Big Data&quot; space?

If a large percentage of the population can&#x27;t participate, the market&#x27;s capability to price, evaluate and represent value is hindered.<p>UBI makes sense for a purpose of bringing more buyer&#x27;s&#x2F;actors to the game. It&#x27;s especially useful considering our dependence on jobs as the primary activating mechanism shows strain under the troubles of scaling human coordination and hiring. In a sort of backwards way we get more jobs when more people can contribute to the flow of money.<p>However UBI doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of debt still piping the cash back into the hands of banks and other financial institutions. What are these UBI checks going to be spent on? Rent that&#x27;s too high? Student loans for indulgent tuition prices? Without blocking the pipes from the poor to the the actors with pipes of their own, these throughput problems aren&#x27;t solved more than delayed.<p>An actor is still a single actor, so if one actor has an over aggregation of wealth and has trouble spending it effectively the potential of that wealth is wasted when at least some actors don&#x27;t have enough.<p>So surely trillions of dollars of UBI injected directly into the hands of the poor will stimulate the economy. But for how long until the cash starts to aggregate again into slower pools of cash where throughput is limited? In a sense we almost want inflation if these &quot;overaggregators&quot; are so abundant, but only if the population is maintained at a base level of wealth relative to the inflation. Otherwise the rich, who probably got rich by being more effective with their money respond to the market changes faster and the UBI stimulation is only temporary.<p>But if UBI causes significant inflation, and the pipes going directly to every individual have enough back pressure, it could be a great situation where the overaggregators lose value to inflation as they struggle to spend or invest."],"time":["2020-05-20 08:26:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["scoopertrooper"],"id":[23243736],"kids":[23243963,23243918,23244394,23243883,23244438,23243929,23244123,23243802,23244071,23243862,23244660,23243878,23243869,23243968,23244115,23244074,23243932,23248148,23243898,23243830,23248516,23244351,23244051,23261459,23243806,23244001,23245019],"parent":[23243330],"text":["Keep in mind this article largely restricts itself to considering direct cash transfers to people in low-medium developed countries.

No intermediary service involved.<p>## Context<p>PullPreview’s main use case is for making it easier to review code in branches or pull requests, because reviews with live code are always better than code-only reviews. This means better and faster feedback from reviewers (be it clients or teammates), so that everyone can iterate faster on the feature being developed.<p>However in most organizations, there is only a handful of staging servers available to the developers, which are hard to keep in sync, maintain, and with complicated processes to make sure you don’t step on someone else’s code.<p>PullPreview solves this with ephemeral environments for any pull request or branches, just by adding a label from the GitHub UI. URLs for the deployed environments are displayed right into the GitHub UI, thanks to the integration with the Deployments API.<p>## How it works (spoiler: no kubernetes)<p>Contrary to many other solutions, PullPreview _never sees your code_, because it runs as a GitHub Action and does all the work within the GitHub Action runner. The Action automatically provisions a server in _your_ AWS account (a cheap Lightsail instance), and then boots your application using the Docker Compose file(s) that you specify. The server is automatically destroyed when the PR is merged, closed, or the label removed.<p>Some of the features include unlimited parallel environments, support for SSH access, source IP filtering, port filtering, seed data support, data persistence across deploys, all managed from the GitHub UI.<p>All of this is packaged as an Open-Source GitHub Action that can be tried right now. You can run it for free for 30 days, and after that we have two license tiers at 120€&#x2F;year and 300€&#x2F;year. We believe it is pretty cheap compared to rolling and maintaining your own solution in-house. It is also free for non-profits.<p>## Next steps<p>We’re looking for feedback on the idea, what could be missing, and the pricing. We are also discovering many more use cases while dogfooding our own idea. For instance, we are currently running a few services in production, continuously deployed thanks to PullPreview (e.g. pullpreview.com itself)."],"time":["2020-05-18 14:30:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gitgud"],"id":[23242001],"kids":[23243079],"parent":[23221471],"text":["Interesting, I&#x27;ve never heard of the [1] <i>&quot;The Prosperity Public License 3.0.0&quot;<\/i>, free for non-commercial use, or 30 days free for commercial use, which seems like a great compromise.<p>This idea is very similar to a few other solutions, [2] Release (YC W20), [3] Netlify Deploy Previews.
