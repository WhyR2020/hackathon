Our local banker knew him. When we signed the deal we got representations of authority and so forth. But at some point someone on my desk asked how I knew that he was really the CFO of this company. What if he was just some guy, taking my bank for a billion dollars? What if he snuck into their offices to meet with me?

We <i>trust<\/i> that what we see, or hear, or read, has a strong correspondence to some underlying reality.  That it isn&#x27;t some selective sample of reality (lying by ommission).  That representations are as they claim.<p>And, most of the time, even amongst strangers, this is the case.<p>What mass media allow, though, is for a control point, in that changing a small quantity of information can have a profound effect.  The promise, again and again and again of &quot;new media&quot;, from the cave painting to mobile apps, has been to decentralise information, put it in the hands of the public and individuals, remove gatekeepers, and give both voice and fact-checking abilities to anyone.<p>Sometimes that works.<p>But very often, the problem is that we find that trust has a scaling problem.<p>- We can&#x27;t keep track of who is or isn&#x27;t an honest source.<p>- Honest sources turn dishonest.<p>- Honest sources are subverted, from within, without, overhead, or underneath.<p>- Vulnerabilities are found, and disinformation injected.<p>- Playing to the crowd, often on emotion, empathy, identity, and above all, fear and anger, are used to distract or mislead.<p>Ironically, both excessive centralisation <i>and<\/i> decentralisation are vulnerable to attack, though by different modes.  Centralised media tends to play strongly to establishment power.  Decentralised media is more subject to either the madness of crowds or nonestablishment forces.<p>Full vetting, constant vigelance, perfect identification, global reputation and credit scores, are not only impossible but quite often themselves avenues of attack and control.<p>But a mix of partial approaches can very often prove <i>sufficient<\/i> whilst also being <i>robust<\/i> against manipulation.<p>Of all the lie-busting techniques I&#x27;ve encountered, the one which seems most useful is to seek correspondence across elements -- from different sources, within different elements of a story, with known facts.  Where a direct comparison to a ground truth isn&#x27;t possible, at the very least <i>this points out where potential concerns may lie.<\/i><p>(The method is also strongly applicable to many technical situations as well:  if your monitoring, meters, or gagues disagree with one another, you may not know <i>what<\/i> is wrong, but <i>something<\/i> almost certainly is.)<p>Circumstances in which an element, or quite often, a <i>person<\/i> is highly resistant to verification, most especially if they react in anger or emotive appeal (shaming, insults, special pleading, appeals to empathy or pity), you may also want to look with suspicion.  These aren&#x27;t perefect tells of lies, but they&#x27;re often provoked by someone prefering to conceal manipulation.  Nonhuman elements (sources, data, systems) which are suddenly resistant to further exploration are also suspicious.<p>A tool I try to employ is suspended judgement.

This was about 7 years ago, so before Scenic existed to help with this (or at least before it was known). We had to manually manage the use of our views while keeping Rails apprised of the underlying schema through custom schema files and migration methods.<p>One of the main issues we had run into, in addition to all the complexity that comes with managing a cache and no longer being able to count on your db queries to return the latest information, was that our views had to be deleted and re-created for nearly every schema change (at least every schema change that affected the views, but we had so many views, this ended up being probably 90% of our schema changes).<p>We ended up overriding the standard Rails &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; migration methods to prepend the deletion of these views, append their re-creation, clean up after failed migrations, etc. I remember us spending a good amount of time across the team dealing with weird edge cases that cropped up from this. I also remember spending a fair amount of time training all the developers on these issues since almost no one on the team had experience using or dealing with database views. I assume managing migrations and schema of your views within Rails is all included in what Scenic does for you for free, since these hassles weren&#x27;t mentioned in the article.<p>It&#x27;s really nice to see something that handles all that complexity for you. However, that still leaves the standard and age-old caching issues with stale data. Another side effect was that they started being a bandaid for inefficient queries and data structures in the database, which is probably how we ended up with so many db views in the first place.<p>In the end, after probably 8 months of using these views, we decided to excise them from the application entirely and go back to optimizing our actual database queries. We got to delete a lot of custom code, our schema changes and migrations became simpler, our data became fresh again, and we got to reinvest that time into improving our underlying data structures and queries.<p>This probably is not an argument against using db views, but rather an anecdote of what can happen when you resort to them prematurely. If you have queries that are 100ms or more, there are probably more traditional optimizations you can find, such as restructuring your relational data, adding&#x2F;removing indexes, etc. If you&#x27;re actually trying to eliminate those last 10s of milliseconds from your queries though, as is shown in the article, I can see them being a good option."],"time":["2020-01-16 20:59:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gigatexal"],"id":[22067701],"kids":[22067793,22070252,22067908],"parent":[22066195],"text":["Another approach could be to create the materialized view and then use some sort of event system say the pg_notify subsystem to capture an event and then increment some aggregation -- this would eliminate the need for scheduled view refreshes and keep the view almost real-time and quick."],"time":["2020-01-16 20:01:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pdkl95"],"id":[22068061],"kids":[22068163,22068294],"parent":[22066195],"text":["&quot;There are two hard things in computer science: <i>cache invalidation<\/i>, naming things, and off-by-one errors.&quot; (Phil Karlton, <i>et al<\/i>)<p>Views (both regular and materialized) are really useful, but remember that storing data in two places really is one of the of the hard problems in CS.

Our senior sales managers trained us to identify personalities, and they used similar groupings.<p>There were four &#x27;buckets&#x27; and they are very close to this color system. They are dominant driver, complacent, ego driven, and analytical. The idea is to, as quickly as possible, identify the customer&#x27;s type, and adapt your sales approach to that. You learn to use a communication style for each bucket. Different types of questions to ask, different speed&#x2F; energy, different body language.<p>I was a terrible salesperson, but I watched the managers and top salespeople use this approach with much success.

I think this type of segmentation of people is (1)beneficial and (2)mostly harmless.<p>(1) The sole reason for the feeling of &quot;being surrounded by idiots&quot; is lack of understanding of the other. If someone has different opinions&#x2F;behaviors&#x2F;moral values than I do, the easiest thing I could do is just label them &quot;Idiot&quot;. Real understanding and empathy are just too hard. Actually, this also true when looking at one&#x27;s own behaviour. We are mostly quick to judge and be angry at ourselves.<p>Having a system such as this (even if it is pseudo-scientific) gives one pause in judgement. For example: John isn&#x27;t an idiot or an asshole, he&#x27;s just a Green. The implicit idea here is that John doesn&#x27;t do it on purpose, he&#x27;s part of a group. So I should be more accepting of him and I should learn to deal with Greens&#x27; quirks better. This neutral judgement (instead of the negative one) automatically side-steps the anger, elicits more empathy  and accepts partial responsibility for the interactions. It also gives a feeling of increased understanding of &quot;how the world works&quot; which feels good (even if it&#x27;s false). This also works when introspectively looking at one&#x27;s own behaviour: Us Blues have a hard time doing X. I should be easier with myself.<p>The actual underpinned theory is irrelevant (as so far as the aforementioned benefits are considered). It works just as well with &quot;John&#x27;s just a Gemini&#x2F;INTP&#x2F;Type 8&quot;. It&#x27;s just the ability to attribute <i>something<\/i> to the person&#x27;s actions I dislike other than stupidity or incompetence.<p>(2) People love this stuff. Personality segmentation models are abundant and people love taking assessment quizzes. Astrology, Enneagram, Big-5, Myer&amp;Briggs and many others. I&#x27;d venture off saying that most people don&#x27;t take these things too seriously. Even the theories themselves recognize that human&#x27;s personality can&#x27;t really fit nicely in n boxes, so all of them have &quot;extensions&quot;: You can be several colors, Astrology has &quot;horizons&quot;, Ennegram has &quot;wings&quot;, Big5 gives a running score to each trait, etc. Proponents of a system can easily utter something like &quot;Mary&#x27;s not a typical Aries, though&quot;. So while there are some people that might take it too far, I feel it&#x27;s mostly used benignly.<p>The fact that the theory behind some of these systems are anywhere between questionable to down right ludicrous is a pickle, though. But sometimes system benefit people even when the people don&#x27;t understand the mechanism in which they do, or hold a wrong one. Therfor truth seeking shouldn&#x27;t, in and of it self, be enough of a reason to tear down such a system.

There are plenty of occasions where so-called minimalist layouts are perfectly appropriate. Most of the lessons at the core of it are absolutely fundamental to design. And what it replaced, the very brief period of corporate skeuomorphic design was never that great and in my opinion had much more to do with companies wanting to showoff their fancy new technology than designing anything great in its own right.<p>However, I despair when I think of the amount of young designers who know nothing else and can barely imagine a life without the strict framework of minimalism and its accepted practices. They will never know the feeling of going off the beaten path and discovering something cool and valuable, because your inner minimalist has long since shot down that line of thought as frivolous self-indulgence. Only minimalist self-indulgence is accepted.<p>I&#x27;m sure most people here can agree that the web is kind of in a sad state right now. We&#x27;re using staggering amounts of man-hours to run this thing. An enormous bloated stack of technologies maintained by a horde of programmers just so that designers can spend their days meticulously handcrafting minimalist websites that pretty much look the same and do the same thing, while being far heavier than they have any reason to be.<p>I can appreciate the programmers who build perfectly optimized &quot;programmer minimalist&quot; personal websites, but at the end of the day, I think that just amounts to a lot of really nice sandcastles. How do we translate that to the real world?<p>I&#x27;m hoping 2020s could be a decade when people get real about moving forward. Less aping of aesthetics and technologies from the 60s and 70s.

Basically, it&#x27;s a submarine warfare game which you play as a U.S. Navy submarine in World War II, cursing the Pacific Ocean and attacks Japanese warships. When playing the game, I was extremely frustrated about the Mark XIV torpedo onboard - After going through the painstaking process of calculating the projectile, hitting the fire button, I would watch the stopwatch and hoping for the best that the target won&#x27;t change its course... finally it was the time... nothing! For every five fires or so, there would be one or two torpedoes that never explode - when you need it the most. I was not playing the &quot;hard&quot; mode, it happens even in a &quot;moderate&quot; difficulty setting.<p>I thought the game developers were making it unreasonable. And a few years later, I learned from a history book about the early unreliability of the torpedoes, and realized the torpedoes in the game were an accurate and realistic depiction of its historical performance. Kudos to the game developers.<p>Another tool in the game I felt strange was the &quot;Torpedo Data Computer&quot;, which is something that you can simply enter the bearing, speed, etc., of your target via its tuning dials, and the machine automatically calculates the firing position for you. I thought it was just the hand-waving of the game developers to make the game more playable while making it unrealistic - why would a computer even exist in the 1940s? I believed it was all pencil-and-paper.<p>Later I learned it was real as well - totally mind-blowing. When I was a kid, I had no idea about the sophisticated historical mechanical fire control computers in the 1930s-1940s. There is a Hacker News submission of the documentation of the computer.

First and foremost... <i>what is the impact when (not if) this process finally stops?<\/i> This isn&#x27;t just for technical people. You need a business impact assessment. You need the users involved. They&#x27;re your lever for fighting the inevitable fear-based political hurdles. Is it an annoyance? Or does the company go out of business? The potential severity of the impact matters a great deal. If it&#x27;s putting the entire business at risk, you should be able to get support from the highest levels of management to do whatever is necessary.<p>Second... how do you recover? There are a variety of ways off the top of my head. The most obvious would be to reconstruct the physical config. The &quot;obvious to others&quot; that is probably a stupid idea is rewriting the application. Let&#x27;s ignore the stupid one and start dealing with reconstructing the configuration.<p>Do you have the source code for the system? If so, you can probably reconstruct the configuration architecture from reading source, at least. It may suck, but it&#x27;s something.<p>Is there a test environment with its own running copy of the app? If so, it will have its own configuration, which will make reconstruction much easier, as then you differ only by values and don&#x27;t have to figure out what the fields are.<p>Now, what kind of data is in the configuration that makes it difficult? Resource locations? Authentication credentials? Something else? If it&#x27;s connecting to external systems, you can look at logs, packet-sniff, etc, to at least figure out where it&#x27;s going. Credentials can be reset for a new version - a painful one-way trip, but it can work. Do you own any external systems, or are they outside your control?<p>Now, all systems have inputs and outputs. What is the output of this? Is it going to a database? If so, are you backing up that data? Make sure any locally stored data is getting backed up!<p>If there isn&#x27;t a duplicate test system, what would need to be done to create one? Are there licensing restrictions? Specialized hardware&#x2F;OS? Are you building from source code? Do you have the source? Do whatever it takes to create a parallel system that you can test configuration on, make it run elsewhere.<p>I can just go on and on with this, but the important thing is to be able to duplicate as much as possible before you try to replace.

I absolutely <i>love<\/i> it. I thought I would hate it. I&#x27;m an introvert. I previously worked as a solo freelancer and then as a remote teammate. So I was very nervous about this aspect of the job, but figured I&#x27;d give it a shot (other things about the job were appealing enough that I was willing to try it out).<p>Some thoughts based on my own personal experience:<p>* The biggest win for me is I am much more focused and productive throughout the day. Having an actual person to be accountable to on a continual basis keeps me from meandering down unimportant rabbit holes, unnecessary&#x2F;premature refactoring or re-organizing, and general procrastinating (reddit, HN, etc)<p>* Development is definitely at a slower pace on a daily basis than what I&#x27;m used to working on my own, but over time I think it evens out in terms of quality of code and maintainability.<p>* Knowledge sharing is huge -- when I was solo, I could never truly take a vacation because I was the only one responsible for my piece of work. Now I&#x27;m on a team where we all pair with each other and switch around every day... if someone is out, it&#x27;s no big deal. Also makes it much easier to onboard new people (the company I work at is a consultancy so projects are always ending and new ones beginning).<p>* Despite being an introvert, I feel no more &quot;drained&quot; of energy at the end of the day than I ever did at any other job. One-on-one interactions with people I know and build trust with just doesn&#x27;t affect me the way other social interactions do.<p>* Pairing is not a panacea. Some of the comments I&#x27;ve seen here are about how horrible it would be to pair and feel judged all the time or one personality overriding the other... I suppose that&#x27;s possible but it doesn&#x27;t happen at my job because my company values and encourages trust. My team is comprised of mature people who all value team cohesion and working together towards a goal over having to be right all the time or proving to someone that we&#x27;re better or whatever.<p>* I am never &quot;stuck&quot; pairing with just 1 person for a long time... we switch around every day. I probably pair with any given person only once per week (on a team with 6 developers). But each team has autonomy to structure the pair switching however they want.<p>Those are just some thoughts off the top of my head.

This is the difference between being “carbon neutral” and being “net zero.” While they sound similar, in fact they’re different.<p>&gt;Given common usage, companies have typically said they’re “carbon neutral” if they offset their emissions with payments either to avoid a reduction in emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere. But these are two very different things. For example, one way to avoid a reduction in emissions is to pay someone not to cut down the trees on the land they own. This is a good thing, but in effect it pays someone not to do something that would have a negative impact. It doesn’t lead to planting more trees that would have a positive impact by removing carbon.\nIn contrast, “net zero” means that a company actually removes as much carbon as it emits. The reason the phrase is “net zero” and not just “zero” is because there are still carbon emissions, but these are equal to carbon removal. And “carbon negative” means that a company is removing more carbon than it emits each year.\nWhile we at Microsoft have worked hard to be “carbon neutral” since 2012, our recent work has led us to conclude that this is an area where we’re far better served by humility than pride. And we believe this is true not only for ourselves, but for every business and organization on the planet.<p>&gt;Like most carbon-neutral companies, Microsoft has achieved carbon neutrality primarily by investing in offsets that primarily avoid emissions instead of removing carbon that has already been emitted. That’s why we’re shifting our focus. In short, neutral is not enough to address the world’s needs.<p>&gt;While it is imperative that we continue to avoid emissions, and these investments remain important, we see an acute need to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere, which we believe we can help catalyze through our investments.<p>&gt; Solving our planet’s carbon issues will require technology that does not exist today. That’s why a significant part of our endeavor involves putting Microsoft’s balance sheet to work to stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology. Our new Climate Innovation Fund will commit to invest $1 billion over the next four years into new technologies and expand access to capital around the world to people working to solve this problem. We understand that this is just a fraction of the investment needed, but our hope is that it spurs more governments and companies to invest in new ways as well.<p>This is one of the most exciting and potentially impactfull announcements. My biggest issue with companies that make a big deal about being &quot;carbon neutral&quot; and &quot;carbon offsets&quot; is that many times it is &quot;voodoo accounting&quot; in which they pay money to another company which claims to have prevented some carbon emission in an unaccountable developing country. Basically, these carbon fees just are another form of indulgences in which rich people pay money to be able continue their sins while feeling good about themselves.<p>However, &quot;carbon removal&quot; is a game changer. Based on human nature, I do not believe we will be able to change behavior enough to save ourselves. I think our only hope of preserving our civilization is with carbon removal technology.<p>That is why I am so glad that Microsoft is specifically focusing on this. If other large companies did this, I think there is a good chance that we could innovate our way out of the climate change crisis."],"time":["2020-01-16 19:49:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bitL"],"id":[22068197],"kids":[22068230],"parent":[22067096],"text":["Carbon-negative like in reality, or by outsourcing dirty jobs like how Germany is the greenest country by dumping their garbage in Poland?"],"time":["2020-01-16 20:52:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["perfunctory"],"id":[22068916],"kids":[22072501],"parent":[22067096],"text":["&gt; At Microsoft, we expect to emit 16 million metric tons of carbon this year.<p>So, Microsoft emits as much carbon as the whole of Ireland?

The whole concept is flawed.<p>New&#x2F;delete like this are for smallish general purpose allocation, for example of objects, where we want to keep the code at a fairly high level in C++ and not think about low-level concepts like &quot;bytes&quot; or allocation mechanics. Or performance.<p>Conversely, an app written in C++ that needs huge swaths memory for manipulating raw bytes and needs high-performance would not likely use new char[] or calloc&#x2F;malloc directly at all. It would directly interface with the OS via mmap or indirectly via some domain relevant library, for example, OpenCV.<p>We might even still exclusively use the C++ language to write the low-level portions of the code, but if you need to interface with the OS in specific controlled ways or write performance oriented code, you are not going to do it using only high-level C++ operations. You are going to call exactly what you need to interface with the system directly. If you  want mmap(), you&#x27;d just call mmap() from C++. If you want sbrk(), you&#x27;d call sbrk(). If you don&#x27;t like the system new&#x2F;delete and malloc&#x2F;free, you could use something like dlmalloc and and even remap new&#x2F;delete to it, or to some custom slab allocator.<p>Secondly, as pointed out by others, the author isn&#x27;t benchmarking C++. He&#x27;s benchmarking glibc malloc and the Linux mmap. We&#x27;d expect a C program using malloc&#x2F;calloc to have exactly the same timings.<p>Thirdly, fallacious reasoning about initialization. If your app needs to allocate (for some ??? reason) 32 GB of memory, you would NOT automatically zero it first, unless you actually needed it to be zero, or you wanted your app to waste a bunch of time.

However, reforestation can play a large role in combating climate change. The first and most important step should be to cut down burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible. The lowest hanging fruit there is stop using coal. It is the worst offender and the most easy to get rid of. Just burning gas instead cuts CO2 emissions by more than 30%. Not counting in that number is, that a lot of gas is burnt on oil producing sites instead of used and that gas plants can have much higher efficiencies, like using the heat also for heating houses. Gas plants can reach up to 90% efficiency this way, basically halving the CO2 emissions vs. coal. Also, flexible gas plants play nicer with renewables as solar and wind. And of course stop using oil e.g. for cars.<p>Having done that would cut down the CO2 emissions drastically, and then the reforestation becomes a more realistic target and would indeed a very practical means to get to net zero emissions.

The social contract used to at least hint at the idea that if you worked hard and did an honest days labor you would at least be entitled to a roof over your head, food in your belly, and the ability to support a family. There was a marked shift away from this in the 1970s, in the name of &quot;meritocracy&quot; to allow higher earnings for those who &quot;deserve&quot; it in exchange for lower wages for those don&#x27;t.

Either that or you need millions in funding to build a marketing campaign and to have the runway to wait until the CAC is covered. I would 10x your price at least, and then offer early adopter discounts to clients who pay for a year now, not when the product is ready, with extra off if they prepay for two years. Then each sale pays you enough to do some development and get the next sale, as opposed to paying you enough to eat at McDonalds once a month.<p>Also, list yourself on Sploda.com (no association) and update your profile every time something happens, so they start seeing progress.<p>John"],"time":["2020-01-16 15:58:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LeonM"],"id":[22064947],"kids":[22064972],"parent":[22064364],"text":["You need someone with sales experience.<p>Without knowing what business you are in, $10&#x2F;month&#x2F;seat sounds _way_ to cheap.

Also when they commit to buying from a new startup they are putting their reputation at their firm on the line. Their natural inclination will be to defer the decision if they&#x27;re interested. So if they gave any kind of indication that your product might be useful keep pinging them politely and semi-regularly - preferably with useful product updates which could meet their needs - until you get either a yes or a no. Introductions, warm referrals or partnering with a bigger vendor who can vouch for you can shorten the sales cycle significantly for enterprise.<p>Avoid falling prey to potential customers saying they&#x27;ll bite if you give them &#x27;feature X&#x27;. Do make a note of the conversations and feature requests though - sometimes if the use case crops up more than once it might be useful to consider adding to your backlog.<p>Consider blogging about what you guys do, how you do it, why you do it - this will help build social proof for not just the product but you.

Similarly if you&#x27;re not great at understanding Google Analytics etc. learn it - but know when to get a specialist in to help do a few days work for you.<p>Upwork is great for finding skilled freelancers to parachute in and do some work. Keep a list of all the top notch talent you work with, it&#x27;s quite possible the best thing to come out of your venture is the network you build.<p>Finally take care of yourself. Mentally and physically. Know that even if this goes belly-up you are not your product - your product didn&#x27;t work out - you however showed a lot of initiative, courage and smarts to get something new, that didn&#x27;t exist before out the door and onto the market.<p>Good luck!"],"time":["2020-01-16 16:11:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throw3982"],"id":[22086932],"kids":[22087246],"parent":[22064364],"text":["To everyone saying they should do consulting, how can they they keep the IP rights then?<p>If they consult for another company, wouldn&#x27;t that company own the rights?<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, not many companies are willing to pay consulting fees and give up ownership of the work."],"time":["2020-01-18 21:29:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["brianwawok"],"id":[22064707],"kids":[22064786],"parent":[22064364],"text":["A total runway of 12 months feels short if going enterprise.

B2B SaaS, bootstrapped (still no capital raised after 7 years), even the price is the same. We had 4 co-founders, I wrote the code. Here&#x27;s a brain dump of things we learned:<p>When we started we were all fresh out of (or still finishing) university and had fairly small savings. Definitely not a year of runway. So we found jobs that were relatively easy, well paying, and minimally distracting. Our goal was to earn only enough to live off, so while we kept the jobs we had infinite runway.<p>In my case I reached out to one of my uni lecturers and convinced him to add me to the tutoring team for one of his first year programming subjects. It was super easy content, the pay was pretty good, and I didn&#x27;t have to think about it at all when I wasn&#x27;t working on it. The other guys took other odd jobs around the university, for similar reasons. I am less a fan of the consulting strategy - it feels too easy for that to take over your focus.<p>Our internal goal was 100K ARR within our first year. If we did that, we&#x27;d all quit our other jobs and go full time on this, and start paying ourselves. We got pretty close to that target but went all in anyway.<p>If you can hit 100K ARR and keep your costs of living low, you won&#x27;t need to raise a seed round. I don&#x27;t know anything about you - we had just finished uni so we were in a good position to live cheap. We would make 100 meals for $100 and eat a lot of chilli con carne + rice: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;9BtnOkP.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;9BtnOkP.png<\/a><p>It was 6 months from first code written, to first customer paying us. And then about 9 months from there to 100K ARR. Our typical customer at the time was worth about $200&#x2F;month ($2.4k ARR). Don&#x27;t lose hope, you might be just on the cusp of some cash. The advice about charging more in this thread is bad advice without knowing how many users each business you sell to will have. In our case it was at least 20 (we sell a whole of business product, so it was defined by company size), which was totally sufficient.<p>We didn&#x27;t hire anyone until we&#x27;d been going for about 18 months. Because we couldn&#x27;t afford it. But in hindsight it helped. If you hire 4-6 devs now you&#x27;re going to spend all your time managing them instead of learning what product you are building. Learning to be a manager takes a long time and you&#x27;ll probably be bad at it at first - particularly if you&#x27;d rather be coding. Anecdotally I think we had a year lag from when we first hired a few extra devs, to when we got a significant increase in product output.<p>Don&#x27;t do pilots.

Had been stuck in a position where I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a way out, due to a combination of a non-compete on myself and restrictive no-poach agreements between my (now former) employer and a majority of large tech-oriented businesses in my city.  Tried everything I could to get out from under both, short of leaving town, and just couldn&#x27;t find a job that fit my career goals that I was actually able to take.  Early last year, I started checking the who&#x27;s hiring posts monthly, on the off-chance that something would stick out and catch my attention.  I was scrolling through pretty quickly one day, just looking for keywords, and blasted through like half the page, and then realized I had missed reading a comment that had some of my target words in it.  Scrolled back up, saw a post from an engineering manager at a company whose product I actually use, and on a whim I just applied.  Now, over half a year later, I&#x27;m happily and gainfully employed, working remote, for a company that I really enjoy working for and on a product that I can dogfood.  Feels really great.
