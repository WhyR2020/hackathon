Many of these questions are basic stats. Others seem like the kind of statistics process control I learned in my undergraduate engineering curriculum. Some are more modern, and would be learned by going through something like the scikit-learn documentation, or taking a coursera, though I suppose this might be in a more current formal curriculum.<p>The odd part is, do senior actuaries get quizzed on integration by parts when they interview? Do law firms put new hires through their 1L civil procedure exam?<p>And while those are fields with a standardized entrance exam (actuarial exams, bar exam, etc), I know lots of people in non-credentialed fields that still are knowledge based. They may get asked about a database or their experience with it, but they don&#x27;t go through anything like this kind of technical exam style interview. It really is an exam, it&#x27;s just administered capriciously, often by people who have unknown or dodgy credentials, without any review by experts or assurances that it won&#x27;t be used to discriminate (the modern day equivalent of a &quot;literacy&quot; test, I suppose), and is graded under conditions of great secrecy (people often sign a non-disclosure prior to interviewing, google asks people to do this).<p>I personally think a company is well within its rights to do subject experienced people to an eternal cycle of undergraduate midterms if that&#x27;s what it chooses to do. I think that this practice deters a lot of people from going into these fields as well, which is also their right as free and full members of the society they live in, free to choose a career path in response to their own interests and how they align with what employers want and what they&#x27;re offering.<p>But... well, here we go. The companies that do this are almost always talking about a shortage of workers, one that the government needs to solve (or at least mitigate) by creating a special visa that allows employers to decide who is allowed to work in the united states and the conditions under which they are allowed to remain. Conditions that, surprise surprise, often involve working in a field that subjects people to an endless repeats of their undergraduate midterms. When people with choice won&#x27;t choose a particular job, isn&#x27;t that the market&#x27;s answer? Just to be clear, I positive about immigration, provided the people who immigrate are, well, free. But why on earth would we create a special corporate controlled worker visa so that companies can continue to engage in practices that drive away people who can choose, in large numbers?<p>This is the pits, people. Don&#x27;t these lists bug you just a little? I mean, I&#x27;m not trying to put down the list itself, I suppose it&#x27;s probably a pretty good list for people who are going to subject themselves to this kind of interview exam, either because they like the field or because it&#x27;s the only way to get through the US&#x27;s byzantine immigration system without relatives.<p>But is it really a surprise that people with choice (i.e., the &quot;free&quot; citizens of Rome who are not bound by law to work only in certain fields as a condition of remaining within Rome) are rationally choosing to do things where they don&#x27;t have to put up with this bullshit?"],"time":["2020-03-02 18:48:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["turbinerneiter"],"id":[22459604],"kids":[22459908,22459992,22462051,22459861,22459800],"parent":[22459277],"text":["I was playing with Glade the other day and it is quite a nice but also hard to get into.

Kinda shameful though tech seems to only be in a handful of tech hubs. Seems like if I had a startup going, I&#x27;d be more likely to be funded in Texas or California than where I&#x27;m originally from. Seems like a lot of areas have leaders that don&#x27;t even care about startups or tech... or maybe just statistically they don&#x27;t think they can attract tech maybe?<p>Was watching a news segment about startups in Cleveland a while back and one of the big things is the lack of investors, so people are forced to leave their family and community to go elsewhere if they want to be successful. Not from Cleveland but it sounds like a similar story in a bunch of places.<p>Then probably smart people feeling disconnected or lonely because of the lack of resources and startup&#x2F;tech culture. The census I think is going to be a big blow for places like Ohio and other places, no wonder younger people are moving for better opportunities, and then when they are ready to start their own families, wonder if their kids and future kids will stick around? Sounds like then Cities are losing generations of people, so long term this is going to compound and hurt cities and states even more for their inaction. Plus I think weather plays a bit of a role too, not all just economics - but then again there&#x27;s a lady I know from Texas who wants to move to Ohio because she likes the cold, while I rather like the warm so sounds like we rather just swap places haha...<p>Plus people are anti-tech. Some people like their quiet small towns, and affordable houses. Tech money flows and then the rents and house prices go up. and then people stereotype tech people too. So sorta like a not in my backyard thing too. Not everyone wants tech I guess, so maybe it&#x27;s easier to just move elsewhere than trying to turn your own community into the vision you have. Then people don&#x27;t trust tech, I used Apple Pay at like one of the only places that take it and the lady commented on it about not trusting it. Then I was listening to a podcast segment and I guess some college in Michigan installed Apple Pay to pay for things and found sales went up, I mentioned that I thought that was cool and someone said they wouldn&#x27;t trust their credit card with a vending machine... When I think it&#x27;s, in fact, more secure than an actual credit card, but then again even the basic idea of public-private key cryptography goes over people&#x27;s heads.<p>I kinda feel like if I grew up and lived in a better area for tech, I&#x27;d probably be more successful personally, meetups and networking with other like-minded people I think would help. Plus I kinda feel like I have trust problems, people online I was going to work on projects with me but some people are so flakey or just disappears instead of staying committed. Like wanted to do something media related years ago, and the person just disappeared on me. Then was doing another project where someone was going to focus on sales, and agreed to give them a % of the company but can&#x27;t seem to get ahold of him(But I know now that&#x27;s what vesting is for). So seems like a recurring theme I always get flaky people. So I feel like real in person could be a benefit too in that regard. It seems more real too, and plus people try to read emotions and stuff in between the lines - but even then there are stories of people working offline and it not working out too... So I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to get the right structure, and contracts and stuff in place. Focusing on the tech part for my own project first on my own but hoping to take Startup School and pick up on things before I involve others just because I don&#x27;t want to get burned. But personally I think I rather just bootstrap and own 100%, and then pay contractors or employees when profitable to work on features I don&#x27;t want to personally do, so less conflicts and not slowing down making decisions, could consult people for advice but I&#x27;d have the final say."],"time":["2020-03-01 22:05:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["finphil"],"id":[22458533],"kids":{},"parent":[22458342],"text":["Good read!"],"time":["2020-03-01 20:07:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vermooten"],"id":[22459056],"kids":{},"parent":[22458342],"text":["I Tulsa.

I spent most of my 20s eating roughly twice as much as average and hitting the gym 3-4 times per week and I never felt better, especially after 20 rep squat sessions that naturally raise hormones like testosterone and HGH.<p>I occasionally cut calories to lose weight or train my metabolism to be &quot;ready&quot; for emergency situations (which was honestly camping or going broke, not exactly military excursions), but in my experience it basically felt like death. Like I could feel my body catabolizing muscle and I had flu-like symptoms if I took it too far for too many weeks.<p>Anecdotally, my parents&#x27; boomer generation felt that bodybuilding was generally a waste of time. If you watch old movies from the 60s and 70s, people were especially lean. And then unfortunately juicers in the 70s, 80s and 90s ruined the reputation of bodybuilding so everyone figured that being strong meant taking steroids. It&#x27;s only been in the last 5-10 years or so that I&#x27;ve noticed a resurgence in natural bodybuilding (check out Jeff Nippard, Steve Cook and Mike O&#x27;Hearn for examples of what&#x27;s possible natty).<p>So personally I really feel that lifting weights from about 15-16 years of age for life probably replicates many of the health effects of calorie restriction. Like, Arnold Schwarzenegger did some of his best work in his 40s when he was in better shape than most people in their 20s. Many athletes in their 70s and 80s look like they&#x27;re 50.<p>An untrained human bench presses about 100 pounds. When I was growing up, a 300 pound bench was considered mastery. Today with YouTube and better workout programs and supplements, that&#x27;s probably 400-500 pounds. I personally would choose to have 3-5 times average strength (anything above 4 is metahuman IMHO) rather than spend my life at a withered calorie restricted strength of 1&#x2F;2.<p>Of course ethically, it would be better for the planet if nobody worked out I guess. That&#x27;s a separate discussion though, and I feel that some of the downside could be alleviated if the extra calories came from relatively benign sources like rice and beans. So my question is, is this all just vanity? Or would a diet&#x2F;exercise approach be comparable to calorie restriction?"],"time":["2020-03-01 18:57:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["waterheater"],"id":[22458103],"kids":{},"parent":[22457136],"text":["I recently read a copy of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Chemicals of Life.&quot; Written in 1954, the book talks about how and why our bodies work. It hardly mentions DNA and focuses on the larger structures of enzymes, proteins, vitamins, and hormones. Some of the information is outdated in its presentation, but the book still holds up in almost all areas. (Also, I had never realized Asimov was a Professor of Biochemistry. He knew his stuff in this area.)<p>The first chapter of the book is titled, &quot;The All-Important Protein.&quot; This struck my 2020, DNA-oriented mind as an odd starting point, yet Asimov was very clear: &quot;all life is protein.&quot; The book is remarkably lucid, and here&#x27;s one of the best portions of the book:<p>&quot;Suppose the food you ate contained very little fat. That wouldn&#x27;t bother your body a bit. It would take the carbohydrate you eat and turn it into fat. It happens all the time. Everyone knows what starchy foods will do for the waistline.<p>&quot;If both fats and carbohydrates are low, the body is still not at a loss. It can manufacture both out of the proteins of the diet.<p>&quot;Where the body <i>does<\/i> get stuck is in the case of a shortage of proteins. It cannot manufacture proteins out of fats and carbohydrates. Proteins require nitrogen, and neither fats nor carbohydrates have any. So proteins can only be obtained for the body by making certain that protein is in the food. It is impossible to live on a diet of starch, butter and sugar. You can get all the energy you need, but you can&#x27;t build tissue.&quot;<p>Asimov places heavy emphasis on the two primary categories of what our body cannot naturally produce: essential amino acids and vitamins. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. The human body cannot produce nine of these amino acids, and we term these to be &quot;essential&quot; (Asimov said there were only eight; the necessity of histidine for adults was not yet established in 1954.) We must acquire the essential amino acids from a source outside our body. If we don&#x27;t acquire these essential amino acids, our bodies will fall apart. Wikipedia says &quot;protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body&#x27;s organs and many of its systems&quot; [1]. Asimov later discusses the importance of vitamins, or &quot;atom groupings, which the body cannot make for itself and must get from the food it eats.&quot; Without vitamins, we cannot produce certain coenzymes and will fall ill and possibly die.<p>Essential amino acids and vitamins. I&#x27;ve been focusing my diet on the acquisition of those in correct quantities. My diet-optimizing function seeks to minimize sugar, maximize protein, and moderate the rest. So far, it seems to be working well; I still build muscle at the gym and fat stays off. Wonder if this is what keto basically optimizes for as well.<p>So many articles about bodily function I&#x27;ve seen online jump straight to considerations of DNA. Certainly, this approach is more accurate, though I do wonder if we the layperson are approaching health issues with too much detail. To analogize to software, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re trying to debug our complex C++ program by pouring over the binary. The issues are far more likely to be with what we&#x27;re putting in than what&#x27;s already there.<p>Sources:<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Essential_amino_acid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Essential_amino_acid<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-01 19:00:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22457624],"kids":{},"parent":[22457136],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-01 17:41:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["asdkjh345"],"id":[22457583],"kids":{},"parent":[22457136],"text":["It doesn&#x27;t.

At the end of the day, if your city is nice enough, and demand is high enough, and supply is low enough, you&#x27;re going to see prices per unit of area rise. And you can do two things, pay more, or accept less space. And in the latter case you run into these ostensibly weird constructions like sleeping in your bathroom.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to think of that. On the one hand its inhumane. On the other hand, it&#x27;s self-inflicted. If you&#x27;re in the UK, you absolutely don&#x27;t need to live in London to live a normal life with a decent job, food on the table, good healthcare, good education for your kids etc. The person who rents this place probably is single, late twenties, works in finance, and will likely live here only 2 years before moving to something bigger with a longer commute, but not quite yet before he&#x2F;she wants to live in the city near the action. Although there&#x27;s reason to pity, this isn&#x27;t your stereotypical dystopian pity-case of a family of three menial workers living in a Hong Kong cage.<p>You can have a discussion about London being a place only for rich people, and that without mitigating measures you get an economic divide between rich and poor, with no socioeconomic mobility. And that&#x27;s true. In this context I have quite clear opinions on the need to keep neighbourhoods mixed, which requires subsidised social housing (council housing), subsidised private (public) education, subsidised after-school programs etc. But that&#x27;s a matter of distributing scarce high-value resources to poor people to keep a healthy level-playing field in society. But it does not solve the underlying scarcity. Whatever government system you apply to London, you&#x27;ll always have this scarcity, and people self-inflicting themselves by choosing to pay 2k for a bed in a bathroom. You can take that choice away through regulation (no beds in bathrooms, minimum unit sizes etc), but it doesn&#x27;t solve the underlying scarcity issue, just the symptom.<p>One course of action that I think we should take, is driving centralised decentralisation on a national level as much as possible. Yes we can acknowledge urban centres do wonders as knowledge&#x2F;financial&#x2F;cultural hubs. But we can also acknowledge that hyper-concentration in one place, is not preferred to concentration in 5 places. the UK does this very poorly with London taking up a huge part of the national economy.

I have terrible internet right now which makes it hard to look up sources, but almost all cities here in Germany have rents rising faster than wages or inflation - even those with decreasing populations.<p>Even if it was just an issue of demand and supply, housing isn&#x27;t just any commodity. Cities shouldn&#x27;t just maximise for supply, they also have to factor in other things, like life quality, availability of services, pollution and more. For example I don&#x27;t think rent control is an effective tool to be used broadly, but if I look at the district I grew up in in the 90s, almost all the native people were pushed out of it, and the rich people living there now not only fundamentally changed the districts spirit, they also effectively segregated themselves from the poorer segments of society. If this trend continued on a city-wide level, you would have boring rich districts and ghettos, as well as increasing and very visible inequality.<p>So in the housing market I think capitalism fails quite spectacularly in accounting for very important factors that are only indirectly tied to profit. The few metropolis that have a functioning housing market <i>usually<\/i> also have massive public-housing companies, and they mix meaningful regulation with fast and easy bureaucracy. - The obvious examples coming to mind would be Singapore and Vienna."],"time":["2020-03-01 13:11:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["planetzero"],"id":[22459170],"kids":{},"parent":[22457650],"text":["15+ years ago, I was working on my first development job out of college and I noticed that there was a strange process running on my work computer that couldn&#x27;t be killed.<p>I traced it to a specific port and host and used telnet to connect to it directly (I thought it was malware and got curious).<p>Little did I know that my manager was watching our every move and when I connected to the host&#x2F;port (sending no data), it crashed their viewers (the software was crap).<p>I was brought in then next day to my manager&#x27;s office and they told me they saw what I did and asked me to explain.

Not world changing, but useful. Ed Thorp did know about this in the 50s though (as I did in the 90s).<p>4) Electronics are much cheaper (and I make a lot more money to buy more of them). Linux works about as well as it did in mid-90s anyway. Laptop batteries MUCH better.<p>5) Cars are better: antilock brakes, crumple zones, airbags have made things much safer on the roads<p>6) Crime was much higher in the 90s than in the 21st century. Trend is reversing in the US at least.<p>Disagree&#x2F;aesthetics<p>1) Clothing is vastly worse than in the 90s in every way; aesthetics, durability, materials<p>2) Muh weed isn&#x27;t better than public smoking; I miss being able to smoke in public after a drink<p>3) Induction stoves are bloody awful and a huge regression from gas, even electric coil<p>4) Microbrews were much better in the 90s; everything is a disgusting IPA now, mostly to cover up the fact you&#x27;re drinking toilet water. I&#x27;d rather drink coors light than an IPA.<p>5) Most coffee is actually worse; Peets and Starbucks burning their beans is an aesthetic atrocity.<p>6) Apples are still groace and covered in alar.<p>7) Average flights are cheaper, but travel is VASTLY more unpleasant. You used to be able to buy a paper ticket, then trade it on usenet for someone else&#x27;s ticket. No ID required; just the ticket. Imagine that. No CNN blaring at you on the infoscreen making thought impossible (looking at you Atlanta). No anal probe at the boarding area. Your family could wave at you when you get on the plane, or hug you as soon as you get off. Total regression: I&#x27;ll happily pay more for the old experience.<p>Just wrong:<p>1) Travel in the EU is vastly more expensive to an American than it used to be, and hordes of travelers from everywhere on the globe make it less pleasant as well. It&#x27;s also worse from a visa perspective; you used to be able to do visa runs and stay on the continent basically forever instead of vacating Shengen every 90 days.<p>2) Most houses are actually NOT heated&#x2F;cooled&#x2F;insulated as efficiently as he thinks; presumably he just moved up a few socioeconomic brackets or moved some place warmer.<p>3) Coats? C&#x27;mon; if your coat is thinner, it&#x27;s because you live in the Bay Area or something. High end winter coats are still goose-down.<p>4) AI&#x2F;VR aren&#x27;t really things except as LARP<p>5) Trichinosis wasn&#x27;t a problem in the US in the 90s any more than it is now. Personally I can no longer eat US pork (it was fine in the 90s, just as it is in europe). See next point for why, perhaps<p>Shit that got worse and he didn&#x27;t notice:<p>1) Everyone&#x27;s fat; an aesthetic and libidinal apocalypse. Obviously something enormous and negative has happened in public health (cue 10 people responding to this, all with different &quot;answers&quot;), and nobody can identify what it is.<p>2) Everything as a service: back in the day you had to pay for utilities and maybe cable TV. Now you pay 10x what you used to for phone service (in the US; elsewhere else it&#x27;s fine) due to oligopolistic pricing, and you have a bunch of dumb &quot;apps&quot; on your phone charging you, 3 different movie services, even your damn radio betrays you. Managing more such things is unpleasant and the whole world is basically a giant ripoff<p>3) Social atomization in the US is at all time high, mostly due to technology<p>4) Search engines, homeless people and Elsevier have destroyed physical libraries, and that&#x27;s a real loss.<p>5) The internet is dumber and more corporate, and opinion makers now think that Usenet arguments on twitter are meaningful and real: something the rest of us got over around 1991<p>6) Cheap LED lights means designers put them everywhere, and you have to work hard to sleep in a dark room<p>7) Movies are shittier; big deal that I can watch a capeshit movie in 4k. I&#x27;m an adult and do not enjoy watching adults prance around playing make-believe in their underthingees. Supposedly we live in a &quot;golden age of TV&quot; but I don&#x27;t see that either: they just rediscovered the 1930s serial format. You can watch any of 1000 things, but most of them are awful.<p>8) There are tent cities in the US, rapidly turning into Favelas<p>9) The ubiquity of internet telephony (a general good) has made telephone scams and spam calls much more annoying than playing phone tag<p>10) Cheap flights and transport has caused &quot;barbarian invasions of Rome&quot; level immigration problems, and will be a huge social problem in the next economic downturn, in part because the internet means ethnic enclaves don&#x27;t have to assimilate to local culture.

The seats have an amount of small-item storage that will feel extremely generous in Premium Economy, but without the lockers, there&#x27;s no storage for bigger bags.<p>This is also not an unsolvable problem, but airlines are exceptionally risk-averse and change-averse, so it&#x27;ll take some real convincing.<p>And then there&#x27;s the accessibility and safety issues with the ladders to resolve and the question of how people will feel about the low ceiling clearance (will it feel premium?  especially to people who aren&#x27;t regular travelers)<p>I do hope some airline tries it.

Before you finish a transaction (i.e. a sequence of commands), you can rollback the transaction. This will undo the effects of every command ran as part of the transaction. It&#x27;s interesting to take a look at how different production databases implement undo:<p>MySQL and Oracle use the &quot;reconstructing previous states from the current state&quot; strategy. As commands are ran, they keep track of how to undo those commands in the &quot;undo log&quot;. If you rollback a transaction, all they do is run the commands in the undo log.<p>Postgres uses a different strategy. When Postgres modifies a row, it marks the old row as deleted and inserts a new row. Furthermore these changes are associated with the current transaction and considered to be pending until the current transaction completes. If the current transaction fails, Postgres will use the original version of the row because the transaction that modified it never actually completed.<p>SQL databases have a completely separate form of undo used for point in time backups. This is the ability to restore a copy of your database from any point in time in the past. As far as I know, use a combination of the &quot;recording each state&quot; and &quot;reconstructing previous state from initial state&quot;. There&#x27;s two parts to your typical database backup. There&#x27;s the base backup which captures the state of your DB at a specific point in time. Separately there&#x27;s a redo log that captures every change made to the data after the base backup was created. By replaying the changes made before a certain time, you can restore the DB to any state after the base backup was created."],"time":["2020-02-29 08:38:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ajuc"],"id":[22450085],"kids":[22452091,22451058],"parent":[22440927],"text":["Warhammer 40k universum had technopriests - a caste of people maintaining technology and treating that as spiritual rituals (blessing the doors with sacred oils so that they become content and don&#x27;t scream :), etc).<p>Funny how we could actually get to a similar point with computer technology."],"time":["2020-02-29 12:25:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["putzdown"],"id":[22450363],"kids":[22450448,22450957,22450913,22450673,22451096],"parent":[22440927],"text":["The article argues that because each little computer is a little “sentient”, and because machine learning builds algorithms that are intractable to the people who nurture them, and because in a house there will be lots of these sentient and intractable “learning” machines, that therefore the house (and car and office...) is full of consciousness, much like primitive ancients would have imagined a forest to be.
