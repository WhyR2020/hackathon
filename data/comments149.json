I&#x27;ll update the GitHub description to take this into account, but please help me answer some of these questions first (or, better, write me an email, so you can contribute directly to the AVICOT&#x2F;Documentation repo) :<p>Does the randomization happen at each new invocation of Bluetooth?<p>Is it coupled with the &quot;location services&quot; as suggested by jackweirdy below?<p>Another important point is that of using location tracking instead, as suggested by c22. I had this exact scheme as the initial AVICOT concept, but abandoned it because even with one-way hashing of the coordinates of the space-time boxes, the locations (and thus identity) of the infected person can easily be calculated if the (hashed) &quot;dangerous&quot; space-time boxes are publicly available.<p>One really good point of using space-time location boxes is, that you can assign an infection risk to being at the same location, say 3 hours later (e.g. use an exponential risk decay with some suitable half-life parameter). This is not possible with the Bluetooth IDs.

Today, I can&#x27;t even imagine typing any text in anything else but Emacs. Having all the tools you need at your disposal - spellchecking, thesaurus, dictionary, word lookup, translation, etc., feels extremely empowering.<p>My work machine is a Mac. I have written this¹, mainly to integrate with Emacs. Whenever I need to type anything longer than four words, in any program, I use that. The idea is simple - to copy existing text, call emacsclient, it invokes a function that opens a buffer and pastes the text into it. Then you edit the text in Emacs, press dedicated key-sequence - it grabs the text, switches back to the program, pastes the text back in there. It works surprisingly well. I can for example, open Browser Dev Tools; invoke Emacs; switch to js-mode, have all the bells and whistles: syntax-highlighting, autocomplete, etc.; write some javascript; finish editing and it would paste the code back into the Dev Tools console.<p>Sometimes I use Linux with EXWM. When I first discovered it, I got very excited. Not because now I could manage all windows through Emacs, but mostly because EXWM can &quot;translate&quot; and &quot;simulate&quot; the keys. So, for example, you can use same key-sequences that you use on Mac, but they&#x27;d translate into Linux native keys. There&#x27;s no &quot;context switching&quot;, you don&#x27;t need to re-adapt to the keys all the time. It took me a few hours to learn EXWM and configure it, next day I wrote exwm-edit² Emacs package.<p>Being able to write any kind of text in your favorite editor is truly liberating. I highly recommend trying. Be warned though - it&#x27;s impossible to live without that later. The only reason I don&#x27;t much use Windows these days - because I haven&#x27;t yet figured out the way of doing this in Windows.

Ultimately, responsibility lines must be drawn, standards established, adjudication performed, and unique or specific situations accommodated.

This great culture was all lost as a result of the merger with McDonnell Douglas [1], [2], [3].<p>Somehow the Boeing apologists want you to think that the unholy trinity of the ghost of McDonnell Douglas through the CEO at the time of the merger Harry C. Stonecipher (the father) and Dennis Muilenburg (the Son) who greenlighted the 737 MAX are responsible for this abomination. So much so that of the thousands of engineers who worked on the 737 Max not a single one raised issues with the engineering of the aircraft or wrote a blistering memo calling out its failing or quit in protest. They were all held in thrall by the power of this unholy trinity!<p>In the theory of causation, we distinguish between proximate vs. ultimate causality. Every proximate event can plausibly be claimed to be the cause for a subsequent event. As they say for want of a nail the war was lost. What is plausibly the cause for the engineering fiasco of the 737 Max? Why go back to the merger and why not blame the 9&#x2F;11 or the election of G.W Bush or even Barack Obama&#x27;s for this disaster? Why go back to the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas? Because it allows Boeing engineers to deflect blame for the terrible product they built and foisted on the flying public by coasting on their past reputations.<p>Eventually, all stellar organizations, public or private, become complacent (e.g. Israeli Intelligence Failure, 1973). Boeing made an unstable plane with a dangerous MCAS to get it to market fast. They then topped it off by making it rely on a single sensor and made the dual-sensor an <i>upgrade<\/i>. A sophomore engineering student with a 101 course on probability can see that this is tailor-made for diaster. They made an essential safety feature an upgrade!! They then proceeded to hide this monstrosity from every regulator and airline on the planet and insist that the plane was no different in every aspect of its flight behavior than its predecessor which was over 30 years old.<p>Boeing had become so criminally blatant that the head of airline training at Lion Air inquired about extra training for the 737 Max and they rebuffed him. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing proceeded to cast aspersion on the safety practices of Lion Air. Lion Air <i>does<\/i> have a spotty safety record but in this case, Boeing rebuffed their requests for additional training because it would set a precedent for other airlines in SE Asia. When that lack of training was a factor in the crash, Boeing proceeded to blame Lion Air. The mind boggles at the sheer chutzpah!<p>The recently released messages show how Boeing employees worked in unison to ensure no extra simulator training was required. Great engineering culture obsessed with safety, this aint!<p>Go ahead and blame the McDonnel Douglas merger for this. Or accept that whatever stellar engineering culture existed at Boeing is dead. We as a society need to stop scapegoating imaginary forces in the past and giving Boeing&#x27;s engineers a pass. We need to start agreeing that strong regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of the products Boeing puts out.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1776080&#x2F;how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1776080&#x2F;how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merg...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;longform&#x2F;boeing-737-max-crisis-shareholder-first-culture&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;longform&#x2F;boeing-737-max-crisis-sharehold...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perell.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;boeing-737-max\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perell.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;boeing-737-max<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-07 21:03:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mazsa"],"id":[22513535],"kids":[22513548,22513666],"parent":[22512215],"text":["The key technical reason is this one: &quot;While multiple factors led to these accidents, both crashes shared a key contributing factor: a new software system called the\nManeuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which Boeing developed to address\nstability issues in certain flight conditions induced by the plane’s new, larger engines, and their\nrelative placement on the 737 MAX aircraft compared to the engines’ placement on the 737 NG.&quot;"],"time":["2020-03-07 20:38:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thrwaway8347346"],"id":[22514471],"kids":[22520260],"parent":[22512215],"text":["&gt; In March 2016,Boeing sought,and the FAA approved,removal of references to MCAS from Boeing’s Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM),ensuring 737 MAX pilots were unaware of this new software and its potential effect on the aircraft’s handling without pilot command.<p>Are the execs in jail?"],"time":["2020-03-07 23:01:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sn41"],"id":[22515888],"kids":{},"parent":[22512215],"text":["I am concerned that the Dreamliner is also a potentially unsafe aircraft, as has been suggested often.

You cannot spin up 100K native threads to handle 100K requests that are IO bound (which is very common in a microservice architecture, since requests will very quickly block on requests to other services).

The conservative option is to limit yourself to 4 requests at a time.  But for most web applications, requests use tiny bursts of CPU in between longer spans of I&#x2F;O, so your CPUs will be mostly idle.<p>Let&#x27;s say we want to make better use of our CPUs and accept 40 requests at a time.  Some environments (Java, Go, etc) allow any of the 40 requests to run on any of the CPUs.  A request will have to wait only if 4+ of the 40 requests currently need to do CPU work.<p>Some environments (Node, Python, Ruby) allow a process to only use a single CPU at a time (roughly).  You could run 40 processes, but that uses a lot of memory.  The standard alternative is to do process-per-CPU; for this example we might run 4 processes and give each process 10 concurrent requests.<p>But now requests will have to wait if more than 1 of the 10 requests in its process needs to do CPU work.  This has a higher probability of happening than &quot;4+ out of 40&quot;.  That&#x27;s why this setup will result in higher latency.<p>And there&#x27;s a bunch more to it.  For example, it&#x27;s slightly more expensive (for cache&#x2F;NUMA reasons) for a request to switch from one CPU to another, so some high-performance frameworks intentionally pin requests to CPUs, e.g. Nginx, Seastar.  A &quot;work-stealing&quot; scheduler tries to strike a balance: requests are pinned to CPUs, but if a CPU is idle it can &quot;steal&quot; a request from another CPU.<p>The starvation&#x2F;timeout problem described in the post is strictly more likely to happen in process-per-CPU, sure.

Linux runs a pass down the list of listeners doing the epoll thing -- all of them! -- and tells every single one of them that something&#x27;s waiting out there. They each wake up, one after another, a few nanoseconds apart.<p>Linux is known to have poor fairness with multiple processes listening to the same socket. For most setups that require forking a process, you run a local loadbalancer on box, whether it&#x27;s haproxy or something else, and have each process listen on its own port. This not only allows you to ensure fairness by whatever load balance policy you want, but also lets you have healthchecks, queueing, etc.<p>&gt;Meanwhile, that original request is getting old. The request it made has since received a response, but since there&#x27;s not been an opportunity to flip back to it, the new request is still cooking. Eventually, that new request&#x27;s computations are done, and it sends back a reply: 200 HTTP&#x2F;1.1 OK, blah blah blah.<p>This can happen whether it&#x27;s an os threaded design or a userspace green-thread runtime. If a process is overloaded, clients can and will timeout on the request. The main difference is in a green-thread runtime it&#x27;s about overloading the process vs. utilizing all threads.

Also it seems like a bad design not to know how big to make the buffer, which means if you want to reliably get the whole file you either have to put it in a loop reallocating the buffer, or do a stat system call before be lucky with the race condition.<p>To be fair, this has been an issue since the first unix kernels, and even though &#x2F;proc and sysctl are an improvement over grepping kernel memory from user space (the incredibly hackish way old ps worked), in my opinion it&#x27;s still a big mess in various ways.<p>Just in case you aren&#x27;t aware, linux ps&#x2F;top&#x2F;etc. has to open possibly hundreds of fake files, parsing from text a bunch of stuff which may or may not be there or valid or the same data type depending on your kernel configuration or version. Just because you could write &#x27;ps&#x27; with awk, doesn&#x27;t make it good. I wouldn&#x27;t object at all to the &#x2F;proc interface, as a way of enabling simple tools, if there was also a decent function call interface.<p>Modern BSDs generally use sysctl, which although being better in theory, that you don&#x27;t have the overhead of useless translating numbers back and forth from text and looking for space characters, it still has the problem that it&#x27;s very dependent on subtle changes in the C data structures which can easily happen between version and architectures. But it also has the terrible drawback of not knowing how big the buffer should be and therefore having to be in an allocation fail loop, probably exactly when you don&#x27;t want it to happen, when you system is overloaded with way too many processes. I really don&#x27;t see why one couldn&#x27;t pass a memory allocator function, which could be called in the same manner as a signal handler.<p>I don&#x27;t know how windows stuff works inside, but to get process information you ask for a snapshot of the system from which you can return a set of handles to processes, which you can get information from. In other words, it allocates the appropriate things for you and has well defined set of information which you can query, all with a relatively simple function call interface from C. I wrote a &#x27;ps&#x27; that works on linux&#x2F;bsd&#x2F;macos&#x2F;windows, and even though I&#x27;m not at all fan of windows, the windows kernel does it better than all the unix kernels.<p>It&#x27;s actually not that hard to make an acceptable C interface to to say process information, if you ignore the problems of data structure variance. But ignoring it is really the root of the issues, so it seems fairly pointless. sysctl sort of tries to have a metadata system, but it doesn&#x27;t really address the data type problem well, and can end up using C structs from the kernel with same variance problems. For example task_struct in linux or struct proc on macos is kind of a big mess, but very important. You wouldn&#x27;t want to restrict it from changing in any way, but you do want to get some of that data to users.<p>Making a good C metadata interface is complex, and although it&#x27;s been done many times, it&#x27;s quite tricky to do well, and you would really want a kernel interface to be done very well. I like to imagine that there could be something less bloated than gtk gobject, but more featurefull than sysctl. Unfortunately when I look at code involved I start feeling like C isn&#x27;t really a good language for writing an operating system. But I still think that a well designed structured meta data system would be overall less overhead than &#x2F;proc and could even achieve better speed and reliability."],"time":["2020-03-07 16:21:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["shiblukhan"],"id":[22510515],"kids":{},"parent":[22506184],"text":["Hmm, how is one actually supposed to use O_SPECIFICFD in real life though?

Yields typically drop when there&#x27;s a flight to quality (i.e., people selling stocks to buy bonds). The upward pressure on bond prices drives yields down because people are willing to pay more for lower yields. Bonds are almost like a future of expected return on capital. If bond prices are high and yields are low, it suggests the market thinks equities will have a lower return.<p>Bonds and stocks have been fairly non-correlated over recent years, but this hasn&#x27;t always been so. It&#x27;s great for modern portfolio theory (i.e., holding a portion of stocks and bonds and rebalancing periodically). There&#x27;s no guarantee that it will stay this way.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not giving investment advice, but I think the current market panic is short term and non-systemic, so it&#x27;s not a terrible idea to consider rebalancing from bonds into stocks while the prices are good. If you think the market might keep dropping, then perhaps wait a little longer.<p>The truth is that trying to time the market is like throwing a dart at a board blindfolded, so you might as well take advantage of the current state instead of speculating about the future."],"time":["2020-03-07 16:33:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Danieru"],"id":[22511915],"kids":[22511997,22512186,22511940],"parent":[22511578],"text":["Bonds are a commited fixed return, which means the value of bond goes up if the going rate for new bonds goes down.<p>Thus bonds can be much more profitable than stocks when the marketing is going down. The central bank will drop rates, and thus any holder of existing bonds gets to sell their old bonds for more, maybe much more.<p>Of course this is not the big driver for bond demand. Rather bonds are demanded by money managers who are not allowed to take any risk. Think banks, and especially central banks.<p>Said money managers want to never-ever lose so much as a dollar of principle. They are not paid to maximize total return, but rather to manage this pile of money in such a way to never let it shrink.<p>You&#x27;ll see this set of incentives all over the world if you know where to look: money which is not expected to be invested.<p>Think of mega-corp&#x27;s payroll. Every month they need to pay X large number of dollars by the end of the month. Missing payroll by 1% would be such an incredible disaster it would lead to lawsuits. So big-corp does the sensible thing, and keeps the money in a money-market fund. Said money-market fund in-turn holds various short-term bonds (1 year or less).<p>Who borrows money for only 1 year or less? People who have a little bit of their own money with which to take risk and want to turn around and borrow longer term.<p>Bit by bit money which needs to be 100% safe, gets lent its way up the value chain until you reach end users.<p>My favorite example of this is how the large Japanese REITs finance themselves. These REITs will have a relationship with a single major bank. One might expect that since they have a special relationship said bank will provide all financing: but they do not. Instead the REIT borrows floating-rate loans from 10+ banks, including their special bank. Then the REIT turns around and offers these loans to the special relationship bank. Said special bank takes the 10+ float rate loans and provides the REIT a single (let same size) 30year fixed rate loan.<p>In this way everyone gets what they want. The REIT gets to tell investors their loans are not due for refinance until 2050. All the banks get to lend out money at 0.5% interest, and the special bank gets to take the other bank&#x27;s money and earn an extra 0.5% interest on top of it all in exchange for taking the interest rate risk.<p>So if you are wondering why bonds are weird: it is because you are not the customer."],"time":["2020-03-07 16:17:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thebrain"],"id":[22512152],"kids":[22512232,22512631,22512205,22512241,22512572],"parent":[22511578],"text":["I recently cashed out a Canada Savings Bond I had from when I was a kid and I after taking into account inflation I made about $8 while the government had my money for 20+ years."],"time":["2020-03-07 16:55:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tryptophan"],"id":[22511896],"kids":[22512603,22513111,22513619,22512741],"parent":[22511578],"text":["The dividend yield doesn&#x27;t matter (alone).
