In high school learned some C and C++, but once the internet became more accessible moved onto web based languages. After graduating high school, mostly due to having no guidance what so ever, I never put together in my head that I could pursue programming as a legitimate career, walking around with a 16 inch green mohawk pretty much guaranteed that I was labeled a lost cause.<p>I did a short stint in the Army, ended up in a minor touring punk band till about my mid-20&#x27;s. Decided that I wanted to pursue something different after realizing the band was a one way ticket to a dead end. I got the brilliant idea to pursue photojournalism. My timing was impeccable. As I was finishing the &quot;great newspaper crash&quot; had started and after working freelance for a few years I started a small photographic advertising firm. But... during all this I was still coding. This was in the early days of what was being called &quot;New Media.&quot; A lot of the places I was working with, the older journalists were not interested in how to use the web for better story telling. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get my hands dirty creating web sites for stories, working with flash to create interactive pieces, etc.<p>When I started the advertising firm, a client asked me if I could create a website for their business. Never being one to pass on the chance to make a few bucks, I confidently said &quot;Yes&quot; and proceeded to learn PHP and WordPress as fast as possible.<p>Around this time I also took the plunge and got married, which ended rather quickly in divorce. I decided to give up my rights to anything we accumulated during our marriage and was living on my friend&#x27;s couch just trying to get a fresh start. A friend told me about a company his partner worked for that was looking for a developer. With her reference and the pressure of being homeless and hungry, I was able to land a gig as the companies &quot;Web Master&quot; (yeah, they were still using that title lol). The company was sold and the purchaser had their own team and cut the local team to the bones so I started freelancing.<p>My tips?\n- Most developers and SWEs are just as clueless as you even if they have a degree, don&#x27;t be intimidated.\n- Realize that as a self-learner, you have an advantage of knowing how to learn quickly and efficiently.\n- Don&#x27;t make money a priority, salaries for the most part are a side effect if you love what you do.\n- Realize you need a break sometimes, burn out is real and will kick your behind if left unchecked (as my own failure of my first tip, I always am dealing with imposter syndrome which leads me to constantly spending even my off time trying to learn more so that my co-workers don&#x27;t ever say anything negative about me being self-taught)\n- Ignore trends and just follow what you enjoy doing or this will quickly become &quot;work&quot;. In my own recent experience, I&#x27;ve been feeling the pressure about moving into ML&#x2F;AI. After a nice long think these last few months as I end my first decade in this field I realized I have no interest in it, I just like building software. Coming to terms with that has done wonders in my mental state and brought a lot of inner peace.<p>Eventually a friend told me about a gig as a developer with an F500 energy company and helped me get my foot in the door. Worked my way up from a junior SWE to a lead position. I&#x27;ve now moved a few times and am now working in a financial company that is a major player in the world economy. Not because I think it will change much other than making me a better engineer, I&#x27;ve recently returned to school to get my CS degree and am preparing for another pivot into other areas of development once I&#x27;m done.<p>All in all, it wasn&#x27;t the life track I expected. What I have learned in all this is I love doing what I do. As others have said I think my enthusiasm and passion have taken me a lot farther than the typical &quot;coder bro&quot; that comes out of college with a CS degree because they heard they can make big money quickly."],"time":["2020-08-31 00:04:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mygo"],"id":[24333538],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["I am projected to break 6 figures in revenue by December as an independent consultant.<p>I was interested in web design as a kid. Built my first website when I was 11. Back then, there was no facebook or myspace — those wouldn’t be created until 2 years before I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. There really wasn’t a well-fleshed our career path in the web either — e-commerce hadn’t really blown up back then either. So I was just genuinely interested in the ability to publish for the web.<p>I learned by going to the library and borrowing books that teach you by you following along. But still, it was mostly just HTML and CSS, no JS or any real programming yet.<p>It wouldn’t be until college that I’d pick up programming. Not that I majored in CS or SWE or anything —  I majored in Biological Science and Studio Art, wanting you become a medical illustrator.<p>Nobody that I was around ever told me that “hey, you should check out CS”. It was always presented as this complicated and difficult subject. Something that was for others, but not for me. Much harder than Biology =p (they were wrong, lol, Biology is harder IMO, but I am genuinely interested in the topic and continue to learn more about it too)<p>During college I got involved in organizations outside of the classroom, and this was right around the time when facebook was a few years old and social media was emerging as a tool that can be used to market a cause and actually raise funds. The first viral video campaign came out this year, for the Ora Brush. So I ended up making a website for one of our events, linking it with google payments etc, promoting it on facebook via a video shared among local groups, and it registered people, kind of like what eventbrite does now. We were able to raise a couple thousand dollars the first year, and ~$20K total by junior year. So that experience exposed me to some of the cool things I could do with my web skills and I focused more intensively on learning to program more.<p>That landed me my first software engineering internship my Junior year, where although I had no experience with the backend programming language that they used I was able to pick it up and ship a finished admin client by the end of the internship. I was offered a full-time position as a software engineer at the completion of the internship, although I did not have a CS &#x2F; SWE degree. However, one thing that I discovered about myself during the internship was that working a desk job all day made me very depressed. Aside from QA sessions and design briefings with management I hardly interacted with people during my internship, due to the nature of the engineering job. And it felt like taking the job would be me sitting behind a desk in front of a computer all day for the rest of my life, not really interacting with many people... and for some reason that was very depressing and unsettling to me, personally. So instead of seeking employment I decided to go the freelance &#x2F; consultant route, and try to build my own clientele.<p>It took ~4 years to actually get any real consulting traction though. Partly due to some false starts in startup land... So I’m not sure if I would recommend it. I think for many people, the happy ending would have been getting a full time offer before graduating college. And the advice there for someone in their early 20’s would just be to network, get involved in things, build a portfolio, and seek out internships. An internship is basically an extended interview with a potential full time job offer on the other end... But unfortunately my particulars made that somehow undesirable, and so I decided to go the hard way.<p>Today I consult with business owners and partner with design agencies, helping businesses in e-commerce bring their business requirements to life. Sometimes it’s just giving general advice on how to build stuff, what they should be considering during the design process, and the rest of the time it’s programming. It’s all remote. Although many people have given remote work a thumbs down during the pandemic, I’m happy with the flexibility."],"time":["2020-08-31 19:09:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24329322],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":{},"time":["2020-08-31 09:52:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["adrusi"],"id":[24326835],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["<i>Why did you get into the field?

I got some relevant work experience in college, first working quarter-time for a startup writing node js libraries, then working for my university&#x27;s CS department as a sysadmin.

Back then I was on AOL and hackers made “progz” which added functionality on top of the platform. I was curious how they did made them and wanted to make one myself. So my father took me to compusa to talk to someone about programming. I left with a cd to install Visual Basic and a learn vb in 24 hours book. From there I spent a good portion of my childhood learning various languages, platforms, philosophies, and frameworks.<p>The first money I made was building ASP classic websites for local businesses when I was around 17. In college I started as a CS major but at the time the curriculum hadn’t caught up to the web and I wasn’t interested in what they were teaching. I was always a pretty entrepreneurial, so I transferred to the business program.<p>I try not to have regrets, but in hindsight I wish I followed  through with CS. It took me many years and a large investment of time to build the required fundamentals I think every software engineer should have. Also, all that stuff they were teaching later become interesting to me.<p>After I graduated I wanted to be a product manager. But no one would hire me and they kept pushing me towards software development. I decided if I was going to write software for a living I had to go work somewhere fun. So my first job was at CollegeHumor as a software engineer. It was the perfect transition from college to the real world. We worked hard and we had a tremendous amount of fun too.<p>Early in my career I had a chance to go into management and have mostly stayed in management since. I still program (outside the critical path), contribute to architecture, and try to keep my skills up to date and sharp.<p>I’ve joined various companies early enough where I’ve been the first engineering hire. I’ve had the chance to develop everything from scratch and then build a team to hand it off to. I’ve also joined mid stage startups and helped grow the team and tech.<p>I love what I do.<p>My advice...<p>- Do it because you love it. The best engineers I’ve worked with also happen to be the most passionate. They are curious and never stop learning.<p>- Learn CS fundamentals and how the things you use work under the hood<p>- Learn to create value for a business. Unless you are in academia or research you are being paid to create value for the business. I can’t believe how many engineers miss this point. This means that you should forget the pursuit of perfection and learn to balance good enough and technical debt.<p>- Learn how to speak to software people and business people. You’ll be more valuable if you can translate and be the bridge to both sides.<p>- Experiment with lots of different languages, philosophies, and paradigms. You’ll find the ones you like and take some lessons away from all of them.<p>- Dont get caught up chasing the next hot thing (language, framework, database, etc). At the same time don’t become obsolete either.<p>- Learn SQL. Really learn it. I’m not talking about the little bit to make your ORM work. A database is just another service you interact with. You should know what value it brings and how to interact with it.<p>- Money is good. Most people in this perfession seem to be doing okay. But don’t do it just for the money.<p>- If you plan to join a startup learn about Stock options and how they work. It’s amazing how many engineers work at startups and have no idea about their options and how it fits in as part of their comp package."],"time":["2020-08-31 00:34:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["j_rosenthal"],"id":[24326470],"kids":{},"parent":[24325548],"text":["Self trained SWE here.  AP CS in HS, 1 CS class in college.  Two degrees in archaeology which I studied and worked in on three continents (and an island).<p>- Why did you get into the field? What did you focus on at first?<p>It was kind of an accident.  Archaeology is inherently destructive, so data management is pretty important.  I&#x27;d always been on the data and mapping side.  I wound up in a data production&#x2F;management role at a government agency.  We had a web mapping product delivered that didn&#x27;t do what we needed, and it landed on my desk to figure out if we could use it to improve our internal workflows... and so I fiddled and read, and fiddled and watched Doug Crockford&#x27;s videos, and fiddled and went to see John Resig speak at a meetup... and along the way released multiple little (and eventually big) tools to help my colleagues get stuff done.  3 years later I was speaking at conferences about the technical side of what we were doing, not the archaeological side.

I do miss working outside and digging in the dirt though, but definitely enjoy the stability, lack of poison ivy, salary and benefits.<p>- How did you break that first-job barrier?<p>There were two barriers, neither of which I set out to break....  the first barrier was &quot;how did I get the Archaeology job to let me spend time learning and fiddling&quot;, while the second barrier was &quot;how did I get that first job where they actually hired me to do software developent&quot;.  To the first barrier, I built tools.  Tools beget more tools, beget absurd amounts of time saved, which led to bosses willing to let me say &quot;I have an idea, I know its possible, I&#x27;m sure I can build a &quot;good enough&quot; version, I just need time to figure it out.&quot;<p>To the second barrier, I asked questions, I answered questions, I went to lectures and was lucky.<p>- What were you doing before this?<p>Archaeology.

I don&#x27;t actually remember the details of when those things arrived very well.<p>But to me computers were like toys that you could play with infinitely because they could be programmed to do anything.

I remember doing more actual programs when we had a PC.  I spent many hours in GW-BASIC and remember creating a simple Space Invaders-like game among other things.<p>Also around middle school age I was getting into Turbo Pascal and starting to teach myself object-oriented programming.  I recommend the book Turbo Pascal Disk Tutor by Werner Fiebel which I had a late edition.<p>When I was around maybe 8th or 9th grade we had started learning algebra and I also my dad had bought this little second-hand 1960s math&#x2F;engineering reference handbook.  I used the equations in there for rotation to create a very simple system for displaying 3D wireframes using Turbo Pascal.  And made it into a really basic type of 3D modeler.<p>In high school I got a later edition of C++ How to Program by Deitel &amp; Deitel.<p>Also my mom was really into reading and brought home a ton of science fiction books many of which I read.  So I think that science fiction also inspired me a bit.<p>College was hard for me, aside from the programming classes which were easy, and some basic courses that mainly just tested literacy.  And I was not really able to make and keep friends so I ended dropping out.  I actually drove across the country and moved to New York where I hoped I would be able to get a job doing trading in C++ or something.  I feel like I was close to scoring a job with a few interviews but ran out of money and got into data entry and then legal word processing for a few years.  I remember building a workflow&#x2F;job tracking system for one of the offices I was in using Access and VBA and then failing to sell it to the programming department head who felt everything needed to be coded in C++.<p>But anyway it was quite difficult for me to get a career in programming.  I put a lot of time into things like Rent-A-Coder and eventually got a temp job that was semi-technical but not quite programming.  I created a system to help automatically compare multicolumn PDFs which was one of the primary jobs in that department.  That helped me land an actual programming contract.<p>To be honest, I think my lack of a degree or charisma and also a few health problems has all hurt me a bit and I have not really flourished as a computer programmer aside from a few more lucrative contracts.<p>The last several years I have focused on work that I can do remotely and that isn&#x27;t always the highest paying thing.  I have also been focusing more and more on startups and as much as possible my own startups or side projects.<p>Right now I work for a tiny startup for little money and live somewhere cheap.  It is at least not a very stressful or demanding job and it leaves me some energy and time for side projects.

Either sunrise or noon (or both) have to move. DST is a compromise to keep them from moving too much. But sunrise is a more important time than noon.<p>So I&#x27;ve proposed something I call Sunrise Standard Time. It abolishes DST and splits the 24 primary longitudinal time zones into as many as 120 zones by cutting at the tropics and polar circles. Clocks adjust gradually each day to keep sunrise near 6am. The tropics would follow sunrise at the equator, and the temperate zones (between the tropics and polar circles) would follow sunrise at ~ 30deg N or S. That adjustment is about 1 minute per day.<p>To refine things slightly, sunrise can be fixed at the latitude which divides the population in half in each zone (with the constraint that the N and S zones are mirrored). Those latitudes are approximately: 13.5deg for the tropical zone, 34.5deg for the temperate zones, and 68.5deg for all 2 million people living in the polar zones.<p>A further refinement is to split the per-capita sunrise aberration instead. This pushes the boundaries to slightly higher latitudes. For the temperate zones, the minimum per-capita offset of sunrise from 6am on the solstice is achieved by following sunrise at 37.5deg. That&#x27;s pretty close to Washington DC (39deg), Beijing (40deg), and Tokyo (36deg).<p>I suggest the tropics use the equator for simplicity.<p>SST will improve sun tracking for the vast majority of the world&#x27;s population with no sudden changes. It will also be easier to understand than DST. There are no dates to remember and, because the N and S zones are mirrors, it&#x27;s easy for someone in e.g. New York to understand what&#x27;s going on in Sydney.<p>Supporting links:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;e&#x2F;e1&#x2F;Hours_of_daylight_vs_latitude_vs_day_of_year_cmglee.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;e&#x2F;e1&#x2F;Hours_of...<\/a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;world.andersen.im&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;world.andersen.im&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-08-29 05:18:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["idoh"],"id":[24312709],"kids":[24313118,24312779],"parent":[24312545],"text":["Either eliminate it (preference) or make it permanent.

The difference in motivation and internal drive is significant.<p>Of course it&#x27;s still nice when people genuinely want to contribute to make the world a better place, but I&#x27;m skeptical about the support burden that these non-traditional contributors often put on project maintainers, because they tend to need more guidance on average and have less intrinsic understanding of the problem space and relevant use cases.

So nostalgic! The weird noises and radio crackles really hammer home the dystopian future. I can’t get the game to run full screen though (Linux problems) but it works okay in windowed mode. I don’t know how people game on Linux because despite the progress it’s still so far from being sane."],"time":["2020-01-22 16:52:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["skizm"],"id":[22119349],"kids":{},"parent":[22117297],"text":["Small note: free to play till launch.

And perhaps that&#x27;s the case.\nBut on the other hand, teaching languages are not the same as production languages. There are a number of languages that may be more powerful, but I think Delphi is a decent choice for teaching.<p>* You want to teach principles. Delphi allows you to teach OOP principles. You may or may not agree that OOP should be the starting paradigm, but that is at least a popular and conventional opinion.<p>* You don&#x27;t want complexity. I am sure there are many alternatives that do things better. Heck, I am sure some Haskell guy will tell us itt how he can build a graphical interface in half a line of code. But remember these are kids who may not even understand what a program even is!<p>* You want results. In particular, it should be easy to create things like a user interface via the IDE. The fun about learning programming is to create something cool. Kids today most often use UI&#x27;s and not terminals, and I think there is real value to allowing them to create something they might actually use. If you struggle through understanding your first program, and all it does is to print out &quot;Hello World&quot; on a black interface, it is somewhat underwhelming.\nBut if you can use the IDE to create your custom &quot;hello world&quot; box with pink borders and a unicorn picture - well that&#x27;s cool!<p>* Of course you want students to be able to transfer their skills to other languages. But that&#x27;s arguably not a big issue with Pascal.<p>* Finally, you want it all in one package. If you have to learn a vast module infrastructure, it just complicates things. Here is your &quot;language&quot;, you can do everything in it. \nI remember when we were learning, we started to try to build games and stuff. We used the tools available to use, because it was all very complex and we understood little. It was useful to have such a limited toolbox in the view of complexity. I think if we were forced to think about modules and many, many options to do a thing, we&#x27;d probably give up. Of course it is educational to try to come up with a solution with a limited set of tools!<p>From this perspective, Delphi is not a bad choice.

That second layer would accumulate enough luminous energy, before it discharges as a laser. Since a laser diode needs to reach a certain level of optical amplification before it discharges its beam.<p>So that makes one operational unit.  And you have to assemble a bunch of them together, to fire off to a third layer, that has a bigger diamond, which requires a larger energy threshold before it fires off.<p>And you keep repeating that until you get enough energy to do useful work.<p>So the whole thing ends up looking like a giant inverted pyramid, of a Rube Goldberg machine.<p>The final result, is that the laser is used to do useful mechanical work, like boiling water to create steam, to move a generator, to create electricity. It can also be used as a giant death ray, but that’s not very useful, except for the emperor that wants to hold a planet hostage.<p>Why this setup? To build something solid state, and somewhat passive, that can be used to reliably generate electricity for thousands of years. And it’s not a radioactive nuclear reactor that will create deadly waste that lasts thousands of years.<p>And it can also be orbited in space to beam the laser down to earth.  It should last longer than solar panels, which doesn’t seem to last very long.<p>And now that we can manufacture industrial diamonds that are more pure than a natural diamond (just add heat, energy, and pressure), that I wonder when we can make this cheaply enough.<p>The next trick would be to find that optimal arrangement of diamonds and design to make such a thing feasible."],"time":["2020-01-22 21:18:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["schallis"],"id":[22115100],"kids":[22115123,22117762],"parent":[22110501],"text":["I&#x27;ve been reading Berry&#x27;s The Unsettling of America and am finding it a very comforting counterpoint to my career in tech and associated feelings of burnout."],"time":["2020-01-22 07:24:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jcrabtr"],"id":[22117783],"kids":{},"parent":[22110501],"text":["Here&#x27;s a speech of Berry&#x27;s, entitled &quot;Local Economies to Save the Land and the People,&quot; that serves as a quick introduction to his thinking.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inthesetimes.com&#x2F;rural-america&#x2F;entry&#x2F;17778&#x2F;local-economies-to-save-the-land-and-the-people\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inthesetimes.com&#x2F;rural-america&#x2F;entry&#x2F;17778&#x2F;local-econ...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-22 15:28:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["creimers"],"id":[22116919],"kids":{},"parent":[22110501],"text":["I studied agronomy and am well familiar with Berrey&#x27;s work.

The move from &quot;the dinosaur moves and that is fun&quot; to fully fleshed mini games took me by surprise. No linearity there.<p>What I really appreciate about Scratch is how you can use the system without having to understand big parts of it. For example, one of the most complicated parts is the sprite editor (which does both vector and raster graphics). However, there&#x27;s a huge library of sprites, so it&#x27;s not a problem. You&#x27;ll only have to learn the editor when your ambitions grow and you want custom sprites.<p>Another curious thing is that Scratch encourages concurrent code right off the bat (every script runs in their own thread). My son is coming up with rather elegant patterns which are nevertheless quite different from my intuition, like controlling the sprite&#x27;s horizontal and vertical movement in separate scripts – which actually gives you easier to understand code.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a social aspect – discovering programs written by other kids and analyzing their code, and remixing them for your own projects.

All big car companies are trying to keep up with Tesla in electric car tech and additionally, if the transition comes, are burdened with a lot of production facilities for ICE cars.<p>Tesla is also much more than just cars, they have their own charging infrastructure, battery manufacturing, might play a big role in cell manufacturing going forward and are getting important in the energy sector, which might overtake the car business one day.<p>Also, Tesla is growing exponentially. This gives a lot of growth fantasy, that they might get to the size of Amazon one day, which would mean a multiple of stock value compared today.<p>But most importantly, and that is the reason they have such a strong support amongst their current and potential customers: they keep innovating. A bit like Apple of the old, if they announce a new product, prepare to see something really new. While traditional car manufacturers keep iterating on their products, Tesla has completely new things, just think of the Cybertruck. Which other car annoucement got that much press coverage as the Cybertruck? Also, the Semi could get huge.<p>There are also some very technical factors driving the recent raise of the stock: there have been quite a few good, if not great news (Q4 sales numbers, Gigafactory 3 operating within 1 year of the building start, Gigafactory 4 planned).\nThen there is still a huge amount of stock shorted, so while it not might be a full short squeeze, the shorts need to cover the stocks they shorted.\nFinally, Tesla might join the S&amp;P 500, which means, that a lot of institutions have to buy Tesla stock, which will drive it up further, at least short-time."],"time":["2020-01-22 18:25:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cestith"],"id":[22119531],"kids":{},"parent":[22118913],"text":["This is near the market valuation on IBM. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seekingalpha.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;4318281-ibm-turnaround-is\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seekingalpha.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;4318281-ibm-turnaround-is<\/a><p>Watch for some adjustments when people take (legal or publicity) action over troublesome app and website design.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tedstein&#x2F;status&#x2F;1144270122959417346\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tedstein&#x2F;status&#x2F;1144270122959417346<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tedstein&#x2F;status&#x2F;1219406746868953088\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tedstein&#x2F;status&#x2F;1219406746868953088<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-22 18:13:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cedivad"],"id":[22119692],"kids":{},"parent":[22118913],"text":["I would just like to point out this is 75% of Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap, and at this point I&#x27;m not sure what the bubble is anymore.

Admittedly this is less effective than preventing failures in the first place, but the challenge of raising tax dollars to fix a bridge becomes much easier when residents can no longer use said bridge to commute and thus have a much larger incentive to pay the necessary taxes."],"time":["2020-01-23 00:34:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["natmaka"],"id":[22123720],"kids":{},"parent":[22122460],"text":["Pertinent and sound points are made at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;best-of-2019-trickle-or-the-fire-hose\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;best-of-2019-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-23 01:46:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tempestn"],"id":[22123848],"kids":{},"parent":[22122460],"text":["Something I&#x27;ve noticed that came to mind as I happen to be vacationing in Playa Del Carmen (Mexico) while reading this.  I&#x27;m from Canada; visiting here, and walking through the town, I obviously notice many buildings, vehicles, roads, etc. are in much more of a state of disrepair than I&#x27;m used to at home.  This includes downtown areas, so it&#x27;s not a sprawl issue, but (I assume) just that there isn&#x27;t the same amount of capital invested into maintaining infrastructure, updating vehicles, etc. that we see at home.  (On average; obviously there are plenty of exceptions.)  Now, this isn&#x27;t surprising since GDP per capita in Mexico is much lower than in Canada or the United States.  However, in most visits I&#x27;ve made to the US, I&#x27;ve noticed the same thing to a lesser extent.  Almost anywhere roads are in worse condition that what I&#x27;m used to.  Outside of large cities, infrastructure in general seems more run-down than in similar places in Canada.  But this is all just in my limited personal experience.<p>So first of all, I&#x27;m curious whether this is actually the case, or just my own biased personal experience.  Have other cross-border travelers noticed this?  And if it is a real thing, then I&#x27;m curious what the reasons are, given that the US has somewhat higher GDP per capita than Canada.<p>Some possibilities I&#x27;ve considered are 1) wealth in the US is more concentrated in large cities than in Canada.  I&#x27;m sure this is the case in both countries, but perhaps the effect is greater in the US?  2) The spending priorities in the two countries are different.  For instance, US spending on healthcare and on military are both higher per capita than Canadian.  Perhaps Canada just spends more (publicly and&#x2F;or privately) on infrastructure and less on other things?  If so, is this the result of intentional priorities to some extent?  Or is it just an artifact of history or of governmental structures?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue that one approach is better than another, or even that my observations are generalize-able.  Just curious if others have noticed the same and have thoughts."],"time":["2020-01-23 02:04:14"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["davidw"],"id":[22123484],"kids":{},"parent":[22122460],"text":["If you like the article, his book is good too, it distills a lot of the thinking (that site has a <i>lot<\/i> of articles) into one source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;book\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;book<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-23 01:10:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["blackrock"],"id":[22125925],"kids":{},"parent":[22122460],"text":["How exactly would we colonize Mars anyways?<p>All equipment on Earth is run off fossil fuels: gasoline cars, diesel trucks, jet engines, helicopters, busses, etc.  Tesla electric cars barely make a dent, and rely on electricity produced by natural gas.<p>Solar intensity on Mars is much weaker than on Earth.  I assume this would require huge acres of land to capture as much energy from the sun via solar panels, as compared to Earth.  Fortunately Mars has electric dust storms that can scrub the solar panels for us, which would reduce the need to send human labor out to clean them.<p>So that leaves hydrogen and nuclear.  Hydrogen can be split via electrolysis, but this requires a lot of electricity. See problem #1.  And it requires expensive fuel cells to convert it back into electricity, so that it can be used on demand. But we haven’t yet mastered the mass production of fuel cells here on Earth, in order to produce it cheaply enough. Fuel cells requires platinum, gold, and a bunch of other precious metals.  So this would add to an already very expensive camping trip to Mars.<p>It’s possible wind turbines might be used, but Mars has a thin atmosphere, which already presents problem for spacecraft trying to land. But this may work for wind turbines.<p>Or geothermal, but his assumes the core of Mars is hot.  But from all satellite reconnaissance so far, Mars doesn’t seem to have any hot springs.<p>Then nuclear, this is likely the most viable technology. Possibly by RTG, which seems to be the most portable, as we can build that on Earth, and launch it to Mars.  You would need to launch a lot of them from Earth to ship to Mars, which further reduces the affordability, and kills the possibility of living off the land.  And if uranium exists on Mars, which I’m sure it does, then you’d need a huge industrial base just to mine and process it.  But first, you’d have to find it, which would require expensive human and robotic exploration outside in Martian excursion suits.<p>Fission based nuclear plants as we know it on Earth seems overly complex to use on Mars.  It’s just a giant water boiler, used to produce steam, to spin a generator, to create electricity.  And I doubt the technology as it is used on Earth, can function correctly in the cold winters of Mars.  You’d have to prevent your radioactive water coolant from freezing on you. So you’d need to redesign it in order to be used safely on Mars.<p>Fusion reactors, well, we still haven’t invented that yet, and they keep saying that it’s only 50 years away.<p>So that brings us back to fossil fuels.  If they’re correct in assuming that Mars used to be a tropical paradise, billions of years ago, and full of lush vegetation and flowing rivers, before it froze over, then, I’m certain that there is oil buried somewhere in the dirt.  It may be frozen, but we can bring in our fracking technology to extract it. Or maybe it’s frozen in tar sands, in which case we can excavate it.<p>So there you have it.  Mars has oil! Possibly..<p>Now, it’s time to go plant a flag.

Nuclei generally prefer to be at lower energy levels, and the transitions between levels are dictated by rules having to do with properties of the levels like spin and parity. The group used a proton accelerator to populate a particular level in a particular nucleus that is forbidden from decaying by emitting a gamma ray. They observed electrons and their antimatter counterparts coming out, which often suggests that some neutral particle produced them. Gamma rays can do this too through &quot;pair production,&quot; but gamma rays are mass-less and carry very little momentum compared to a heavy particle of the same energy. This is where the angular correlations come in, because they are ultimately influenced by the mass of the intermediate particle. They also measured the energy of the pairs and found it to be comparable to the mass energy of the proposed X17 particle. \nI think this is really interesting, and I&#x27;m not a theorist, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m convinced that this is necessarily evidence of a fifth fundamental force.
