Hence their other announcements that they are merely trying to keep up with Tesla as opposed to beating them (which is not a realistic goal for them short term).<p>Basically there are several companies who at the same time are trying to secure battery supplies while still peddling hybrids and hydrogen as well because they know they don&#x27;t have enough batteries. E.g. Hyundai and Honda have a few popular EV models that are pretty hard to order (long delivery times&#x2F;waiting lists) because production volume is limited. The reason is not because the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want to sell more but because they are unable to produce more; mainly because of a lack of access to batteries.<p>GM making this move means they mean business.

It relies upon a simple result from network&#x2F;graph theory that I will outline here.<p>Assume, if you will, that typical social networks contain a small number of people who are highly connected (hubs) and a large number of people who are much less connected (spokes). The hubs could be e.g. your GP&#x2F;physician, your teacher, or even just your popular friend. It would not be surprising if these people have a much high transmission rate for a virus than people who have a much smaller social circle - all other things being equal, and also crucially, they often connect mutliple sub-networks (GP is a good example here).<p>We would of course like to ensure that we test (perhaps regularly) the people who are at the center of these networks - the hubs. How do we find out who these people are? It turns out that you can do this probabilistically. First, I pick someone at random from the population. I then instruct them to pick a contact&#x2F;friend at random. The person they pick is statistically much more likely to be a &#x27;hub&#x27; than a &#x27;spoke&#x27;, even though we have no explicit knowledge of the network and carried out this process randomly. A good way to visualise this is to imagine a toy network of say one person in the middle, connected to everyone else, and 10 other people, all connected to the person in the middle but nobody else. You can see that in 10&#x2F;11 cases, a &#x27;spoke&#x27; is selected who then goes on to select the &#x27;hub&#x27; (what we want) whereas in only 1&#x2F;11 cases the hub is initially chosen, who then chooses one of the other 10 contacts at random.<p>A practical implementation of this could be to choose N people at random and send them a letter or text message instructing them to pick e.g. the (modulo) 5th person from their contacts list whose name begins with R. They would then contact this person and inform them that they should present themselves at a doctor and be tested should they develop any symptoms. There are obvious optimisations to be made here in terms of name distributions and other subtleties of course, and certainly providing a list of fallback randomiser instructions, if they can&#x27;t find someone fitting that criteria.<p>Bottom line is, even if many people don&#x27;t comply, you can increase the probability that you end up prioritising testing of people who are very connected, and thus likely to spread disease, which can be invaluable when your testing capacity is constrained."],"time":["2020-03-07 22:55:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Leary"],"id":[22514444],"kids":[22514671],"parent":[22513664],"text":["2 problems:<p>1.

Apart from privacy I never really liked the direction DuckDuckGo was going in (more below). Just recently I decided to search for an alternative search engine once again.<p>Things I want to consider are:<p>1. <i>Reasonable privacy<\/i> - I don&#x27;t want the search engine to take super invasive steps to track me (but still keep in mind that I need to send my queries to someone, so there&#x27;s really no expectation of full privacy)<p>2. <i>No personalization<\/i> - I want to be sure that only obvious parameters affect the ranking of search results (e.g. manual language or location selection, manual time selection, ...). Want to avoid personalization and a search bubble at all cost.<p>3. <i>No results processing<\/i> - I want links to original sources, not processed or aggregated information with little or no references to sources.<p>4. <i>Independence<\/i> - I&#x27;d like to support a search engine that can operate as independently as possible. A search engine with it&#x27;s own crawler seem far more resilient to external influence than a meta or proxying search engine.<p>Google falls short on 1, 2 and 3. But holds up very well on 4.<p>With Bing or Yandex I don&#x27;t have much experience, but expect something similar.<p>DuckDuckGo heavily advertises 1. I guess 2 follows from it but didn&#x27;t find it mentioned as an explicit goal. On 3 and 4 it falls short. If I remember correctly DuckDuckGo was one of the first to offer processed results (Instant answers). I&#x27;m not sure about the situation now, but I believe it started of as a meta search engine and proxied most searches to Yahoo, Bing or Yandex. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;duckduckgo-help-pages&#x2F;results&#x2F;sources&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;duckduckgo-help-pages&#x2F;results&#x2F;so...<\/a> still lists Bing prominently.<p>Startpage.com seems to get me 1 and 3. But 2 is questionable since the results are still tailored by Google (not to me personally, but it&#x27;s still not clear what factors into ranking). And 4 obviously doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>To find a better alternative I started looking for search engines with independent web crawlers. So far I found mojeek.com, beta.cliqz.com and qwant.com. mojeek.com looks good on 1,2,3,4 but results aren&#x27;t quite good enough. With Cliqz I&#x27;m not sure about personalization, but otherwise looks good.<p>I finally settled on Qwant.com for now. It promises privacy and no personalization explicitly. Has an independent crawler. Sometimes it tries to provide a processed answer card, but so far I managed to ignore that.

At that time, storage cost ~$4.50&#x2F;TB on Sia to back up large real world files (backups of DVDs and Blu-Rays).[0] Community members have re-run my tests every few months, most recently in October 2019, when the cost was measured at $1.31&#x2F;TB, though it&#x27;s worth noting that recent tests use synthetic data optimized to minimize Sia&#x27;s cost.[1] It&#x27;s also unclear how much the market value of Sia&#x27;s utility token affects these costs, as the price of Siacoin has fallen by ~80% since I conducted my original set of tests.<p>The calculations in today&#x27;s blog post account for the labor cost of assembling hardware, but leave out major other labor costs:<p>1. You need an SRE to keep the servers online. Sia pushes out updates every few months, and the network penalizes you if you don&#x27;t upgrade to the latest version. In addition, to optimize costs, you need to adjust your node&#x27;s pricing in response to changes in the market.<p>2. You need a compliance officer to handle takedown requests. Since Sia allows anyone to upload data to your server without proving their identity, there&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from uploading illegal data to the network. If Sia reached the point where people are building $4k hosting rigs, then it&#x27;s safe to assume clients would also be using Sia to store illegal data.

Renting a dedicated server for a game, web hosting, hell even GPU mining makes more.<p>(a single 1080ti can do about 1$ a day in gross revenue on grin&#x2F;eth&#x2F;etc - which can be had used for ~400 bucks- Or you can get a p102 which is the mining card version with no display output for 250 bucks) - Payback with power costs&#x2F;etc.. well below the 10 year threshold of siacoin)<p>Now where it might be interesting (IF there is demand), is just adding harddrives to an existing infrastructure already in place. So if you are a GPU miner and have 1000 rigs already in place, just adding a single 4TB harddrive to each machine might not be too bad- They go for about $50 each used and according to this, will pay back $8 a month with minimal extra costs"],"time":["2020-03-07 11:41:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["franciscop"],"id":[22510745],"kids":[22510840],"parent":[22506722],"text":["The website seemed okay and even useful until:<p>&quot;Both renters and hosts use Siacoin, a unique cryptocurrency built on the Sia blockchain.

Contrast this with a typical raid scheme where a failed drive means the nth erasure fragment of every file is gone  - correlated failures.

Most buttons have detailed descriptions of what they do and multi-layered, visible keyboard shortcuts that activate them quickly. Some even have an additional drop down for more options, so i.e. the &quot;view&quot; button in Access might switch you between the two most common views when clicked, but you can expand it and select a different view if need be.

And if your peer group is composed of assholes, then being an asshole is a positive trait as long as you&#x27;re not an asshole towards members of that group.<p>Another thing: when you&#x27;re a no-name upstart, reputation matters little because nobody knows you.

An individual is juggling <i>a lot<\/i> of different priorities in their lives, not least of which is &quot;saving money&quot; and &quot;buying stuff one likes&quot;. So e.g. Coca-Cola does a pretty lot of evil stuff, but people have strong taste preferences in the product category Coca-Cola sells, so nobody really boycotts them. Or, pretty much every major brand of smartphones is doing evil things, and every major telco provider is filled with assholes - yet as a citizen of the western world, I really <i>do<\/i> need to have a smartphone. So I have to choose <i>someone<\/i>. Or, a grocery store next to the place I used to live would wash stale meat with detergent and sell as fresh. This lands straight into asshole category, but I still went there, because a) it was the closest store, and b) I have no guarantee other stores don&#x27;t do the same (and plenty of reasons to suspect they do).<p>And yet another thing: taking VC investments; when investors come knocking for their returns, plenty of startups are forced to become assholes.<p>--<p>TL;DR: The market rewards assholes.

Especially the more you climb the ladder. As my bootstrapped business reached $3M ARR, a wave of no-name investors approached us. Some of the term sheets more than insulted me. They sought to take control of the company without any payout for the co-founders or employees. They just wanted to capitalize a company they&#x27;d now own.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t understand why.<p>(Warning: Probably unpopular opinion for capitalistic mind sets following)<p>Well, big surprise, because they got corrupted (ethically) by their money and greed, or that is the way they got a hold of it in the first place. They got some, so they want more. Money buys almost anything in capitalistic society after all. They see a chance to take advantage of a fellow human being, a chance to profit! They do not care about the human in your business. They care about ways they could profit from it. You are only a means of increasing their capital. The higher the amount of money investors have, the more likely, that they got it through ethically questionable means, because that is, where the big money is made.<p>There might be ethical investors out there too. Haven&#x27;t knowingly met any such yet, might have unknowingly met some. It is probably also quite difficult to keep a clean sheet through all the complexity of today&#x27;s financial world.<p>(perspective change from having a company which others want to invest in, to investments being done by people)<p>There is a difference between working for a wage and using money to &quot;magically&quot; create more money, fueling turbo capitalism. In many cases that difference is an ethical one: What investments does one make? Can one be sure, that those investments are not actually investments, which flow directly or indirectly into production of weapons, climate destroying big companies, pesticide producing giants, who are responsible for decimating bee populations and starvation in third world countries? \nAnyone &quot;investing&quot; should really think hard about it and be on the lookout for superficially nice investments, which are actually indirectly quite unethical.<p>Now I will admit, that there are probably still many ways to make ethical investments. Of course there are. It&#x27;s just that those are not yielding the highest returns. You could invest in social projects, in green energy&#x2F;technology, in research for many good things. You can even donate to a good cause (like protection of rain forest) and thereby make an investment into all our future.<p>Most people, who &quot;invest&quot; in something however, are almost completely after the returns those things yield and do not give a damn about the ethical aspect of that investment. They do not give a thought about indirectly investing in some huge company, which takes part in producing weapons or building the next big coal mine (thinking of a recent example).<p>Lets take a look at for example DAX (German stock index). Anyone investing in any &quot;financial product&quot; that invests into the top n DAX companies. There we have BASF and Bayer, responsible for producing, selling and lobbying for pesticide usage and killing natural diversity and species, starvation of people in India and forcing farmers to use genetically modified seeds, in the name of profit. We have BMW and Daimler, where at least to my knowledge Daimler is part of the diesel scandal, making people believe their cars were cleaner than they really are, indirectly guilty of dealing huge damage to our environment and health. We have Deutsche Bank and Telekom there as well. Telekom just sucks for being a monopoly (at least was) and keeping technology way behind in Germany. Deutsche bank does not have a good name, when we talk about ethics, although I do not personally know exactly what they did. Probably investments in weapons and stuff like that. And wasn&#x27;t Adidas connected to child labour in third world countries?<p>So basically anyone investing in DAX as such invests in these at least partly evil players, knowingly or unknowingly. But people are being scared by people working in banks and other places, who tell them that, if they do not invest into something with more risk, they will not be able to take advantage of those precious percentages at the stock market and then those scared people stop thinking and become investors. Notice also how usually the people, who are consulting you at banks and insurances try to steer you into the direction of stock market backed investments. Usually they will make other options simply look worth, simply based on percentages. That is often, because when you invest into such products of theirs, their company gets more flexibility of investment itself and can do more unethical investments, yielding higher returns for them.<p>In my opinion anyone investing into anything has a responsibility. That responsibility is not to increase their own riches, but to look out (not only superficially) for any ethically questionable consequences of their investment and even the responsibility to try to make the world a better place with their investment."],"time":["2020-03-06 20:54:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RestAndVest"],"id":[22510494],"kids":{},"parent":[22504897],"text":["Keep in mind that many people become business owners because they are too toxic and conflictive as employees."],"time":["2020-03-07 09:09:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["draw_down"],"id":[22505641],"kids":{},"parent":[22504897],"text":["Who decides who is an asshole?

These diets are probably easiest to do in the USA with its huge industrial meat industry.\nIn other countries, like here in Europe, you&#x27;d probably need to be a millionaire to buy that much meat in the first place.

The first was holistic, comparing brain network stability after participants had spent one week on a standard (unrestricted) vs. low carb (for example: meat or fish with salad, but no sugar, grains, rice, starchy vegetables) diet. In a standard diet, the primary fuel metabolized is glucose, whereas in a low-carb diet, the primary fuel metabolized is ketones. However, there might have been other differences between diets driving the observed effects. Therefore, to isolate glucose vs. ketones as the crucial difference between the diets, an independent set of participants was scanned before and after drinking a small dose of glucose on one day, and ketones on the other, where the two fuels were individually weight-dosed and calorically matched. The results replicated, showing that the differences between the diets could be attributed to the type of fuel they provide to the brain.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-03-06 16:58:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["smallcharleston"],"id":[22519887],"kids":{},"parent":[22503286],"text":["The reason I refuse to read about keto is that pretty much all doctors and public health organizations I’ve seen recommend basically the same things: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, replace saturated fats with unsaturated if possible, low fat dairy, nuts, legumes, fish, some poultry sometimes, strictly controlled alcohol.<p>Until these guys start recommending something such as keto my basic assumption is that it’s either a weird fringe diet or a diet only applicable to very specific medical issues (eg seizures) that me (not a medical professional) should not try on myself.<p>If I go to a doctor and they ask how my diet is and I tell them I eat the stuff I listed above, I’m fairly certain they will tell me good job.

System currently boots from a USB dongle; the board very conveniently does have a USB receptacle directly soldered, so it doesn&#x27;t expose the flash key to the outside. No problems in about 4 years, but some day probably this year I&#x27;ll have to get new disks either due to aging or available space, then get the ball rolling and manually upgrade to XimaNAS (automatic update from this NAS4Free version is risky), or moving to FreeNAS&#x2F;TrueNAS, or jumping ship completely and get one Helios64 box plus OMV since BSD support on ARM isn&#x27;t there yet. Any comments?<p>ps.

The extra bonus feature was their usage of a proprietary mesh network, so the music didn&#x27;t stream over your increasingly-overburdened regular wifi network.<p>Well, most of those advantages have kinda gone away.

My nontechnical wife never warmed to Sonos at all, but she can use iTunes on her phone with aplomb, and playing music in the living room uses the same interface as playing music on her headphones.<p>- Library access was a sticking point, given that Apple formerly relied on a convoluted approach here, but by subscribing to Apple Music the problem is completely sidestepped. I pay for this mostly so I don&#x27;t ever have to plug my phone into the media box and sync files -- for me or for my wife. That&#x27;s worth the price right there, to be honest, but in addition to that you get access to nearly anything. It&#x27;s rare I can&#x27;t find what I want there.

If two people are working on one issue, you have to balance the benefit of that versus two people working on two problems.<p>- I&#x27;m more effective when I can focus, and sometimes I need to spend an hour deep-thinking about a subject and perhaps pseudocoding something.  Pair programming with someone remotely and having long periods of silence would be... weird.<p>- People seem to view PP as a measure of success.  The more a team is pairing, the more success being experienced.  Right?<p>- If someone isn&#x27;t into pair programming often, that&#x27;s seen as a negative.<p>- 95% of people who pair remotely need better microphones or accoustic environments.  I wish remote companies would ship their employees a pair of AirPods, a Yeti mic, and some acoustic foam squares.<p>- Pairing is more consistently useful for reviewing large code changes where it can be difficult for a reviewer to reason about the work that was done.  Going through it with the author and doing a screen share can make all the difference.<p>My conclusion is that pair programming can be good for some things, but I would consider it a red flag if a company highly emphasizes pair programming or coerces people to do it.  Treating pair programming like a panacea dismisses the fact that people of different personality types have been writing perfectly good software without pairing since time immemorial, and that there are other ways to improve code and product quality.  What I think can be nearly as effective as pair programming is getting code reviewed early and often.  I&#x27;m not the best at this yet, but I&#x27;ve noticed that life is just better when I don&#x27;t do a ton of work and wait for it to be reviewed when it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot;."],"time":["2020-03-06 18:29:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ggregoire"],"id":[22505383],"kids":{},"parent":[22503030],"text":["There is a construction site in front of my office.
