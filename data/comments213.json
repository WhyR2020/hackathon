I gave the person an assignment that, given their experience, should have been well within their capabilities. They kept not delivering and kept up a steady patter of &quot;knocking down the barriers&quot; communications which, valid or not, got me wondering what was going on with this person. At the one month point I gave them a pretty clear deliverable and worked with them for a timeline for when it would be done. They were &quot;almost&quot; done at the agreed upon time two weeks later, so I asked them to present it one week from that date to the group. The presentation was an epic disaster in terms of not coming close to meeting the deliverable, not showing any development in understanding the problem, and generally being something a new hire could have come up with in less time.<p>At our 1:1 that week we talked about the deliverable, my expectations given the experience they claimed to have, and what we got. I got a lot of &quot;I just need x, y, and z and then it will be done.&quot; kind of discussion.

A study in Norway found that 96% of cases of corporate fraud were not reported to authorities.[1] The financial and reputational costs of a company pursuing prosecution outweigh the benefits, and it&#x27;s usually better to keep things quiet: terminate the individual and recoup whatever losses you are able to without involving the legal system.<p>Even in this scenario of blatant fraud, Arram stopped short of explicitly naming the individual. ZeroCater was saved a huge hiring mistake, but &#x27;Sam&#x27; probably went on to another company that is clueless to his scam.<p>This is why I always ask why someone is looking for a new opportunity&#x2F;why they left their previous position. If the answer doesn&#x27;t add up, I press for more info. Maybe they&#x27;re just embarrassed because they were fired? People get fired all the time for reasons that don&#x27;t necessarily preclude them from being valuable to me. But if they still can&#x27;t come up with an answer that makes sense, I start &quot;noticing I&#x27;m confused&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;01639625.2016.1196993?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;journalCode=udbh20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;01639625.2016.11...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-24 21:45:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sumanthvepa"],"id":[22136134],"kids":[22136141,22136170,22136166,22136229],"parent":[22135899],"text":["Clearly there was fraud here.

Most modern FORTH don&#x27;t have SMUDGE any more, which has been replaced by HIDE and REVEAL.<p>Perl programmers may savor and fetishize their weird arbitrary unreadable code like letter-sparse sigil-saturated line noise, but Perl can&#x27;t hold a candle to the subtle beauty and enigmatically punctuated surrealistic symmetry of FORTH code:<p><pre><code>    8 : BNF:   [COMPILE] : SMUDGE COMPILE &lt;BNF ; IMMEDIATE\n    9 : ;BNF   COMPILE BNF&gt; SMUDGE [COMPILE] ; ; IMMEDIATE\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&gt;b) Line 9 shows a recursive production, &lt;S&gt;. During the definition of a production, its name is automatically unSMUDGEd.<p>Of course it&#x27;s still possible to write self documenting FORTH code:<p><pre><code>    : C(-; LICK SMILE NOSE WINK ;\n<\/code><\/pre>\ncomp.lang.forth: Why smudge?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!topic&#x2F;comp.lang.forth&#x2F;olO-VHXJa1Q%5B1-25%5D\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!topic&#x2F;comp.lang.forth&#x2F;olO-...<\/a><p>&gt;Does &quot;smudge&quot; have any other use than to stop the current word being\nfound during a dictionary lookup?  If not, then its only use would\nseem to be to allow a word to be defined in terms of another (older)\nword with the same name.  Are there some useful things that can be\ndone with this ability that make up for the (minor) extra complication?<p>My other favorite (and much more useful and powerful for metaprogramming) FORTH words are &lt;BUILDS and DOES&gt;, but &lt;BUILDS has been replaced by CREATE now, so they don&#x27;t look as cool when used together.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amforth.sourceforge.net&#x2F;TG&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;Builds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amforth.sourceforge.net&#x2F;TG&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;Builds.html<\/a><p>&lt;BUILDS is the older sibling of CREATE. It has been in use in pre-ANSI Forth’s and is still around as an supplemental tool. It is a parsing word that takes the next word from the input source and creates a dictionary entry in the current word list. Unlike CREATE it does not add an execution token. Thus the word list entry created is unfinished and calling it will crash the system.<p>The definition of the word list entry is finished with the DOES&gt; section, that makes the word list entry a proper callable word.<p>The big advantage over CREATE is that CREATE requires a rewrite of the contents of the execution token. That is on microcontrollers with the flash based dictionary only possible if a single cell can be re-programmed. The Atmegas can do that with little efforts, the MSP430 lacks essential ressources to do so.<p>From the programming perspective there are no differences. &lt;BUILDS can safely replace CREATE in defining words that contain a DOES&gt; section as well. All other occurances of CREATE should remain unchanged.<p><pre><code>    : constant create , does&gt; @i ;\n    \\ or\n    : constant &lt;builds , does&gt; @i ;<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-01-24 10:09:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["java-man"],"id":[22138832],"kids":[22140227],"parent":[22131119],"text":["When I coded a Forth virtual machine in 8080 assembly in 1985, I soon realized Forth is a write-only language.<p>Fun, but totally unusable for a mediocre programmer like myself."],"time":["2020-01-24 16:05:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Donald"],"id":[22142316],"kids":{},"parent":[22141333],"text":["NASA is now reporting the problem as fixed: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mars.nasa.gov&#x2F;msl&#x2F;mission-updates&#x2F;8589&#x2F;sols-2653-2655-attitude-adjustment&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mars.nasa.gov&#x2F;msl&#x2F;mission-updates&#x2F;8589&#x2F;sols-2653-265...<\/a><p>(Press article at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;mars-rover-curiosity-attitude-glitch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;mars-rover-curiosity-attitude-glitch.h...<\/a>)"],"time":["2020-01-24 21:49:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lisper"],"id":[22142855],"kids":[22143545],"parent":[22141333],"text":["A better title would be: Mars rover stops moving because it lost track of its orientation.

This distinction is central to his argument, so it&#x27;s worth discussing for a minute.<p>&gt; Software development problems are complex, i.e. made up of many interacting sub-problems. Some of that complexity is accidental. This doesn&#x27;t imply randomness or sloppiness, but only that the complexity isn&#x27;t inherent to the problem; that it&#x27;s only the result of our (human) failure to achieve perfection.<p>&gt; If you imagine that you could whittle away all the accidental complexity, you&#x27;d ultimately reach a point where, in the words of Saint Exupéry, there is nothing more to remove. What&#x27;s left is the essential complexity.<p>Okay, that might be a useful way of thinking of things...<p>But the author then goes on to talk about how he thinks that Fred Brooks underestimated the percentage of accidental complexity in the average project.<p>However, he then starts to go into things he thinks are &quot;silver bullets&quot;, but most of them are tools that, in my opinion, address <i>essential complexity<\/i>:<p>* The World Wide Web: in his description, this solves a problem of the complexity of finding how to do things. Can we imagine a solution where finding out how to do things isn&#x27;t part of the system? No? Under the definition, that&#x27;s essential complexity.<p>* Git: in his description this solves the problem of tracking changing source. Can we imagine programming where we don&#x27;t need to keep track of what source changes happened? I can, maybe, in a distant future where programming is done an entirely different way, but I&#x27;d argue that at that point it&#x27;s not really the same problem. If we&#x27;re writing code to solve a problem, then tracking changes to that source is essential complexity within that solution.<p>* Garbage collection: again, maybe there will be a computer that works completely differently (quantum computers?) but under current architecture, the physical machinery of a computer has limited space, so we need to reallocate memory that is no longer being used. That&#x27;s not accidental complexity, that&#x27;s essential complexity. There are other solutions to this, but every program solves it in some way, whether it&#x27;s by reference counting, manual allocation, borrow checking, preallocating everything, or just allocating everything on the stack and copying everything, and each of these has complexity: that complexity is essential.<p>I think what this all points to is that <i>essential complexity isn&#x27;t intractable: you can make it someone else&#x27;s problem.<\/i> In these cases, we&#x27;re taking some part of the essential complexity of solving a problem, and letting our ISP and websites solve it, or letting code that we don&#x27;t maintain solve it.

The focus changed to using the most common idioms, the clearest and cleanest and most concise way of writing stuff down, and avoiding smart hacks or, if necessary, encapsulating and documenting smart hacks.  Not being shy of writing stuff multiple times until it really is clean and inviting to be read and understood.  Using a very strict style (including when&#x2F;where to put white space and line breaks) that everyone else also uses so that code is easy to read for everyone.  It improved my programming enormously and the bugs&#x2F;line ratio went down.  It also gave a much better intuition to smell fishy code.

It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m uniquely awesome, it&#x27;s because keeping everything testable means it has to be code where I&#x27;ve already clearly broken out what it needs to function, and how to have it function in isolation, so when it actually has to function in real isolation, it&#x27;s very clear what needs to be done and how.<p>Of all the changes I&#x27;ve made to my coding practice over my 20+ years, I think that&#x27;s the biggest one. It crosses languages. At times I&#x27;ve written my own unit test framework when I&#x27;m in some obscure place that doesn&#x27;t already have one. It crosses environments. It crosses frontend, backend, command line, batch, and real-time pipeline processing. You need to practice writing testable code, and the best way to do it is to just start doing it on anything you greenfield.<p>My standard &quot;start a new greenfield project&quot; plan now is &quot;create git repo, set up a &#x27;hello world&#x27; executable, install test suite and add pre-commit hook to ensure it passes&quot;. Usually I add what static analysis may be available, too, and also put it into the pre-commit hook right away. If you do it as you go along, it&#x27;s cheap, and more than pays for itself. If you try to retrofit it later.... yeowch."],"time":["2020-01-23 18:54:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hellofunk"],"id":[22132435],"kids":[22133973,22132694,22136262,22132662,22135882],"parent":[22129757],"text":["Avoiding cleverness at all costs.

Not only because of different geographic&#x2F;demographic situations, but simply because of the figures themselves.<p>First, there is the problem of being careful understanding which figure is given to you.<p>For example, for Toulouse, he quoted 125.7 M metro+tram <i>trips<\/i>. But 125.7 M is not the number of trips, but the number of metro+tram <i>&quot;validations&quot;<\/i> (each time you transfer to another bus or metro line, it counts as an extra validation (yes, in this city, even between metro lines)). The total number of trips (132 M) is 30% lower than the total number of validation (188 M). There is no detailed by mode number of trips, so you cannot get the number of metro+tram trips. I guess the best you can do is apply the 30% discount to get an approximation of 88 M metro+tram trips [and I shouldn&#x27;t even write that because that depends how we decide to count mixed-mode trips].<p>Then, there is the problem of deciding if some assumptions which are valid here are still valid there.<p>He has decided to ignore bus network.<p>Still in the case of Toulouse, the bus network usage is a bit bigger than one metro line, but the thing is that there are only 2 metro lines... Very roughly, each of (metro line 1), (metro line 2) and (bus network) is 1&#x2F;3 of the total passengers. Worse, if you consider the number of kilometres ran, the bus network represents 73%!<p>Now you may argue that most bus passengers transfer from or to the metro. It could be true. But that would only affect the relevance of the figure of trips&#x2F;inhabitant.<p>However if you want to talk about the quality of the service, the quality of the offer, I don&#x27;t think you can neglect something that represents 1&#x2F;3 of the passengers transported and almost 3&#x2F;4 of the kilometres offer (those figures mean that the metro lines only cover a very small part of the territory, and that&#x27;s indeed how it is, the bus network is 50 times longer than the metro network). The frequency and spread of the bus offer has to be taken into account, hasn&#x27;t it? Maybe in other cities the bus network can be neglected, but I don&#x27;t think it a good idea to neglect it by default.<p>(One could add that in the case of Toulouse, the bus traffic has grown clearly and steadily, while the metro traffic plateaued years ago.)<p>And at this point you fall back on the first difficulty I mentioned: how difficult it is to compare networks which grew differently and developed different structures."],"time":["2020-01-25 01:11:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["monksy"],"id":[22143166],"kids":{},"parent":[22136712],"text":["I wonder what this looks like for Chicago."],"time":["2020-01-24 23:55:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Animats"],"id":[22141070],"kids":[22141347,22142151,22143061],"parent":[22140196],"text":["(2016) See Wikipedia.[1]<p>Press release from University of Bristol.[2]<p>Article which actually has some numbers.[3] 100µW for 5,000 years.

I&#x27;m also skeptical that they could use these batteries to practically power a cellphone. So a cellphone requires about an average power of about 200 mw assuming we deplete the battery once every 24 hours. 1 gram of Carbon-14 experiences about 156*10^9 decays per second, which release at most 156 KeV in the form of beta particles, so carbon 14 has a power density of about 4 mW&#x2F;g. By itself this is decent, but conversion of these high energy electrons to electricity won&#x27;t be very efficient. 9.8% efficiency has been attained for diamond films under electron irradiation[1], although because the beta particles emitted have a much larger energy than the bandgap of all the semiconductors we know, the efficiency is likely to be less. So assuming 10% conversion efficiency, we need 500 grams of just C-14. This about twice the mass of the iphone 11 pro max. It is probably not very practical to haul a large brick of radioisotopes around to power a phone.<p>However, in theory it is possible to make a nuclear battery capable of providing this amount of power taking up only a fraction a phone&#x27;s mass. [3] shows that it is theoretically possible to make nuclear batteries with power densities of 1-50 mW&#x2F;g. The way they propose to accomplish this is to use the alpha particle emissions from americium to generate power. Alpha particles have on the order of MeV of energy rather than KeV beta particles typically have. Even if the conversion efficiency is low, because there&#x27;s so much energy available we still attain high power densities. The issue is that because alpha particles have so much energy and are massive they do quite a bit of damage to semiconductors. This means that alphavoltaic batteries do not last very long before they degrade, and it is not expected that alphavoltaic devices can made with current semiconductors that last much longer than month. I&#x27;ve also heard that some alphavoltaic devices have not lasted much longer than an hour. Although, self healing liquid semiconductors appear to be a promising option with one test demonstrating minimal degradation over a 57 day period.<p>[0]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;radioactive-diamond-batteries-real-thing&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;radioactive-diamond-batter...<\/a>\n[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aip.scitation.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;1.4954013\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aip.scitation.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;1.4954013<\/a>\n[2]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;compare&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;compare&#x2F;<\/a>\n[3]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aip.scitation.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;1.5123163\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aip.scitation.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;1.5123163<\/a>\n[4]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-018-30815-w\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-018-30815-w<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-25 02:05:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foobar_"],"id":[22141687],"kids":{},"parent":[22140196],"text":["The flux capacitor!"],"time":["2020-01-24 20:37:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Dylan16807"],"id":[22140719],"kids":[22140859],"parent":[22140196],"text":["&gt; &quot;Eventually, a highly powerful version of a diamond battery could power a mobile phone&quot;<p>Good luck with that.

Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held. (Government regulations effectively mandate that public companies have larger boards—the average is nine members.) By far the worst you can do is to make your board extra large.

It must be extremely well run.” Actually, a huge board will exercise no effective oversight at all; it merely provides cover for whatever microdictator actually runs the organization.

If you want an effective board, keep it small.<p>More board members may increase intransigence, decrease oversight (cover over who is <i>really<\/i> making the decisions and who is not), and turn corps more bureaucratic. <i>Regardless<\/i> of who is joining the board, this is going to increase board sizes, and that&#x27;s pretty unfortunate for some philosophies of effective management.<p>It is not that [xyz] representation isn&#x27;t a problem, but that an effective company structure must be the foremost requirement, ahead of any other (more arbitrary or ephemeral) requirements.

The more I think about all the stuff I want to do, the less I&#x27;m willing to put the effort into doing one thing. Possibilities are more interesting than reality. Even as reality kills off possibilities, I can always spin up more. Reading HN is like a staging zone where I&#x27;m not having to commit to anything. I&#x27;m not getting anything done, but at least I&#x27;m still keeping all the possibilities in play.

My hypothesis is that it comes from the procrastinator getting hung up on a &quot;desired outcome&quot;. Procrastinator expects certain reward in lieu of his work, for instance making someone feel a certain way about them. But they realise how unlikely the exact outcome is. Inability, perceived or real, of managing with even slightly different outcomes is what causes the stress in the first place.

Removing things from my life that I do not need. Facebook, non-casual video games, unhealthy relationships, excessive &lt;fill in the blank&gt;. I find that this is not a one-time decision but rather a continual pruning of &quot;bad branches&quot; from my life.<p>3. Regular exercise. If I feel good about my activity level and my own body, I begin to find work and other responsibilities to be less of a drain.<p>4. Caffeine, but without overdoing it. If I drink a cup or two of coffee throughout the day, it allows me to focus in ways that are otherwise beyond my ability. Too much caffeine actually produces the opposite effect, and I&#x27;ll get nothing done."],"time":["2020-01-23 15:44:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lcall"],"id":[22129876],"kids":{},"parent":[22124489],"text":["Other somewhat related discussion:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22096571\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22096571<\/a> (&quot;Ask HN: I don&#x27;t want to be a worker any more I want to be a professional&quot;)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20930439\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20930439<\/a>  (&quot;how do you keep your programming motivation up?&quot;)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18903886\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18903886<\/a> &quot;Ask HN: How do you motivate yourself to keep working on a project? &quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19777976\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19777976<\/a> &quot;ask hn: how do you stay disciplined in the long run?&quot;"],"time":["2020-01-23 18:55:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pdkl95"],"id":[22127142],"kids":[22127156],"parent":[22124489],"text":["&gt; ‘Just get started’<p>An unexpected side-effect of learning to use version control tools (esp. git) was significantly reduced friction before starting something.

We believe we are rational creatures, but we have all these emotional mechanisms in our brain that kick in and do a hardware override of everything. For me the first step in getting better control of this is just to understand that it&#x27;s happening.<p>I came to this realization from a fascinating book about anger[1]. The idea of this book is to explain how your brain activates anger so that you can deal with it better. Hopefully my explanation won&#x27;t butcher the technical stuff too badly, but I believe the gist is that anger is a useful mechanism in your brain that is supposed to kick in when certain conditions are met and drive you toward taking action when you really need to.<p>As such, there&#x27;s a part of your brain that&#x27;s sitting around monitoring to figure out if any such conditions have been met. When it decides they have, then two things happen. One is that it sort of juices your brain with something that heightens alertness and focus. This boost gives you the mental energy to act. (Think of something kind of like an adrenaline rush.) The other is that it directs your attention to the issue. It does this over and over and over again until it is resolved. If you don&#x27;t act (because of impulse control, lack of opportunity, or failure to decide how), it&#x27;s like hitting a snooze button. You can put the thought out of your mind, but the alarm will go off again and bring it back.<p>So, in computer terms, there&#x27;s a hardware control system here. It turns on and periodically generates a non-maskable interrupt which jumps you into a routine it provides. And it cranks up the CPU clock speed to the point of nearly overheating. And there is no instruction to just make it stop. The only way to shut it off is to change the conditions that enabled it.<p>Anyway, the point is that our thoughts exist within the framework of this system. Our brains are capable of rationality, but this framework can kick in and preempt that. And anger is just one of many systems!<p>Therefore, if you want to gain control of your thinking, you must gain control of your emotions. (Emotional regulation is supposed to be important to mental health, and after learning about this one emotion, I can see why.) Gaining control might be a misleading phrase here because you can&#x27;t stop or eliminate them. Instead, your only choice is to learn how they work and how to manage them. You need to learn to work within the framework. Which takes practice and honing skills. If you don&#x27;t, then you are just being led around blindly by them, leaving everything up to chance. Either you get a handle on them, or they control you. Or maybe I should say they <i>do<\/i> control you, and your only choice is to control <i>how<\/i> they control you.<p>---<p>[1]: The book is called &quot;Healing the Angry Brain: How Understanding the Way Your Brain Works Can Help You Control Anger and Aggression&quot;.

Those are just the rational numbers whose denominator is a power of two (e.g. 1&#x2F;2, 3&#x2F;16, 61&#x2F;32). Fundamentally, binary floating point represents dyadic rationals (not counting special stuff like NaN, infinity, etc.) To represent such a number in floating point form, just write it as a&#x2F;2^b. Then the mantissa is a, and the exponent is -b.<p>This intuitively makes it obvious why, for example, 1&#x2F;3 can&#x27;t be represented.
