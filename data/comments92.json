By no means is that clear from reading the post.<p>This subject of easy versus simple is frustrating, angrily so.<p>I frequently see people asking for things to make various software tasks more easy.  When I see anybody ask for easier the only appropriate question is: <i>How easy does it need to be?<\/i>.  The question isn&#x27;t rhetorical, because I doubt (from experience with this issue) that the person asking for easy has any idea about what the end state of what that easy should comprise.<p>Here is a real life example:<p>At work there is a software component that has jQuery 1.x embedded and this failed an internal security audit.  To solve for the audit failure version 1 of jQuery must be removed from this application.  My first thought is to simply remove jQuery all together.  You don&#x27;t need it, but jQuery is easy.  I was denied from removing jQuery, so I have to upgrade it.<p>I upgraded jQuery and it breaks the application.  I tried 3 different versions of jQuery Migrate and multiple versions of jQuery 2 and 3 and no luck.  The application is broken.<p>This quest for easy is wasting an absurd about amount of time, so far a week, and its still ongoing.  Knowing this is absurd I took the initiative to simply remove jQuery.  I removed the jQuery library (about 12000 lines of code uncompressed and about another 100 lines for AJAX prep in our application).  I then added about 20 lines of code for standard XMLHttpRquest handling.  The application works perfectly, but fails a code review.  We must use jQuery.<p>I tried to explain this to nondevelopers and couldn&#x27;t do it in a way that empathizes with the need for easy, because at face value it seems irrationally absurd.  No matter how I tried it always sounded stupid.  So, instead I have learned to explain like driving a car.<p>Imagine you are a professional driver.  You have been driving professionally for 10 years and have quite the validated resume.  You have experience driving sedans, limousines, trucks, and so forth.  You can drive safe and fast.  You come to the current client highly recommended.  A transport service dropped off an extremely expensive super sports car at an import broker and you are required to drive it to the client.<p>You hop into that driver&#x27;s seat and are shocked to discover there is this weird stick thing in the middle console between the seats and 3 foot pedals.  Remaining confident you put the keys into the ignition but the car doesn&#x27;t start.  You sit there for 10 minutes completely lost.  You have never seen a car with 3 pedals or a weird stick between the driver and passenger seats.  Clearly, the car must be broken.  Never mind that somebody just pulled the car up to you and never mind that its a standard transmission, which is the default in most super sports cars.<p>Obviously the car is broken.  The best recommendation is to investigate the car for mechanical defects, swap out the manual transmission with an automatic and after $18000 and 3 weeks it will be ready to go.  Easy, now any qualified driver can drive the car.<p>Simple, conversely, is just putting your foot on the clutch while engaging the ignition.  The car starts without delay and allows for greater speed and precision at no extra effort.<p>As a web developer most of the software I encounter is easy and extremely fragile, but its certainly not simple.  This is especially true when you out grow your giant framework."],"time":["2020-04-13 21:50:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mrfusion"],"id":[22859554],"kids":{},"parent":[22857551],"text":["I always liked the extension system in browsers."],"time":["2020-04-13 22:16:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulDavisThe1st"],"id":[22859810],"kids":{},"parent":[22857551],"text":["We had a moderately long thread on the question of scripting versus &quot;change the code&quot; over on the ardour.org forums, starting with a post from me ...<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.ardour.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;is-open-source-a-diversion-from-what-users-really-want&#x2F;102665\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.ardour.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;is-open-source-a-diversion-fr...<\/a><p>TLDR: i still don&#x27;t know if most of our users would prefer a  more scriptable application even if it was closed source."],"time":["2020-04-13 22:47:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrischen"],"id":[22859591],"kids":{},"parent":[22857551],"text":["Functional programming to the rescue!"],"time":["2020-04-13 22:20:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jshap70"],"id":[22859095],"kids":{},"parent":[22857551],"text":["title makes it justifiable for systems to both be hard to modify and difficult to use"],"time":["2020-04-13 21:22:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_alex_"],"id":[22862172],"kids":{},"parent":[22857551],"text":["this is all just a long con to try to convince everyone to integrate Guile"],"time":["2020-04-14 04:21:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["iLemming"],"id":[22862925],"kids":[22865310,22862962],"parent":[22857551],"text":["This comment probably will be downvoted since it doesn&#x27;t represent popular opinion.<p>I think everyone who has chosen a career of a software developer sooner or later needs to seriously evaluate Lisp and Lisp dialects - Racket, Clojure, CL, Emacs Lisp, Fennel, etc.<p>Lisp has certain qualities that most other languages don&#x27;t (perhaps except for Smalltalk).<p>I have personally learned, tried, and implemented working software in numerous different programming languages. I&#x27;m not trying to brag about it, that&#x27;s not the point. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is the following:<p>I&#x27;ve seen many programs - systems, small, medium, and of significant size, and honestly, only systems written in Lisp can give you this genuine feeling like you are dealing with a garden. Even in systems where things get incredibly messy, you still can organically keep growing them and keep adding more and extend existing stuff. They usually do not crumble under their weight.<p>Take, for example, Emacs. Arguably it is probably the most extensible piece of software that humanity has ever created. It is wildly malleable. Things you can do with Eisp are borderline insanity; you can change things on the fly without even having to restart Emacs - sometimes, it feels like some sorcery. Last time I checked - I pull something over 400 hundred different packages in my configuration. And somehow things just work. Yes,  from time to time, &quot;abstractions start leaking,&quot; and things would break, but never to the point that it becomes completely unusable. Check out GitHub stats. Github alone contains an incredible amount of Emacs lisp. A language with one sole purpose - configuration. Basically, it is a glorified YAML for Emacs. And the people who wrote that code - most of them never had met each other. They have never worked in the same org. They didn&#x27;t have to follow strict guidelines or standards. It is a messy, wild, and lawless world. Emacs ecosystem defies any logic. If you think about it - it should not work at all, yet it does. And it&#x27;s been working for over 40 years.<p>Many people. Some brilliant individuals every once in a while would claim: &quot;Well, Lisp is just old. Give language X a few more years, and it gets the same and even better features...&quot; And that&#x27;s been going on for over six decades now. Ironically, almost every single language that is on top of TIOBE and RedMonk today, has borrowed many ideas from Lisp, except the most fundamental one. The concept of homoiconicity. The benefits of homoiconicity are incredibly underrated.<p>You may dislike or even hate Lisp, but trust me, years later, when Python is no longer sufficient for our needs; when Java becomes too expensive to maintain; and Javascript transforms into a drastically different language - Lisp still would be used, and systems written in it would be thriving.<p>Learn Lisp. It will make you a better programmer. That is guaranteed. Don&#x27;t take my word for it. See what the world known CS experts have to say about it. Not a single one has ever said: &quot;Lisp is a waste of time.&quot;"],"time":["2020-04-14 07:07:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thesuperbigfrog"],"id":[22858816],"kids":[22859435],"parent":[22857551],"text":["The Malleable software principles seem to be more of a &quot;No Code&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Low Code&quot; wish list with some similarities to the Four Freedoms of the Free Software Foundation.<p>&gt;&gt;  &quot;Software must be as easy to change as it is to use it&quot;<p>Easy is relative.

I intentionally don&#x27;t list dependencies of the packages I want in this file, so I can remove a package later and I don&#x27;t have to trawl through the huge list of potentially unnecessary packages now that I&#x27;ve changed what I want.  I don&#x27;t (typically) manage the version number listed in packages.config, I have a few scripts to help me do that:<p>install.ps1 has two uses: 1. install on a new system by cloning (or downloading the zip of) the repo and running the script, which will download and install the exact versions of the software that is declared in packages.config.  2. If I want a new package I can edit the packages.config to add the line then run install.ps1 (this second capability could use some UX work).<p>update.ps1 lists all of the packages that are currently out of date, gives you the option to update all of them, and then (regardless of which option you chose) rewrites packages.config with the currently installed versions.  This allows you to use git to identify and manage the version differences between multiple windows installations and also upgrade all of them easily.<p>This doesn&#x27;t configure any of the applications, but at least they&#x27;re installed and they&#x27;re the same version when you move from one computer to another.  You can also quickly identify version differences between installations which makes debugging application version problems much easier.

It produces HTML and PDF, but ePUB is an option too.<p>Using AsciiDoc rather than Markdown has several benefits.  The language supports many common book features, especially for technical books, like those &quot;! Warning here&quot; callouts, cited quotes, captioned figures&#x2F;tables&#x2F;codeblocks, internal links, I think even an index.  It&#x27;s also a lot more stable; I&#x27;m not concerned that there will be significant syntax changes in 5 years time. The user manual [2] is the quickest way to see what AsciiDoc can do.<p>PO4A is an adaptation of GNU GetText to use on prose.  PO4A&#x27;s output can input into a typical translation workflow -- distributing the files, or using online translation services.  It mostly supports AsciiDoc, though there are some bugs, and outputting a PO file directly from AsciiDoctor (with a plugin) might be better -- PO4A parses AsciiDoc itself.<p>The code is at [4].  It&#x27;s in slow development when necessary for new documents; I don&#x27;t particularly intend to polish it for release or wider use.<p>KiCAD&#x27;s documentation was the best example of something similar (AsciiDoc + PO4A) to what I&#x27;ve put together.<p>The missing pieces, which are closely related, are translatable and flexible diagrams.  AsciiDoctor supports plenty of diagram tools, but none of them can do this.  For example, the diagram at [6] is an SVG, which (since it&#x27;s XML) can be translated using PO4A.

I had read these types of articles about how FreeBSD is so much cleaner and well documented than Linux, and I wanted to try it out.<p>Honestly, I found it seriously lacking. It always seemed to me like most of those article writers had poor understanding of Linux, and now it seems to me like they have poor understanding of FreeBSD too.<p>For example, this article, like many, touts the high quality of FreeBSD documentation. I found it to be similar to Linux documentation: a few excellent pages, mostly good pages, some mediocre pages, and lots of undocumented stuff. People (including me) often complain about the quality of Linux networking documentation, which is unquestionably terrible, but I found that FreeBSD isn&#x27;t really that much better overall. Better in some places, worse in others, often you have to give up and go find the source code.<p>Another thing often touted is the centralized development of FreeBSD making it more organized. This article betrays itself here by explaining that FreeBSD has <i>three<\/i> different firewalls, one originating locally, one forked from OpenBSD, and one forked from some dude. Now, to be fair, Linux is far from clean here: between ipchains, iptables, nftables, and bpfilter, Linux has gone through a lot of change. At least with Linux though there are at most two practical options at any given time, and there is a clear forward progression. With FreeBSD, I spent several hours trying to figure out the differences between each, which wasn&#x27;t helped by the documentation problems: manual pages being fragmented and incomplete and the handbook being woefully out of date on this subject.<p>It also seems like a lot of the hyped FreeBSD features are actually far behind Linux features. As other commenters have mentioned, Linux has device-mapper, which is similar to GEOM, and is used for LVM and modern RAID setups. Jails came before containers, but Linux namespaces are now far more powerful than jails, which aren&#x27;t that much more than chroots. bhyve is nice, but lags behind QEMU&#x2F;KVM.

I&#x27;ve stopped accepting payments via PayPal for that reason.<p>Furthermore - this isn&#x27;t personal experience, just word on the street - I hear PayPal Customer Service can be pretty atrocious to merchants, which is another thing I&#x27;m not too happy about when it comes to their service."],"time":["2020-04-13 18:26:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["adanto6840"],"id":[22854242],"kids":[22855366],"parent":[22854120],"text":["Over the last year or so it seems like TransferWise has rapidly come onto the scene &amp; taken over much of the landscape for our international contractor payments.

They have a great feature where you can sign up as an individual contractor. They shine on their simplicity of onboarding and scheduling.  They also offer a free consultation if you have tax questions etc.<p>Transferwise: They are great.  If you are making individual payments you cannot go wrong.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to operate my payroll off of them, but they are great for one-off payments. (I used them to send payments to Italy for my wedding)<p>Pilot (pilot.co): Pilot makes it ridiculously easy to pay your international team members. They handle payroll, benefits, and compliance for international employees and contractors. They have some great tech behind their products, utilizing integrations like Plaid to get you up and running fast, they also beat TW in currency pricing all day.<p>Rippling (rippling.com) They have a great HR product and domestic payroll solution.  They have recently launched an international payroll solution and it is just a great as their domestic.<p>Payoneer:  Payoneer has been the industry standard for quite some time.  I think the only downside is they are expensive (exchange rates are not competitive).  Still would be a great option, but would not be my first option.<p>If you have any questions about moving money internationally, I would love to chat with you and answer them.

These are of course anecdotal, but the science behind Spaced Repetition is pretty solid.<p>1. We naturally forget information after a certain amount of time. Much of this information has to be relearned at some point; I’d estimate we end up learning the same fact at least a dozen times over the course of our lifetime. SRS can cut this relearning time to the minimum necessary.<p>2. By optimizing for ‘daily maximum possible learning.’ This is related to the Spacing Effect and it’s a crucial idea underlying SRS.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spacing_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spacing_effect<\/a><p>In my personal experience, there is a limit to the amount of information you can meaningful acquire per day. After that point, it becomes a waste of time and effort. So, by dividing learning materials into smaller pieces and spreading them out over time, you can reduce the amount of time needed to learn them.<p>This is particularly relevant for useful-but-not-urgent information, like alphabets or geography. For example, trying to learn and remember the Russian alphabet in a single day will probably take you a few hours, if not all day. Learn one letter per day over the course of three months, however, and your daily time requirement is perhaps a few minutes.

Slowly, I learned how I worked best and leveraged these lessons in design of the new work flow.  Of course, the solution was far simpler than before.  The lessons were often exactly what was exhaustively explained in books about habit and routine.<p>Anyway, my workflow is centered around directories and files accessed from Sublime.  Every directory is major subject area or project.  One directory is the Control Center - filled with documents that drive my work day and planning.  Things like Work Journal, Weekly, Master, Research Depot, etc., are all referenced every day - sometimes dozens of times.<p>Table Editor package for Sublime to create logs, reference tables, checklists (option v = v).  Also great for tracking my micro workouts - calisthenics every hour to keep the pump bumping.<p>Code folding works to hide &quot;folders&quot; of data within a text document so I can access things quickly from their header line.  This is particularly handy in the Research Depot file.  Exempli gratia, I have NPRs Music recommendations of 2020 folded up to one visible line with checkboxes of albums I&#x27;ve tried.  Another folded area is on Stinging Nettle uses.<p>My zettlekasten system was moved to Sublime as well.  It got its own directory.  Added a time stamp package for naming the file from the first line with a CMD-T, and some simple markdown, each file is a zettle.  I use Zettlr for exploring the notes - but Sublime for editing.  Perfect mix for me.<p>It&#x27;s not so much this all saved me 100 hours, but my productivity is up 1000%.  No hyperbole.  My writing, projects, chores, fitness and client labor are all up by extraordinary levels.  My down time is more relaxing, work more pleasurable, and creativity is like a real psychic adventure.

In under a year, every single one of those outrageously expensive ad slots were sold, and Alex Tew - just a student at the time - walked away a millionaire.<p>Hundreds of spectators decided they weren’t going to miss out on an opportunity to make a bunch of money fast and easy. So-called “pixel ad” websites began popping up everywhere. They would change a few things up, in an attempt to recreate the novelty which drove the original to success. One such website called itself the <i>ten-thousand<\/i> dollar homepage. Another tried to sell a single pixel for a million dollars. None were successful.<p>The idea of permanently selling previously worthless ad-space at a high price for a high profit had already been done. Despite their efforts, these copy-cat websites were not original enough and did not capture people’s attention.<p>Is the idea of a bunch of 3D rendered rectangles enough to capture people’s attention?

This may sound like just evaluating whether it&#x27;s your core business or not, but it&#x27;s a nuance on that which is important.<p>It&#x27;s easiest described by an example: we use open source Gitlab extensively. Numerous times it has been proposed that we migrate to $expensive alternative because they all have advanced functionality that we don&#x27;t get from Gitlab (in many cases, even the enterprise version). Yet we are sticking with Gitlab, and making extensive customisations (mostly using the API) and workflows adapted to it.<p>Is our core business developing software for CI&#x2F;CD&#x2F;Issue tracking&#x2F;source code management?  Absolutely not.  But is that <i>critical to us<\/i>?  Absolutely.

JSC tends to outperform V8 so if you find a pathology in V8 it’s just not so surprising. It would be more interesting if you found a pathology in JSC.<p>I think that the use of small benchmarks obscures what’s going on. The VM is trying to win in the average. It’s like a professional gambler. Observing that the VM did something dumb for a program is like observing that a professional gambler lost a bet. That’s not interesting. In a game of chance, even a really great strategy will have its outliers.<p>I think that to understand the quality of a VM you have to throw millions of lines of code at it and see if the optimizing JIT can consistently produced speedups or at least produced speedups more often than not using some aggregate metric. As someone who studies the behavior of JSC on million line code bases, I can tell you that a pretty good outcome is if only a small number of functions experience an “upside down” effect from optimization and ends up running slower over time.<p>Finally, the whole search for a methodology to pinpoint warmup is broken. It’s pure brain damage. VMs need to be fast even for small programs that don’t have a chance to warmup. Startup time is absolutely important. So it’s a methodological antipattern to even try to find the warmup.<p>The questions worth asking are:<p>- for some program, how long does it take to run that program. Start to finish. No ignoring warmup.<p>- how long does it take to run some very long program or the average running time of a small program averaged over many iterations<p>- some percentile of behavior, like the 99th, to get an average of the janky behavior.<p>Ideally you measure all of those things and include both short running and long running programs.<p>This tells you how good a VM is.<p>If you’re doing math or methodology to identify the warmup point then you’re effectively biasing your experiment to forgive VMs for bad behavior so long as that bad behavior happens early.

This &#x27;long-running&#x27; benchmark code (of .4 to 1.8s ), by definition, has to include multiple inner loops&#x2F;hot code, which is quickly optimized, otherwise benchmark code would have to be millions of lines long, in order to have a sufficient runtime length.

This includes building Zilog&#x27;s own semiconductor fab to manufacture the chip, costed several millions of dollars, which was the standard practice in the 1970s - fabless wasn&#x27;t really a thing until the early 90s. &quot;Oil money&quot;, a hot topic debated today, was the norm.<p>&gt; Federico Faggin (who designed the Intel 8080, founded Zilog and designed the Z80) said: When I joined -- when Zilog was formed -- by the way, Ralph and his wife set up the original office in State Street in downtown Los Altos, so I already had an office and a desk when I arrived at Zilog.  Of course, Zilog in those days was not called Zilog yet.  And then we had an interview with a reporter from the Electronic News, which was a weekly newspaper in the electronics field, was very well-known.  And this reporter reported that there was this company that had been formed with Faggin, Ungermann, and they were going to be some kind of microprocessor company.  And that caught the eye of Exxon Enterprises.  Exxon Enterprises in those days was a subsidiary of Exxon Corporation, the oil company.  And they were making venture capital investments in the R&amp;D information technology.  So somebody called me up from Exxon and wanted to visit.<p>&gt; [...] Yeah, it isn’t that I didn’t intend to build a fab.  I didn’t believe that we could possibly get the money to build the fab.  You know, even if in those days fabs were not very expensive, it would still take several million dollars for the equipment, whereas now, of course, it’s several billion.  But in those days with the three-four million of equipment, you can actually build a small fab.  So I didn’t think we could get the money.  But then after the success of the Z80, Ralph and I were able to convince Exxon Enterprises to actually fund a fab.  Also it was absolutely essential if we had a second sourcing arrangement with Mostek as we did, that we were independent in manufacturing in order to survive as a company.  So it was an imperative to have a fab at that point.<p>The interview by Computer History Museum is extremely interesting (as always) and worth reading.<p>* Zilog Oral History Panel on the Founding of the Company and the Development of the Z80 Microprocessor<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.computerhistory.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;text&#x2F;Oral_History&#x2F;Zilog_Z80&#x2F;102658073.05.01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.computerhistory.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;text&#x2F;Oral_Histo...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-13 22:24:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cbm-vic-20"],"id":[22855629],"kids":[22855771,22857712],"parent":[22842547],"text":["That also looks like a rebranded DEC VT-100 terminal."],"time":["2020-04-13 15:27:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["isatty"],"id":[22856043],"kids":{},"parent":[22854303],"text":["Quick ELI15: Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.<p>A cryptosystem that supports arbitrary computation on ciphertexts is known as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homomorphic_encryption\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homomorphic_encryption<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-13 16:19:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["motohagiography"],"id":[22855701],"kids":[22856863,22861462],"parent":[22854303],"text":["If viable, FHE solves some very urgent problems in sharing personal health information data sets for research, and there are literally billions of dollars in individual  transaction data locked up behind legal firewalls in banks. \nThis is a great usable library we can reason about, but in terms of a trust model for it, is TFHE a candidate or on a certification path?<p>Given people trust institutions, and institutions trust other institutions that trust math, from people who write the code - you have the math and the code, my question would be, which institutions can we help to get priority for trusting this?"],"time":["2020-04-13 15:36:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["api"],"id":[22855635],"kids":[22856641,22857674,22855650],"parent":[22854303],"text":["I wonder at what point might we implement a very old CPU like the 6502&#x2F;6510 on this and demonstrate the proof of concept of e.g. a very very slow fully homomorphic Commodore 64 emulator.<p>Has it been done?"],"time":["2020-04-13 15:28:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rjeli"],"id":[22859157],"kids":[22864045],"parent":[22854303],"text":["How hard would it be to use Yosys (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clifford.at&#x2F;yosys&#x2F;documentation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clifford.at&#x2F;yosys&#x2F;documentation.html<\/a>) for logical gate synthesis to run arbitrary Verilog on TFHE?"],"time":["2020-04-13 21:29:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gumby"],"id":[22857456],"kids":[22857927,22858472,22858053,22861438,22858475],"parent":[22854303],"text":["Whats the real world application?
