Something like 6-12x more expensive. (PGI with C.O.B. of 24k would cost $800B annually, UBI would cost 3.6T)<p>+aside from giving to the rich for no good reason, UBI causes an increase in commodity prices anytime the fund is issued.  This is like having a highway turn at 340* and being very incensed when people crash because they are going too fast.  There is no way to avoid a spike in commodity prices when giving UBI out and especially when you give it out to everyone, why? because everyone getting more money devalues money (for a brief while).  See: Supply of Money (M0, M1, M2...) and the Kuwait attempt at UBI from 2011.  They blamed their ministers of commerce for the crashes on the 340* turn, of course.<p>+ Value Added Tax is not good to fund B.I. of any kind because it&#x27;s likely that this &quot;luxury tax&quot; will hit a lot of the recipients of the B.I.  The Roosevelt Institute did a study on a potential UBI to &quot;grow the economy &#x2F; gdp by 12% annually&quot; which is cool to consider, but one of the key assumptions is that a funding method like a VAT would not hit the households getting UBI.  Plus, their study does not do UBI, just B.I. of different tiers.  If the VAT hits the consumers who get the B.I. then it&#x27;s taking with the left hand what was just given with the right.<p>+ In short: Don&#x27;t give back to the rich.  Don&#x27;t make a VAT that taxes the poor inadvertently (B2B vat is the only vat we could support then it seems).  UBI would cause commodity spikes during currency issuance and that&#x27;s unavoidable, but the amount of issuance is proportional to spikes so:  Only give B.I. to people below a Climb-Out-Bound.  Give them ( C-Earnings )&#x2F; 2 to incentivize their working out of poverty.<p>Example: Climb-out Bound 24,000.  You earn 12k, the government gives you 24-12 = 6k, and now you&#x27;re at 18k. \n The closer you climb out of poverty, the less you get, but you cannot get more than 12k, and if you work you&#x27;ll make more than someone not working.  Make sense?<p>Because what people fail to remember is the Federal reserve act of 1913 and its FEDERAL mandate that employment be kept at a running maximum (keep them ponies movin&#x27; raw hide).  \n+Progressive Guaranteed Income does not violate the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, but actually works with it."],"time":["2020-02-21 21:59:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simonebrunozzi"],"id":[22384237],"kids":[22384370,22384385,22384445],"parent":[22383840],"text":["&quot;Google Just Gave Millions of Users a Reason to Quit Chrome&quot; - very clickbaity title.

I work on the team that deploys this tech on set. We focus on how the video signals get from the video output servers to the LED surfaces, coordinating how we deal with tracking methods, photogrammetry, signal delivery, operator controls and the infrastructure that supports all of this. As noted in some of the comments, the VFX industry solved tracking with mocap suits a long time ago for the post-production process. What we are exploring now is how we can leverage new technology, hardware, and workflows to move some of the post-production processes into the pre-production and production (main&#x2F;secondary unit photography) stages.<p>If you are interested in checking out another LED volume setup, my team also worked on First Man last year.

My niece wound up with 3 kids, divorced, with inconsistent child support payments.  So she went on food stamps.  She was looking for a better job.  She found one, interviewed, and they wanted to hire her.  But the salary that they offered was $0.50&#x2F;hour too much for her to stay on food stamps, and was less than her current job.  Thanks to union regulations, the person who wanted to hire her couldn&#x27;t pay her less than the standard salary.  The result is that she did not take the job.<p>A common result when Congress takes note of perverse incentives like this is that they introduce a more complex program with specific terms that address specific problems that emerged.  The problem is that by creating more brackets and more complex rules you usually create <i>MORE<\/i> cliffs with perverse incentives (though the perverse incentive at each cliff tends to be less).<p>Another solution is to introduce rules that attempt to identify people who are &quot;abusing the system&quot; and punish them.

Why in the world are statements like this not met with scorn? <i>“... scale to $1 billion in revenue in the next five years, and it will become free cash flow profitable (something the CEO also referred to, loosely, as profitability) in the next two.“<\/i><p>On point #2 - thats NOT profitability. Thats called “Cash Flow Positive”, and its an incredible achievement, but definitions matter. In my opinion, “cash flow profitable” isn’t a real thing (its “cash flow positive”), but the real issue is - cash flow positive <U+2260> profitability.<p><i>Edit: On why definitions matter, recall WeWork “Community Adjusted EBITDA”.<\/i><p><i>Edit #2: The Author knows that the CEO is making stuff up, which is why this bothers me.

There still doesn&#x27;t seem to be any answer to that!<p>No, Signal is not an acceptable answer; it replicates text messaging, not email.  In more detail:<p>1. Email is potentially long-form. I sit down and type it from my computer. Text-messaging is always short, although possibly it&#x27;s a series of short messages. A series of short emails, by contrast, is an annoyance; it&#x27;s something you try to avoid sending (even though you inevitably do when it turns out you got something wrong).

I expect a text message will be probably be read in a few minutes, and probably replied to later that day (if there&#x27;s no particular urgency). I expect an email will be probably read in a few hours, and probably replied to in a few days (if there&#x27;s no particular urgency).<p>3. It&#x27;s OK to cold-email people. To text someone you need their phone number; it&#x27;s for people you know. By contrast, email addresses are things that people frequently make public specifically so that strangers can contact them.<p>So what am I supposed to do for secure messaging that replicates that?

That&#x27;s... not really a satisfactory answer. Like, I expect a multi-page Signal message talking about everything I&#x27;ve been up to for the past month to annoy its recipient, who is likely reading it on their phone, not their computer.

When I encrypt or sign I don&#x27;t just do it for the sake of itself: I want to be sure to whom I am encrypting and from whom I am verifying a signature. If I am not sure of what is the link between the used key and an actual person, organization or service, crypto is not very useful for me. PGP has a way to do that. We can speak for hours of its pitfalls, but it&#x27;s there, and with same care it can be used.<p>Do the alternatives have anything similar? I don&#x27;t think so. Signal and WhatsApp basically rely on a GSM identity (a telephone number), which is verified by checking a six-digits code by SMS. There are hundreds of ways to screw this up. Any random street pickpocket would be able to get your phone, read the code and put it back in your pocket without you even noticing, not mentioning attack on the actual GSM protocol of which I do not know much (but have heard of its insecurity more than once). It&#x27;s true that there is Perfect Forward Secrecy and your peers will get a little notice saying that your security code has changed (and will most probably ignore it), but if it is so easy to take over one&#x27;s identity, I don&#x27;t think I can put much trust if the system as a whole. (also, OP complains that GPG is a complex and obscure implementation; what are they going to say about GSM stacks?)<p>Ironically, the thing that would make this system secure would be that people actually checked security codes, which would basically amount to what PGP users do when they exchange fingerprints (and I am sure OP would consider that the LARPmost possible thing in the universe). Not even with the advantage of having a proper Web of Trust, though.<p>Even TLS, although it is not mentioned by OP, has quite a few problems. Most TLS certificates are Domain Validating, and the validation procedure essentially consists in recovering a secret file by mean of an HTTP request to that domain (surely that&#x27;s true for Let&#x27;s Encrypt, but I believe that most commercial DV operators work in the same way, except that you have to pay for it). So as soon as you&#x27;re able to MITM the domain validation (and there are a lot of actors who are able to) you can grab the certificate, which would in theory protect from those who are able to MITM your server. This mechanism still protects your from MITMs positioned close to the client, that&#x27;s true and it&#x27;s better than nothing. But you still have all the holes you want. And bad examples of TLS CAs are nothing near missing.<p>So, bottom line: I am very happy if you give me modern and advanced tools for encrypting stuff, but please do not ignore the problem of giving names to keys, a problem that as far as I know only PGP is currently able to tackle."],"time":["2020-02-20 09:15:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["WaitWaitWha"],"id":[22377070],"kids":{},"parent":[22368888],"text":["The reasons of presumed eventuallity is a horrible reason not to do something."],"time":["2020-02-20 19:04:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nextlevelwizard"],"id":[22373076],"kids":{},"parent":[22368888],"text":["Nice try NSA"],"time":["2020-02-20 07:13:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Idunnonothing"],"id":[22381540],"kids":{},"parent":[22368888],"text":["ad"],"time":["2020-02-21 08:37:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["allovernow"],"id":[22371525],"kids":[22371642,22371641],"parent":[22368888],"text":["&gt;Ordinary people don’t exchange email messages that any powerful adversary would bother to read, and for those people, encrypted email is LARP security.<p>We are literally living in an age where the NSA is spoofing cell towers to intercept and save unencrypted (and probably encrypted) traffic to a database that will probably be around as long as the NSA exists.

It took a few days to arrive but it&#x27;s without a doubt my favorite mattress.<p>I love the convenience afforded by these modern startup companies but there is really something to be said for going to someone who has made one thing their entire life&#x27;s misson and letting them help you out."],"time":["2020-02-20 21:36:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dbg31415"],"id":[22378594],"kids":{},"parent":[22376248],"text":["Returns on bulky items are a mess.<p>I ordered a fridge and dishwasher from Costco.

We got invited to the interview at the YC office but couldn&#x27;t convince people because of a number of reasons:<p>1. GDPR was not huge back in 2017 so the idea of creating an open-source alternative was not attractive enough.<p>2. We were targeting the companies that want to build their own data pipeline on cloud and the cloud providers such as AWS were claiming that their products (specifically Kinesis &amp; Redshift) make it dead-easy to create such a data pipeline. At first, we thought that we were doing something complementary to cloud providers but soon we realized that we were competing with them. Our potential customers were trying to create such a data pipeline in AWS thinking that it will be simple and AWS actually made it easy to start in the beginning. However; data enrichments and the cost optimizations are really tricky when your data grows and our product was optimized for these workloads. AWS doesn&#x27;t really need partners like us, we&#x27;re saving costs from the customers but make AWS lose money in the long run because of these cost optimizations. The switching cost becomes more than just increasing the Redshift capacity by 2x as you store all the data in Redshift.<p>3. We&#x27;re not native speakers so we probably couldn&#x27;t express ourselves back then.<p>Time flies.

As the person who scaled Heap, here is my honest opinion of this. I think there is going to be a huge challenge ahead in scaling query performance. This was perpetually a challenge at Heap and was for a long time the main limitation on Heap&#x27;s growth.<p>The challenge was tough enough for Heap and PostHog is going to be at a huge disadvantage due to the lack of multi-tenancy. When you use Heap, your data is stored across Heap&#x27;s entire cluster of machines. When you run a query, that query is ran simultaneously against every single machine in Heap&#x27;s cluster. Even though your data may be taking up something like .1% of the total disk space, when you run a query, 100% of the disk throughput of Heap&#x27;s cluster will go to processing your query. It&#x27;s not an overstatement to say this alone results in a &gt;50x improvement to query performance.<p>I honestly think Heap wouldn&#x27;t be possible without multi-tenancy. It&#x27;s hard enough as is to get queries that process multiple terabytes of data to return in seconds when you have a fleet of dozens of i3s available. I&#x27;m not sure how you would do that with a fleet a tiny fraction of that size. If you&#x27;re curious about Heap&#x27;s infrastructure, Heap&#x27;s CTO, Dan Robinson, has given a number of talks on how it works[0][1].<p>That&#x27;s not to say that PostHog won&#x27;t work for anyone. I previously tried (and failed) to start a company based on optimizing people&#x27;s Postgres instances. One of the big takeaways I had was that no matter how you use it, Postgres will work completely fine as long as you have &lt;5GB of data. I think if you have a modest amount of data, something like PostHog would work perfectly fine for you. Since the Postgres optimization business didn&#x27;t work out, I wound up pivoting to freshpaint.io which eliminates the need to setup event tracking for your analytics and marketing tools by automatically instrumenting your entire site. Since I started working on it, things have been going a lot better.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NVl9_6J1G60\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NVl9_6J1G60<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iJLq3GV1Dyk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iJLq3GV1Dyk<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-20 23:51:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Risse"],"id":[22377834],"kids":[22377868],"parent":[22376732],"text":["You should mention on the README that the production dockerfile (and posthog&#x2F;posthog:latest) are busted, they do not create any database.

You have to pay extra on top of the 2.9% + 30c per transaction to get this protection.<p>But instead of providing Radar as a base service to all customers for the standard rates, they would rather you have fraudulent transactions against your account because they profit from &quot;dispute fees&quot;, which is usually $17 or so per dispute that the merchant has to pay out of pocket, where Stripe takes some cut of that and the bank takes the rest of the cut.<p>It just feels super scammy of Stripe to not offer Radar as a thing you get by default, since it&#x27;s so beneficial to have and business owners are powerless in preventing fraud on their own because they don&#x27;t have hundreds of millions of transactions of data to lean against and a way to perform analysis on the transaction before it happens since merchants aren&#x27;t directly in contact with credit card vendors (that&#x27;s why we use Stripe).<p>I actually talked to support about this once in an email a few weeks ago, and the email began with them saying it&#x27;s the merchant&#x27;s responsibility to deal with fraud but by the end of the email discussion, support completely switched their position and said Stripe has the power to prevent it and they will pass my feedback to their product team. Which of course really means &quot;ok, you win, Stripe is really responsible for fraud detection and we can totally do it, but we&#x27;re never going to give it to customers out of the box because we profit from fraud regardless of you paying for Radar&quot;."],"time":["2020-02-20 03:46:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Trias11"],"id":[22371723],"kids":[22371857,22371745],"parent":[22371330],"text":["With more competition coming into marketplace the costs of transactions inevitably goes down.<p>Charging more for transactions (in either direction) has nothing to do with &quot;payments are costing more to process&quot; lie.<p>This has everything to do with hook-and-charge business approach relying on majority of customers swallowing the arbitrary higher costs because it&#x27;s more hassles to switch provider, especially for non-technical business owners."],"time":["2020-02-20 01:38:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ikeboy"],"id":[22371681],"kids":{},"parent":[22371330],"text":["Recently got hit with this with QuickBooks.

A group of kids didn&#x27;t seem to have this problem at all,  so this early sleepiness phenomena is not universal. Throughout my life I was also a night owl, my most productive and creative moments took place after dark. Recently, however, something changed. I feel much more comfortable in the morning, I even enjoy the quiet hours early in the morning until things start to hustle and bustle and enjoy and am able to go to sleep earlier.<p>So to conclude, this is not a universal thing and this is the problem, we are all different so a one sized solution does both good and bad."],"time":["2020-02-20 21:41:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["germinalphrase"],"id":[22378421],"kids":[22378508,22381228,22380450],"parent":[22378226],"text":["I teach at the high school level.

It’s extremely common in games, web, and even desktop apps, to also pack the images or other assets that icons represent into compressed files.<p>If you do pack your assets into zip files on disk, then it’s possible to lose disk space by converting to a binary icon format that might be less compressible, with no real gain in terms of disk reads or disk seeks -- and if you separate files instead of packing them so that you get icons in your inodes, you might be increasing the number of disk seeks &amp; reads considerably."],"time":["2020-02-20 16:07:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Crestwave"],"id":[22374687],"kids":{},"parent":[22373422],"text":["Previous discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12420763\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12420763<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-20 13:48:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["b0rsuk"],"id":[22374993],"kids":[22379372],"parent":[22373422],"text":["Vector images optimize for file size and flexibility.

A vector image is a recipe for making an image. More calculations have to be done client-side, times the number of clients. Clients have to do the work the server didn&#x27;t want to.

And cache the image, so if another user with the same display size asks for the image, it&#x27;s ready. Few people resize the browser window often.

That would be the ideal fair way of doing energy.  Certainly would be a socially more acceptable way.  Of course you can allocate people a higher initial rate they can use without paying tax upon the charge for things like disabilities, health needs etc.  Again, be no simple solution, but working on something that sees it paid for fairly always works out best for all as above all, people love fairness.

A Nike swish logo by itself, without context of the brand we have with it today, is just a random piece of graphic. The pixels itself are worth practically nothing. But because when we see the Nike logo, we feel something (Athleticism, motivation, inspiration, energy, etc.) the mark is worth billions. The magic is not in the mark itself, it&#x27;s in the context and meaning it builds up in the user&#x27;s mind over time. Same goes for icons. When seeing a play button with a red background and a white triangle, it might suggest you&#x27;re looking at a Youtube video. Icons, have no real meaning or worth without context that&#x27;s built up over time. Both are &#x27;investment graphics&#x27;. So the purpose of an icon should be to make the user familiar with something and initiate a mental model when you see it (You see Nike, you feel something. You see a Play button, you know you need to click it, etc.). Don&#x27;t judge icons by their looks, but by their context.

An alert, a warning or an immediate attention to a hazard.  Icons have a cognitive overhead of learning it - if we design icons of different styles and artistic expression, they lose their efficiency in cognitive detection. An interface with lots of icons without text (For e.g. SolidWorks, 3DS MAX, Houdini) requires professional training and lots of experience. But a universally recognized icon such as the ones defined in ISO 7010 [1] are popularized and standardized - why? Because, if these icons are standardized, they gain popularity and recognizeability. I am guessing, the cognitive overhead in icon detection and interpretation becomes less as we are constantly exposed to these icons. It doesn’t have to be officially standardized. For example, Floppy disk icon (save a file) and on&#x2F;off icons. Ofcourse, designers will continue to do things as a statement of artistic expression at the expense of all kinds of things - legibility, accessibility and as I said earlier, recognizeability.

It reminds me of lots of first time drivers reacting to new situations where safe is the best way forward. But if we had pure first time drivers, we&#x27;d be a gridlock at even a mild amount of traffic that enters and leaves the roadway.<p>Looking forward to this next set of 5 years.

There is a tremendous amount of communication happening between the individuals, but not overt language. It&#x27;s physical communication which requires empathy (i.e. seeing things from someone else&#x27;s perspective) to accurately interpret and make predictions from.<p>A simple example is to be in a lane next to a lane that ends. Everyone sees the same signs that indicate that lane is ending; everyone knows the cars in that lane are going to get over. But there are a variety of strategies for doing so: get over early; wait until the last minute; accelerate to merge; slow down to merge; use the opportunity to pass; etc. Some drivers are nervous and cautious; some are aggressive. The way the cars move on the road, the signals they provide like brake lights and turn signals, are a form of communication that you, the potentially yielding driver, can interpret and make decisions about how to deal with the merge. Or prevent it! If that is your inclination.<p>This seems like a hard problem IMO. Perceiving objects is essentially about physics--detecting and recognizing. Next step harder, making physical predictions e.g. how far a moving object will travel in 200 milliseconds. Maybe that&#x27;s enough to keep a self-driving car safe, but it won&#x27;t make it very efficient in heavy traffic (which is the norm in urban areas). To interpret intent as part of a prediction seems way harder than even that. Reminder that when humans start driving they typically have 16-18 years of continuous social learning... and even then it usually takes years to become a comfortably safe driver in traffic.<p>Of course this would be way easier if all the cars were self-driving, all at once, but that seems like a really hard way to implement this technology. I think you&#x27;d have to have a city with very strong leadership that defines a small area that is self-driving only (working with one or more private companies to provide the vehicles), and then slowly grow the boundaries of that zone."],"time":["2020-02-20 15:19:16"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["TaylorAlexander"],"id":[22378866],"kids":[22381239,22379096],"parent":[22374408],"text":["It’s funny, I see people online in random comments saying “AI” hasn’t materialized in to anything useful.

It can be found from the knowledge of various disciplines: the more universally applicable a unified theory, the simpler it is, and the more basic it is, the greater it is.<p>[The Pure Function Pipeline Data Flow v3.0 with Warehouse &#x2F; Workshop Model ](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linpengcheng&#x2F;PurefunctionPipelineDataflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linpengcheng&#x2F;PurefunctionPipelineDataflow<\/a>), based on the philosophy of Taoism and the Great Unification Theory, In the computer field, for the first time, it was realized that the unification of hardware engineering and software engineering on the logical model. It has been extended from Lisp language-level code and data unification to system engineering-level software and hardware unification. Whether it is the appearance of the code or the runtime mechanism, it is highly consistent with the integrated circuit system. It has also been widely unified with other disciplines (such as management, large industrial assembly lines, water conservancy projects, power engineering, etc.). It&#x27;s also very simple and clear, and the support for concurrency, parallelism, and distribution is simple and natural.<p>There are only five basic components:<p>1. Pipeline (pure function)<p>2. Branch<p>3. Reflow (feedback, whirlpool, recursion)<p>4. Shunt (concurrent, parallel)<p>5. Confluence.<p>The whole system consists of five basic components. It perfectly achieves unity and simplicity. It must be the ultimate programming methodology.<p>In addition, the IT industry is still a very young and immature discipline. The current software engineering is still at the level of manual workshops. Pure function pipeline data flow brings large industrial production theory and methods to software engineering. It incorporates IT industry into modern large industrial production systems, This is an epoch-making innovative theory and method.<p>The modern society is an information society, IT controls everything, penetrates everything. In my opinion, the development of IT is exactly the same as the development of modern large-scale industrial production systems. With the development of the IT industry, With the development of the IT industry, data standard systems will be widely established, improved and interconnected at the international, national, industrial and enterprise levels, It will be precisely standardized to every smallest part. pure function pipeline data flow will become the basic theory and Methods have become increasingly important, and have become the ultimate standard method for entering textbooks and industry.<p>The key to the industrialization of the IT industry is to establish a complete standard system like the traditional industry. software is the pipeline for producing products (data), which is no different from traditional industrial production lines. Therefore, the software production method will adopt enterprise management ideas, develop software into something similar to a traditional industrial assembly line, input standardized raw materials (data), output standardized products (data), and store them in a warehouse (database).<p>From the perspective of large industrial production theory, standardizing the input raw materials (data) and output products (data) has the following advantages:<p>- Fairness<p>- Neutrality<p>- Fungibility<p>- Standard, Data standards (data interfaces, data specifications) are better than code interfaces.<p>- Interconnectedness<p>- Combination, Data combination is better than code (function) combination.<p>- Simplicity<p>- Predictability, because the system architecture and set-up methods are simple and uniform, very clear, so its evolution and direction of development are predictable.<p>- Reliability<p>- Unity<p>- Easy to expand<p>- Easy to parallel, Can linearly scale up production (performance).<p>- Observable, easy to debug, and verifiable.<p>- Clarity, non-IT practitioners can understand.<p>It can refer to the theory of integrated circuits, business management and other disciplines.\nThe role of the standard system can be seen from the great progress of social productivity after the traditional industry has entered the era of large industrial production from the era of manual workshops.<p>This method has been applied to 100,000 lines of code-level pure clojure project, which can prove the practicability of this method."],"time":["2020-02-21 02:18:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["NelsonMinar"],"id":[22376016],"kids":[22379643,22377240],"parent":[22365103],"text":["Never forget that RSA is the company that sold out the security of all its customers for a $10M payment from the NSA. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-security-rsa&#x2F;exclusive-secret-contract-tied-nsa-and-security-industry-pioneer-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220?irpc=932\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-security-rsa&#x2F;exclusiv...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-20 17:06:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ausbah"],"id":[22374644],"kids":[22375077,22375090,22375178,22374753,22378218,22377990,22375356,22375703,22374835],"parent":[22365103],"text":["&quot;Private equity firms increasingly are setting their sights on the security industry due to its rapid and steady growth.&quot;<p>I do not trust private equity to main the standards necessary for quality and trustworthy security."],"time":["2020-02-20 13:41:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tptacek"],"id":[22376170],"kids":[22377384],"parent":[22365103],"text":["A reminder that RSA was &quot;Security Dynamics&quot; before they bought &quot;RSA&quot; and renamed themselves.

It may sound invasive but I&#x27;ll bet the efficiency will go up and that&#x27;s all that matters at the end of the day, right?<p>Since efficiency can be broken down into money earned&#x2F;lost, this should probably start up the top-most level (CEO) since the highest paid positions would yield the most gain&#x2F;loss depending on efficiency changes. So once the CEOs have spy cams installed in all of their toilets, we can really measure how well efficiency improves!<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;m coming back to this because I don&#x27;t think this is <i>quite<\/i> efficient enough. We should have a team of resident defecation experts who can detect exactly when the CEO should start the wiping processes, and gradually phase them out with AI that learns different pooping patterns. It can also give recommendations to the employee in terms of eating more fiber to speed up the defecating process and result in more solid stools, thus optimizing all bathroom time and shortening the amount of wipes required to as little as possible, again, to save more time and thus, money.<p>Not only that, but eating more fiber can prevent troubles like constipation as well as other health issues, saving <i>even more<\/i> money for the company when it comes to healthcare.<p>These are just a few more ideas, but I have plenty more.<p>EDIT #2:<p>I feel stupid for not thinking of this earlier, but another good strategy to prevent time away from the desk would be to simply remove all water and refrigerators from the building, and naturally all bathrooms would follow suit. The bathrooms would be replaced with closets filled with amphetamines, which are huge efficiency boosters, and bananas, so the employees don&#x27;t die of hunger. The amphetamines will keep the heart rate so fast the bananas will be burned off like fuel.<p>Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;but what about the pumping rooms for breastfeeding moms? What happens to those?&quot; It&#x27;s a great question, with a simple solution - Barclays doesn&#x27;t hire parents anymore. This is about efficiency, remember? Barclays will henceforth only hire asexual and sterile men and women to nullify any risk of pregnancy.<p>However, for those parents who need to keep their job, Barclays will also offer a free service called &quot;reverse adoption&quot; where you bring in your kids and the company gives them away. This can save dozens of dollars per day from employees getting distracted by things like &quot;family&quot; and &quot;not working.&quot;<p>Between this, the spy cams in CEO toilets, the defecation expert AI, and removing the bathrooms, there will be tons of money saved, a portion of which will go towards financing the amphetamines and bananas.

I&#x27;m the founder of Classpert (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;classpert.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;classpert.com<\/a>), a search and comparison site for online courses. In the last 6 months, we’ve managed to sell over 2000 courses, in 8 different languages and across 80 different countries (Udemy alone is selling around 200 courses each month through Classpert). So while it is true that price has an impact on low-income customers (especially from developing countries), even for developed countries (USA, Canada, Germany, Japan) Udemy still is leading the race in number of sales (at least if we use our database as a proxy of the market)<p>Much of their success stems from the fact that Udemy has by far the largest catalog of online courses on the web (something around 110k courses). And while some people may argue that this comes at a cost of providing low-quality courses it also naturally provides an extremely aggressive long-tail SEO strategy.  The majority of potential customers don’t correlate e-learning platforms and quality (most of their customers are not high-profile HN users), so if you are googling for an online course chances are that Udemy will be ranked at the top (and on a global scale). This also explains why they have 10x more traffic than Pluralsight or 3x more than Coursera.<p>On top of that (an here is much more my personal intuition than data-based analysis), Udemy not only offers cheaper courses but also has not yet adhered to “subscription models”. Subscription models target specific users. Subscription models are awkward and feel totally unnatural to most “normal users”. Why on earth a normal user, seeking for a specific bit of knowledge will lock himself on a subscription? The subscription business model seems to work much better on B2B than B2C."],"time":["2020-02-20 14:24:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nickjj"],"id":[22374727],"kids":[22376130,22376077],"parent":[22373380],"text":["Udemy is one of the most corrupt &#x2F; worst marketplaces I&#x27;ve ever encountered in the world -- for the folks who make courses at least.<p>For reference I&#x27;ve had some of my courses on their platform for years and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m bitter because no one bought my courses. I&#x27;ve made a solid amount of money there over the years (6 figures).<p>The problem is they constantly sell your course for $10 and then take 50%+. Any traffic coming from Google results in them taking 50%+ too. If you opt out of their controlled pricing then your course will be hidden from all search results, in which case you&#x27;ll make nothing because no one will be able to find you and that defeats the entire purpose of using a marketplace.<p>But that&#x27;s only the tip of the iceberg. Udemy heavily hand tunes search results and cuts behind the scenes deals with instructors in certain niches, and when those deals happen, other people in the same niche get completely fucked over night.<p>For example, I was selling close to 50+ courses a day, then Udemy signed a contract with another person in the same niche (they told me directly). A few days after their course went live, the traffic to my course dropped by over an order of magnitude and my sales dropped by 20x. My graphs literally looks like a nose dive and I went from being able to sustain myself to having to stop creating courses.<p>The hilarious thing is my course is even higher rated than theirs and I&#x27;ve had people message me privately saying they took both courses and much preferred mine, yet it sits barely on the first page with a 4.7 average rating and like 1 sale a day with little to no traffic.<p>Every time I email Udemy asking about this they say they don&#x27;t modify search results, but then every time I show them screenshots of very strange ranking behavior they change what they say and usually I get in a bump in sales for a day and then it drops off.<p>For the last few years I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time (and a lot of hard work) attempting to build my own audience instead of making new courses so I can drop Udemy all together. I&#x27;m not there yet, but one day I hope I&#x27;ll never have to deal with that platform again and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using Udemy for both buying or selling courses to my worst enemy.<p>Oh, and one fun thing about being on Udemy too is, you can expect people to black mail you for unreasonable things. I&#x27;ve had more than 1 person on the platform email me saying things like I &quot;MUST&quot; help them with their custom project for free and if I don&#x27;t then they they are going to give my course a 1 star review.

I&#x27;ve learned so much from their courses, including React and Flutter most recently. Our employer has an unlimited subscription which is great for checking out a lot of these courses, I definitely don&#x27;t watch every single one available however, but enrolling in a few courses of the same topic shows me what&#x27;s possible with some technology and which teacher is the best.<p>I personally prefer Andrew Mead&#x27;s courses as he actually waits for you to complete a part by yourself before moving on, which I don&#x27;t see as concretely with other teachers like Girder or Schwarzmüller, who sometimes say to try it on your own, but Mead actually has a moment where you can pause the video and try it, built into the course.<p>With regards to not having informational density, I&#x27;ve solved this problem by downloading the courses locally [0] and watching them at 4x speed. In a browser, you could set `querySelector(&quot;video&quot;).playbackRate = 4`, but since the video changes every few minutes, especially at high speed, this isn&#x27;t too useful. I&#x27;ve actually made a Chromium extension that changes the video&#x2F;audio playback speed globally since I watch a lot of YouTube at 4x speed as well [1], but again it isn&#x27;t smart enough to detect when an underlying video source has changed.<p>Therefore, I use a local player, SMPlayer in specific [2], which is an mpv-based player. The problem, however, is that Chrome is very good at allowing you to understand voices at high speed, and nearly every other player, such as Firefox [3] and others, do not. This seems to be because they saccade the audio, where they skip parts of it, so that it sounds tinny or not understandable (edit: looks like it&#x27;s fixed in Firefox!). Chrome does not use this approach. I&#x27;ve tried loading playlists into Chrome for this exact purpose, to simply use it as a video player, but the tab crashes because the video files are too large. Now, we return to the local player, SMPlayer.<p>SMPlayer, as it uses mpv, is able to pass any command line options to mpv. In this case, we are able to change the time-stretching amount by ourselves instead of waiting for Firefox or another player to do so. To do so, go to Options -&gt; General -&gt; Multimedia Engine: mpv, and then Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; MPlayer&#x2F;mpv tab -&gt; Options: --speed=4, Audio filters: scaletempo=stride=10. You can play around with the speed and stride, but for the stride, around 8-20 sounds good [4]. It&#x27;s still not as good as Chrome but it&#x27;s usable and understandable. I wonder if there&#x27;s a full way to solve this bug.<p>Edit: Looks like from [3], someone figured out that you can use the following filters with mpv as well. This just adds the overlap and search arguments in the audio filters. This sounds significantly better than without the overlap and search arguments as above, Chrome level basically.<p><pre><code>  mpv --af=scaletempo=stride=8:overlap=1:search=10 --speed=4 test.mp3\n<\/code><\/pre>\nAnyway, hopefully this helps others move through content faster. You might balk at 4x, but you need to start at something smaller, like 2x, before gradually moving up in speed. I like experiencing content at high speeds personally, and I use similar hacks for other media as well, such as audiobooks and podcasts. For audiobooks (on Android), I use a fork of the Voice Audiobook player [5] which supports speeds up to 6x because the original author did not seem to want to raise the maximum listening rate, citing simplicity concerns for most people. As well, it also seems like only AntennaPod goes up to 4x for podcasts, most podcast players I&#x27;ve seen only go to 3x [6].<p>[0] Udeler - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FaisalUmair&#x2F;udemy-downloader-gui\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FaisalUmair&#x2F;udemy-downloader-gui<\/a><p>[1] Speed - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;speed-global-videoaudio-s&#x2F;ncaighkkcbkmhiiljbjfjpkkgelpgkab?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;speed-global-video...<\/a><p>[2] SMPlayer - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smplayer.info&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smplayer.info&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3] Firefox bug with time-stretching - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1427267\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1427267<\/a><p>[4] SMPlayer solution for time-stretching - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.smplayer.info&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9069\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.smplayer.info&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9069<\/a><p>[5] Voice Audiobook Player fork - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brandonocasey&#x2F;Voice\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brandonocasey&#x2F;Voice<\/a><p>[6] AntennaPod - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antennapod.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antennapod.org&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-20 16:53:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["iashishsinha"],"id":[22373959],"kids":{},"parent":[22373380],"text":["think about it: they were created for desktop audience and till date, they haven&#x27;t been challenged by anyone (the world has moved on to mobile).<p>Which is why they are able to command a higher valuation (lack of competition, a known brand which knows how to create FOMO and now an enterprise sales team)"],"time":["2020-02-20 11:03:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["sfblah"],"id":[22375651],"kids":[22379094],"parent":[22373380],"text":["Udemy is just like all sorts of things in the economy: it’s a stupid-people tax.

It would entrench powerful, traditional media companies and allow them greater control over public narratives and public conversations. Option 1 effectively forces anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to live on 8Chan off of the Internet. Moderation is a requirement for any online community to remain stable and healthy.<p>Even taking the premise that Twitter is an existential threat to democracy (which I am at least mildly skeptical of), it&#x27;s still mind-boggling to me that people are debating how to regulate giant Internet companies instead of implementing the sensible fix, which is just to break those companies up and increase competition.

In contrast, the CEO-to-typical-worker compensation ratio (options realized) was 20-to-1 in 1965 and 58-to-1 in 1989. CEOs are even making a lot more—about five times as much—as other earners in the top 0.1%.<p>&gt;From 1978 to 2018, CEO compensation grew by 1,007.5% (940.3% under the options-realized measure), far outstripping S&amp;P stock market growth (706.7%) and the wage growth of very high earners (339.2%).

The percentage of women working since 1985 has only increased a little bit. But women&#x27;s wages have gone up 50% adjusted for inflation.<p>Of course, when women have been bringing more money into the family, people will spend more. For example, the chart shows expenditure on housing increasing. But the average American house today has twice as much square footage per person than in 1985: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azgolfhomes.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;American-Enterprise-Institute-Housing-Data.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azgolfhomes.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;American-...<\/a>. Expenditures on housing are increasing--but the number of vehicles per household has also gone up since 1985. The cost of college has gone up, but the percentage of people attending college has also doubled in that time frame. Colleges, moreover, are far more luxurious than in 1985. (The community college where my mother in law works now has far nicer facilities than Georgia Tech did when I attended just 15 years ago.) College itself has become something of a luxury consumption good--with large numbers of young people attending, drinking and having fun for four years, but getting degrees of questionable utility.<p>There are a lot of sound bites (and Twitter-level analysis) on this subject, but it&#x27;s actually extremely hard to figure out how to precisely measure changes in standard of living over time. For example, even just looking at the &quot;median&quot; is misleading. In 1990, when I came to America, the percentage of foreign-born people was 7%. Today it&#x27;s double that. Even in an economy that provides tremendous upwards mobility for immigrants, doubling the share of the immigrant population is going to make the median income seem lower. The median household is also much smaller than in 1985, and less likely to be comprised of married couples. Since 1985, the percentage of people 18-34 living with a spouse has decreased by 2&#x2F;3. (That observation is particularly significant because the percentage of women participating in the workforce hasn&#x27;t changed significantly since then.)<p>Accounting for these differences is important. When people think of the &quot;median&quot; they think they&#x27;re comparing like with like. &quot;Two-income middle class American-born family with two kids in 1985 versus 2015.&quot; They don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re comparing a married young couple from 1985, where both spouses work and share household expenses, to unmarried individuals maintaining two separate households in 2015.

By 2018 it took 53 weeks.<p>The author has clearly never heard of Baumol&#x27;s cost disease. The primary reason that households now expend more on housing, healthcare and education is because they expend a significantly smaller fraction of their income on food, electronics, entertainment, energy, clothes, appliances, telephone service, automobiles, and furniture. All of which have seen strong deflationary pressures.<p>Households ultimately need to expend their wages on some category. As the cost of certain goods fall relative to incomes, most consumers will allocate more of their expenditures on the goods that fell at slower rates. For example the average Nigerian or Indian spends a much lower percent of their wages on education or healthcare viz-a-viz the average Swiss or Singaporean. Only a fool would conclude that Switzerland&#x27;s wealth has made it &quot;fall backwards&quot; relative to Nigeria. Instead the explanation is much simpler: the Swiss can feed and cloth themselves using a small fraction of their income. That leaves more left over to spend on comparative luxuries like better medical care and longer educations.<p>This dovetails into the second fundamental flaw with the author&#x27;s analysis. He&#x27;s simply comparing the total expenditures on housing&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;education&#x2F;transport between 2020 and 1985. That&#x27;s making the implicit assumption that people in 1985 were consuming the same basket of these goods as people in 2020. He explicitly eschews measures of inflation, because inflation reveals the fact that the items themselves have not seen price increase. Expenditures rose because households are using their higher incomes (including more two income families) to buy <i>more<\/i> of these goods with more premium qualities.<p>For example one major reason housing expenditures have gone up is because the average home is 50% larger than it was in 1985[0]. Another reason is because of major quality improvements like central AC, attached garages, higher ceilings, better fire safety, higher capacity electrical circuits, and swimming pools. Adjusted for CPI, the median cost per square foot for housing only rose by 5% between 1990 and 2010[1] (which doesn&#x27;t even adjust for significantly lower mortgage rates).<p>Similarly expenditures on transportation has gone up because compared to 1985, Americans travel 25% more miles per capita, and have 20% more vehicles per capita[2]. Automobile fatality rates were nearly 200% higher in 1985[3]. And I don&#x27;t think I even need to tell you how much more reliable and comfortable cars are today than in the 1980s.<p>Healthcare and education probably have shown more true cost disease. However without a doubt Americans have also seen significant increases in their consumption levels. College enrollment rates have increased by more than 100% since 1985. Healthcare consumption has soared over the same period, not least because the country is significantly older and more obese, both of which require many more medical interventions. Compared to 1985, 100% higher proportion of the population works in the healthcare sector.<p>All of which goes to show that the author is plain wrong about his conclusions. The trends he shows are easily explainable by the fact that real household incomes have grown significantly since 1985 (not least because many women entered the full-time workforce). It now takes a significantly smaller percent of household incomes to satisfy basic needs with regards to food, apparel, utilities, appliances and furniture. So people have much more money left over to spend on comparative luxuries like bigger homes, safer and more reliable cars for both adults in the household, more medical treatment with advanced techniques, more home healthcare, and longer post-secondary educations. That&#x27;s not a story of American households struggling, that&#x27;s a story of the incredible consumer growth.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propertyshark.com&#x2F;Real-Estate-Reports&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;08&#x2F;the-growth-of-urban-american-homes-in-the-last-100-years&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propertyshark.com&#x2F;Real-Estate-Reports&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;08...<\/a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;const&#x2F;C25Ann&#x2F;soldmedavgppsf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;const&#x2F;C25Ann&#x2F;soldmedavgppsf.pdf<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ssti.us&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;vmt-drops-ninth-year-dots-taking-notice&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ssti.us&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;vmt-drops-ninth-year-dots-taking...<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in...<\/a>\n[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;183995&#x2F;us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;183995&#x2F;us-college-enroll...<\/a>\n[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;randomcriticalanalysis.com&#x2F;why-conventional-wisdom-on-health-care-is-wrong-a-primer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;randomcriticalanalysis.com&#x2F;why-conventional-wisdom-o...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-20 22:15:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bunchOfCucks"],"id":[22379615],"kids":{},"parent":[22378074],"text":["Boomers"],"time":["2020-02-21 00:30:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["throway1n"],"id":[22379585],"kids":{},"parent":[22378074],"text":["a sad but true story. there are - hn commentariat included - adults, some of whom earn “large salaries”, yet at the age of 30-40 live in shared accommodations and with flatmates. some of them are software engineers and earn what to some may appear a large salary. equally bad, some spend more than half of their income for a property they will only be able to enjoy very late in life due to long and expensive mortgages payed by selling their most beautiful years. this is pretty much what corporate socialism leads to. pathetic."],"time":["2020-02-21 00:26:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["vorpalhex"],"id":[22378398],"kids":[22378546],"parent":[22378074],"text":["Talk about burying the lede.

Hyundai ran a car sharing service here in Amsterdam that used a combination of Bluetooth and cellular connectivity to remotely unlock cars and provision software keys for phones. Every once in a while, though, the app would crash and lose the software key, meaning that the car would end up back again on the map exactly where you picked it up without leaving you with a way to unlock the car. I am not sure what exactly was the issue as the app just errored out.<p>I&#x27;d have to call the customer service line, where they wouldn&#x27;t know what to do as the car was already in use according to the backend. After a few times getting stuck, I came up with a solution which was to literally beg them to cancel the checkout so that the car was available again. They were trained to not do that as their information was that a car could not be left parked outside their service area, which was definitely not the case as I was able to start a new reservation and unlock the car. This happened quite a few times, so much so that I would already know the solution but had to spend an awful amount of time explaining it to the reps -- starting with uninstalling and reinstalling the app as told by them.<p>Then, some other company took over the system and started a new system with the same infrastructure and the app codebase. When it happened again a couple times, I was finally able to get hold of a systems programmer who debugged the issue with me while I was out in the wind.
