With this round of funding, they&#x27;ve officially passed &quot;unicorn status,&quot; and that&#x27;s kind of a double-edged sword.<p>The problem, at risk of stating the obvious, is that investors are hoping for big returns, and that means big revenue -- and that means changing the definition of &quot;success&quot; on Patreon. To hit a few hundred million in revenue a year and earn their valuation, they&#x27;re going to need to start competing with not just YouTube and Twitch, but major music labels and indie-friendly TV&#x2F;film studios.

At least for the things I use it for. If all it was was a way to give people a donation and nothing else then it wouldn&#x27;t matter but many people use it as a way to distribute digital media for $$$<p>But, there is no catalog of media. All you can do is go through old blog posts. The UI of the blog posts is a single page app that you pick &quot;more&quot; at the bottom of every 10 posts.  It crashes often and you have re-start back at post 1 when it does and paginate your way back to where you started. Fixing the pagination would be nice but fixing the entire UI around actually helping people distribute their media would be even better.<p>In fact many people don&#x27;t even put their media on Patreon given how bad the UI is and are forced to find 3rd party solutions<p>Also, Patreon is horrible at discovery. For the most part you have to find out about people to become a patron of offsite. Some of that is the people on Patreon not knowing what they are doing but arguably Patreon needs a better way to browse people and concretely know what they&#x27;ll get access to. Not just &quot;you&#x27;ll get access to special videos&quot; but rather tell me exactly which videos, how many, how long are they, what is each individual video about, etc....<p>Even for artists Patreon could generate a series of thumbnails, small enough that just the thumbnails are not enough but large enough that you can tell what art you&#x27;ll get access to.<p>Given how bad the UX is it&#x27;s slightly infuriating they&#x27;re the most popular of such sites. I guess that just means there is plenty of room for someone to steal their market.<p>Further, Patreon has lots of people scamming for $$$, reselling other people&#x27;s art.

Housework (fixing things, cleaning etc), finance, time management, how to actually learn&#x2F;study effectively, mental health awareness, working out with correct technique and not ruining your body, how to eat healthily are all things that I value more than knowing the intricate details of how the European Union came to be (knowing history is useful and interesting, but I&#x27;d have rather spent that time on the aforementioned things).

They told me 1.15.9-gke.9.\nBut my team at work is still getting reports of CPU throttling causing increased latencies on GKE workloads in these clusters.<p>This means<p>1. we&#x27;re using a kernel that doesn&#x27;t contain the patch.\n2. the patch wasn&#x27;t sufficient to prevent unnecessary CPU throttling\n3. latency is caused by something other than CPU throttling<p>To rule out 1, I again checked that our GKE clusters (which are using nodes with Container Optimized OS [COS] VM images) are on a version that contains the CFS patch.<p>```<p>dxia@one-of-our-gke-nodes ~ $ uname -a\nLinux one-of-our-gke-nodes 4.19.112+ #1 SMP Sat Apr 4 06:26:23 PDT 2020 x86_64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz GenuineIntel GNU&#x2F;Linux<p>```<p>Kernel version is 4.19.112+ which is a good sign.

Top graph shows an example Container&#x27;s CPU limit, request, and usage. The bottom graph shows the number of seconds the Container was CPU throttled as measured by sampling the local kubelet&#x27;s Prometheus metric for `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total` over time. CPU usage data is collected from resource usage metrics for Containers from the [Kubernetes Metrics API][6] which is returns metrics from the [metrics-server][7].<p>The first graph shows usage is not close to the limit. So there shouldn&#x27;t be any CPU throttling happening.<p>The first drop in the top graph was decreasing the CPU limit from 24 to match the CPU requests of 16.  The decrease of CPU limit from 24 to 16 actually caused CPU throttling to increase. We removed CPU limits from the Container on 8&#x2F;31 12:00 which decreased number of seconds of CPU throttling to zero. This makes me think the kernel patch wasn&#x27;t sufficient to prevent unnecessary CPU throttling.<p>This K8s Github issue [&quot;CFS quotas can lead to unnecessary throttling #67577&quot;][8] is still open. The linked [kernel bug][9] has a comment saying it should be marked fixed. I&#x27;m not sure if there are still CPU throttling issues with CFS not tracked in issue #67577 though.<p>Because of the strong correlation in the graphs between removing CPU limits and CPU throttling, I&#x27;m assuming the kernel patch named &quot;Fixed CFS quota throttling issue.&quot; in COS 77-12371-141-0 wasn&#x27;t enough.<p>Questions<p>1. Anyone else using GKE run into this issue?<p>2. Does anyone have a link to the exact kernel patch that the COS entry &quot;Fixed CFS quota throttling issue.&quot; contains? A Linux mailing list ticket or patch would be great so I can see if it&#x27;s the same patch that various blog posts reference.<p>3. Anyone aware of any CPU throttling issues in the current COS version and kernel we&#x27;re using? 77-12371-227-0 and 4.19.112+, respectively.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;omio-engineering&#x2F;cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;omio-engineering&#x2F;cpu-limits-and-aggressiv...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs&#x2F;release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-227-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs&#x2F;release...<\/a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.getcloudapp.com&#x2F;o0u8KoEn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.getcloudapp.com&#x2F;o0u8KoEn<\/a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;debug-application-cluster&#x2F;resource-metrics-pipeline&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;debug-application-cluster&#x2F;r...<\/a><p>[7]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;cluster&#x2F;addons&#x2F;metrics-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;cluster...<\/a><p>[8]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;issues&#x2F;67577\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;issues&#x2F;67577<\/a><p>[9]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.kernel.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=198197\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.kernel.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=198197<\/a><p>[COS]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;container-optimized-os&#x2F;docs<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-02 21:23:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["devit"],"id":[24352061],"kids":{},"parent":[24351566],"text":["Thy should have just upgraded the kernel to a fixed one, which definitely does not require to upgrade the whole distribution.<p>Also if they are using Kubernetes normally there is no reason to not upgrade the whole distribution as well, since only Kubernetes will be running on it, and of course that&#x27;s widely tested (the containers each choose their own distribution, only the kernel is shared)."],"time":["2020-09-02 13:12:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24356030],"kids":{},"parent":[24351566],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-02 20:13:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["poisonta"],"id":[24355078],"kids":{},"parent":[24351566],"text":["You should not run more than one application&#x2F;service in a VM if you are worried about the performance.

I appreciate this isn&#x27;t where CSP was targeted but it lends itself very well IMO to solving this problem because you could decouple components and grow them independently so effectively.<p>Go is an entire language but core.async is just a library in Clojure, they didn&#x27;t have to change the language to implement this which is mind blowing to me.<p>Another example is types. Only some of the code I write actually benefits from types AND most type systems in &quot;enterprise&quot; languages are pretty anaemic. Typing is also really hard to do well, like really really hard. You had a problem, you adopted typing and now you have two problems is generally my thinking here.<p>Scala was to be my saviour here but that missed the mark quite spectacularly and the compiler is still ridiculously slow today but then along came TypeScript which is pretty darned awesome IMO.<p>Thanks to TypeScript and modern Python i had learned that i wanted &quot;optional typing&quot; and i was undecided about type erasure at runtime - i don&#x27;t immediately see a problem with it, i&#x27;ve written probably thousands of lines of Java with generics then used reflection at runtime without losing sleep, but it fills an awkward space in my head - to invest in types but only benefit at compile time seems like a miss.<p>In Clojure i can follow the TypeScript model but actually take it further to runtime.<p>This post is too long already. Long way to say Clojure appears very interesting."],"time":["2020-09-02 21:02:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["praptak"],"id":[24357059],"kids":[24358453,24358649],"parent":[24353476],"text":["For me the most interesting part is how it gets rid of the JVM startup time.<p>So there are two parts to the solution: The first part is Small Clojure Interpreter (sci) which is a &quot;(subset of) Clojure written in Clojure&quot;, so kind of McCarthy for Clojure.

I need reStructuredText &#x2F; reSt markup (which can also be rendered by github), specifically for program documentation. reStructuredText is more suited for longer documentation, it has better code formatting, can show tables of contents, and is also less tied to output in a HTML page (it can easily be converted to a LaTeX or PDF document).
