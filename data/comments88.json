I’ve been keeping bookmarks for longer than that.<p>A few months ago, I subscribed to Pinboard and imported all these 1000+ bookmarks, only to find that hundreds of them were dead links. I could remember many of those websites and pages, I could recall how and why they were important to me; I just couldn’t see them. And never will again. It was depressing and alarming.<p>So, weeks later, when I stumbled upon Jeff Huang’s manifesto “Designed to Last”, it deeply resonated with me. I was setting up a blog, then, and even considering a new note-taking setup, and future-proofing became an even greater concern for me.<p>Like I said, I keep plain text notes. I use markdown a lot, and feel comfortable migrating my notes between different apps and platforms. For example, I’m currently moving from Bear to Roam.<p>The text itself is never a problem — and probably will never be — but linked content is a whole different beast.<p>Each time I switch apps, I either lose inline images or have to relink them, sometimes manually. And URLs often go bad, so the note is suddenly worth a lot less, if anything at all.<p>Being an enthusiastic Alfred user (it&#x27;s the single most important app on my macs), I started to play around with the idea of copying every image to a single &quot;resources&quot; folder in my Dropbox, before using it inside my notes.<p>With a single keyword or keyboard shortcut, Alfred would take care of uploading an image via DB&#x27;s API, get the share link for it and then put it in the clipboard, properly formatted with markdown. The same principle applied to any file attachment.<p>Half of the problem was solved. But what about web pages?<p>I considered using wget to scrape the page at any given URL, store it on Dropbox and do the same routine. I still entertain the idea. But then there&#x27;s the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine. And I love it so so much, that I wanted to contribute. So I went with it instead: Alfred takes the URL, feeds it to WBM through curl, and then returns a link to its time stamped snapshot. Actually, it returns both the live and the snapshot links, the latter with a cool hourglass emoji as anchor.<p>So, now I don&#x27;t fear losing track of linked files or worry too much about websites going down. Once I had these two bases covered, I thought to myself &quot;this is pretty powerful. I should share it.&quot; And so I did.<p>I hope more people find it useful, and would appreciate any comments, ideas or suggestions.<p>Cheers!"],"time":["2020-04-17 00:14:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["geoelectric"],"id":[22894611],"kids":[22895063,22896184],"parent":[22890808],"text":["This is pretty cool!<p>I might be able to learn from your outer loop, actually--this is close to a much simpler problem I&#x27;ve needed to solve.<p>I take my notes in markdown bulleted lists, and try to make them very narrow so they fit on the side of my monitor. I shorten all my links to keep the character count down. The shortener we use at work times out the links if they&#x27;re not used, though, so in old notes I can go back and discover my alias is gone.<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to write something that just sweeps my notes and hits the links through the shortener URL periodically as a keepalive. Since the notes are not always conveniently in one tree with nothing else around, I was thinking something a little richer than text extraction piped to curl.<p>If nothing else, maybe this&#x27;ll inspire me to get off my ass and actually get it done."],"time":["2020-04-17 01:24:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22894060],"kids":{},"parent":[22890808],"text":{},"time":["2020-04-17 00:07:17"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["inetsee"],"id":[22894618],"kids":[22894841],"parent":[22890808],"text":["It&#x27;s been my experience when going through old notes files that &quot;dead&quot; links are not always dead; sometimes they&#x27;ve just &quot;changed their name&quot;.

It uses a different method of binding to ACE 2 than has previously been found to be most efficient\n2. It has several mutations that are of unknown consequence\n3. It doesn&#x27;t have any retrovirus (tool for manipulating virus) backbone<p>The paper then concludes that SARS-COV-2 must be a result of natural selection. While I think this is possible, they ignore the possibility that the virus is a result of artificial selection. If a laboratory were studying how SARS-COV-2 could pass to humans, they might serially pass the virus between mammals  (like pangolins) in order to artificially select for mutations.<p>That is, in fact, exactly what previous scientists did in a 2012 experiment with bird flu. They wanted to make it transmissible between mammals, so they serially passed genetically modified bird flu between ferrets until it was. I wrote this up on my blog:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get21stnight.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-do-some-viruses-cross-over-from-animals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get21stnight.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-do-some-viruses-cros...<\/a> . The result of this is that bird flu acquired previously unknown mutations in order to pass between mammals.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is what happened, and there are some key differences (i.e. in the bird flu experiment, scientists had to start off with a genetically modified virus). Still, I disagree that we can definitively conclude this was a result of natural selection."],"time":["2020-04-16 15:53:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Gh0stRAT"],"id":[22889193],"kids":[22889243],"parent":[22888912],"text":["&gt;While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding<p>Sounds like it could evolve to be more transmissible in humans.

At my current employer I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to do that. Who wants to carry two phones? Or pay for a personal service you barely use?<p>I&#x27;m fortunate enough that my work phone is (now) an iPhone 11 Pro. I routinely go to Australia for extended periods and need a phone there. For years (&gt;5) I used the last personal phone I bought myself, the iPhone 6S, which was still doing quite well since ~2 years ago it had a free battery replacement.<p>But I finally decided to upgrade this. I like the 11 Pro (particularly the cameras) but I find the narrower screen a little annoying (compared to the previous work phone, the iPhone 7 Plus).<p>But damn phones are expensive now. I couldn&#x27;t justify the almost $2000 for an iPhone 11 Pro Max and decided to spend &quot;only&quot; half that on an iPhone 11 instead. It lacks one of the cameras but it has a bigger screen than the 11. I really see no reason to spend the huge extra on the 11 Pro or Pro Max.<p>But by God do I hate Face ID (even more so on my iPad). It&#x27;s horrible. Apple says the false positive rate on Touch ID was too high. I say the false negative rate on Face ID is too high and this is incredibly frustrating. Worse, Apple tries to make it more secure by forcing policies on you like 5 failed attempts means it asks for a passcode. Failed attempts include passive fails where you just haven&#x27;t positioned the phone right.<p>I think Apple just got rid of Touch ID to have more screen area, honestly. That&#x27;s not such a bad thing but what I&#x27;d give for an iPhone that had a fingerprint sensor on the back (like the Samsung Galaxy S9 did, which I also briefly used).<p>So the presence of Touch ID makes me almost want to buy one of these but I can&#x27;t go back screen size wise. As an aside, I am tempted to get rid of my iPad Pro and replace it with the newer (non-Pro) iPad because those still do have Touch ID.<p>This really is an updated iPhone 8 with a modern CPU.
