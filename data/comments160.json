This is technically lying, but given how sensitive celiacs can be to even a tiny amount of gluten (and it sounds like your symptoms are pretty bad) it should really be handled in the same way by restaurants anyway, so don&#x27;t feel guilty about it.<p>With regards to other people, just be firm, straightforward and distrustful. It&#x27;s odd how people that care about you can end up trivialising something like celiac disease or think it&#x27;s no big deal if you have a slice of pizza, etc. They&#x27;re not being intentionally malicious, but your health comes before their incoherence and ignorance.<p>This is all speaking from the POV of someone in London, so I don&#x27;t know how well this would work in Lithuania."],"time":["2020-03-01 15:12:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Vayda"],"id":[22456324],"kids":{},"parent":[22453473],"text":["I live in Italy and here it&#x27;s quite common so I usually don&#x27;t have problems.

Although I do not have celiac my sister does and I grew up in a household where I couldn&#x27;t put butter on toast and then go for a second dab of butter. Here are a few tips of advice from what my sister has done, and what our family does.<p>&gt; At restaurants or family gatherings my sister would always say, &quot;I am allergic to gluten&quot; in place of &quot;I have celiac disease. An allergy is within the experience of most people, particularly in severe cases like some peanut allergies. In this way the waitresses and family members often ask about severity, in which she mentions nothing that touches gluten should be used to prep her food and that washing a set of utensils is best.<p>&gt; A second restaurant protocol is asking whether a salad, piece of meat, or other dish has coatings, dressings, or bread accoutrements. Grilled chicken and steak are my sisters favorite as when she asks if they are coated in flour the answer is always &#x27;no&#x27;. When salads or soups come with bread or croutons she asks for them to be removed when ordering.<p>&gt; When a dish comes with a loaf of bread, croutons, or other gluten items we weren&#x27;t able to discern from the menu or the waitress, she usually asks for one of us to remove it and eat it, if the contamination was small. Knowing how you react to small amounts trace gluten is the key here.<p>&gt; Create a shelf at home that contains only gluten free food. We have several now, but first began with a shelf in the fridge for only gluten free foods and leftovers and a pantry shelf. If not that, have pieces of tape to mark items of food that have no gluten anything that helps in indicate to others what it is and is for. &quot;Use the pasta with the tape on it for my dish because I am allergic to normal pasta&quot; is easier to relate to others.<p>A final thought, make it a point to go out to eat and explore food with your family! They&#x27;ll only grow comfortable to you asking questions of the food if they are exposed to it repeatedly. My family always looks at the menu&#x27;s ahead of going to a restaurant, but even at the most bread heavy of spots she finds a salad, soup, or steak that suits her desires.<p>Don&#x27;t worry too much and know that it won&#x27;t ruin all eating for you! Just find the right set of questions to ask and the best ways to translate it to others!"],"time":["2020-03-01 00:35:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rs23296008n1"],"id":[22454237],"kids":{},"parent":[22453473],"text":["Related to celiac:<p>If you want a similar rabbit-hole, have a quick look at what the thyroid can do if its low.

It&#x27;s all about quinoa or potatoes, and then building a meal around those.  Eg, fish or a meat and mashed potatoes with a side of veggies is super healthy, gluten free, and super good.  Or, if you like more Asian tasting foods, you can make a curry and instead of over rice do it over quinoa.  Quinoa is cooked the exact same way as white rice, in a rice cooker, but it can be cooked with broth, not just water, which allows the quinoa to be paired to the meal.  Eg, beef broth quinoa + thai yellow curry chicken can taste better than with rice.<p>In the US there are tons of gluten free options in super markets, from gluten free hamburger and hotdog bus to gluten free dinner roles, and within the last 5 years or so some of the new gluten free breads are shocking.  You wouldn&#x27;t know they&#x27;re gluten free.  Out here they tend to be in the freezer section instead of with the normal bread because they&#x27;ll go bad quickly.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there is any Whole Foods or similar in Luthuania but you can probably find supermarkets with the same mentality.  Basically, find the most expensive grocery store in the nearest decent sized city near you and you can start there to see what kind of options exist in that area.  There are good gluten free bread options, at least on this side of the world.<p>My great grandmother had Celiac&#x27;s, so I grew up on a lot of gluten free home cooking.  After decades of being on a safe diet (she never cared to eat out to begin with) her Celiac&#x27;s died down and towards the end of her life she started to be able to eat gluten again, but we limited it to one meal a week, just in case.<p>Back then, all gluten free bread was home made.  This is always an option if super markets are limited.  If companies can make absurdly good gluten free bread today, then there are probably recipes out there just as good, but they may be hard to find.<p>So that covers the three basics: rice alternative, non-gluten by default meals (potato or similar is usually involved), and gluten free breads.<p>If you&#x27;ve got fresh cod (or similar) around you, I&#x27;d recommend starting with gluten free beer battered fish &#x27;n chips.  Making home made french fries is a lot of fun too, but can be a bit of work.  There are some gluten free meals you can&#x27;t go wrong with, often better tasting than you can get at a high end restaurant.<p>Every day it will get easier.

We live in the US near Seattle. She must carry an epi pen and even the slightest cross contamination can make her very very sick for several days.<p>We considered this together and it comes down to a few things. First, remove all contaminants from your home and if anyone MUST have wheat, give them a separate cupboard and make sure they know exactly now to not cross contaminate. I had to learn this after much repetition. When I make a sandwich on wheat bread, I use about 2x the dishes (spoons etc) than I did before and I wash my hands about a half dozen times.<p>For others, explain glitter. It gets everywhere. The only way to not get glitter on yourself is to go where there is no glitter. Tell them to imagine that their hands, utensils, pans, etc are covered in glitter. Until it&#x27;s been washed by something that&#x27;s glitter free, then whatever touches it will have glitter on it. Except this glitter can kill.<p>Regarding finding a place to eat, be careful- there&#x27;s places that have gluten free items, but pay no attention to cross contamination, and then there are places that simply ARE gluten free and have no gluten.

You need to be an expert on what has gluten in it. If you go to a restaurant, you can ask to see ingredient lists, and it&#x27;s up to YOU to determine if there is wheat. Most food industry people are not trained in this. We once asked if food had gluten in it and got a &quot;No&quot; after they looked at the ingredients. When we examined them ourselves, it plainly said &quot;flour&quot; on it. Flour, unless specified to be GF, is wheat.<p>All of this research can be done online. Be the expert, and save yourself time and frustration. Also, be bold! If you get a &#x27;rolleyes&#x27; from a server when you ask about GF food, that&#x27;s a good sign to just walk out. Unfortunately there are many for whom GF is a fad and they treat it like it makes them cooler than everybody else. They have done a lot of damage for Celiacs, but don&#x27;t be afraid to set yourself apart from them. &quot;I know it might seem difficult, but if I my daughter gets gluten, she goes into anaphylactic shock, has to epi pen herself and then spend the night in the ER.

I probably don&#x27;t need to say it, but I&#x27;ve had some family members who tried to just &quot;reduce&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Two: You may not know things like this exist, because they may not just be on the shelf of your local pharmacies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00CHQAM08\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00CHQAM08<\/a> Now, the box is basically a lie, inasmuch as you can&#x27;t just pop one of these pills and then eat whatever you want. However, if you have reason to think you&#x27;re going to do something questionable (such as, say, have the part of the family that doesn&#x27;t really keep the gluten separate, or go out to eat somewhere), I&#x27;m about 99% confident this stuff really does work and can help, even if it doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; the problem. You can even take it an hour after you eat, once you realize what has happened, and it will still help. Won&#x27;t solve everything. But it helps. Sometimes the &quot;use by&quot; dates are very conservative on things; for these I&#x27;ve found these do tend to go bad quickly, and they may cause minor digestive distress downstairs, if you know what I mean; still worth it.<p>Three: In my personal experience, the <i>real<\/i> problem with celiac isn&#x27;t &quot;I feel ill when I eat wheat.&quot; That is, ultimately, just an inconvenience. The <i>real<\/i> problem in my life is that I have difficulty absorbing nutrients, even after I&#x27;ve long since stopped eating wheat. My big challenge has been what I&#x27;m fairly sure is &quot;paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;, which I didn&#x27;t realize was trashing my sleep for years, to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even get to sleep anymore without my heart doing all the things (PVCs, skipped beats, hard beats, bleh). The doctors I went to declined to diagnose me, but it worked out because they&#x27;d probably have thrown pills at me. I now take fistfuls of vitamins several times a day. It looks rather scary, but for me has been a life changer in a good way, and when I don&#x27;t do it, I immediately suffer. I would advise reading up about vitamins and minerals and their various symptoms of deficiencies, and considering trying some of them if any of them strike you as relevant to your life. In general, a place like HN will say that supplements should generally not be necessary and you should just eat well, and while I <i>generally<\/i> agree with that, you <i>specifically<\/i> have strong Bayesian evidence to consider that you may find certain supplements may help you a lot.<p>As far as I know, while there are studies that establish the general truth of what I&#x27;ve said above, there are not very many <i>specific<\/i> studies that discuss which nutrients you are specifically likely to be missing. My <i>personal<\/i> experience is that I really seem to have trouble with the minerals, though I&#x27;ve also had good experience with taurine (with its friend l-arginine, heart related), vitamin A (didn&#x27;t help my heart but it gave my immune system a <i>huge<\/i> kick in a good way), and vitamin K (with its friend D). YMMV. If you specifically have a heart issue, reach out to me (see HN profile) and I can get more detailed; it&#x27;s a bit long to put on HN. If you don&#x27;t specifically have that issue, you&#x27;ll have to explore on your own. Or maybe you have it relatively lightly compared to me; my father has a much less strong version of it and does fine on a small subset of what I have to take. If this is all foreign to you, and you sleep great and have no issues, just ignore me and count your blessings.<p>Oh... and my #1 food-I-missed was cheesecake. New York style, rich as can be.

My wife was diagnosed about 6 years ago. We live in Argentina and we lived 1 year in the USA in the middle.<p>She was totally asymptomatic, and was tested because she has hypothyroidism and it seems it&#x27;s pretty common that both conditions come together. So, the doc ordered the tests: first a blood analysis that came positive, then an endoscopy to confirm. From what I&#x27;ve heard here, for every diagnosed person, there&#x27;s about 8 people who have not been diagnosed. But at least here, health professionals are getting aware and more people is getting properly diagnosed nowadays.<p>Luckily for us, Argentina is a very celiac friendly country. A few years ago (coincidentally, about the time my wife was diagnosed), a law was passed that demands all products to inform if they contain gluten or not, and there&#x27;s A LOT of gluten free products available everywhere that are identified by a standardized logo.<p>In Buenos Aires, there&#x27;s a lot of restaurants selling exclusively gluten free food, and for the rest, almost everyone has gluten free options.  Many of those, even design a separate space in their kitchens and utensils for gluten free food, to ensure there won&#x27;t be cross-contamination.  I believe this was achieved thanks to the free courses and consultancy given by 2 NGOs founded by celiac people.<p>As for the difficulty to educate other people about this, I believe it happens mostly with older people, as it was not a commonly diagnosed disease not long ago, so... sometimes they might at first look with suspicion or disbelief, but then after explaining them exactly what&#x27;s about.. they understand, but need to be reminded anyways.   So, if it&#x27;s family, it&#x27;s better for the first months&#x2F;years to take your own food when visiting them, or helping them to cook, as it&#x27;s a perfect opportunity to teach them.<p>One of my best friend&#x27;s daughter was diagnosed when she was a 18 months old baby (she felt badly, was having trouble gaining weight, etc). She is now 4 years old, and super healthy after following a gluten free diet since then. You&#x27;d think it would be hard for her... but it&#x27;s incredible when other kids offer her something, she immediately looks the package for the logo, if she does not see it, she politely rejects it (or if unpackaged, she simply asks if it&#x27;s gluten free), as she knows it would harm her otherwise...   Her kindergarten teachers are aware and pay attention other kids won&#x27;t contaminate her food, so all has been OK so far.<p>In our home, we usually have for dinner the same food, but for some stuff like pasta or pizza, I usually cook my food separated from hers, as I prefer the &quot;regular&quot; wheat pasta. She does not have trouble with it. So, in those specific cases it&#x27;s a little more work when cleaning the pans, but that&#x27;s not much of a problem.<p>I hope this was helpful!"],"time":["2020-03-01 00:27:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["symgryph"],"id":[22454596],"kids":{},"parent":[22453473],"text":["Easiest way to deal with it with it was to learn how to cook myself.

All we know is that the technology of hay was unknown to the Roman Empire but was known to every village of medieval Europe. Like many other crucially important technologies, hay emerged anonymously during the so-called Dark Ages. According to the Hay Theory of History, the invention of hay was the decisive event which moved the center of gravity of urban civilization from the Mediterranean basin to Northern and Western Europe. The Roman Empire did not need hay because in a Mediterranean climate the grass grows well enough in winter for animals to graze. North of the Alps, great cities dependent on horses and oxen for motive power could not exist without hay. So it was hay that allowed populations to grow and civilizations to flourish among the forests of Northern Europe.

I didn’t look at my watch once during the speech. Not long into the talk, the elderly gentleman next to me pulled a scrap of paper out of his pocket and began scribbling notes. He kept writing until the end of the speech. I glanced behind me during the question-and-answer period, and noticed that Schwartz Auditorium was so full that people were standing in the balcony and sitting on the railings just to hear Dyson.<p>The text of Dyson’s speech would have impressed any English teacher. He structured it as seven short stories, with each one slowly building on each other. The style of his writing––the way he chose his words and structured his sentences––would have been impressive if he had been giving a lecture in the humanities, much less a field stereotyped for less-able communicators. The way Dyson was able to convey the sheer wonder of science was an orgasmic experience equivalent to reading my first Carl Sagan book.<p>An 80-year-old physicist who had the energy of a young assistant professor, who delivered his speech fluidly and responded deftly to the audience’s questions––a scientist proficient in more than one science, and fluent enough in biology to give an entire lecture on biotechnology!!!!

A lot of the effort in this process is testing and evaluating the melody to see if it is any good to listen to &#x2F; any good in context. This effort hasn&#x27;t been done if you simply brute force enumerate and list the search space without testing anything.<p>There are many kinds of design problems where the effort of checking if a proposed solution is any good vastly outweighs the effort of suggesting a solution.<p>We could do the same thing for other kinds of design problems.<p>In principle, what if we enumerate some (vast) finite space of digital circuits -- if we put a few limits on the amount of stuff we can put into a single circuit, and discretise any continuous parameters to produce a finite space. Does that mean we can copyright all these possible circuits, even if we put no effort into seeing if any of them are fit for any purpose?<p>Can we enumerate some large finite space of possible arrangements of atoms into molecules and then copyright them all, without putting any effort into analysis or experimental testing to see if any of the proposed molecules are fit for any purpose?<p>Snisarenko made a similar criticism when this was posted 15 days ago:<p>&gt; As other commenters have pointed out, this is gimmicky, shallow and clickbaity. All that they did was count from 1 to 68 billion. Any piece of digital data can be converted to a number, and if we apply their argument then you can be &quot;creative&quot; by just counting numbers. But we all know that&#x27;s not true. Once the search space becomes that big, you can&#x27;t actually &quot;enjoy&quot; any of these melodies. Because you can&#x27;t listen to all of them in your lifetime, the ones that you WILL hear are going to be awful 99.999 percent of the time. Hence, the &quot;creative&quot; process is navigating this search space, and figuring out which melodies are catchy.

The first 50-60% of the book is dedicated to how to discover problems with end clients&#x2F;users that are worth tackling.<p>I have used the techniques personally and it&#x27;s great to see what users say is a huge problem vs a problem they&#x27;re willing to pay for.<p>It is easy to get stuck in a self-fulfilling trap that a user complains is a big problem. I recently spoke with a customer:<p>- &quot;What&#x27;s your biggest problem?&quot; (book says this question is a no no)<p>- He replies, &quot;If I sell 3 cars at the same time, I&#x27;m out of available float (cash) while I wait for those deals to close. This is a HUGE problem for me!&quot;<p>- &quot;How do you solve this today?&quot; I ask.<p>- &quot;I have other, larger car sales company who will lend me money at XX rates.&quot;<p>Right there, it&#x27;s a solved problem. The end user figured out their own way. Turns out other smaller dealers like him rely on large trade line companies.<p>The only way I could complete is either on lower cost of financing or speed. At which point, for me, it&#x27;s not a problem worth solving. The problem isn&#x27;t so big for him where he&#x27;s willing to throw cash at me for it.<p>Talk to users.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01H4G2J1U\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone-...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-28 23:23:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["samsquire"],"id":[22447407],"kids":[22447619,22447440,22447507,22450720,22447805,22472356,22453612,22448725],"parent":[22446148],"text":["I am a serial idea writer and I have to agree with the author.<p>Ideas are inherently valuable, maybe not financially, but they&#x27;re valuable to have and valuable to society to share.<p>It makes me angry that people actually believe ideas are inherently worthless.

They don&#x27;t show as much attention to detail.  They don&#x27;t have any loyalty to their employers, who they perceive as exploiting them.  They are much more likely to quit or leave at the first opportunity for any job that seems better.  They aren&#x27;t invested in good customer service.

We&#x27;re currently looking at a global pandemic with the coronavirus.  Given the apparent virility, it seems inevitable that this virus will spread to every country in short order.  Most low wage workers don&#x27;t get sick leave.  Many get fired even for taking unpaid sick days.  These are your cashiers, your grocery store workers, the people who make your coffee - the service industry workers who make up the bulk of American labor. Even those workers who won&#x27;t get fired for taking sick days, often can&#x27;t afford it.  We&#x27;ve all seen the stats about the huge number of Americans who cannot afford an emergency expense of a few hundred dollars.  Staying home sick qualifies.  The containment efforts we&#x27;ve seen in South Korea and Italy have (so far) largely failed - and these are countries with universal healthcare and worker protections that we don&#x27;t have.  Right now it costs $3,200 to get tested for the coronavirus in the United States.  Not treated - just tested!  Working people cannot afford this and will not get tested, or treated - which will make the crisis worse.  How much will this crisis end up &quot;costing&quot; us in the long run?  If not this one, how much will the next, inevitable one cost us, because working people don&#x27;t have the income or benefits to take care of themselves?<p>Massive kudos to this guy for paying his workers a fair wage.

The advantage of simulation is its flexibility: the designer can inspect (or even change) the contents of every component, and they can run the clock forwards or backwards until they pinpoint the problem in their design. But the disadvantage of simulation is its slowness: simulating a design can take about 100000 times longer than executing it properly. Sameh’s work describes a way to move the entire state of a design back and forth between an FPGA and a software simulator. His proposal is that a design starts running on an FPGA, then at some predetermined trigger point, the clock is stopped and the current state of the FPGA is copied over to the simulator. The designer can then investigate what is going on at this point, and maybe step the clock forwards or backwards a bit, and then they can copy the new state back to the FPGA and carry on running it. The best of both worlds is thus achieved: the fiddly parts of the design can be run in the simulator, and the long, uninteresting parts can be left to the hardware. Myself, I wondered whether this system could form the basis of an exhaustive hardware simulator: one that runs a design in hardware until comes to some sort of ‘branch’ or ‘decision point’, at which point it saves its current state, and executes one of the paths. Later it restores this saved state and executes the other path. Thus, it might be feasible to explore all the possible behaviours of a system.&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-29 06:37:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Treblemaker"],"id":[22439713],"kids":[22439850,22439972,22439787],"parent":[22439021],"text":["&gt; Stefan’s paper asks what would happen if we could just stick a direct wire between certain pairs of LUTs, like you can when designing fully-custom hardware.

You’re feeling down about your situation, but situations can be changed. It’s important to have the mindset that it’s temporary and to know that your situation will improve. If you have to, write down how you want your life to be in the future and read it to yourself every day. Remind yourself of the skills and value that you have and make small steps every day to move towards your goals.<p>Appearance - this is important, I’d work to make myself look, sound and smell very much the opposite of what you’d think a homeless person might look and smell like. Make sure you are clean, well groomed, and if you need to, ask people if they can help buy you some clothes that make you look presentable. Most homeless people ask for money on the street. They never ask for something specific. I believe if you ask for specific things you want - like ask someone if they can buy you a shirt to help you get a job, you will find someone that will do it. Don’t be afraid to ask people for help - I believe people want to help others.<p>You have by the sounds of it many skills.
