There is a lot of confusion on that subject.<p>Having said that, there are a lot of things someone can do, and no single one of them will be a panacea. There are three things I would suggest, and third one, while very effective, is probably too &quot;out there&quot; for people. I will offer it here and let you decide.<p>The first is the practice of mindfulness meditation. That you are aware enough of your pattern is a great start. Although the point of mindfulness meditation is to awaken to one&#x27;s true nature of being, there are fringe benefits when it comes to realizing how sensations and feelings arise within us. It is this fringe benefit that lets us be aware and make changes to our core being. Without mindfulness meditation, it is difficult to make any lasting changes to ourselves.<p>The second, is that you might want to consider seeking a therapist who can work with you on this. There are many modalities. Not every one will work. But issues such as taking things too personally actually has a lot to do with being insecure and overcompensating for that. This can be combined with the mindfulness practice. I understand that there is a perceived stigma to going to therapy ... it might help to view this as going to a coach, who can help you be the best you while having healthy, functioning relationships with others.<p>The third, and most &quot;out there&quot; is something that really requires the first two suggestion. This having an acupuncturist needle some specific points. But it can&#x27;t just be any acupuncturist. Not all acupuncturists are sensitive to subtle energy, and for this to work, you&#x27;ll need to find one who is. Not only that, someone with the knowledge to work on what are called the &quot;extraordinary meridians&quot;. Working with those are not covered under the accredited acupuncture schooling needed to receive a license to practice acupuncture. It most definitely falls outside of evidence-based medicine.<p>But if you do manage to find such a person, they can work on these meridians, some of which are directly regulating one&#x27;s self-esteem, being overly critical of other people, being able to take feedback, listening to others, etc. The pair that is most directly related to that are what are called the &quot;yin qiao&quot; and &quot;yang qiao&quot; meridians.<p>The thing is, to get the most out of it, you may need therapeutic help as well. Successfully triggering this will shift things, bring up memories, change how you feel. You might not feel like yourself.<p>Thing is, when I used this method for myself, it was the thing that finally improved the relationship I have with my wife."],"time":["2020-02-07 00:58:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["verganileonardo"],"id":[22260285],"kids":{},"parent":[22255268],"text":["Therapy"],"time":["2020-02-06 22:05:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["KnobbleMcKnees"],"id":[22256973],"kids":{},"parent":[22255268],"text":["I don&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions here but it&#x27;s <i>possible<\/i>, nay <i>probable<\/i>, that you&#x27;re a software engineer."],"time":["2020-02-06 16:56:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["newbie789"],"id":[22260463],"kids":{},"parent":[22255268],"text":["I don&#x27;t mean to sound flippant, because I&#x27;m being entirely serious here.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you talk about only seeing things from your own perspective and in the same breath lament the fact that you can&#x27;t find a book written specifically for your perspective.<p>Perhaps read some of those books about what it&#x27;s like to experience interactions with a narcissist from another&#x27;s perspective, and see if you can identify behaviors or patterns that you exhibit.

I&#x27;ve had some experience with such secrets and getting around the politics so will chip in!<p>(1) Some Academic Ground Rules<p>Some high end research universities state that the requirement for a Ph.D. dissertation is &quot;an original contribution to knowledge worthy of publication&quot;, and the usual criteria for publication are &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.<p>(2) Career Secret<p>In technical careers, say, based on math and computing, there is almost always more money to be make in making valuable applications of such knowledge than in research creating such knowledge.  Moreover, for the goals of financial security or even to be financially responsible and to be able to buy a house, have two late model cars, support a wife and family, have a valuable IRA, etc., it can be tough to meet these goals as a prof doing research and much easier making valuable applications.<p>(3) A Career Success<p>I was a ugrad math major but by luck stumbled on to a cute fact:  There was and likely still is good money to be made applying math, physics, and computing to problems in US national security around DC.   So, at the time, some of the math was numerical integration, root finding, numerical linear algebra, the fast Fourier transform, power spectral estimation, digital filtering, lots of applied statistics, numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, max-min and game theory for the SSBN fleet, etc.  My annual salary was six times the cost of a new, high end Camaro.<p>The success was an example of (2) of more money from applications than academic research.<p>So a lesson:  With math and computing, to make more money, concentrate on valuable applications and not academic research.  Further, do this where there are powerful customers with deep pockets for solutions to technical problems -- e.g., US national security around DC.<p>(4) An Academic Success<p>I was getting paid so well for what I knew in math and computing that I wanted to learn more so went for a Ph.D.  Then right away, as in the OP, politics hit me.<p>Then I stumbled onto a solution:  I saw a math problem (a tricky issue in the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions), asked for a &quot;reading course&quot;, maybe not to get a solution but just <i>study<\/i> the problem.  Two weeks later I found a solution that was clearly publishable (later did publish in <i>JOTA<\/i>).<p>Presto, bingo, <i>secret<\/i> discovered:  The original work gave me a shiny halo and a Kevlar suit of armor against any and all obstacles, especially political.<p>Technically from (1), the work was enough for a Ph.D. dissertation.<p>Lesson:  As a Ph.D. student, ASAP do some research that meets the criteria in (1).<p>(5) Another Academic Secret<p>Get a Ph.D. in an engineering school and not in a school of arts and sciences.  I.e., get a Ph.D. in applied math for some engineering and not pure math without clear applications.<p>So, for a dissertation, start with an important practical problem got likely from outside academics.  Then use some old pure and new applied math to get a valuable solution.  Then, since the practical problem has likely not already been solved well, the work will be &quot;new&quot;.  Since the problem is important and the solution valuable, get &quot;significant&quot;.  Since the core of the work is some math with theorems and proofs, it is relatively easy to be check the work and, then, be &quot;correct&quot;.  Since the problem is from outside academics, your profs might not know about its practical details and, thus, can&#x27;t easily criticize.  Also generally the university might like the idea that you are trying to make money because otherwise they can&#x27;t even hope that you will donate a lot of money!<p>(6) Business Secret<p>Currently there is an historic business opportunity:  E.g., for less than $2000 in parts, as a Web server I plugged together a mid-tower case computer with an AMD FX-8350 processor with 64 bit addressing, eight cores, and a standard 4.0 GHz clock, an Asus motherboard, 16 GB of error correcting coding (ECC) main memory (both the processor and the motherboard support ECC), several TB of rotating disk, Windows 7 Professional, etc.  So, computer hardware and software for operating systems, middle-ware, utilities, etc. are cheap and powerful.  In addition the Internet spans nearly all the world, and data rates of 1 Gbps are readily available in the US.<p>Since these cheap, powerful resources have not yet been fully exploited, there should be opportunities to make significant bucks.<p>Next, one of the standard remarks is, for success, good problem selection is important:<p>Well, then, broadly can provide new, valuable <i>information<\/i>.  Using some pure and new applied math can help get more valuable information.<p>Then with all of that, also pick a problem can solve as a sole, solo founder funded from own checkbook.  An example is the Canadian romantic matching Web site Plenty of Fish -- one guy, two old Dell servers, Windows with .NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET, ads just from Google, and $10 million a year in revenue.

It surely is fun and useful for artistic purposes, where the only evaluation is from a human eye. But when you actually compare the structures of the algorithms presented here to the real curves and topologies of any living plant, you find that they are missing a tremendous amount of detail. From a machine learning perspective, e.g., it would be very hard to &quot;fit&quot; these models to actual data. This is because these algorithms and data structures assume far too much homogeneity in the basic structures of a given species, particularly that these structures be repeated with only simple rotations and permutations. In fact, when you look closely at leaves and flowers and roots and stems of a plant, there is more and more detail; just like any living system, this is because plants are very active on a microbiological level that causes a level of microscopic entropy well beyond that of any single Bezier curve (or whatever). So for those who really do love the beauty of plants, and who really do want to model them and therefore be able to propagate their forms in the digital space, I would suggest looking elsewhere, and in particular seeking ways that are more data-driven to model plants.

A pre-image attack means that you&#x27;re given the outputs and need to solve for the inputs, while a collision means setting two sets of these equations together and finding a differing set of inputs which will &quot;cancel out&quot; internally and result in the same output. The latter is easier, because you&#x27;re not constrained by the outputs --- the final hash output can be anything, as long as you find two different inputs that give the same output.<p>This very interesting article about using &quot;tunnels&quot; to find collisions in MD5 is worth reading: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2006&#x2F;105.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2006&#x2F;105.pdf<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-07 04:26:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["deerIRL"],"id":[22260846],"kids":[22261017,22261135],"parent":[22253977],"text":["Did anyone else find the tables completely unreadable?

After all, if you generate a collision, you have two inputs (preimages) that hash to the same output (image) so isn&#x27;t the second input a second pre-image of the first input?<p>I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;ll try to explain how I think this works, and invite real experts to step in if I get it wrong.<p>I think the way this works is that, with collisions, the attacker gets to choose their inputs. They don&#x27;t care what two inputs they find that generate to the same output, they only care that they <i>do<\/i> generate to the same output. With a second-preimage attack, one of the inputs is chosen by the hasher.<p>As it turns out, the ability to choose both your inputs is quite useful! You can view hash functions in reverse: for a given hash function, the inverse hash function is a function which takes the output of the hash function and returns the set of inputs to the hash function. For many hash functions, the inverse hash function IS NOT uniformly difficult to compute partial solutions to: some inverse hashes are much easier to compute than others. So if you can find an output for which the inverse hash is easy to partially compute, you can generate collisions at that point much more easily.<p>However, in the space of possible hash outputs, the number for which the inverse hash is easier to compute is probably very small, or the possibility of computing the inverse hash would have been noticed by the creators of the hash function. So it&#x27;s highly improbable that the hasher will have chosen a hash input at a point where the hash input is one where the inverse hash is easy to compute."],"time":["2020-02-07 05:11:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pabs3"],"id":[22263744],"kids":{},"parent":[22253977],"text":["Another post on the lifetime of hash functions:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;valerieaurora.org&#x2F;hash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;valerieaurora.org&#x2F;hash.html<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-07 07:39:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dependenttypes"],"id":[22264829],"kids":[22271576],"parent":[22253977],"text":["&gt; all others (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, etc.)<p>This table is incorrect.

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>162 page PDF [last updated: Feb|4|&#x27;2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

HIPAA and similar legislation allows the sharing of billing data like this, and no other PII (or any PHI) gets shared in the process.<p>Second, medical debts have been a part of bureau data for a while now. What&#x27;s new here is that Experian is trying to build a machine learning model on it to try to sell the model as a new product. I&#x27;ve never worked for any of the bureaus before but know many people who do, and in general, these specialized scores seldom sell well, but since the marginal cost to Experian is low (let a few data scientists at it for a few weeks), they still put out new ones anyway. Even things like new FICO&#x2F;Vantage scores like the new FICO that&#x27;s been in the news lately tend to take a while (on the order of years) to make it out into the wild since lenders like to have consistency in their processes as long as possible.<p>Third, it&#x27;s actually beneficial to most consumers to have medical debts split out of the bureau data explicitly. Most big lenders use raw bureau data much more than the aggregated credit scores, and since the US medical system has so many distortions that correspond more to broken processes rather than a person&#x27;s creditworthiness, many exclude medical debts from consideration explicitly, and others implicitly as models they build don&#x27;t often find those attributes as useful as others.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s good to be thoughtful about how information like this is disseminated and used, but the dire warnings of the article are really not warranted in this case."],"time":["2020-02-06 18:51:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["petilon"],"id":[22257424],"kids":{},"parent":[22255995],"text":["Great.

Of course it&#x27;s going to kill people in the meantime but it is doomed.<p>While on vacation recently I ended up listening to the Bear Brooks podcast [1]. It&#x27;s a little longwinded at times (but it is aimed at non-technical people) but is not a bad way to spend a long drive.<p>The interesting thing about this story is how advancements in DNA testing have taken us from the simple case of is or is not a match (used in paternity testing and for forensics) to figuring out how much of a match you are. This has created a new field of genetic genealogy that famously led to the identification of the Golden State Killer [2].<p>So there&#x27;s a lot of talk about privacy and your DNA but much like having your contact information uploaded by someone else, this is showing that that will be insufficient as your DNA will ultimately be inferred (at least in probability terms) by people who aren&#x27;t you. There&#x27;s really no putting this genie back in the bottle.<p>So take a disease like Cystic Fibrosis. Currently this requires life long medication and care. Depending on the severity, you may require one (or more) lung transplants. All of this is expensive.<p>So if you have CF and want to get private insurance in the US this may well be a pre-existing condition and excluded. Now this disease is usually quite apparent from birth but there are other diseases that are not (eg Huntington&#x27;s). If you&#x27;d had a test and know you have it the insurance company has a &quot;right&quot; to know it (if you accept the premise of the US health insurance system, which I, of course, do not).<p>But this is only going to get worse. Ultimately health insurers will able to figure out if you&#x27;re much more likely to have certain expensive conditions by knowing, say, that a sibling is a carrier (which greatly increases the chances you have it).<p>Taken to its natural conclusion, the system of private health insurance cannot survive. The only workable solution is group health insurance. Sufficiently large groups statistically even out. That&#x27;s how insurance is meant to work. This could be a fully public health system or something in between (eg state-level).<p>So back to the medical credit score. There will be fights over this. At some point you&#x27;ll have a right to see it and get corrections. This will probably be championed by states since the Federal government seems to have forfeited, well, governing. But all this is just arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.<p>Of course there&#x27;s still the separate issue of costs (in the US) to deal with but one step at a time.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bearbrookpodcast.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bearbrookpodcast.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Golden_State_Killer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Golden_State_Killer<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-06 17:15:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vkaku"],"id":[22259870],"kids":{},"parent":[22255995],"text":["The medical system in the US needs more regulations, and people should push their politicians to fix this, or vote them out."],"time":["2020-02-06 21:19:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["alpineidyll3"],"id":[22258868],"kids":{},"parent":[22255995],"text":["Great to see healthcare sector innovating in new levels of depravity.

Once the document is out, every consulting firm is free to access it and place a bid on how much they would charge to implement what was outlined in the procurement document. The government is then forced to pick the lowest bidder. It doesn&#x27;t matter if what&#x27;s asked by the government doesn&#x27;t make any sense, the engineers on the contractor&#x27;s side are forbidden from contacting government employees (for anti-corruption reasons).<p>I&#x27;ve heard many stories where the contractor knew the job would have to be done twice the moment they read the procurement documents. But they couldn&#x27;t voice their concerns. And if they suggested doing what they knew was the right thing that would have made them ineligible for the contract as it wasn&#x27;t what was required. Future-proofing the bid or trying to deliver something closer to what they ended-up shipping was also not possible because this would have made them more expensive than the bidders following exactly the request. In the end they ended-up rewriting most of the code at their usual billing rate on top of the original fixed cost contract.<p>In the case of Phoenix, I&#x27;ve read a lot of media articles outlining how bad of a job IBM did but despite all this it seems the contract itself was never challenged in court. What I heard from internal sources is that IBM did ship correctly all what was asked for in the contract, it&#x27;s just that the government workers drafting the requirements didn&#x27;t understand their own payroll needs enough to properly articulate them.<p>Of course CBC, the state-funded media where everyone is on the government&#x27;s payroll, won&#x27;t outright blame their bosses. But they would get sued and lose pretty bad in court if they claimed the contractors didn&#x27;t deliver what was in the contract.

Uber trained people not to tip so only 10% of them do.<p>B. Uber drivers do both ride share and Eats in the same app. They can turn off one or the other or do both. There often aren&#x27;t enough Eats drivers as a result (more to follow)<p>A cont... \n~~~~~~\nPeople always used to tip taxi drivers, but Uber said &quot;hey you don&#x27;t need to tip on Uber&quot; and implied or outright said tips are included. Often rides are not profitable without a tip, so drivers refuse them or cancel them. For example, driving 10 miles to give someone a 2 mile ride. So Uber has to gamify and pay incentives for consecutive rides or whatever (I ignore the games, because I do Lyft as well. I make more doing both, rather than playing the games)<p>Here&#x27;s what Uber has said over the years about tipping:<p>March 30, 2014\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140330002844&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uber.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140330002844&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uber....<\/a>\nFrom the rider landing page:\nCASHLESS &amp; CONVENIENT You don&#x27;t need cash when you ride with Uber. Once you arrive at your destination, your fare is automatically charged to your credit card on file – no need to tip. We’ll also e-mail you a receipt.<p>From the help:\nTipping Drivers\nBeing Uber means there is no need to tip.<p>Mar 31, 2017\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170331040415&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uber.com&#x2F;ride&#x2F;how-uber-works&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170331040415&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uber.c...<\/a>\nDo I need to tip?  The Uber app cannot include a tip when billing you for a trip fare... In most cities, Uber is a cashless experience. Tipping is voluntary. Tips are not included in the fare, nor are they expected or required. As a rider, you are not obligated to offer your driver a gratuity in cash. If you decide you would like to tip, your driver is welcome to accept.<p>Today\nCan my driver ask for a tip? Drivers may request tips at their discretion. Drivers care about rider ratings and do their best to create an ideal trip experience. While Uber does not require riders to offer drivers a tip, you are welcome to do so in cash, through the app, on riders.uber.com, or from your emailed trip receipt. Please note that the trip fare charged to your payment account does not include a gratuity.<p>B cont... \n~~~~~~\nBy doing UberEats in the same app and subjecting Eats drivers to the more stringent standards required of passenger carrying drivers (nice car, spotless background check) they eliminate a lot of Eats drivers, who may have an older car or minor traffic citation. Not only that, but why do Eats when Uber rideshare is busy? (and Lyft is busy, since most drivers do both) With Eats, you have to get out of the car, fight your way into a busy restaurant (Fri,Sat night) deal with surly restaurant personnel. Then, drive to some apartment complex, get out and look for the apartment in the maze, or drive to a house on a dark street and look for the right house number, which is barely visible in the dark or doesn&#x27;t exist. Then try to find the front door (some will come out and meet you, but not many) Then on top of that not get a tip. You don&#x27;t have to tip Uber, remember. Eats tip rate is a little higher.<p>Conclusion: Because Uber had told people that they didn&#x27;t have to tip and that got into the zeitgeist, only 10% of them tip. Uber has to offer bigger driver incentives as a result. Would less people use Uber if they felt they had to tip? Yes, that&#x27;s why Uber said people don&#x27;t have to tip. At the time, there were less drivers and I hear anecdotally from other drivers that the money was better than now, even without the tips. Waiters, Bar tenders, many others make good tip money, but that horse has left the barn for Uber and now they can&#x27;t retrain people to tip.<p>UberEats is a second class job for Uber&#x2F;Lyft drivers.

Algebraic geometry grew out of the study of solutions of systems of polynomial equations.  This is naturally a question of geometry, which can be studied analytically (using tools from calculus, for example).  If you are willing to consider solutions over the complex numbers, and not just the real numbers, you can study the question algebraically, as well.  Once you take that step, you can ask what happens when you look at solutions over exotic objects such as finite fields or rational functions.<p>Alexander Grothendieck pushed for a very general formulation of this algebraic approach, using the notion of &quot;scheme&quot;.  Together with Jean Dieudonne, he wrote an introduction to this topic, called EGA, which is French for &quot;Elements of Algebraic Geometry&quot;.  This is one of the foundational texts in algebraic geometry now.<p>At some point, Grothendieck became disillusioned with both mathematics and academia, quit both, and isolated himself from most people.  Not long before his death, he expressed the desire that all of his work cease to be published.  He died 5 years ago now, and I&#x27;m not actually sure of the legal status of republishing his work, though people are determined to go ahead because of its great historical significance.  While I think EGA has largely been superseded by newer sources, some of his later work (known as SGA) has not."],"time":["2020-02-06 22:58:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wolfgke"],"id":[22259034],"kids":[22259752],"parent":[22253961],"text":["A question to the experts: Of EGA I, there exist two editions:<p>1. the 1960 edition, which is available at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numdam.org&#x2F;item&#x2F;?id=PMIHES_1960__4__5_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numdam.org&#x2F;item&#x2F;?id=PMIHES_1960__4__5_0<\/a><p>2. the 1971 edition: mentioned under <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C3%89l%C3%A9ments_de_g%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie_alg%C3%A9brique#Bibliographic_information\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C3%89l%C3%A9ments_de_g%C3%A9o...<\/a><p>As I see it, this translation seems to be of the (older) 1960 edition.

The irony: I wish to have data to prove it, my hypothesis is based on my experience. I got more actionable insights from qualitative research, self-reported metrics, or quantitative data focused in certain aspects (instead of collecting all just in case).

SAP will come to the market leader and put their processes into software.<p>Then everybody else adapts to SAP not because adapting SAP is impossible but because SAP implements the processes that made the market leader successful (at least that&#x27;s the idea).<p>So it is very intentional that you adapt to SAP and not the other way around. You do it to emulate the market leader.<p>And the user friendliness is also on purpose. If you go visit a company using SAP, you will find that you have a certain job in the company and it needs two or three things from SAP. Jobs are very specialized, so SAP is, too. Nobody is supposed to just wing it with SAP. You are supposed to learn how to do your transaction with SAP, and that transaction is then meant to be super efficient.<p>If you actually go visit a somebody from an enterprise environment interact with SAP, you will be astounded how quickly they can do what they are supposed to do.
