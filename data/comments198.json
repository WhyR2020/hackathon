As it happens, most business applications do not have any requirement to deal with &quot;unknown&quot; values. These applications are only interested in acting on requests where all the required data are provided by the person responsible for entering the data. For example, when I transfer money from one bank account to another, the amount of the transfer can&#x27;t be &quot;unknown&quot;, the sending account can&#x27;t be &quot;unknown&quot;, and the receiving account can&#x27;t be &quot;unknown&quot;.<p>These same applications do have requirements to deal with empty values.

So that is what happens.<p>And you have to remember to use &quot;is&quot; instead of &quot;=&quot; when you want to test your empty NULL values for equality with other empty NULL values - because your SQL database is pretending that NULL really means &quot;unknown&quot;, and it doesn&#x27;t want to say that one unknown value is equal to another unknown value, because that would be theoretically incorrect."],"time":["2020-02-04 09:21:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22224809],"kids":{},"parent":[22223909],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-03 16:15:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["salzig"],"id":[22224495],"kids":[22225189,22224541,22224764],"parent":[22223909],"text":["there is something &quot;missing&quot;.

I don&#x27;t know much about the history of pointer compression, but I know the following.<p>In 2008, Don Knuth posted on his then &quot;news&quot; page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.stanford.edu&#x2F;~knuth&#x2F;news08.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.stanford.edu&#x2F;~knuth&#x2F;news08.html<\/a>):<p>&gt; <i>A Flame About 64-bit Pointers<\/i><p>&gt; <i>It is absolutely idiotic to have 64-bit pointers when I compile a program that uses less than 4 gigabytes of RAM.

Recently, while searching for something on Stack Exchange, I came across a question related to Bentley&#x27;s June 1986 <i>Programming Pearls<\/i> column that featured an invited literate program by Knuth and a review by Doug McIlroy, about which there is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding on the internet (e.g. calling it an &quot;interview question&quot; and what not!). Anyway, this question on codegolf.SE (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codegolf.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;188133&#x2F;bentleys-coding-challenge-k-most-frequent-words\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codegolf.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;188133&#x2F;bentleys...<\/a>) was about implementing a fast solution to the same problem, and the &quot;winner&quot; was an elegant Rust program. I was curious about Knuth&#x27;s original Pascal (WEB) program from 1986, so I studied it, translated it to C++, and found to my surprise that it ran faster than the fastest program that had been posted on the site! Looking closer into why, experimenting with this and that, it turned out AFAICT that the probable reason, ultimately, was that where the Rust program used (64-bit) pointers, the translation of Knuth&#x27;s program (which had been targeting &quot;common denominator&quot; Pascal, without pointer types) used (32-bit) array indices, so it was able to fit twice as many struct values in the cache.<p>In fact, taking just this one idea (cache-friendliness) and using a regular trie data structure (as we&#x27;re no longer operating under similar memory or language constraints as Knuth was) gives something even faster.

Yes they are rarely done, but there is a beautiful even spectacularly good history!<p>The first key is, use more and hopefully better information than is <i>usual<\/i>.<p>Here are some such projects:<p>There used to be typewriters and carbon paper.  Not so good.  So, Xerox developed and sole a much better solution.  Presto, bingo, super big success.<p>Typewriters remained clumsy -- with the labor, a massive economic waste.  IBM developed and sold their Selectric typewriters with a little spool for &quot;corrections&quot;.  It was much better and a big success.<p>Typewriters were still a pain.  Along came personal computers.  Even with just 640 KB of memory, no hard disk, and only 8&quot; diskettes for storage, and a dot matrix printer, they were MUCH better than typewriters.  With a daisy wheel printer with a carbon ribbon, they were much better, still.  They sold &quot;like hot cakes&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s possible to have a toothache.  I got one of those:  I&#x27;d gritted my teeth getting CorelDraw working with PostScript output; nice output, but I cracked two molars.  On one I had a root canal procedure and a gold crown.  Eventually the other one let some infection into the center of the tooth.  Result:  CO2 pressure; worst pain imaginable.  In about an hour, the CO2 pressure was high enough to leak out via the crack, and then an hour later the pain started again.  I went to the ER.  About then the pain started again.  The ER physician just took out a Q-tip, dipped it in a small bottle, painted my tooth, and I was OKAY!!!!!  He said he used Benzocaine which is what dentists use before giving an injection and is over the counter.  So I rushed to a drug store and stocked up!  So, Benzocaine -- works GREAT, got to have such a sore tooth to understand the real value.  Not much chance of no market for Benzocaine!  Result:  A few days later the pain quit.  A few weeks later, the tooth was loose in its socket.  A week later it was gone!<p>We can all see places where there is a need and some good technical work will create a great solution highly desired by the market.<p>Sure, about the best will be one pill taken once that cures any cancer with no side effects.  All we need is the pill, and presto, bingo, a 100 X unicorn!  Sure, so far after no doubt some $billions  in research funding, no one knows how to make that pill.  But there is progress, and on and on we will be curing cancers until we have cured all or nearly all of them.  Some of the cures will be very valuable.<p>So find a big need;\nuse some advanced, <i>leading edge<\/i>, partly original, difficult to duplicate or equal, technology to get a terrific solution.  Tell the world.  Buy a nice place in Aspen, along the Florida coast, in Maine, on Long Island (as in the Audrey Hepburn movie <i>Sabrina<\/i>), in Shenandoah, etc. and enjoy life!<p>So, given a problem, need a solution.  Can we have any faith in technology?  Hmm ....  In WWII, the world learned, YES:  Radar, penicillin, the proximity fuse, sonar, jet engines, code making and breaking, and The Bomb.  Later the world learned from the SR-71, the Navy&#x27;s nuke powered submarines, the Navy&#x27;s version of GPS later done by the USAF, Keyhole, basically a Hubble but aimed at the earth, and much more.  These projects were funded mostly by the US DoD, and the track record, <i>batting average<\/i>, <i>bang for buck<\/i> were terrific.  In particular, the US DoD can look at a project proposed just on paper, evaluate it, go or not go, and achieve the track record.  Very little luck needed!<p>Apparently Silicon Valley can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t do projects this way. So, there is an opportunity:  If can find the problem, stir up the technology, and write the software, all as a small project, small team, maybe even sole, solo founder, then maybe can shop for those nice houses and no luck required!<p>Common?  The usual?  No.  Possible?  Yes.<p>Back to it!"],"time":["2020-02-03 21:44:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ronilan"],"id":[22227301],"kids":[22227521,22228573],"parent":[22226382],"text":["Two long time friends walk down the street.

I haven&#x27;t had a single job as a software engineer that didn&#x27;t have a constant background of distractions and interruption that prevented work from getting done.  My current job is great, but its biggest issue is the sheer amount of interruption and poor organization of information that makes it difficult to get work done in a timely way.  When I have to switch contexts frequently, for lack of a less cliche term, it takes even more time for me to get back up to speed with where I&#x27;d left off.  Some people are clearly better at this than others, but I&#x27;d bet that those who can handle context switching well would still do even better under a system that valued focus.  I don&#x27;t think this really has much to do with introversion(which everyone has a different definition of and, in my experience, everyone claims they are, making the term worthless IMO).<p>This last weekend I did something that I normally refuse to do, which was to catch up on work.  I still dedicated most of my time towards non-work, yet being able to work without interruption was not only a breath of fresh air but seemed to allow me to get more done in the same amount of time.<p>My guess as to why organizations don&#x27;t care about focus is that they value the perception of &quot;getting things done&quot;; when engineers that need focus are frequently interrupted by the process, they&#x27;ll shift to getting smaller tasks done first so that management will know that they&#x27;re working on something.  Organizations will tend to tolerate a more complex task taking longer than estimated, but in my experience are less tolerant of engineers not pushing lines of code for days because they&#x27;re taking time to implement said complex task in a good way.  In essence, it&#x27;s a spin on &quot;butts in seats&quot;, except it creates the illusion of productivity when in reality it could mean counter-productivity.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure that having the process wall people off from interrupting each other is necessarily a good thing.  What would be better is a good planning process that limits unnecessary change combined with a working culture that values focus.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m <i>not<\/i> talking about legitimate interruptions like when someone needs help or wants to pair program.  I&#x27;m talking about interruptions that are either environment related or are a result of process failure(e.g. new tasks and course corrections frequently added to the pile because of poor planning).

I actually dread that Apple would, in a few short months, announce a new major release with even more changes and new features. So here&#x27;s my short open letter to Apple.<p>Dear Apple:<p>Eat your false pride and do a reset on macOS – in WWDC 2020, don&#x27;t add a new major macOS release, and don&#x27;t have a new release name with funny stories of how your crack marketing department came up with it. Accept that you messed up, just like you messed up with the Mac Pro and tried to save face by saying that you &quot;painted yourself into a thermal corner&quot; (but didn&#x27;t say why you went into radio silence for years). Then work on a stability focused release without adding major new features. We know you don&#x27;t focus or spend as much on Mac&#x2F;macOS as you do on iPhone and iOS. Introspect and realize that you bit a whole lot more than you can chew (even with hundreds of billions of dollars in cash) with macOS Catalina.<p>Fix the design, fix the data loss issues, fix the Time Machine issues, fix the iTunes &quot;replacements&quot;, fix the performance issues of APFS on magnetic hard drives, fix Catalyst, improve your QA&#x2F;QC...the list of big ticket items is long enough to keep your tiny macOS team busy for another year or two.<p>Follow a tick-tock cycle if you can&#x27;t solve this with your current organization structure and people – one feature release a year, followed by (another) one whole year for stabilization and tiny incremental improvements.<p>It takes a big mind to accept mistakes, accept them sooner than later, and then correct them. It&#x27;s high time for you to grow up (being in the top two or three in market cap and all) and start doing this. You&#x27;ll find people more accepting of deficiencies&#x2F;issues and more willing to wait for fixes when you communicate like an adult and treat your customers as adults.<p>[P.S.: If I have to lose some virtual points for this critical comment, so be it]"],"time":["2020-02-02 18:52:30"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["russellbeattie"],"id":[22220519],"kids":[22231714,22220538,22227407],"parent":[22216411],"text":["This is an easy Google search, but I&#x27;ll add it just in case someone hasn&#x27;t done it yet.

It could actually still be less than what my work is worth to them, but I don&#x27;t have a good way of telling, and it&#x27;s probably still more than what I&#x27;d be able to earn making my own product.<p>Though if there&#x27;s one profession where it&#x27;s easy to make your own product with very little risk or investment, it&#x27;s software engineering, and that&#x27;s probably the reason why we get paid much closer to what we&#x27;re worth than many other professions; because to us, leaving and starting out own business is always an option when employers don&#x27;t want to be reasonable about what they pay us.<p>Also, there&#x27;s enormous demand for what we do, so that increases our bargaining power, and therefore our salaries.<p>So to what extent is our salary risk premium? I suppose an employer could pay us much less than what we think we&#x27;re worth, and if we have nothing better at the moment, we might take it and leave the moment we find something better. In that case, it would be better for the employer to pay us more to discourage us from leaving.<p>But is that risk premium? If it is, then practically any salary, and perhaps any cost, can be considered risk premium. I don&#x27;t see this as a very useful way of looking at things.<p>And Google and Facebook have little to do with my salary; they barely have any jobs in my field in my country, and I don&#x27;t want to emigrate.

It&#x27;s something that space pioneers have been pursuing since the dawn of the space age  or even slightly before. Tsiolkovsky and the other Russian (and later Soviet) Cosmists. Robert Goddard and Wernher Von Braun. And it was kind of the understood backdrop narrative to NASA&#x27;s foundation and Apollo, why it seemed to capture everyone&#x27;s imagination. Yeah, scifi. But scifi is not supposed to be a synonym for the impossible or fantastic (ala Star Wars). Jules Verne (for instance) is scifi but powerfully predictive in what technologies ended up existing (nuclear submarines, space travel in capsules, etc). People EXPECTED space settlement after people landing on the Moon and were excited about it. I think the Cold War eventually kind of destroyed that optimism for a while just due to dread and dystopia becomingfully mainstream in media and scifi.<p>NASA never gave up human missions to Mars as a goal (and not just supporting the search for life, but as a goal in and of itself, with permanent presence as the goal). Apollo was wound down in favor of Shuttle, which was to lay the groundwork for Mars by lowering launch costs and establishing Space Station Freedom (which became ISS) as a platform (in part) for building and launching missions to Mars. The Soviets were pursuing a similar path. After losing the Moon race, they chose to refine long-duration human spaceflight instead, developing the Salyut space stations built with logistical support from many launches (a first for spaceflight, and considered a prerequisite for Mars). Salyut was considered a kind of precursor to a Mars transfer vehicle. Salyut expanded to the Mir program, whose spares and follow-ons ended up contributing to the critical propulsion elements of ISS. But like NASA, the goal was still eventually Mars and space settlement. (And around this time in the US, there were also space settling enthusiasts focused on just scaling up space stations to be large, permanent settlements... a kind of rival for the Mars sect).<p>In the 1980s and 90s, there were a group of Mars enthusiasts in industry and NASA that started pushing Mars settlement hardcore after a few decades of post-Apollo disillusionment. They saw ISS and space stations in general as a kind of distraction, a needless cost and time tax for missions to Mars. They were (are) led by Robert Zubrin, who developed an architecture for Mars exploration called Mars Direct that could do cargo or crew launches to Mars in just one launch, with rendezvous with the different elements happening on the surface of Mars, not in orbit. They also did some important work on in situ resource utilization (ISRU), i.e. the idea of producing the vast majority (or all) of the fuel, oxidizer, and even consumables like water and air from resources on Mars (initially relying primarily on Mars&#x27; CO2 atmosphere, but later incorporating surface ice as knowledge about the extent of water on Mars expanded), convincing NASA to hesitantly baseline ISRU for future missions (previously had been Apollo-like all-up missions bringing all supplies from Earth). They were more vocal about permanent settlement on Mars as the end goal than NASA. Robert Zubrin and his group established The Mars Society in 1997, with permanent settling of Mars as a primary goal. Today, The Mars Society has Mars analogue research stations around the world where volunteers dress in mock spacesuits and live in mock space habitats (naturally, modeled after the ones from Mars Direct) and conduct mock Mars missions, including studying rock samples from the surrounding area (usually some kind of remote desert). This has been going on for decades, now.<p>Elon Musk, shortly after selling Paypal and getting rich, became kind of converted into this Mars settlement vision. He donated a bunch of money to the Mars Society (they named a telescope at one of the Mars analogue research stations after him), and they convinced him to try to send a greenhouse to Mars to kickstart the public&#x27;s imagination on Mars, with the goal of increasing NASA&#x27;s budget and focusing them on the humans to Mars goal. Long story short, he tried buying ICBMs from Russia on the cheap, was rebuffed, and so ended up starting SpaceX (and the ambition has grown tremendously from that point on).<p>So I&#x27;m not surprised not everyone is on the Mars settlement train. You&#x27;ve got to catch the Mars bug. It&#x27;s not for everyone. But it&#x27;s much bigger than Musk alone. It&#x27;s an old dream going back over a century.

Development effort across the ecosystem is probably minimized when library consumers handle exceptional situations themselves, which they may have more insight into if their own infrastructure is causing the exception."],"time":["2020-02-03 18:46:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["reffaelwallen"],"id":[22225508],"kids":[22225548,22225670,22227590,22225873,22226959,22225581],"parent":[22225170],"text":["I love using exceptions as control-flow, Python makes it very easy, and it&#x27;s really helpful.<p>edit: grammer"],"time":["2020-02-03 17:16:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foolfoolz"],"id":[22225780],"kids":{},"parent":[22225170],"text":["I’ve pushed for Either[L,R] based coding without exceptions for a while and met a lot of criticism along the way.

So it&#x27;s a fairly terrible title that is really arguing against a catch-all Error case.<p>The one parallel to (actual) exceptions is the author is arguing for a constrained subset of error states rather than a catch all Error type. This isn&#x27;t a new idea. Java essentially does this with checked exceptions. C++ does this where you can declare what exceptions can be thrown (which you should basically never do).<p>So I did Java for years. Java had several Grand Experiments, one of which was checked exceptions. Despite it still having some fans I think the general consensus now is that checked exceptions were a Huge Mistake [tm] for many reasons (eg leaking implementation details, cluttering your API the whole way up).<p>One anti-pattern I see with exceptions is people using them for control flow. For example, dealing with a ParseException in Java when parsing numbers [1].<p>This of course falls into a religious argument about what an exception actually is.<p>For a few years at Google I wrote Google&#x27;s flavor of C++, which I actually grew to really like. It is pervasive that any method in Google C++ returns a util::Status. This is much like Go error handling but (IMHO) better.<p>For one thing, it&#x27;s a compiler error to ignore the result of a util::status (you can call .IgnoreResult() if you really want to ignore it). I think this is a much nicer and safer default.<p>You return things with a util::StatusOr templated union type that has the same semantics. There are even macros (that were somewhat controversial) to reduce boilerplate to do things like call a function that returns a StatusOr, assign the result to a variable if it&#x27;s OK or return the error if it&#x27;s not.<p>There are of course utility methods for adding context to a Status(Or) you&#x27;re returning.<p>So all this came about because Google C++ strictly prohibits exceptions. This is a historic decision that&#x27;s probably impossible to unwind at this point and honestly I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a strong motivation to change it.<p>IMHO exceptions are a false economy.<p>This is one of many things I like about Rust. Rust&#x27;s enums are kind of the next evolutionary step for this.

There&#x27;s always the posibillity that shit hit the fan and something happened which was unexpected and indicates an unhealthy system in which case it will result in an unanticipated exception such as a RuntimeException.<p>This is ok, that&#x27;s why every application has somewhere a global error handler, which can capture that unusual exception, log it and potentially terminate the application or put it in an unhealty state so that a higher level scheduler can replace or re-start the app. Possibly even raise some emergency alerts with developers via PagerDuty, etc.<p>However, it most certainly doesn&#x27;t leak anything or makes the Result type less useful, because most application errors are anticipated due to a combination of user inputs or other external factors such as API calls and these can be perfectly handled in a more predictable way by using a Result type.<p>&gt; It’s by such misadventure that the working F# programmer soon realizes that any function could still potentially throw. This is an awkward realization, which has to be addressed by catching as soon as possible.<p>Not really. There&#x27;s nothing awkward about a runtime exception. Shit sometimes happen. And it&#x27;s not true that it has to be handled as early as possible. As said before, you only have to deal with exceptions in a global error handler. If the error must be caught as early as possible, then it means that there is a possible plan B and a possible plan B can only exist if the error is anticipated. If it is anticipated then it should be returned in a Result type. So fundamentally exceptions are not awkward. When they happen there&#x27;s exactly only one place where they need to get handled and the rest of the application code just works with Result types where errors are possibly known.<p>&gt; In the majority of codebases using result types that I’ve been reviewing, people typically just end up re-implementing exception semantics on an ad-hoc basis. This can result in extremely noisy code...<p>So he has just worked with badly written code. If all the code is doing is bubbling up an error from the Result type then whats the point of returning that error? Return errors which are meaningful and where the calling code can deal with it immediately, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.<p>&gt; An important property of exceptions -which cannot be stressed enough- is that they are entities managed and understood by the underlying runtime, endowed with metadata critical to diagnosing bugs in complex systems. They can also be tracked and highlighted by tooling such as debuggers and profilers, providing invaluable insight when probing a large system. By lifting all of our error handling to passing result values, we are essentially discarding all that functionality.<p>Well as said before, the Result type is not to be logged or thrown or something. It&#x27;s there so calling code can deal with it - implement some sort of plan B. If all the author wants is to always log the entire exception including stack trace for every error and not really deal with it then fair enough, just use exceptions everywhere, but that application will suck big time.<p>&gt; That said, I strongly believe that using result types as a general-purpose error handling mechanism for F# applications should be considered harmful.<p>Functions are Input -&gt; Output. If you don&#x27;t like that as a &quot;general&quot; mechanism, and you prefer Input -&gt; Output, Exception, {whatever} then use OOP and not FP. It almost seems like that the author just doesn&#x27;t like the functional appraoch in functional programming, which is a weird point to make.<p>&gt; Exceptions should remain the dominant mechanism for error propagation when programming in the large.<p>Based on which logic? That&#x27;s such a generalisation that it&#x27;s just plain wrong. Exceptions are try-catch error handling and there is no proof that try-catch is the ultimate error handling solution.

Every single one of our senses only works by detecting change.<p>Take smell for example. Your nose detects a <i>difference<\/i> in the smell of the air. When I burn things in the oven, I get used to the smell after a while but when my wife comes home she says: &#x27;Ahh, cooking again earlier?&#x27;<p>Taste is the most obvious one. Fast for a month then eat a corn chip. You will taste that simple food so deeply you could pinpoint the field the corn was grown in. Now eat a million corn chips. You quite literally won&#x27;t even taste the last one.<p>Put a fan on in your office, you&#x27;ll forget its on. Randomly have someone turn it off and the difference will be a bit painful that change is so obvious.<p>Gain 100 pounds, you get used to the feeling of it. Lose the 100 pounds, you&#x27;ll get used to that feeling too. If you didn&#x27;t, people who were obese would strive to be out of pain. There is pain in being heavy, but you get used to the feeling of your body.<p>I have heard a version of &quot;Humans adapt&quot; for my whole life. I think it&#x27;s more than that. I think it&#x27;s more like &#x27;Humans ride the wave of change.&quot; We are so symbiotic with change we don&#x27;t even notice that change is the thing we both fight and enjoy.<p>Why do I rewatch episodes of MASH? Because it&#x27;s both the same and different each time. I watch all eleven seasons over and over and what happens? I notice nuance. That&#x27;s me detecting change. It&#x27;s hard to exhaust the nuance because there is just so much of it. I see patterns, like how Hawkeye acts drunk or how Hot Lips manages her hair.<p>What is hard is FORCING change. That&#x27;s the tricky bit. Lose the weight, win the lotto, date your dream girl. Now that evolution that has kept you safe by detecting change fights you because you are way outside your comfort zone and what you are used to.<p>Subconsciously, many of us, would do the things that will help us get back to safe harbor: stifle and defend against self imposed change.<p>I think focusing on happiness is a poorly defined goal.

I joined this community a few months back hoping to contribute, but despite numerous offers for help I was turned down nearly every time. There isn’t really any leveraging of the community within the discord or reddit or really anything that I can see. I rarely saw the administrators ask for any help for archiving purposes, and most of the data that is added to the community has no rhyme or reason but largely seems to be at the whim of the administrators.<p>The-Eye was fulfilling a niche for me and that was comic book archival. It seems the comic book industry at large has no regard for preserving comic books, and I found that The-Eye had a large collection of comic books. Disappointingly I found that I already had access to the majority of these comics and actually thought I could contribute. However, there doesn’t seem to be any easy way to add content but rather that the only thing a normal users can do is download content, so I couldn’t contribute anything.<p>What I have found though, is that there is a concerted effort to gather donations from the community. There were several occasions where there were multiple announcements daily on the discord asking for donations, or if users wanted to join one of the private sites they wanted, and even asking for people to show at the store.<p>Data archival is actually a big interest to me, especially in an error when content on the web is here one day or gone the next. There is probably more data lost in a day than was created in multiple decades in earlier centuries. I just don’t see the-eye actually as a entity that is actually arching anything, but rather that their interest largely lies in providing just enough data so that it can either be paywalled, or users can give donations.<p>Don’t take my word for it though, just spend some time on their website and you can see that they have numerous calls to action for a user to donate, but nearly nothing on their site which asks for a user to contribute actual content. If the user base that you are trying to cultivate is those who contribute content it stands to reason that uploading content would be trivial. Contrast that to imgur, however, which has an upload button displayed very prominently on their front page and you can see where their priorities lie. I know this may seem like comparing apples to oranges as one could make an argument for “quality” or data curation but even when you start searching the site more in depth there is a FAQ wherein the question is asked “How can I contribute?” and they ask you to donate rather than to upload.<p>I’m not trying to claim that I understand their model, but rather to relay that from my observations it doesn’t seem like they are really interested in users contributing anything.<p>As a disclaimer, the final straw for me was when I offered books that were behind a “library” on the OpenLibrary. I had written a scraper for the site, as there were numerous items which were now public domain but you had to borrow the books which essentially was a weird form of DRM. When I asked if I could upload them to the-eye the response was “why would you want to do that?” And it wasn’t until I had gotten angry, and honestly over reacted, that they claimed that there was no space on their servers for users to contribute. I left the community, and have not since been back. That was a couple of months ago. I have a friend who has claimed that there have been some changes made since then... But that seems to be hearsay, so I am not sure how much value I place on that.<p>However, there is a silver lining... I do agree that there is an awesome community on the discord, and in the communities. I think that if you are looking for a bunch of like minded individuals who are easy to talk to, and fun to be around that you couldn’t do much better than to join the Discord and chat with the people who are there. If you value nothing else then this site is absolutely essential and I think that everyone should consider joining."],"time":["2020-02-03 16:52:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sirgawain33"],"id":[22226146],"kids":[22226287],"parent":[22225263],"text":["I was curious how this application approached privacy budget management (e.g. how the privacy parameter e is accounted for over multiple searches), but, flipping through the source, this application doesn&#x27;t appear to use Differential Privacy at all.<p>The anonymization approach implemented is &quot;generalization&quot;.

My name is Mike. I&#x27;m a disciplined software engineer with great attention to detail and ability to grok complex systems. I enjoy working on backend systems closer to the metal, but have experience up and down the stack. If you have hard problems that can&#x27;t afford cowboy approaches, I can (independently, remotely, with a team, or with stakeholders) assess your project (however unfocused) into productively delivered milestones which fit into your overall business strategy.<p>In my most recent project, I spent 2+ years as Software Architect for OpenBazaar coordinating a rapidly evolving codebase which did not have very strong development opinions when I began. OpenBazaar is an open-source, distributed, p2p marketplace which has a reference implementation that we successfully use both on desktop (Electron) and mobile (gomobile + React Native). Under the hood it runs on IPFS, SQLite, and glued together with Golang.<p>Some of my super-powers include:<p>- guiding a higher level of code quality from peers.<p>- advising design decisions toward thoughtful, orthogonal, and maintainable solutions.<p>- writing and refining requirements for protocol-level behavior.<p>- regurgitating technical specifications and documentation into functional code.<p>- filtering techno-babble into realistic, actionable expectations.<p>_<i>Work sample<\/i>_<p>My last two years of work are mostly public.

Particular academic areas of interest include streaming and sketching algorithms, hash tables, and succinct data structures. I also have considerable experience in DevOps&#x2F;cloud deployment, including both on AWS and inside AWS itself.
