The literature seems to suggest that it&#x27;s an evolutionary response to protect the community and these biases are difficult to detect because they are so innate in how we assess risk and process threats to a group.<p>I was just saying the other day that we&#x27;re one Coronovirus-like pandemic away from seeing sweeping changes in government policy that lend themselves to authoritarian rule. Changes that go beyond what we&#x27;ve seen on removing the red tape around how hospitals are run and how the spaces within them can re-purposed for other use.<p>Imagine a virus that has the properties similar to covd-19 but a higher mortality rate, affecting children and working age groups. Containment of  a pandemic would be trivial if you knew the location of infected patient and everybody with whom they&#x27;ve been in contact with over a 14 day period. That data is already available from the fact most people are mobile phone users. It&#x27;s just the data is not shared. Containment would be more specific and targeted. At the moment health professionals rely on self-reporting by patients to follow the spread of a pandemic.<p>The pretext for dissolving these artificial boundaries between the pools of data owned by corporations, intelligence services, health institutions would be easy to provide in the interest of protecting the government and the public. It would seem both responsible and reasonable to the public if the mortality and symptoms were terrifying enough. It can be argued that China&#x27;s alleged effectiveness in dealing with the virus in cities with populations larger than LA, London and NY was due to an authoritarian government model. We also see our governments working with the private sector to handle this pandemic.<p>Governments are scared because they do not have visibility on the pandemic&#x27;s spread because of problems in scaling tests, using numbers of confirmed cases serve as poor proxies for decisions to be made. I don&#x27;t think it would be long before someone starts asking the question, if we had richer data on confirmed patients and who they&#x27;d been in contact with, could we have nipped this in the but before it had the impact its had on the economy and put the health system at risk."],"time":["2020-03-15 16:49:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lkrubner"],"id":[22583790],"kids":[22583994,22584546],"parent":[22583594],"text":["A large exception would be Russia, and to a lesser extent, all of Eastern Europe.

But he isn&#x27;t revealing any new information or critical analysis that would change anyone&#x27;s minds. In fact as you read further down you find he&#x27;s actually agreeing with the government&#x27;s policies.<p>The key points of the article are:<p>• Herd immunity will happen anyway and shouldn&#x27;t be a goal.<p>• A second wave may or may not happen, it shouldn&#x27;t drive policy.<p>• Be like South Korea and close everything for an unspecified period of time.<p>• Close the schools!

He obviously realises children shouldn&#x27;t come into contact with grandparents, but fails to apply the common sense knowledge that many parents can&#x27;t stop working to take care of them e.g. because they work in the healthcare system, or logistics, or grocery retail, or pharmaceuticals, or government, etc. So those children will all go to their grandparents, assuming they have some: the one place you don&#x27;t want them to be. This is a point the scientific advisors to the government made in their announcement press conference but he fails to address it. Children need to be kept away from grandparents and in the presence of young, fit, healthy adults. These conditions can be found in schools.<p>He says:<p><i>Second waves are real things, and we have seen them in flu pandemics. This is not a flu pandemic. Flu rules do not apply. There might well be a second wave, I honestly don’t know.

The goverment understands that herd immunity is going to happen sooner or later, it&#x27;s the only way to end this, and that&#x27;s why reaching it with as few fatalities as possible is the stated aim.<p>Finally, his recommendations are useless. He just recommends social distancing and shutdowns without any time frames attached. Does he believe people can self isolate and schools can remain shut indefinitely? If not, if he believes these measures don&#x27;t last for long, then there is a question of when the optimal time to deploy them is. And trying to answer that question is how the government arrived at its current policy.<p>I have to say, reading this makes me glad the government has better scientists than this guy advising it.

However, how many of you here on HN throw up a red flag when an article uses the word &quot;poach&quot; around scientists and engineers?<p>I&#x27;m permanently distrustful when I start to hear this word. I think this was a result of being an engineer in Silicon Valley from the late 90s through 2010 or so. The large Silicon Valley employers (the ones lobbying congress about a shortage of engineers) were clearly involved in an absolutely loathsome no-poach collusion to suppress wages.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean I automatically reject the possibility of bad faith when I read stories about &quot;poaching&quot;. For example I do agree that USC crossed a line and acted reprehensibly when it &quot;poached&quot; UCSD&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s research lab. But I still want to know how much the UCSD scientists were getting paid relative to the housing market nearby (in this case, La Jolla, CA). This info is almost never included in the articles (just like the press is willing to report about how a tech CEO is experiencing hiring difficulties without once mentioning the salary offered).<p>This article suggests something more akin to the USC&#x2F;UCSD scenario, where it&#x27;s more than merely hiring away talent. I&#x27;d just like a little more information about what they mean by &quot;poached&quot;. What were the working conditions and salaries for the German scientists getting &quot;poached&quot;? Are these scientists superstars? You know what large law firms, investment banks, tech companies (post-collusion), and sports teams pay superstars to keep them from being &quot;poached&quot;?<p>The word &quot;poached&quot; implies that engineers and scientists, among others, are not truly free agents, but are owned in some way by their employers - and this worms its way into policy (for example, in how H1B visas are actually controlled by the employer, not bestowed directly onto the employee and&#x2F;or would-be immigrant).

Usually, when you take a course in person, the folks teaching the class have ample opportunity to ensure that transfer is happening, in online courses, the onus is really on the student.<p>Thus, in an online course, you need to provide clear learning goals, for instance, &quot;dynamic programming&quot;, a set of lectures that teaches those concepts, then homework or project based work that directly refers to what has been said in the lectures. Decide what your resources are, say, a book, your videos, and a few homework assignments, then try to have the resources build off each other, and make sure information is available in multiple places. Sometimes with difficult concepts, you need things explained twice, from two different sources!<p>The next aspect of a great course is the fostering of a learning community. Make sure the students have a place where they can engage (slack, discord, et cetera) and ask questions. Having students make a social connection has been shown to increase their outcomes in online learning, and for me, the early Coursera courses were amazing for this.<p>Finally, there is the aspect of of running the course. Some students don&#x27;t do well learning online, and I some of this can be explained by the loss of human to human contact and relationship building and mentoring that can help struggling students during in person office hours. A percentage of students truly rely on this, and there is no online alternative. If you don&#x27;t grok them pythonz, data science can be a nightmare (R 4 lyfe!!!).<p>Someone much smarted than me figured out you need 3 things to learn: time invested, a consistent environment, and feedback.

The source for what I’m saying is a veteran virologist with 40 years of experience dealing with these exact kinds of things. A two hour interview was linked from a previous HN thread.<p>Despite what ceejayoz might try to tell you, corona viruses do not mutate in the way that influenza does. Influenza mutates in a way that evades the immune system but retains other qualities. This is why new vaccines for the flu are always being developed. Despite the fact that corona virus family viruses are responsible for a very small amount of “common cold,” they do not exhibit this behavior. They do mutate though, which is why we are seeing two “versions” of covid-19. The ultimate meaning of all this is that once a population gains collective immunity, the virus will basically disappear. In layman&#x27;s terms, the virus will go away probably between 3 to 6 months from now in the United States. If anyone tries to refute this, post actual evidence or expert testimony showing that covid-19 mutates <i>in a similar way to influenza<\/i>.<p>Like Elon musk points out, only those with immune system problems are at risk. This includes <i>some people of advanced age<\/i>, some people with diabetes and various other people.<p>The virus appears to kill people like many other similar illnesses: if the infection spreads to deeply within the lungs, gas transfer is interrupted and secondary bacterial infection sets in, commonly known as pneumonia. The treatment for which is antibiotics and an oxygen line. This is why you see Italy asking specifically for more oxygen equipment, in my non expert opinion. Both these treatments are widely available and do not require special skill to acquire or administer. Patients who do not benefit from these would require mechanical ventilation.<p>The fatality rate is massively skewed toward severity because of the lack of testing. If all the benign cases were taken into account, the facility rate would be much smaller although still high enough to take seriously.<p>Remote administration of oxygen and antibiotics, washing hands, and light self-quarantine, all very easy to do, will blunt the impact on hospitals significantly.<p>Overall, the threat that this virus poses to most people and society in general has been overblown by the for-profit media.<p>I would like to apologize for being so impolite in addressing this topic previously.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0896841120300469\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S089684112...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WWNuDT4t-TM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WWNuDT4t-TM<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-15 20:29:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pcdoodle"],"id":[22586159],"kids":[22586211],"parent":[22585216],"text":["I&#x27;m going to get down voted but this is rational CEO speak."],"time":["2020-03-15 20:54:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nimbius"],"id":[22586083],"kids":{},"parent":[22581957],"text":["its a bit weird to watch a state that snored through 30 years of medical knowledge on the safe and effective practice of abortion in favor of christian pseudoscience suddenly become concerned about the pseudoscience of a televangelists snake oil.<p>this is the same Missouri that insists women read a pseudoscience pamphlet prior to getting an abortion, including an entire passage about &quot;fetal pain&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;health.mo.gov&#x2F;living&#x2F;families&#x2F;womenshealth&#x2F;pregnancyassistance&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Mo.InformedConsentBooklet-Revisedpgs.12-15August2019jkOGCReviewed.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;health.mo.gov&#x2F;living&#x2F;families&#x2F;womenshealth&#x2F;pregnancy...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-15 20:44:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["paulryanrogers"],"id":[22583831],"kids":[22583986,22584799],"parent":[22581957],"text":["Not surprising considering Bakker&#x27;s past, or the magical thinking that often accompanies charismatic Christianity."],"time":["2020-03-15 16:04:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["vr46"],"id":[22586472],"kids":{},"parent":[22581957],"text":["Is that dude still around?

Compared to normal language models, these can provide much better accuracy, assuming you can describe (and speak) your command structure exactly. (This is probably more acceptable for a voice assistant for an audience that is more technical.) The grammar can be specified by a FST, or you can use KaldiAG through Dragonfly, which allows you to specify them (and their resultant actions) in Python. However, KaldiAG can also do simple plain dictation if you want.<p>KaldiAG has an English model available, but other models could be trained. Although you can&#x27;t just drop in and use a standard Kaldi model with KaldiAG, the modifications required are fairly minimal and don&#x27;t require any training or modification of its acoustic model. All recognition is performed locally and off line by default, but you can also selectively choose to do some recognition in the cloud, too.<p>Kaldi generally performs at the state of art.

Basically they say that prices reflect all available information and that you cannot &quot;beat&quot; the market (there&#x27;s a subtle difference between EMH and random walk). The return on an investment is a direct reflection of the risk.\nGood reading to get an understanding for this are &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; and papers by Eugene Fama (EMH will be covered by any intro to finance book as well). For a good overview of EMH, I like this paper: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ucl.ac.uk&#x2F;fileadmin&#x2F;UCL-CS&#x2F;images&#x2F;Research_Student_Information&#x2F;RN_11_04.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ucl.ac.uk&#x2F;fileadmin&#x2F;UCL-CS&#x2F;images&#x2F;Research_Stu...<\/a><p>The investment takeaway is that you should invest in passive index funds with low management cost (typically ETFs).<p>There&#x27;s different contrasting points of view most notably behavioral finance. The EMH argument is basically the market is an aggregation of all available information. Due to the power of averaging it is going to be correct (if one person overestimates, another will underestimate and it will all cancel out). The behavioral counterargument is that there are certain human biases that lead to all parties being wrong in the same direction (such as risk aversion).\nAnother POV that is aligned with the behavioral view is that the theory of evolution provides a good framework for thinking about markets. I like the book &quot;Adaptive Markets&quot; which also gives a good overview of EMH and behavioral finance so I&#x27;ll recommend that as a reference. I think together with &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; you&#x27;re set for &quot;general framework of thought&quot; material.<p>Personally, I am a value investor so I can only recommend books from that school of thought. The basic idea is that you look at the fundamentals of a company and the stock market can misprice them. The holy grail is finding a company where the sum of (current) assets is worth more than the current market valuation via the stock price because in essence that means if the company would be liquidated and everything would be sold off, you&#x27;d still walk away with a profit. In essence, you&#x27;re trying to buy 1$ for &lt; 1$.\nThis is Buffett&#x27;s philosophy and he has done really well with it. I&#x27;d recommend &quot;Value Investing&quot; by Greenwald, Kahn, Sonkin and van Biema as a good intro book that summarizes everything and has some easy to follow examples (because you can&#x27;t usually just take the assets face value but have to discount them etc.). The classics are &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; and &quot;Security Analysis&quot; (more academic but for me this is the gold standard).\nIf you need a quick &quot;how to read balance sheets&#x2F;income statement&#x2F;cash flow statements&quot; I&#x27;d recommend &quot;Warren Buffett Accounting Book&quot;<p>I think the best essay that describes what markets are good for is &quot;The use of Knowledge in Society&quot; by Hayek. At least it makes sense for me that they serve the function of aggregating local and specialized information.\nIf you&#x27;re interested, it&#x27;s also a decent idea to research the different theories of the business cycle. Keynesian, Real Business Cycle, Austrian etc.<p>tl;dr:<p>- A Random Walk Down Wall Street<p>- Adaptive Markets<p>- Value Investing (+ Warren Buffett Accounting Book)<p>Edit: I&#x27;m assuming you want a &quot;quick overview&quot;.

The reason COVID-19 patients need to get ventilated is due to a failure of oxygenation - the infection causes direct lung injury (ARDS) which impairs oxygen absorption in the lung tissue. Normally we breathe room air, which is 21% oxygen, this drops to around 10% oxygen in the arterial blood due to inefficiencies in the absorption in the lungs. In a normal healthy patient breathing 100% Oxygen, their arterial oxygen content would be around 90%. ARDS significantly impairs oxygen uptake by the lungs, in severe cases patients breathing 100% oxygen may have arterial oxygen concentrations of just 8-10%.<p>The purpose of ventilation in these severe ARDS patients is to augment oxygenation of the blood, using a combination of techniques including end-expiatory positive pressure and inverse-ratio ventilation, among others, and support the fatiguing respiratory muscles. Because the lungs of COVID-19 patients are already injured by the infection, they are very prone to further ventilator-associated injury. Modern intensive care ventilators have complicated computer-controlled &#x27;modes&#x27;, which allow precise regulation of ventilatory volumes, pressures, rates, timing, and gas blending. The ARDSnet trials in the early 2000s demonstrated the importance of carefully managed &#x27;lung protective&#x27; ventilation, poor quality ventilation is likely to cause further lung injury and make the patient worse, not better. Therefore amateur ventilators are unlikely to be beneficial in COVID-19 unless they can provide similar lung protective ventilation, which would make them quite complicated.<p>Additionally, ventilation is just one component of the management of sick COVID-19 patients. First you need to pass a breathing tube into their trachea, which is a challenging and risky procedure when performed by a skilled operative in a otherwise well patient, let alone someone on the brink of respiratory failure. Once intubated you will need to keep them deeply sedated, otherwise they will strain against the ventilator and make effective ventilatory care impossible. This requires equipment, drugs, and skilled staff, all of which are going to be in short supply."],"time":["2020-03-14 23:31:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_red"],"id":[22575328],"kids":[22575795],"parent":[22573188],"text":["Great idea.

Even if this worked, it would only take one area not doing this effectively to allow reinfection of these other areas once measures are lifted. \nThe other issue is that an effective vaccine is not going to appear for at least a year. Other repurpose therapies are being trialed, and initial results will be released this month. I’m not aware of any other completely new therapies which may change outcomes. So, it appears the benefit is limited. \nThe main risk of this approach is that containment is initially successful, but then fails in Autumn (fall), leading to a peak in the winter when the health system is already under a large amount of stress. This would be a disaster, and may well be what happens to other countries who try this. \nSo, the UK approach of making occur in summer may make sense for the UK.

However, the obsession with structural biology isn’t necessarily optimal, because we’re talking about shapes of things (analog, constantly changing) instead of discrete states of molecular circuits. Check out the book “wetware: a computer in every living cell” —- cells figured out logic long before we did. Treatments which operate from a structural paradigm, like small molecules, antibodies, and vaccines, are analog. Treatments which operate from a sequence &#x2F; switching &#x2F; circuit paradigm are digital.<p>The digital solution is stronger: delete Coronavirus RNA. This isn’t dependent on shape of some molecule and how some other molecule docks with that inside a molecular blender. Genome engineering targets sequences directly, works with novel viruses right away, tolerates mutations with wobble base pairs, works in immunocomprimised patients, has potentially zero side effects, etc etc<p>I applaud these efforts but implore you to consider: why throw a fancy molecular wrench into the virus machine when you can instead set the “virus switch” to “off?”<p>If anyone’s gonna grok the benefit of digital over analog, it ought to be the Hacker News community.

If you get fiber or high-speed cable to your home, yes, you may have a buttload of potential bandwidth. If everyone in a large metro area tried to use all 1Gbps of their bandwidth at once, connections for many of them would crawl to about the speed of a 48.8 modem.<p>There simply isn&#x27;t enough backbone capacity for everyone to use all potential bandwidth all the time. But besides just not having enough raw capacity, the closer you get to reaching capacity, the more knock-on effects from buffer overruns and collisions and retries and latency and all sorts of shit start to cause connections to slow further. In order to keep speeds faster near capacity, you are forced to use traffic shaping to artificially squeeze capacity in order to make it not <i>seem<\/i> dog-slow, and falling into an unusable tailspin.<p>The caps are there to keep people within practical, usable limits, to prevent knock-on effects on edges of the network more vulnerable to bandwidth problems. To reduce that possibility they&#x27;d have to invest more money in unprofitable sections of infrastructure. Charging you more for bandwidth is effectively a way for them to not invest, because if they did invest, they would <i>subsequently charge you more money to cover it<\/i>. The caps basically artificially lower your own bill by getting you to choose to use less data. It&#x27;s the choice of &quot;do we piss them off with higher prices or worse service?&quot;<p>Do they want to charge you more? Of course. Do they know most people won&#x27;t use more than 1TB of data per month?

The shoulder straps are relatively narrow, and made of canvas, they look incredibly uncomfortable, but after I broke them in they were incredible, they moulded to fit me.<p>The external frame allows for really good back ventilation. The thing I dislike the most about modern backpacks is that I basically end up with a giant sponge on my back. The frame also serves a protective purpose, along with being made out of thick canvas, everything inside the pack stays safe, you could throw it of a cliff.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s heavy, bulky, and if it doesn&#x27;t fit you it&#x27;s hell to wear. But for a 40 year old backpack it does incredibly well.<p>I think that the biggest difference between old outdoor equipment and new equipment is that the new stuff is all generic, one size fits all, and designed to be comfortable from the moment you walk out of the store. You can buy a new pack and boots, and go on a 5 day hike the next day without having to break in any of your equipment. Perfect for our fast food, turnkey culture. Older, and modern bespoke equipment made in the old way, will last you an entire lifetime, but it takes time to break it in and maintain it.<p>I&#x27;ve always found it interesting that at the point in history where humans were spending the most time in the wilderness, we had the least technically complicated equipment. When the Europeans were exploring and colonising the Americas they did so with nothing but timber, leather, canvas, and a bit of steel. Now we spend a couple of weekends a year in the bush, bringing a plethora of space-age technology just to try and survive: carbon fibre, nylon, and titanium gas cookers that boil water in 30 seconds.<p>I feel like people often become more reliant on technology, not less, when they go into the outdoors."],"time":["2020-03-14 10:13:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["PaulDavisThe1st"],"id":[22576264],"kids":{},"parent":[22557640],"text":["One thing missing in this survey is the arrival of shoulder strap lift straps. If you go back to the 1970s, backpacks more or less uniformly had a shoulder strap that started at the top of your back, sat directly against the body and wrap up and over the shoulders. This transferred a significant amount of weight directly to the top of the shoulders.<p>At some point, people figured out that it made sense to run an adjustable strap from the very apex of the shoulder strap back to the pack &quot;frame&quot; (whatever that was), designed to generally run at about a 45 degree angle upwards.
