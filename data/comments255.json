It&#x27;s foundationally true, of course, because energy is conserved, and we use all of the calories that we eat, with few exceptions, either for energy or for fat storage.<p>But exercise really helps. It changes what you want to eat first of all. Fat loss can be grueling or easy, depending on where your body wants to be, and exercise pushes it to the easier side.<p>Some of the non-calorie burning exercises have the biggest effects here. Weightlifting is almost pointless from a calorie perspective, but it really energizes weight loss. I assume that the hormonal effects are king.<p>Biking colossal distances is another thing that seems to lead to leaning out. In theory it should be possible just to eat through the calories burned biking, but in practice, it seems to shift the bias towards losing.<p>Also, the biggest problem with calories-in calories-out is that weight regain after a calorie deficit period -- even a long one -- seems to be almost a law of nature. The body seems to push extremely hard for regaining everything that has been starved off."],"time":["2019-12-27 02:32:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bot1"],"id":[21888076],"kids":[21888164,21888148,21888147,21890935,21888243,21888174,21888153],"parent":[21887538],"text":["Start lifting weights.

There&#x27;s an old expression, &quot;The only thing in the middle of the road is roadkill.&quot; It&#x27;s not saying that moderates are extinct or undesirable. Rather, left and right political views mostly come from a history of life experiences that drives people either towards empathy for strangers or towards fear of strangers. The combination of these worldviews and the human desire for having a community or clan drives people into parties in opposition to each other.<p>For most moderates, their experiences instead drive them to prefer either worldview depending upon which issue is being considered. Their experiences are not totally based on seeking safety or showing empathy. They are not middle of the road on most issues, but have a diverse set of opinions. Their opinions are diverse enough to not feel fully accepted into either party and to adjust their own views into alignment, unless their country has a middle party.

Fully left or right ideas both tend to overshoot evidence-based decision-making. I believe this is what Graham refers to as accidental moderates.

Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>As is increasingly the case, the core of pg&#x27;s argument is a variant of the Appeal to Authority: the &quot;impressive people&quot; that pg personally knows.

Not only can it be easily dismissed, it probably proves the opposite of what he intends.<p>I think we can assume those impressive people are likely all drawn from the small coterie of technology startup founders and investors. From this and other essays, it&#x27;s become clear that pg believes that success at becoming a startup founder (just like pg) is almost identical with being an impressive person.<p>But it&#x27;s well-known that this group already comes from a relatively narrow slice of humanity. Upper-middle-class or upper-class, likely white, likely gone to a university in America. It would not be surprising if their opinions were roughly in alignment.<p>Even so, the &quot;impressive people&quot; have not taken public stands that we can verify. We only have pg&#x27;s assessment of their stances as being roughly centered around a mean, and we only have pg&#x27;s assessment of where the mean is. (It&#x27;s rare indeed for someone to self-identify as an extremist!)<p>This is an informal essay, so perhaps asking for even <i>one<\/i> example is too much rigor. And, as pg often reminds us, his friends have all kinds of interesting opinions they can&#x27;t reveal in public any more, due to political correctness. Luckily we have pg who valiantly is willing to stand up in public and allude to a large number of people who agree with him, but are just off-camera.<p>Anyway, since we are left to merely imagine, let&#x27;s also imagine that we asked pg&#x27;s interlocutors about other topics. What would their opinions be on, say, technology startups and business? They&#x27;d probably say they were good for the world, and good as a career path. There might be a relatively univocal assessment of taxes as being too high,  the barriers to founding businesses as too onerous, and that some ideas popular outside the tech industry (like mandated key escrow, or fact-checking social media posts) are all ludicrous and counterproductive. All defensible opinions, but my point is, we can imagine them all being in close agreement on issues relating to their industry.<p>So let&#x27;s take pg at his word that if we have a cohort of people who have self-selected an industry and risen to success, their opinions about that industry are both informed and in close agreement, and their <i>other<\/i> opinions might be defensible, but randomly scattered around a mean. Is this <i>really<\/i> that surprising?<p>pg wants us to believe that the relative moderation of his impressive friends proves something. That not only is moderation a virtue, but the virtuous are moderate.<p>But accidentally, he may be revealing that technology startup success is more random than he thinks. That it selects for people with some narrow range of skills, but success is awarded with a high degree of randomness.<p>And since there is no reason for this cohort to be in  alignment on any other matter, they are more or less randomly scattered around the median opinion of an upper-class American university technology student.<p>...<p>PS: pg started his career as an essayist with &quot;Beating the Averages&quot;, and now he asserts that being average is actually good!?<p>Okay, maybe that&#x27;s a cheap shot, but we&#x27;re all looking to justify ourselves and be loved, I guess, and as we pass through different stages of life that doesn&#x27;t change. pg used to write about the hidden virtues of high school nerds, minority programming languages, and young founders who weren&#x27;t from California.

There should be a happy-clicky thing that non technical people could set up and it would force them to do it the right way, because the right way is the easy way.   By happy-clicky, I mean, they create an account on any VPS provider, then click &quot;add service&quot;, say how big to let it scale to, define what domain name to use and they are done.<p>- Web based chat servers that scale.  Again, there are web front-ends, like Convos and TheLounge you can put in front of IRCD, but non technical people don&#x27;t have the patience to set up IRC networks and put web front-ends on them.  If there was a happy-clicky solution that used RPC over HTTPS or something to negotiate clusters and all the person has to do is point DNS to it, then more people would self host chat.<p>- File sharing.  If there was something lighter weight than NextCloud that could auto-scale in any VPS provider and could be deployed from each VPS provider, then more people would self host.  I almost wrote something like this out of necessity but so many people were using dropbox, I abandoned it.<p>In summary, I think the gap that needs to be filled is to have more projects that integrate into VPS providers (by the VPS provider) and be part of their VM deployment system, so that anyone can deploy them easily.  Maybe there could even be a business model around integrating 3rd party services into each of the VPS providers, following some non vendor specific standard, that all the VPS providers could set up.  Linode, Vultr, AWS, Azure, Softlayer, OVH, Hetzner, Digital Ocean, etc... and no code specific to any of them.

It&#x27;s the height of arrogance for an individual cook to believe that they possess genius exceeding the crowd-sourced collective imaginations of an entire people. And actually believing one &quot;needs&quot; to do something different, to make one&#x27;s mark? It&#x27;s hard to be a good cook, but it takes the barest modicum of emotional control and self-awareness to avoid falling into this trap. Just don&#x27;t.<p>As in mathematical or scientific research, one is actually most creative and original when one is channeling with clarity what everyone else meant to say, wanted to say but didn&#x27;t know it. In cooking, the hardest thing to do is to express a classical recipe using modern methods and ingredient sourcing, better than an entire people had managed before with conventional methods. Either this is too hard for elite restaurant chefs, so they instead play with their food, or there&#x27;s no market, because one has to be on the same level to taste the difference? I don&#x27;t believe that; perfecting the thoughts of others is the ultimate challenge.<p>Baking is easy. I have a spreadsheet going back fifty versions for sourdough bread ground from whole grains. It&#x27;s a careful search algorithm in a high dimensional space, not cooking. Corn tortillas from scratch, via nixtamalizing and grinding landrace Oaxacan corns from masienda.com, is an ultimate baking graduation exercise. There&#x27;s much conflicting information out there, but no reference recipe that guarantees success at home. Within a month one is at the research frontier for home cooks in a modern setting. One needs to be comfortable with research, not with following direction.

For example audit, a point of view that IT is a cost center, and the non technical management decision making that go along with the previous challenge the spirit and proper execution to get DevOps right. But in reality DevOps is a symptom of a larger issue - functional reporting structures and goal misalignment.<p>Audit - the idea that your developer doesn’t have access to production systems and data is a challenge to DevOps. The idea that one person codes and one deploys can be a challenge. Some organizations like management visibility and an audit trail to prove it - this can challenge automation and frequent deployment. This is not just a DevOps issue, audit expectations for business requirements and QA signoff can be just as bad. Admittedly some of the audit rules are relics of the past but the need to be addressed in order for DevOps practices (and really for agile teams to be agile.<p>In organizations where IT is a supporting function of the business there is a view point that it’s a cost center only and doesn’t produce value and should be cost controlled and managed to ultimate efficiency. I’ve reminded CIOs that the work the IT team does is not “a factory” as they sometimes insist on calling it - no one in technology that I’ve ever met (except management) really wants to think they work in a factory.<p>The efficiency mindset rank orders roles with QA and analysts at the bottom, devops slightly higher, developers relatively high, architects at the top of the skilled food chain and management of course at the top. To some degree these functions can be centralized so they can be optimized and made efficient. Centralizing typically means you work for management rather than a particular business mission. Your job is to make management look good and keep everything running smoothly (remember you work in a factory). Management generally looks good when quality is achieved at a lower price point. Along with that tends to be a higher level of off shoring at the lower end of the skill rank where larger numbers means more efficiency at lower cost. Here lies the problem - the premise of DevOps is that the role is integrated in the team. When DevOps is a function reporting to management then their goals aren’t aligned to the development team. They might not even sit with the team and they might have their own orders. They might be in a 12-20 hour time zone offset.<p>To me the larger issue is management structures aligned by function instead of business. This leads to misalignment if goals and ultimately lack of integration in functions. It’s a bigger problem than DevOps and it’s a bigger problem than IT. I think the companies that get management reporting right will win in the end. I am curious to see how Google and Amazon respond to these issues at their scale.

The New York Armory Show art exhibition unveiled Duchamp’s Nude Descending a Staircase, a “sensation of sensations” that prompted Americans to declare Duchamp the leader of cubism, the voice of modern art.<p>In Paris, however, the cubist revolution was reaching its peak around Picasso. In retrospect, these events form a crossroads in art history, a moment when two young bohemians adopted entirely opposite views of the artist, giving birth to the two opposing agendas that would shape all of modern art.<p>Today, the museum-going public views Pablo Picasso as the greatest figure in modern art. Over his long lifetime, Picasso pioneered several new styles as the last great painter in the Western tradition. In the rarefied world of artists, critics, and collectors, however, the most influential artist of the last century was not Picasso, but Marcel Duchamp: chess player, prankster, and a forefather of idea-driven dada, surrealism, and pop art.<p>Picasso and the Chess Player is the story of how Picasso and Duchamp came to define the epochal debate between modern and conceptual art<U+2015>a drama that features a who’s who of twentieth-century art and culture, including Henri Matisse, Gertrude Stein, André Breton, Salvador Dalí, and Andy Warhol.

It was a small batch, so we all got to know each other pretty well.<p>There was something that really made the Airbnb founders stand out from the rest in that batch.<p>It wasn&#x27;t that they seemed to have the best business idea; as has been widely written about before, PG and the other YC partners thought their &quot;eBay for space&quot; concept was stupid and would soon fail, then they would hopefully move onto something more promising.<p>But for some reason, everyone just assumed that these guys were on a sure path to huge success, and in the batch voting on the most promising startup just before demo day, they won by a huge margin.<p>I didn&#x27;t grasp this at the time, but over my own startup journey I realised that the factor that made them seem so promising, and the one that held me back and all the other companies that didn&#x27;t make it, was emotional strength and stability [1].<p>The Airbnb guys just really seemed to have their shit together emotionally. Not in any bulletproof, infallible way; they had their weaknesses, and made mistakes like everyone else, but they had a unique ability to cop the hits, learn the key lessons and bounce back better from every challenge and setback, and thus they kept growing and progressing at an astonishingly rapid rate.<p>I, on the other hand, whose business concept was considered by some others to be at least as solid, was far more sensitive and emotionally fragile, and I would become increasingly scarred by setbacks and criticisms, and paralysed by fear of further torment.<p>Though we battled on for five years, I became physically and mentally exhausted, and ultimately had to step away to let my co-founder and a new CEO to take over.<p>In the six-plus years since then, it&#x27;s been my primary focus to overcome all my deeply held traumas and unhealthy emotional&#x2F;behavioural patterns, and to become as grounded and rounded a person as possible.<p>And as my healing journey has progressed, any ambitions I held to achieve business success on par with the Airbnb founders has faded, and been eclipsed by the realisation that in order to do _anything_ well – from running businesses and leading social&#x2F;political movements, to simply having successful friendships&#x2F;relationships, a healthy family life and a physiologically healthy body – a healthy emotional foundation is of prime importance.<p>And as I methodically work though my emotional baggage, all those key aspects of my life - career, family&#x2F;friendships, and physical health - have steadily improved, but my ambitions and visions of a desirable future have also significantly changed from what they were when I entered YC.<p>Exactly what that means for my ultimate career&#x2F;life outcome is still very unclear, and to me, these days, not especially important.<p>But one thing is for sure; whereas I&#x27;d initially hoped that getting into YC would put me on a path to building a &quot;unicorn&quot; tech company, the way it ended up changing my life has turned out to be far more profound.<p>[1] The other thing that made them stand out was that they were by far the most nice and supportive to everyone else in the batch, which I&#x27;ve also since learned is a sign of emotional roundedness and wholeness; when you really have it together yourself, you have plenty of positive energy to share with others."],"time":["2019-12-26 13:19:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jonnym1ll3r"],"id":[21882500],"kids":[21882692,21883568,21885427],"parent":[21882441],"text":["&quot;Who are you willing to continue to become, even after you’ve accomplished some success?

I could handle it when my nervous system was stable, when my ego mind had solidified logical pathways to bypass physical, and likely emotional, pain that had started when I was 4 or 5 years old - the full extent of which was masked, hidden, until my journey towards holistic healing practices lead me to Ayahuasca ceremonies - which dissolved my ego and reintroduced me to the intolerable level of physical injury below. I still haven’t been able to find stable footing, I struggle day to day, even though over the last 3+ years I have successfully healed a significant amount of physical pain with stem cell treatments allowing me to get closer to grounding, still a significant amount of pain remaining preventing me from ever fully grounding, the aversion from pain, unknown how much of the pain I will be able to heal.<p>What I had been holding onto, for hope, for distracting my mind, was hope for my very ambitious projects. The first difficult lesson in letting go was ~4 years ago; I really haven’t kept track of time, there’s no value in that I’ve found. I was developing a platform for the yoga community and successfully launched with decent number of yoga instructors actively using it, and was ready to scale - with the help of my then girlfriend and business partner I brought on when platform was ready to scale, who mainly was tasked with outreach and support. I struggled for a few months to find a way to keep this project alive and growing - I couldn’t. Perhaps fortunately design is where my skill development lead me, and so over the last few years a main focus I had was redesigning the platform of which I completed 80-90% of the new version, however I let go of that many months ago now - I just can’t handle managing or arranging for the next steps for such a relatively complex project; I know the market better than most, the new updated model if implemented would scale very quickly - I am certain if I could write an executive summary to explain the game plan I could convince anyone the vision will be successful, except there’s no point because I can’t execute or guide the execution of it.<p>All around the same time as struggling to keep the project alive, to scale: the relationship with my then girlfriend fell apart primarily due to my difficulty coping with the pain I could no longer be the stability she needed, I had to fly back from our outreach in Silicon Valley to watch my father who had requested euthanasia - but denied it - suffocate, drown to death in his hospital bed due to his body being weak and him catching pneumonia (pneumonia his lungs) in the hospital - watching along with my mother and sister; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattamyers.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;120321181606&#x2F;my-father-passed-away-yesterday#disqus_thread\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattamyers.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;120321181606&#x2F;my-father-pa...<\/a>. It was ultimately the grieving of my father’s death that reduced my available tolerance for the difficulties of the relationship to zero.<p>As I say, my first project has always been myself - trying my best to organize the next treatments, to try to problem solve what else may be going on. Healing myself has been difficult on its own though with my executive function being greatly disrupted due to the pain, and though I have tried again at different times - mostly after when significant healing has occurred, I still can’t handle the normal stress of moving a project forward, of hiring and managing others. I don’t know if I will ever be able to handle any normal life stress - whether for what I consider my life’s work, writing a detailed book of my journey, moving my projects forward - a network of health-wellness differentiated platforms to help shift society toward a healthier path, friendships or more - I simply am stuck from moving forward with all of this; this has difficulty psychologically of course. It is rare that the conditions are right that allow me to stream of consciousness write like this, where I write everything in one go, which allows there to be some organization inherently in the thoughts - otherwise I’m generally unable to organize a longer story from pieces written at different times - a part of mental organization tied to executive function.<p>The turmoil from not having a stable foundation for my brain, or perhaps mind to stem from, to develop patterns of behaviour, autonomous nervous system habits, executing thoughts toward behaviour allowing me to move forward without being constantly interrupted by physical pain, psychologically has been varying degrees of hell on Earth.<p>Two years ago it seemed I was better able to trick myself, delude myself, into thinking that I would soon reach the tipping point where enough pain would be healed where my executive function and life could begin to be rebuilt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattamyers.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;160104127401&#x2F;on-days-like-today-my-birthday\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattamyers.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;160104127401&#x2F;on-days-like...<\/a>. It’s however been 2 more years of stem cell treatments with unimaginable difficulty day to day, week to week, year to year, of struggle trying to cope - cycling through patterns and attempting to maintain a routine to provide as much stability as possible for myself.<p>When I write something long like this I wonder if it will be the last coherent piece I write to share my story. It feels cathartic to share my story, as we’re designed or evolved to story tell to pass on knowledge - however it is the rare time where I am able to compile something as clear as I feel this is, and so unfortunately it can’t end up part of my routine. I step carefully to not touch on details of my journey including near constant occurrences of incompetence, abandonment, lack of adequate support to not too strongly trigger emotions, stress including post-traumatic stress, that my nervous system just can’t handle due to the constant injection, sensitization of my nervous system.<p>I no longer care to actually share my vision for my projects, it isn’t useful to have hope - in fact optimism increases the contrast creating higher peaks and valleys with the pain, reducing how stable or flat foundation is possible. I could be hopeful, optimistic - I’m not broken that way - however ultimately I’d need the help of others to move my projects forward and that doesn’t happen, no help for me day to day or organizing treatments or someone problem solving for me what else could be going on with my nervous system, and no help for me for my projects; I can’t even ask for help any longer and don’t want to because the thought of moving forward engages executive function, your mind and thoughts lead to the body preparing itself for action - which for me, my body trying to engage triggers, tries grounds into the pain — aversion. It seems everyone has difficulty understanding just how locked up I am with moving forward in life, most everyone - especially doctors - not willing to read anything long form like this either.<p>So currently I am in a very dark place, more calm today after the storm that this past week has been. I do have another stem cell treatment middle of January already booked and organized, that at least today, I feel like I’ll make it to. A month ago I found out after doing a microbiome test I have an h.pylori infection - probably for many years now, that if treated may or may not reduce pressure on my body and reduce symptoms. It took me until a few days ago to order the supplements the doctor wanted me to take for a few weeks before starting antibiotics for a few weeks. There are other treatments and other diagnostics I still need to try organize. I normally share the actual incidents and causes of physical injury, though I don’t care to at the moment, and I am getting mentally exhausted now so my writing will start to fall apart if I continue trying to add to this and would start adding exponential more stress if I tried to push.<p>I don’t expect anyone to read this - though a thank you to other commenters who inspired me with their openness, and to LeonW’s thoughtful responses that let me feel this would be a safe space to share.

Less?<p>In the past, granular permissions <i>did not exist<\/i> in Android. You were simply given a list of permissions that any given app would simply use at any time and you either downloaded the app or you didn&#x27;t.<p>Final example: Android lets apps simply write and read to&#x2F;from the file system anywhere they want, until very recently (Android 10?). If I&#x27;m not mistaken, that means that any app that&#x27;s granted permissions to the file system could just read common storage locations like your Facebook cache directory to gather personal information.<p>&gt; My wife asked me how Facebook knew she walked by a particular store yesterday, so I dove into the Settings. What a mess.<p>iOS does not give these permissions away. The answer is obvious: his wife gave Facebook location access.<p>&gt; First, there’s this “Privacy” tab in iOS settings, but under it you’ve got this ridiculous and ever-growing list of crap. Every app appears multiple times, and you have to know where to look.<p>On the one side of the ring, people ask Apple to make things simpler, and on the other side of the ring people ask Apple to expose more granular control. There&#x27;s no winning here.<p>And anyway, the organization is quite logical. It&#x27;s organized by permission category.<p>&gt; Browsing the “Location Services” tab alone is a nightmare. There’s no way to sort by “Always”, which is usually the particularly bad permission you care about. (Although “While Using” is a bit ambiguous too.)<p>How many apps do you have where sorting is an issue here?<p>Also, &quot;While Using&quot; is not ambiguous. It means &quot;While Using.&quot; The text on the original dialog was &quot;While Using the App.&quot; What else could it mean?<p>This is an interesting criticism because it&#x27;s another piece of granular location control that Android either doesn&#x27;t have or gained very recently.<p>&gt; And don’t get me started on this “Bluetooth” tab.

Cargo always consults both .toml and .lock files, and only uses the .lock file to the extent where it&#x27;s consistent with the .toml. If it notices any inconsistencies, e.g. .lock pointing to github but .toml pointing to crates.io, its behaviour depends on the parameters passed. If you pass --locked or --frozen, it gives an error. If you don&#x27;t pass any parameters, it tries to fix the issue by itself. It can&#x27;t use the information from the .lock file to get the precise version, and thus just uses the latest version that&#x27;s still consistent with the version requirement in the .toml file.<p>I don&#x27;t think that cargo&#x27;s decision to always consult the .toml was actually motivated with security in mind. Instead I think cargo&#x27;s authors just wanted to avoid the hassle for developers of having to constantly invoke commands to update the .lock file (is this what &quot;convention over configuration&quot; means?). So I think this is an instance where a choice done for better ergonomics actually ended up improving security as well.<p>Note though that even with current cargo, any PR that claims to do a simple cargo update could very well not be such a PR.

This test is only 90% sensitive after 12 weeks ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hepatitisc.uw.edu&#x2F;go&#x2F;screening-diagnosis&#x2F;acute-diagnosis&#x2F;core-concept&#x2F;all\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hepatitisc.uw.edu&#x2F;go&#x2F;screening-diagnosis&#x2F;acute-d...<\/a> ). Testing shortly after possible infection with this test is not effective.<p>The best early detection test is Hepatitis C Viral RNA, Quantitative, Real-Time PCR. It’s able to detect infection 2 weeks after.<p>The absolute best testing protocol after suspected infection is what doctors use for needle-stick. Test the person who may be spreading the infection immediately using the RNA test. If RNA is detectable start the short course of Hep C drugs on the person who might be infected. This will avoid acute Hep C infection altogether.<p>Hep C testing is very popular direct-to-consumer. For us, patients usually get it as part of full STD screening ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jasonhealth.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;std-testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jasonhealth.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;std-testing<\/a> ). About 80% of Hep C tests are ordered as part of that.<p>Anecdotally, it’s not usually ordered by MDs as part of STD screening.

I haven&#x27;t taken a sick day in years. Since I&#x27;m young and healthy, I didn&#x27;t see the need to take an annual physical exam. Scheduling doctor&#x27;s appointments is such a hassle. I&#x27;m sure many of you feel the same.<p>So when I was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, it came as a complete shock to me. The shock was due to two reasons:<p>1. I wasn&#x27;t involved in any of the &quot;high risk&quot; activities associated with Hepatitis C, which are intravenous drug use and tattoos.<p>2. I regularly went to the doctor&#x27;s when I was a child, so there was at least 20 blood tests done back then. None of tests caught the Hepatitis C back then.<p>Since Hepatitis C is a chronic condition for most people, if I didn&#x27;t catch mine early, it would have been found much later in life when all of the damaged has been done. I only caught my Hepatitis C because I wanted to an elective cosmetic medical procedure. It was my own vanity, plus pure luck, that caught it.<p>When I was a child, I was covered under the government&#x27;s and my parents&#x27; health care plans. When I entered college, I was enrolled under the mandatory student health care plan. After I entered the work force, I was covered under my employer&#x27;s health care plan. All this health care was fully paid for, either through tax dollars, or my parent&#x27;s contributions, or my own contributions, and I stupidly chose not to utilize it, because I was young and healthy.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to end up like me, then please heed my advice: all of you are under-utilizing the medical services that you have already paid for. You should research what kind of screening and preventive care is included in the health care plan that you purchased and then take full advantage of them. It&#x27;s better for you since you live longer. It&#x27;s better for your insurance company since screening and preventive care is much cheaper than paying for treatments down the road. It&#x27;s better for your government since they get to collect more tax dollars over your longer lifespan. And it&#x27;s better for me since I make a living using the software and services that you guys provide.<p>I can stick around and do a AMA if you guys have any questions for me."],"time":["2019-12-26 15:41:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jxramos"],"id":[21885495],"kids":[21888321,21887243,21886313],"parent":[21883254],"text":["Here&#x27;s the crux point...<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\n...clinicians are now able to successfully cure at least 95% of patients with the chronic condition with oral medications that have little or no side effects.<p>&quot;With such an effective means for cure, it only makes sense to universally screen patients,&quot; Cheung said. &quot;Implementation of universal screening will also decrease the likelihood of primary care physicians forgetting who does or does not need screening -- and it avoids the sometimes uncomfortable discussion with the patient about why they have been labeled as high risk and needing further screening.&quot;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>I think the fact that high risk populations rock the medical boat so globally already makes medicine awkward regardless of avoiding uncomfortable discussions.

It&#x27;s the next immediate question that gets raised when you evaluate &#x27;why do I need another HIV test&#x27; or whatever other blood test it is that medicine pushes on you. Eventually it dawned on me that these blind blanket decisions are simply because these doctors don&#x27;t know anything about a patient&#x27;s personal life and what risky subpopulations they may or may not belong to. But from the patient who knows what virtue they live or don&#x27;t live some of these tests just come off as absurd knowing your own life history and the absolute absence of risks you deliberately avoid in life.

One pill per day with basically no side effects.<p>- In western countries there are a whole bunch of HCV positive baby boomers, in many cases unaware that they are infected. Epidemically they are not transmitting the disease, but they have been chronic for many years and are having liver issues<p>- Again in western countries, the epidemic is being driven mostly by active intravenous drug users, typically young, and often with other co-morbidities (mental health issues, HIV, etc). Re-infection is possible, so HCV eradication will be tough<p>- There is controversy as to whether you can transmit HCV sexually, at the least it is much harder than transmitting HIV. Conversely active intravenous drug users that share needles will almost certainly have HCV, with HIV being harder to transmit this way<p>- In other countries the situation can be very different.

Also I think it needs to be designed from the ground up for sharing not just with people, but also with apps, just like you can access Google drive data using their API.

The drone industry, in my opinion, has been rather irresponsible about educating their customers.  As a result you have people flying drones in places, at times and altitudes they should not.<p>A few years ago, where I live, we had a rash of new drone owners doing stupid crap like flying over homes, roads, highways, parks and supermarket parking lots, to name a few.  This culminated with the inevitable.  Someone got hurt, badly, when a drone fell out of the sky.  The drone owner&#x2F;operator got arrested.  They ended-up in jail and lost their home in the lawsuit that followed.  Pretty f-ing stupid behavior if you ask me.<p>As someone who has been designing, building and flying all kinds of remote controlled aircraft for somewhere around 35 years, I have been looking at what the consumer side of the drone industry has been doing with horror.  I have crashed so many aircraft and helicopters I can&#x27;t even list them.  I am not talking about cheap toys either.  My highest cost crash was $6,000 in one day.<p>The point is these things are toys made with toy-grade electronics.  They are nowhere near reliable enough to dare fly over structures, people or roads unless the pilot is willing to face the consequences of killing one or more people and possibly burning down an entire neighborhood.  Having done extensive work in aerospace I know full-well what proper fault-tolerant design looks like --cause I have many fault-tolerant designs under my belt.  These things are not even close to being safe enough to fly over a crowd of kids at the park or above a neighborhood.  And yet it happens all the time.<p>The industry has had an opportunity to address these issues, either technologically, through education or both.  And they have note.  Therefore, they are slowly being constrained through  precisely the legislation they deserve to have to face.<p>One of the things I said years ago as drones started to become popular and people started to do stupid things with them was that &quot;these people are going to ruin the model aircraft hobby for everyone&quot;.  I am sad to say I was right.  They are doing precisely that and more.<p>Not sure if there are any solutions at this point other than the kind of legislation responsible drone owners do not need and do not want.<p>Oddly enough this is precisely the same situation we have in the US with the firearm issue.  Responsible firearm owners don&#x27;t need legislation to be, well, responsible law-abiding citizens who harm nobody.
