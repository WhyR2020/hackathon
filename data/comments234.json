For my local school it&#x27;s showing the marginal cost of the first credit hour, but the average cost per credit hour is substantially lower once you get to the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for insurance. After correcting for that mistake it cut the monthly cost for tuition+insurance for my local school in half.  In addition, some schools offer insurance for spouses and children as well, which usually drives the cost per person down even further. For our situation, the total cost of tuition (9 credit hours per semester) plus insurance (2 people) is about $870 per month.

It&#x27;s hard to visualize how much money has been legally stolen from the American people over the last few decades due to the giant scam that is the health insurance industry. The combined salaries of every single doctor in America could be paid for with 8% of what we spend on healthcare every year. If you add in the salaries of nurses, pharmacists, drug researchers, etc. it&#x27;s probably under 25% of what we pay. Unfortunately there are literally millions of middlemen and unnecessary administrators who soak up a very large percentage of healthcare spending without really doing anything.<p>Canada and Australia spend less than half as much per capita as we do on healthcare despite having similar levels of GDP per capita and better average life expectancies.

Distributing extensions this way was free. While never a huge platform due to Mac Safari&#x27;s relatively low market share, it had a number of fairly decent extensions.<p>* In OS X El Capitan Apple rolled their extensions signing program into the Apple developer program, which costs $100&#x2F;year. Extensions that were not signed would be &quot;untrusted&quot; and would be quite annoying to install. Many extension developers openly criticized the move–some refused to continue supporting Safari.<p>* Almost simultaneously, Apple introduced their content blocking API, where extensions could declare a list of what are essentially regular expressions to block content. This model is quite similar to Chrome&#x27;s declarativeWebRequest API in that extensions have little flexibility at runtime to vet requests. This API works in Safari on macOS as well as 64-bit iOS devices.<p>* With Safari 12 Apple deprecated the old web extensions model (no longer loading these) and introduced a new extensions model, App Extensions. These are native bundles that run out-of-process and communicate with JavaScript that you can inject into the page. Again, these bundles must be signed with a (paid) developer ID certificate and be sandboxed. Distribution via the App Store is recommended but not required. Any remaining extensions that share code across browsers (i.e. not using native code) are now locked out of the platform.<p>* (This announcement, which is a rehash of the one at WWDC from this June) In Safari 14 Apple is supporting a conversion tool that converts your standard WebExtension into something that Safari can load, with the same signing and distribution restrictions as app extensions (costs money, sandbox). Many simple APIs are available, but there is the notable absence of the ability to block requests–so uBlock cannot be ported, for example. NoScript does not seem possible to implement either.<p>* Safari on iOS has never supported extensions–this hasn&#x27;t changed. The only extensibility available there is still just content blockers using declarative lists."],"time":["2020-08-28 05:37:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fancy_pantser"],"id":[24301352],"kids":[24304988,24302739,24302799],"parent":[24300548],"text":["This is really exciting for me!

It made me sad, then I started realizing that the nerdy kids like me were into 3d printing and Arduino and robots. However, they are going to miss out on the IoT, which will be driven by radios. The young kids are going miss learning the electronics and radio skills I got to learn before I was ten. Those skills took me into computers, programming and physics eventually.

As @nicoburns points out in another comment, there are many companies that can do the job (MSFT, Google, Cisco, etc. have perfectly comparable alternatives here), and if you&#x27;re willing to look outside of the biggest companies explicitly targeting business meetings, you have other companies with working technical infrastructure targeted at a different market (i.e. FB, Appl) and a batch-ful of YC startups trying to provide the same functionality to the same market.<p>What I think the article is pointing out is that when Zoom goes down, schools can&#x27;t teach. And that&#x27;s true. I think this is indicative of a usability &#x2F; coordination &#x2F; culture problem of missing fallbacks. For example, when Zoom goes down a teacher (at least to my knowledge) can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t quickly email out a &quot;Hey class, Zoom is down so here is the Google meet link for today&quot;.<p>However, this is true of many technologies (if gmail is down I&#x27;m not getting email, if slack is down I&#x27;m not reading messages, and if Github is down I&#x27;m not pushing code). I think the larger problem is HOW MANY institutions it&#x27;s a critical point of failure for. If Zoom goes down, our courts largely pause, our education largely pauses, our economy largely pauses, etc. The same is not true of Github or Gmail. In this regard it&#x27;s closer to a powergrid failure.<p>This should go away as verticalized solutions and fallbacks appear (leading to broader diversity, where not all courts use the same platform), but I think the key things to think about until then are:<p>1. Is there anything Zoom could do to create stronger network effects (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayushsood.com&#x2F;zooms-missing-platform&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayushsood.com&#x2F;zooms-missing-platform&#x2F;<\/a>) preventing new entrants from entering the market?\n2. If they did those things, how could we respond to ensure Zoom&#x27;s incumbent position didn&#x27;t allow them to prevent new entrants? An old-internet answer would be to centralize the key nodes, effectively utilitize them, and then allow anyone to make a platform that connects to them (i.e. AT&amp;T doesn&#x27;t own telephony, DNS&#x27; don&#x27;t own the internet, Gmail doesn&#x27;t own email).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how likely this is given (1) we&#x27;re moving towards centralization generally (2) the importance of performance in video streaming.

Why would anyone ever use such a pointless thing?<p>Well, games are in many ways exactly that. They don&#x27;t really touch any part of the outside world or produce anything materially useful. They&#x27;re self contained. So why do people sink time into them even though they can&#x27;t get anything tangible in return? It&#x27;s because the process of using the software itself—playing the game—is so <i>intrinsically<\/i> enjoyable.<p>If you can learn a little bit of that and apply it to software that <i>does<\/i> do something useful, you can end up with the kind of programs that build devoted fanbases."],"time":["2020-08-29 00:23:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mooman219"],"id":[24309985],"kids":[24311143,24310781,24311109,24318393],"parent":[24309234],"text":["(Riot&#x27;s less than stellar history aside) I see these takes on game design a lot, and they&#x27;re interesting to see because everyone takes their own stance on how to construct a fun game from distinct smaller concepts.

Countries like China, the US, Australia, and the UK are of course interested in controlling the flow of information for political, ideological, military and other reasons. Therefore they are interested in controlling what the IETF does and how. That&#x27;s the nature of any big country or entity (including companies). E.g. Apple kicking competitors out of the app store is exactly the same kind of behavior. Whether that&#x27;s good or bad is a separate discussion.<p>The reason the internet exists at all is that it provided a way around &#x2F; relief from this level of control and that it allowed independent innovation to happen. In a way this was a happy accident because a lot of the funding for the R&amp;D behind this came out of cold war era defense projects which were very much not about the free flow of information. So, it would be a stretch that this is working as intended. But it was successful exactly because of that and the IETF brought together the right parties to ensure it kept enabling this.<p>More strict networks ultimately failed to compete because users and companies found that they needed to tap into this free flow of information. The fact that countries like China, Russia, North Korea, etc. are on the internet at all (grudgingly and with all the restrictions that they try to enforce) is because they need to be. They are also part of the world economy for the same reason. And as much as they&#x27;d like to tell others what the value of their own currencies should be relative to $, renminbi, euro, etc.; they have no choice but to leave that to market forces. Of course it doesn&#x27;t stop them from trying to influence and manipulate that. Nor does it stop anyone else from doing so. But ultimately it leads to either hyper inflation or people just swallowing their pride and accepting or paying in dollars for stuff they buy (e.g. oil) or sell on the international market. The internet is the same; it&#x27;s a take it or leave it kind of thing. Either you are on it or you are not.<p>It is a bit of neutral ground where mutually hostile entities looking to control, monitor, and manipulate each other can conduct their business (some of it very bad business). It works precisely because things like https prevent man in the middle attacks, certificates keep us honest (to some extent). All the other technical tooling the IETF standardized to ensure third parties don&#x27;t mess with private interactions between two parties trying to have some meaningful interaction is there for just that reason. Of course the tools are far from perfect and there&#x27;s an arms race between intelligence agencies to exploit loop holes, bugs, design flaws, etc. The IETF&#x27;s role is to address these issues, not to create more of them to enable authoritarian regimes to gain an edge over other nations or their own citizens.<p>So, DNS over HTTPS is a good thing and exactly the right thing for the IETF to be standardizing because it fixes a problem with what they previously standardized (i.e. DNS). It&#x27;s controversial because it takes away power from countries actively abusing that power. But the fact that others are exploiting protocol weaknesses in DNS is fundamentally a bug and not a feature. You could argue DNS over HTTPS is not a perfect solution or that better solutions exist but not that the role of the IETF is to enable the Chinese to have a say in what people (in or outside China) lookup via DNS. That&#x27;s not their role. If the Chinese, the Australians, etc. want to block people that choose to configure their browsers to use this (or browsers that do this by default), that is of course their good right.

I have personally implanted many animals of different species with similar apparatus as the ones described by neuralink, and published numerous papers in the field, including theoretical papers on neural activity coding and modeling. Here are my two cents about this. Sorry if it’s long, I m hoping that this will help provide perspective on the topic at hand.<p>As a scientist, the first thing that is striking is that this is another example of science by press conference. It’s probably why there is a lot of eye rolling in the field. No data has been released (including in the single author elon musk paper published a couple of years ago), and it is therefore impossible to judge the results independently, let alone have a scientific discussion about it.<p>First off, it should be noted that not much here is completely new. Chronic implantation of multielectrode arrays, with wireless recordings have been around for roughly 15 years. These arrays are able to record and stimulate. This is usually done in mice, in which space is even more limited than the pig. The number of contacts (i.e recording points) of 1000 is also on par with the current state of the art (see, e.g the neuropixel implants). The fact that neuralink managed to reproduce this seemingly from scratch is an impressive feat, but in no way is it novel. Dozens of labs around the world do this every day.<p>The issues with electrode recordings are to get close enough to each cell without damanging anything. If the contact is too far, the recording is polluted by other neurons, and one has to rely on blind signal separation to make out each cell. As a result in typical experiments, each electrode is manually positioned In the close vicinity of the neuron (think micrometers). This is a challenge with large arrays because each contact is not independant which reduces the yield. This likely happens here.<p>Another important problem arises with chronic implantantion. When you insert something in the brain, make it as thin as you wish the brain will not like it. There is going to be pushing and shoving of cells, and when the brain reset in position (within minutes) it will have moved. This requires fine tuning of each electrode’s position to keep it close to the neurons. More importantly, it will create a scar. Cells will die around it, the organism will try and isolate the foreign object. This takes weeks. This is the reason why, roughly speaking, no single cell has been recorded from for more than weeks (the record i believe is around 3 months): after a while the electrode is simply too isolated from the actual neurons to pick up a signal. There are endeavors around this, With other electrode materials, etc but neuralink does not do that. (Another really cool way to do chronic implant is with calcium imaging with small implanted confocal microscopes)<p>In addition, this is likely bad for the organism, and possibly not something you would want happen in your brain. BTW I believe that (in addition to size constraints) this is why they are doing studies on pigs now (although their neural activity is not well documented as opposed to mice&#x2F;rats or primates): it is commonly used as a model for human injuries.<p>Finally, do be aware that some humans are already implanted chronically in the brain with electrodes:\n- For parkinsons, in a specific, non cortical area. These electrodes can record and stimulate to alleviate crises\n- For hearing, it’s not stricto sensu in the brain (in the cochlear cavities) but it stimulates neurons\n- On the surface of the brain, with ecog electrodes mostly used during surgery but sometimes chronically for epilepsy diagnosis<p>In addition to these technical issues (which are serious enough, by the way), the claims made here are just sort of outlandish. Even in very well controlled laboratory conditions, there is very little evidence that it is remotely possible to “record” memories (let alone replay them). For the most part it is because we have _strictly no idea_ how _anything is encoded_ in the brain (there is even raging debate as to whether it “encodes” anything). (Sorry to my neuroscientist friends and colleagues, but we are not close to anything the layperson would qualify as “understanding what the brain does”, by a long stretch.) In addition, some of the less outlandish claims (e.g. controlling robotic limbs, etc) made by neuralink are things on which neuroscientists have been working on for decades. It’s not impossible for sure (as many of us argue in their grant proposals), but it is hard. And the plan presented by neuralink (more electrodes) is in no way innovative to an insider in the field. In fact, I doubt that it would get NIH funding.<p>TLDR there are many well documented issues with this endeavor that many people have been working on for decades. It’s frustrating that the general public be exposed to the uninteresting sugar coated sci fi version of an otherwise complex, nuanced and thus interesting field of science."],"time":["2020-08-29 15:30:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwawayneural"],"id":[24312167],"kids":[24312251,24312185,24313192],"parent":[24311152],"text":["(throwaway.)<p>I&#x27;ve been deeply interested in this field for a long time and BCIs specifically.

Every application is manually reviewed, so, uh, give me a few days.<p>Regarding &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; users; this question has been at the center of tilde.town since its inception. We&#x27;re a community first and a technological project second and encouraging a sense of belonging for users is our primary goal.<p>Certain users sign up to abuse resources; that&#x27;s easy to catch and deal with. Other users want to import the wider culture war aspects of the internet into our space, using a variety of tactics to provoke anger and discomfort.<p>I&#x27;m a generally conflict-avoidant person so this took getting used to. On the server, I had to learn to be willing to ban the persistent trolls. I want to provide a space where people can grow and mature as I was given on IRC and web forums back in the early 2000s instead of a place that throws people out at the first hint of having &quot;incorrect&quot; beliefs. Unfortunately this gave too much leeway to people that were consistently there to recreationally troll or promote genuinely hateful movements.<p>I became much more free with both temporary and permanent bans and made the signup intentionally cumbersome, wracked with nerves about the &quot;good&quot; folks who might be intimidated. I still have that anxiety, but ever since increasing the scrutiny on applications and doing more banning we&#x27;ve had a much more stable community environment.<p>I read a lot of books on digital communities; the Virtual Community by Howard Rheingold is a great starting point, but the book that helped me the most was Cyber Chiefs by Mathieu O’Neil. It helped me understand that all communities that manage to grow over time will hit an unsustainable point and either retract or dissipate.<p>Dissipation was a real possibility; for a long time I felt completely emotionally burned out by the town. I chose retraction though, and in retrospect, it was the right choice.<p>I&#x27;m still learning and thinking all the time about ways to encourage quieter or less technologically inclined people to sign up and make a home on the town and am always excited to talk about it or hear ideas.<p>(edited to clarify i&#x27;m not the only admin)"],"time":["2020-08-28 18:27:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["phre4k"],"id":[24302860],"kids":[24303112,24303159],"parent":[24300907],"text":["I run tilde.fun.

To get into any train station at all involved 3 levels of checkpoints, the first checkpoint started before you got to the plaza before the train station, so checking in took about 3 hours. In Kashgar the old city had checkpoints at every corner. The entire province only had 3G, the moment you cross over from neighboring Gansu your China Telecom signal dropped from 4G, so sending videos or even pictures is very difficult even on weChat, if you try to do it through a VPN the experience is even slower.<p>Some checkpoints were vigilant, but in my experience most were just bored. One checkpoint basically forgot to check my ID because I was seated all the at the back of a van. Young Uighur men or woman sometimes with a Han standing around or sitting at a chair with a desk in the middle of the street, writing down the names of everyone who crosses his &quot;stand&quot;.<p>What surprised me the most was that most of the guards manning the checkpoints in towns, highways, at gas stations (which involved a full car search in order to pull into) were Uighurs themselves. I get the impression you basically went to jail or joined the security apparatus, a modern variation on a old Chinese strategem of using barbarian to fight barbarian I guess.<p>The whole experience changed my perspective on human beings in general. At the end of the day, when I got back home the only conclusion I could come to wasn&#x27;t even about China or Chinese, if we look at the long span of human history the only thing I can arrive at is human beings in aggregate have a high tendency to do shitty things.

I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 4GB desktop kit awhile back and it sucked in the beginning. So I did what most people do with their pi; that is to leave it unused and unplugged like a Nintendo Wii.<p>Finally after the firmware fixes came about to improve cooling a few months ago and it was advised to just run the thing set up on its side, I decided to revisit running a &#x27;desktop&#x27; on it.<p>Raspbian, as most people know, is 32-bit and the idea is you can plug the microsd card it into any model of pi ever made and it&#x27;ll run. This sucks for performance and you can&#x27;t run a version of firefox made the past few years. Chromium isn&#x27;t an option on a 4GB ram system, it&#x27;s just not.<p>I eventually settled on using sakaki&#x27;s gentoo pi64 build and it was fairly painless to get running. Unfortunately, she hasn&#x27;t kept the build up to date and there&#x27;s a lot of weird customization she performed to get things running in the early days.<p>Anyways aside from having it run some compiles overnight and finding a new binhost to pull prebuilt stuff from, it runs pretty well. Actually better than my Intel Atom powered GPD Pocket (as it does not throttle ever). All the hardware works, and I&#x27;ve had no video issues since switching to the 5.4 kernel. It checks most of the boxes that OP asked for aside from the RAM being limited to 4GB. Unlike more powerful options on the market, it&#x27;s got a wide release and a low price point so developers will be working on it.<p>So yeah, there&#x27;s your AArch64 desktop you can buy today that everything works on for around $50. If you want to improve performance a bit more for IO, there&#x27;s SSD&#x2F;nvme adapters for it, and while I&#x27;m unsure about hooking into pci-e, the device has it...<p>Oh, and the audio thing is dumb as hell to complain about. Just output the audio through HDMI to your receiver and call it a day. What&#x27;s the big friggin deal that the desktop lacks a 7.1 analog output.

Much of the negative characterization of Galileo rests on two incorrect (but commonly believed) assertions:<p>&gt; Worse than this, [Galileo] placed the Pope’s words on the subject in the mouth of Simplicio, the simpleton, not a smart move.<p>Galileo probably did not intend to put the Pope&#x27;s words in Simplicio&#x27;s mouth. This is a charge that Galileo&#x27;s accusers leveled, but there&#x27;s no evidence for it. Galileo had Simplicio voice a common anti-heliocentric argument that didn&#x27;t necessarily have any particular association with the Pope.<p>&gt; The Inquisition now produced the written version of the statement that had been read to Galileo by an official of the Inquisition immediately following his interview with Bellarmino expressly forbidding the teaching of the heliocentric theory as fact.<p>This is a mischaracterization of the Inquisition&#x27;s 1616 injunction to Galileo. The author here makes it sound like Galileo was simply told not to treat heliocentrism as a fact, but that Galileo was free to entertain the hypothesis. This is a staple of Catholic apologia surrounding the Galileo affair, but it breaks down the second you actually look at the Inquisition&#x27;s statements on the matter.<p>First of all, the Inquisition officially declared heliocentrism to be incorrect and heretical:<p>&gt; Proposition to be assessed:<p>&gt; (1) The sun is the center of the world and completely devoid of local motion.<p>&gt; Assessement: All said that this proposition is foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts many places the sense of Holy Scripture, according to the literal meaning of the words and according to the common interpretation and understanding of the Holy Fathers and the doctors of theology.<p>&gt; (2) The earth is not the center of the world, nor motionless, but it moves as a whole and also with diurnal motion.<p>&gt; Assessment: All said that this proposition receives the same judgement in philosophy and that in regard to theological truth it is at least errouneous in faith.<p>So it&#x27;s clear that the Church was not simply saying, &quot;Hey, heliocentrism is just a hypothesis.&quot; They took a clear stand that it was incorrect and heretical, because it contradicted Scripture.<p>Next, this is how the Inquisition described their injunction to Galileo:<p>&gt; the same Most Illustrious Lord Cardinal warned Galileo that the above-mentioned opinion was erroneous and that he should abandon it;<p>&gt; [...] ordered and enjoined the said Galileo, who was himself still present, to abandon completely the above-mentioned opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing; otherwise the Holy Office would start proceedings against him.<p>This is the injunction Galileo was convicted of breaching in 1633. The injunction didn&#x27;t allow Galileo to treat heliocentrism as a hypothesis. It outright said that heliocentrism was false, and that Galileo was not allowed to teach or advocate it in any way whatsoever.<p>A third problem with this history is that it massively plays up Tycho&#x27;s model of the Solar system. Tycho&#x27;s model was obviously attractive to the Church, as a model that was able to match the data while keeping the Earth stationary at the center of the Universe. The problem with Tycho&#x27;s model was that it was horribly inelegant. Whereas the basic features of the motion of the planets and Sun across the sky (and sunspots across the disk of the Sun) all appear naturally in a heliocentric system, you have to put them in by hand as separate assumptions in Tycho&#x27;s model. It looked like an inelegant kludge put together in order to avoid a moving Earth.<p>Finally, in answer to the comment that Galileo&#x27;s downfall was his hubris, I&#x27;d say that his &quot;hubris&quot; was his belief that he might be allowed to make a forceful argument for the ideas he believed in, without being muzzled by the authorities.<p>1.

Inhibitory interactions between photoreceptor channels can decrease the signal-to-noise ratio and, therefore, may degrade the ability to detect subtle differences in image contrast (Kelber and Roth 2006); in dim light, a monochromatic visual system may be capable of discriminating a greater number of distinct reflectance spectra than a di- or trichromatic one, purely based on intensity differences (Vorobyev 1997). Color vision also degrades spatial acuity, especially when the spectral peaks of the photoreceptor channels are widely separated, because the signals from different cones types will reflect both spectral and intensity differences in the image (Roorda et al. 2001). For this reason, many animals rely predominantly on a single spectral channel to convey high-resolution achromatic spatial information (Lind and Kelber 2011), but of course any other spectral cone types are then taking up valuable retinal “real estate” that could otherwise be used to improve resolution in bright light (i.e., more receptors per degree of visual angle) and&#x2F;or reduce noise in dim light (i.e., through neural summation). Due to absorption, reflection, and scattering by the water itself and any dissolved or suspended substances, most aquatic habitats are characterized by low visual contrast. Moreover, many sharks are active both night and day and must therefore operate under a wide range of light intensities. It is likely therefore that sharks are often operating close to the threshold of their visual capabilities where the disadvantages of color vision circuitry might be detrimental to survival."],"time":["2020-01-10 16:32:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sbilstein"],"id":[22013563],"kids":{},"parent":[22012326],"text":["Quit your job and start something and holy shit you will come to realize the lotus is even more extreme than you thought.
