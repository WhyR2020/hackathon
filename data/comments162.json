This would allow for efficient 8 character &lt;=&gt; 32 bit conversions. Also, I think padding output to a multiple of 7 characters would be good, for similar reasons that it&#x27;s good for base-64. Now you can concatenate encoded streams like you could byte streams, and recover on decode. As multiples of 32 bits are so common, padding would be used little in practice. On input, it would be fine to accept unpadded base-24 sequences, but valid base-24 output should always pad to a multiple of 7 chars (excluding the blanks that should be just for readability and not significant otherwise).<p>However, I strongly dislike the arbitrary mapping between character values and base-24 digits.

From a very cursory reading there&#x27;s substantial jurisprudential churn around the notion of &quot;state actor&quot; - there are commonly accepted &quot;tests&quot; (which are sort of like thought experiments in philosophy), a substantial amount of common sense, and a large margin of error involved in determining whether or not a private entity is behaving in a way that might run afoul of restrictions placed on public actors.<p>It&#x27;s clear that there are cases where publicly owned resources are leased to private entities, and that &quot;speech&quot; happens over these resources (broadcast frequencies, ISP rights, publicly-owned domains, etc.).

Even relatively centrist subreddits, such as &#x2F;r&#x2F;Canada, have mods who ignore the published moderation rules of their own subreddit and do what they please.  If they don&#x27;t like a thread or post it just disappears, even if it violated no rule.  Reddit&#x27;s moderation system is designed to prevent users from seeing how it works.<p>The result is a cocktail of factors ripe for exploitation:<p>1. Some political subreddits have hundreds of thousands of users and are highly influential.<p>2. Mods have unrestricted power and virtually no accountability.  Users have no way to check that moderation is fair and unbiased.<p>3. Mods are unpaid and anonymous.<p>If Russia or China specifically set out to design a way to influence foreign politics, Reddit would be a fantastic platform to do just that.  If you can get mods in your pocket you can promote or suppress issues to suit whatever agenda you desire.<p>If Reddit were going to try to reign in the very worst of its mods, &#x2F;r&#x2F;The_Donald would probably be a good place to start.  Most reddit users view that forum as a cesspool that was quarantined for good reason.  However, the methods Reddit is using here are as opaque as that of the moderators themselves.  There has been no direct communication to users.  All the reporting on this &quot;purge&quot; is sourced from the purged moderators themselves.  While I have no sympathy for the mods of &#x2F;r&#x2F;The_Donald whatsoever, the way Reddit is operating here is indeed reminiscent of a totalitarian state&#x27;s propaganda ministry.  They permit much, but certain things bring the fist down hard, and it&#x27;s done in a way that most people are not meant to see.<p>If you rely on Reddit for political information then you are making yourself vulnerable to unknown influences.  While reddit is a fantastic resource in many ways, it&#x27;s simply not safe to rely upon for certain things.<p>With most traditional news sources now being owned by a small number of international conglomerates, there is a real need for alternative forums of political discussion.  Reddit, as it currently exists, should not be that forum.  However, with changes something like Reddit could be made to work.  Such a forum would need to make moderation much more transparent.  You can&#x27;t give mods the power to simply disappear that which they don&#x27;t like.  Users need to be able to examine the actions of moderators and question them.  Taking away the toy of unchecked, anonymous power would naturally make it harder to find mods, so they might actually have to be <i>paid<\/i>.  How you make money like Reddit does without volunteer moderators is a problem worth solving, as is finding a way to select moderators that can be trusted by the community they serve and not necessarily the company paying them."],"time":["2020-02-27 22:27:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hcarvalhoalves"],"id":[22439528],"kids":{},"parent":[22436619],"text":["Reddit is a private site, and everyone is free to host their own site with their opinions, right?

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.<p>169 pg PDF [last updated: February|25|2O2O]:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W2qxVc&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1S7T_kDv48E40eHzus6CTXHxcm0W...<\/a><p>Previously reported:<p>\\Wag The Dog: first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

I was part of the customer-facing account team (think: sales person, solution engineer, professional services team, and support team). The support team was often located in &quot;low-cost centers&quot; (such a euphemism!), such as India.  My Indian colleague was on the support team, where often they would spend long amounts of time diagnosing customer issues. I was a solution engineer &#x2F; &quot;CTO for the customer&quot; &#x2F; technical account manager-type role.<p>After some informal phone calls &amp; chats with my Indian colleague, I found out that he wanted to work more closely with the customer as a solution architect capacity, instead of just performing a more reactive support role. I was really excited to help him pursue this dream.<p>Here&#x27;s some of the the advice I&#x27;d offer to others on how to help &quot;level up&quot; an undervalued overseas colleague:<p>* Have regular 1:1s with people you find valuable, from all over the organization. In this case, I spent several 1:1 meetings with my Indian colleague, getting to know personal information (what area of India he was from, what the food&#x27;s like, what&#x27;s the work-life like, what do you do for fun - soccer, etc). This helped ME build up empathy for who he is, who he wanted to be.<p>* Find out unrecognized skills — I found out that my colleague used to tutor other students on math &amp; science when he was in university, and loved mentoring people, and was pretty good at ad-hoc presentations. I found out that our company often performs customer-facing classes about our products, to teach customers how to get the most out of the stuff they bough. My colleague was already so familiar with the product at a technical level, so I just had him practice presenting to me in a coaching session, where I&#x27;d pretend to be the customer. Later, I had him present a very focused topic to one of my trusted customers (it was something like, &quot;Top 10 diagnostic tips, tricks &amp; tools for Product X&quot; - showing off the various debug tools, logs, etc available). The customer LOVED it, and actually recorded the session to share around the company. I asked my customer to send me email containing feedback about my colleague&#x27;s presentation. I got glowing feedback from the customer, which I forwarded to a large internal distribution list - &quot;Check out this awesome presentation Support Engineer X did for Big Customer Y!&quot; (+cc&#x27;ing my colleague&#x27;s manager). The email thread got lots of good attention from &quot;high visibility&quot; people like sales &amp; management, who are happy to see examples of people &quot;delighting the customer&quot;. If you think about it, these people are 99% of the time dealing with the fall-out from issues, support escalations, and so on. Positive vibes are a welcome refreshment!<p>* Develop &amp; be recognized fro subject matter expert (SME)-like skills: Several of my customers were concentrated in a specific customer vertical (e.g. &quot;Media&quot;, vs &quot;eCommerce&quot;). My colleague didn&#x27;t recognize it at the time, but he worked primarily with several large customers which were all in the same customer segment. As a result my colleague was very knowledgeable in a couple product areas specific to that customer segment, and that segment&#x27;s challenges. I setup some internal &quot;lunch &amp; learns&quot; where 2 people would present some of the use cases for which their customer is using a product, and share out any advice, gotchas, etc. For my presentation - instead of traditionally having the customer-facing solution engineer discuss the technical parts of the presentation - I asked my Indian colleague to co-present with me. When presenting, I would deliberately defer to my colleague for certain areas - to reinforce credibility &amp; trust - but I also had him present the &quot;advice &amp; lessons learned&quot;-part. Afterwards, he got SO MUCH positive feedback from internal folks. I made share to socialize &amp; forward on this feedback around - greatly increasing the visibility of my colleague&#x27;s name, way outside of his immediate group. From that point on, my colleague was known as an expert in that area, and would commonly be hit-up to answer questions, do presentations for other customers, etc.<p>* Be recognized as a human being. This might sound obvious, but the unfortunate truth is that in many USA-based technology companies, overseas colleagues can be pretty invisible to the &quot;home office&quot;. They are often deliberately hired because their salaries can be lower; they are not physically present in the main offices where informal chit-chat occurs; culturally, there may be barriers like English language fluency, or even the spelling&#x2F;pronunciation of their names. I made a point to learn how to pronounce my Indian colleague&#x27;s name (and he even offered a &quot;Westernized&quot; nickname which he liked, which sounded like a cool rapper&#x27;s name, so we just rolled with it!). In our team, we often had to go onsite with customers (&quot;customer business reviews) - what we&#x27;re working on, how the product is being utilized, etc. I made a point to include a &quot;Your Team&quot; slide - and it included the names AND PHOTOS of the members of the team aligned with the customer. Instead of boring corporate photos, I included photos with actual personality (e.g. my Indian colleague scaling a rock wall, or him and his family at a birthday party in India). These photos would always invite questions &amp; comments from the customer, and my colleague would get some air time to talk about themselves. Really helped the customer get to know them (and avoid the pejorative, &quot;get me someone who actually speaks English&quot; attitude), and built trust both ways.<p>* Get endorsement from the people with the money. There were times when there were staffing changes, which might result in a customer-aligned support person to be moved to another customer. I would often give my customer a heads-up that there might be changes to the staffing - and I&#x27;d tell them, if you feel strongly about keeping Person X on the team aligned to you, please send me a &quot;strongly worded email&quot; asking to keep the person on your team and why. This would often result in the customer explaining how important person X is to their company, the impact they had to their business, etc. Very good stuff for internal managers to see.<p>THE RESULT<p>OK, so I&#x27;ve accidentally written a novel here, and you might be able to te tell I feel strongly about helping raise my colleague up. So what actually happened?<p>* I asked my Indian colleague to help out with a small professional service project for a customer, paired with a senior person advising along the way. This was outside of his typical role, and was OK&#x27;d by his manager (I made the sales person ask it, so it was more &quot;unrefusable&quot;). The project went very well, and again got great feedback from the customer.<p>* An &quot;associate&quot; solution architect role req opened up. Originally it was just for employees located in USA, not remote-friendly. I successfully petitioned that we TRY to do it as a remote-only position, and have my Indian colleague try it out for 6 months, and work with customers who already know &amp; trust him. It worked great. As a result, my colleague got a job title change and a very SMALL pay increase. But since he was on the &quot;revenue generating&quot; team now, he got tons more visibility around the organization - his name was tied to various &quot;high-five&quot; emails and such.<p>* About a year later, a solution architect position opened in Boston - again, not remote-friendly. I asked my colleague if he&#x27;d be interested in the job &amp; relocation - he said VERY INTERESTED, but that from his experience in India, it was nigh unheard of for the company to do that kind of transition. I made a point to speak to some of the highest level people I could find - basically telling the story of this skilled person who&#x27;s personally recommended by some of our most strategic customers, who&#x27;s looking to relocate for this role. &quot;What can we do to endorse this move and make it happen?&quot; I actually challenged an executive, I bet you can make this happen. It turns out, we got attention from enough of the right folks, and we were able to hire him in (along with all the legal &#x2F; H1B stuff required for that) to the Boston slot. He got a huge salary increase, moved to Boston with his wife. I don&#x27;t work at the company any more, but I stay in contact with my former colleague. He&#x27;s super happy, and just checking out his Facebook photos, it looks like he&#x27;s really into snowboarding &amp; microbrewing now :)"],"time":["2020-02-27 17:34:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tathougies"],"id":[22438469],"kids":[22438544],"parent":[22433069],"text":["You can&#x27;t do it.

In a cohort of 75 patients in Hong Kong, 85% had recurrent symptoms after initial improvement. The authors described a triphasic course with fever, myalgia early in week 1, and recurrent fever, hypoxemia, diarrhea, and shifting chest infiltrates in week 2. Twenty percent of patients progressed to ARDS during the third week of the illness. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate in 14 patients with relapse showed peak viral loads occurred at day 10 after onset of symptoms, suggesting that the late deterioration may be due to the host immune response rather than to uncontrolled viral replication.<p>(Granted, the Japanese woman&#x27;s symptoms disappeared for almost a month before reappearing.)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinicproceedings.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0025-6196(11)62689-X&#x2F;pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinicproceedings.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0025-6196(11)...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-27 06:25:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aazaa"],"id":[22430833],"kids":{},"parent":[22430691],"text":["Two things stand out:<p>1.

We simply push on the object when it is more massive, and pull back when it is less massive. The reaction forces during the two parts of the cycle will not be the same due to the mass fluctuation, so a time-averaged net force will be produced. This may seem to be a violation of momentum conservation. But the Lorentz invariance of the theory guarantees that no conservation law is broken.

They do make it more easy to deal with them.<p>It is the same story as with garbage collection. Garbage collection prevents some kinds of errors and in general makes it way more easy to deal with dynamic memory allocations. However, garbage collections does not mean you don&#x27;t have to think about allocation patters and object lifetime for example.<p>Go does make concurrency much easier by the tools it provides. Most importantly are goroutines, which are very lightweight, so within reasonable limits, you don&#x27;t have to be concerned about the number of goroutines you spawen - but as the example shows, you shouldn&#x27;t try to spawn more goroutines as there are file handles available to your process, if every goroutine allocates a file handle. Not only are goroutines very lightweight with small growable stacks, but as they are part of the language specification, the compiler can generate code which helps with scheduling, in most cases you have efficient cooperative sheduling, so thread-based preemption is less frequent.<p>On top of that, channels provide a very easy to use abstraction for communication between goroutines. There are a lot of use cases, where goroutines and channels give you very easy and safe concurrency. It does not save you from understanding concurrency issues and especially deadlocks. Which in a general sense is impossible to achieve, because to prove that a program is deadlock-free would require to prove that all goroutines return and that is equivalent to the halting problem, which is unsolveable.<p>It should also not be underestimated, that due to goroutines and channels being part of the language spec, these are very commonly used features. Concurrency is present in most Go programs. As a consequence, when one reads a lot of Go code, there will be plenty examples of their usage.

I was disappointed at just how <i>not<\/i> easy it was.<p>For example, Go has no generic support for atomic primitives, arrays, slices, or maps. It has sync&#x2F;atomic, but it&#x27;s not generic. I always reach for Uber&#x27;s atomic library, which has typesafe atomic wrappers such as atomic.Bool. They&#x27;re so common, you&#x27;d think a CSP-aware language would provide keywords declare things atomic:<p><pre><code>  var b atomic[bool]\n  if cas(b, false, true) {\n    ...\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n&quot;Classical&quot; Go didn&#x27;t have errgroups, contexts or cancellation. To build something truly robust, &quot;modern&quot; Go ends up involving all three (plus atomics, of course). That&#x27;s because almost all complex situations need to build what are effectively nested trees of goroutines that all need to quickly abort and unwind on errors or panics.<p>But as you use more and more of these primitives, your code (or at least my code) becomes more and more obscured by the layers of error-handling, cancel-detection, retrying, and so on. I really wish some of this was built into the language, especially cancellation. For example, channels don&#x27;t support contexts. So if you have a loop like this:<p><pre><code>  for evt := range taskCh {\n    handle(evt)\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n...then you have to rewrite it to support cancellation. So you have a few options. One is to select on both the channel and context:<p><pre><code>  for {\n    select {\n      case evt := &lt;-taskCh:\n        handle(evt)\n      case &lt;-ctx.Done():\n        return ctx.Err()\n    }\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBecause of this, you can no longer use a for loop. Immediately the code got more bloated and less readable.<p>Another option is to spawn a goroutine whose only job is to abort the channel:<p><pre><code>  go func() {\n    &lt;-ctx.Done()\n    close(ch)\n  }()\n  for evt := range taskCh {\n    handle(evt)\n  }\n  return ctx.Err()\n  <\/code><\/pre>\nThat&#x27;s a bit better (and you could move the for loop into its own function for clarify, without changing anything else). But it&#x27;s still worse than a simple for loop!<p>As a real-world example, here [1] is some code I&#x27;ve been working on lately. A controller starts N workers that need to process a task queue. If the controller is stopped, all the workers need to stop. So I use the pattern above. But I can&#x27;t use a for loop! That&#x27;s because I use a task queue abstraction that needs to support features that Go channels don&#x27;t.<p>I can&#x27;t use a for loop or select block to block on the task queue, because only channels support that. So that&#x27;s another problem with Go: Often, you can use raw channels as your data processing primitive if things are simple enough, but in practice, channels are best for coordination, and you have to build your own primitives — and yet, by building those primitives, you lose language expressiveness.<p>To address the concrete example, I&#x27;d love to do this instead:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F; Range over task queue (custom object with blocking\n  &#x2F;&#x2F; semantics), automatically cancel if ctx is cancelled\n  for task := range taskQueue with ctx {\n    handle(task)\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;atombender&#x2F;6bcff2c2d8fec32bc80ce1f57a8e61f6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;atombender&#x2F;6bcff2c2d8fec32bc80ce1f57...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-03 19:58:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fulafel"],"id":[24361367],"kids":[24361792,24361381],"parent":[24359650],"text":["What would a test for this look like, having a lot of processes?"],"time":["2020-09-03 08:37:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[24362905],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":{},"time":["2020-09-03 13:27:55"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["jacktang"],"id":[24361274],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":["try erlang!"],"time":["2020-09-03 08:24:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["The_rationalist"],"id":[24361453],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":["But with Kotlin flow it is!"],"time":["2020-09-03 08:56:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["apta"],"id":[24367037],"kids":{},"parent":[24359650],"text":["Using goroutines in golang is not dissimilar from threads in other languages (except that you can spawn much more of them), with all the downfalls and gotchas.
