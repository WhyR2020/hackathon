It&#x27;s always claimed it was so far ahead of everything else, yet it never demonstrated it. An airplane is much more than having a few air-worthy airframes. It&#x27;s being able to produce them reliably, service them and have them serve a real purpose on the battlefield. The Arrow achieved none of these goals.<p>To me it always sounded like misplaced patriotism surrounded by conspiracy theory: &quot;Look, our airplane was so far ahead that the program had to be shut down by the number one superpower because they felt threatened&quot; is ridiculous when you look at it more closely. From looking at it many years later it simply sounds like it had no purpose once the landscape shifted to ICBM and that potential buyers were not completely certain the program could survive on its own. That and the lax Canadian immigration policies probably scared the buyers as the company was apparently suspected by many to have already been infiltrated by communist nations. Judging how the plans got in someone’s basements, it sound they were not crazy to think that…<p>The really shameful chapter of Canadian aerospace is the CSeries yet It failed to get mainstream media coverage. Unlike the Arrow it reached production and had healthy sales numbers. It was Bombardier&#x27;s second clean sheet design (after the Global) to reach market and had the potential to be stretched to seat counts comparable to smaller 737 and A319.<p>President Trump levied tariffs on it and that&#x27;s what prompted a takeover by Airbus. What did the Trudeau government do meanwhile to protect it -and by extension Canada&#x27;s aerospace sector? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.<p>I&#x27;m confident of one thing, that Airbus has the full support of the European Governments (especially France) and that Boeing has the full support of the Canadian and American governments.

This decision, made for cold reasons of accumulating power for oneself and immediate cronies by herding public opinion, subsequently filters down through the system via funding grants, access to information, and the occasional revolving-door or literal kickback. It gets amplified because job holders and job seekers spot the opportunities and threats awaiting them through a simple agreement or disagreement: they therefore start conducting themselves accordingly in &quot;the way of the times&quot;, taking up the causes of the powerful with a bare minimum of overt messaging, hoping that they have backed a winning horse. This scramble happens across a broad range of industries, at many levels of the career ladder, and in seeking friends and relationships. There is a lot at stake in having &quot;right opinions,&quot; in fact. The way in which the country seems to &quot;come apart&quot; or &quot;come together&quot; on issues is therefore most reflective of disagreements at the top, and produces a four-year cycle in a political-cultural feedback loop tied to electoral results: the politics become the culture, disseminate through media, and in turn inform the politics of the next cycle.<p>The wedge that breaks the cycle, on an individual, issue-by-issue level, is good storytelling. Stories have the power to change self-narrative towards a direction independent of the structural narrative, and their fulfillment generally comes with some way of overcoming structural forces.<p>But as for why there&#x27;s the specific conflict we&#x27;re experiencing today, it&#x27;s pretty simple: it&#x27;s a local vs global conflict; when you globalize, there are some &quot;powerful losers&quot; at the local level.

We were on the runway, getting ready to take off, and I was doing my typical “I know the flight attendant said to turn all phones onto airplane mode but the whole policy is really quite inane so I’m just gonna keep texting until we take off and I lose service” thing, and a woman next to me decided I was an asshole and loudly told on me to the flight attendant, who was busy and didn’t hear her. So I did the only reasonable thing—I stealthily turned my phone onto airplane mode, re-opened my texts, and very out in the open, started typing a long text. The woman—my new eternal arch-nemesis—took the bait. She saw me texting and again got the flight attendant’s attention, saying, “Excuse me but he’s still texting.” When the flight attendant asked me to turn airplane mode on, I showed her my phone and calmly explained that airplane mode has been on this whole time and I just like to get some texting out of the way during flights—texts that don’t send until I land and re-connect to the internet. The flight attendant said, “Oh then that’s totally fine—my apologies.” I replied, “that’s okay,” and did a little “it’s amazing how awful people can be right?” sigh.

First, transmit, receive, completion, and event queue states are stored efficiently in block RAM or ultra RAM, enabling support for thousands of individually-controllable queues. These queues are associated with interfaces, and each interface can have multiple ports, each with its own independent scheduler. This enables extremely fine-grained control over packet transmission.

To move the colony from the box of dug up dirt to the enclosure, I coated the inside of the box with liquid Teflon (future cancer risk?) and slowly flooded the box, the only way out was a bridge to the new enclosure. Over the next ten hours the ants would compete, some moving eggs and larvae to the new enclosure, some moving them back to the queen. Eventually, when the rising flood had converted enough of the workers to the cause of the revolution, they will make an attempt to move the queen, which she and and a coiterie of anti-diluvianists would resist. The bridge to new enclosure would be a solid mass of writhing black (like Venom from Spider-Man). The queen, noticeably larger than the workers would repeat an escape and climb back over the living bridge to the steadily submerging dirt pile again and again, until eventually overwhelmed she was dragged by the masses to the new home, flailing and struggling all the way."],"time":["2020-01-08 21:37:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tboyd47"],"id":[21996278],"kids":[21997657],"parent":[21988924],"text":["Takeaways:<p>* It is meaningful to speak of animals having &quot;opinions&quot; but it&#x27;s not clear how those match up with human ones.<p>* Individual opinion is guided by a combination of random chance and direct perception.<p>* Individual bee opinions have low success rate, but group consensus of bees has an extremely high success rate.<p>* Opinions acquired via transmission are more weakly held than opinions acquired directly.<p>* Wrong opinions are held more weakly than right opinions.

Hard working folks trying to do the right thing (approx 20-50% of the people)<p>2.  People who are coasting and nominally meet whatever requirement for the position (some combination of experience and certification usually) who can barely get the job done, but they are friendly and don&#x27;t cause trouble (by getting in the way of the people who actually DO get something done) so no one bothers them and they get to collect a paycheck.  (50-80%)<p>Many from category one turn into category 2 as time goes by, because #2 is actually the optimal strategy.<p>Most companies also tolerate #2 because the client isn&#x27;t complaining and they are making their cut on the person&#x27;s hourly rate.  So everyone&#x27;s more or less happy and life goes on.<p>Also note that the distribution of people doesn&#x27;t significantly vary based on whether the employer is SDVOSB&#x2F;WOSB&#x2F;whatever.  However, the largest companies (like Accenture) do tend to have a higher proportion of #2s, but also a higher proportion of extremely charismatic &quot;relationship managers&quot; who flatter, gladhand, and overall stroke the client representative&#x27;s egos and fantasies to cover up for it.<p>The government contracting business has plenty of well-meaning, hard working professionals in it.  But there&#x27;s also a lot of not so much waste, fraud, and abuse, but &quot;skating by&quot; going on as well.<p>The main reason is due to the obstreperous rules, bureaucracy, stagnation, and old tech, the jobs pay above market AND tend to provide excellent work&#x2F;life balance.<p>Source:  I&#x27;ve been a gov&#x27;t employee, then worked in contracting, went to private sector, now back in contracting.

Lidar simplifies the informational inflow, which reduces computational cost. But the computational cost and practicality of processing optical data onboard has changed radically, it is now practical and affordable (both due to substantially improved software and new&#x2F;cheaper hardware).<p>Keep in mind humans use &quot;optical sensors with parallax&quot; (i.e. our eyeballs). Cars are already optimised around that assumption (e.g. headlines to improve visibility in the visible light spectrum). Lidar still has advantages, but also a bunch of drawbacks (like dispersion and sunlight disruption), optical sensors do too (e.g. glare) but they&#x27;re a lot more intuitive for humans because we share them.<p>I guess what I am saying is: Are you betting on better sensor tech (Lidar) or better computational tech (Optical)? I think Lidar will hit a ceiling after the &quot;easy wins&quot; have been consumed (and we&#x27;re approaching that point), whereas optical has no real ceiling (even over and above human&#x27;s innate abilities). With optical you can understand the world as humans visibly see it, Lidar sees the world fundamentally differently, seeing both less (bad) and more (good).<p>Obviously it is a somewhat false choice, but if people are investing dollars into development of both techs it is a choice that matters."],"time":["2020-01-08 19:57:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stevehawk"],"id":[21997188],"kids":[21997380],"parent":[21994002],"text":["I&#x27;m not a big hardware nerd,  how do this and that $16,000 one from earlier this week compare?

That strikes me as predatory.<p>People who are technical and don’t have creativity to come up with new ideas should be employees, not creators. People who can come up with ideas but cannot manage need managers. All those who cannot come up with any of the above should be investors.<p>It is a cunning trick that I observed in the past decade in the start up scene. Instinctively I don’t trust anyone who says that ‘ideas are worthless’.<p>Perhaps this is the reason why many start ups fail. There is no creator or domain expert. I see that in Agtech. The best Agtech companies are those who have some connection to farming. A handful of them are technical.<p>Even those who are technical do not work in the field. It is the uneducated non technical Joses and Marias who are immigrant labour that do all the work that needs to be automated.<p>They are not technical. They barely know English. But by not including those who Agtech is seeking to replace with tech and robots at the table, they set themselves up for failure.<p>I have a small farm and a little technical, but Ag robotics is multiple platforms. As a small farm owner who also has to keep the farm financially solvent and someone who also does manual work that needs to be replaced, I can spot right away how many of the Agtech companies will fail. And most of them will fail. The ones that will make it are those who have someone in the team with in-field experience.<p>It’s this non technical team that will come up with the best ideas because they know where they need help desperately. This is also why Europe will likely succeed first in Agtech than America. Because they have technical expertise as well as the idea team.<p>I hope those who dismiss ideas will reconsider. An idea is like a possibility. There are many ways it can fail and a narrower path to succeed. Only the person who came up with the idea will know the limitations and by excluding them, the chances of failures are multiplied.<p>As an aside: YC is also guilty of this dismissive attitude. This is also why most start ups will fail. Failure is not necessarily a bad thing but failed start ups are graveyard of what may have succeeded. It’s an enormous waste of space and resources. The only upside is redistribution of capital and creation of jobs. Hence even failed start ups and bad ideas that get funding is not necessary a bad thing. If we don’t have jobs, I guess there won’t be a way to employ the hordes of STEM educated young people pouring out into the world as they come of age."],"time":["2020-01-09 23:18:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zekehernandez"],"id":[21992157],"kids":{},"parent":[21991260],"text":["I love thinking of video game ideas, so much so that I made a website to publish the ideas in a rather fleshed out manner: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativeowlet.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativeowlet.com&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-08 16:22:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gitgud"],"id":[21996306],"kids":{},"parent":[21991260],"text":["This mailing list share ideas with an execution plan too.

They teach a great deal at the federal courses on how to conduct interviews of Suspects, Victims, and Witnesses, but almost nothing is detailed on how to take notes.  When I conducted these interviews (especially ones that aren&#x27;t recorded or when I&#x27;m unlikely to have a chance to re-interview someone, such as with Suspects and Victims), I found that I really needed a methodology of note-taking that allowed me to set aside questions to ask when the time was right.  For example, if a sexual assault victim is describing the events that led up to the assault, and mentioned that the suspect sent a message from his phone just before doing something else, I would want to know (to the best of her knowledge) what type of phone it was, but I&#x27;m not going to stop her in the middle of telling me the story just to ask that question.<p>Interestingly, I basically started doing something extremely similar to this system (although, apparently backwards).  My notes always included a line separating my main notes on the left from my key details and questions on the right, with the right column only about 3&quot; wide.  Ordinarily, I would leave 2 or 3 blank lines after each question so I could fill in the answer the interviewee provided and it reminded me to look for any blank space on my notepad before ending an interview (or, in the case of suspects, before asking more direct questions that may lead to suspect to end the interview before I got the chance to get answers to more minor questions).  Ofter, my &quot;summary&quot; section would be extremely short and just describe larger timeline changes, like if a report spans multiple days or locations, I would mark the end of one incident in the bottom few lines of the page and jump to a new page to take notes about the next incident.<p>I&#x27;m very curious if this methodology is used by a lot of others as well (especially in law enforcement), or if I just happened to find one with remarkable similarity to Cornell&#x27;s."],"time":["2020-01-08 21:11:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nradov"],"id":[21992815],"kids":[21993305,21993012,21994493,21994593],"parent":[21989063],"text":["I question the value of taking notes at all.

After the nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered the “Atomausstieg,” the exit from nuclear energy once and for all. Why? Because, as Ms. Merkel put it back then: “The residual risk of nuclear energy can be accepted only if one is convinced that — as far as it is humanly possible to judge — it won’t come to pass.” After Fukushima, Ms. Merkel, a trained physicist, was no longer able to believe that a nuclear disaster would not occur. That there was a catastrophe even in a high-tech country like Japan made her change her mind.&quot;<p>This article dismisses nuclear power as &quot;not safe&quot; with nothing more than the decision of Merkel to justify it.  Yes, Merkel has a background in physics, but she made that decision as a politician.  It&#x27;s an unfortunate truth that science is rarely the first consideration in political decisions.<p>Merkel&#x27;s decision ignored the truly extraordinary circumstances of the Fukushima disaster, which was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami that, each individually, exceeded the design parameters of the reactor, which was 40 years old at the time of the disaster.  Updated studies indicated the reactor was vulnerable to tsunami, but were ignored.  Repeatedly.<p>The reactors of 40-50 years ago can indeed be unsafe if operated poorly (e.g. Chernobyl) or if necessary threat mitigation is totally ignored. Newer designs are safer, and older designs can be made safer if people don&#x27;t bury their heads in the sand about necessary updates.<p>Ultimately, nuclear reactors are designed and operated by humans, and mistakes do happen.  However, the fact is that the Fukushima disaster has killed fewer people in total than coal power kills every year under normal operating conditions.<p>Is Germany paranoid about nuclear power?

Imo, there are 2 major reasons for the current stance:<p>1. Chernobyl: After the disaster in 1986 the anti-nuclear movement gained massive traction. The radioactive cloud spread all the way to West Germany and warnings had to be issued (mushrooms, venison, crops, ...). It was a real turning point, since everyone was made aware of the concerns. [1]<p>2. &quot;Endlager&quot;-discussion: The search for a permanent nuclear waste deposit was&#x2F;is a political shitshow. The trial run at Asse (in the 70s) failed: We are currently getting all canisters out of there, after they found contaminated sludge and flooded areas. [2] Further, the decision to select Gorleben as one possible locations was mostly political. The whole process is politically loaded, expensive and devoid of any scientific reasoning. [3]<p>The anti-nuclear decision has been made years before Fukushima  for imo valid concerns. The &quot;latest&quot; reactor in Germany went online in 1989, and the decision to phase-out was made in 2002.

It is considered harmless because it rises to the upper atmosphere and will not come into contact with any life. There is now several million times as much KR85 as in 1945, at the start of the Atomic Age.<p>KR85 is a radioactive gas, and radioactive gases consist of charged particles. When charged particles enter a magnetic field, they migrate to the poles. The earth is a giant magnet, so the KR85 ends up equally at the North and South poles. There it interacts with the charged stream entering the earth&#x27;s atmosphere from space, known to astronomers as the Wilson Current, a part of the Wilson Circuit, which keeps the earth charged up.<p>The discharge portion of the Wilson Circuit is lightning, most of which is in the belt of constant thunderstorm activity that circles the earth at the Equator. As the inflow of charge at the poles weakens, so does the amount of lightning decrease everywhere on earth.<p>And lightning is essential to plants. Plant life cannot use the nitrogen in the atmosphere unless it is &quot;fixed&quot; into compounds, which can be done by two processes: certain types of bacteria, and lightning strikes.<p>There are some plants that have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria on their roots and do not need lightning, but many plants, especially in tropical forest areas where there is normally a lot of lightning, are lightning-dependent, and cannot get enough nitrogen to thrive without lightning.<p>So the widespread use of nuclear power is decreasing the amount of lightning all over this planet, and causing deterioration of forests, especially in the tropics, from nitrogen starvation.<p>And that is the worst form of climate breakdown currently happening. The mass extinction of countless species of plant life all over the world is much more significant than all other effects of climate destabilization combined.<p>The increase in both frequency and severity of storms in the temperate and polar zones is also being augmented by the build-up of charge at the poles from KR85.<p>The strong tropical storms that form along the Equator are highly-charged systems. How far they travel from their birthplace along the Equator toward the poles is determined by two factors: The strength of the charge of the storm itself, and that of the pole that is attracting it. As KR85 builds up at the poles, these strong tropical storms are drawn farther from their normal home in the tropics and sub-tropics toward the poles, bringing with them tropical heat, as well as more frequent and stronger storm activity to areas not formerly accustomed to such weather.<p>The observations of decrease of ice in the polar zones and more frequent and severe storms in the polar and temperate regions is only one more symptom of the build-up of charge at the poles caused by radioactivity from the nuclear industry.<p>Another side-effect of particular consequence in the Arctic is the damaging ultra-violet radiation that has been observed reaching the surface of the earth from above. It seems to be from beyond the atmosphere, and is conventionally thought to be from outer space, and reaching the surface because of a thinning of a filtering layer of ozone, but is actually being produced in the upper atmosphere by the interaction between the influx of charge of the Wilson Current, and the layer of KR85 that now exists there.<p>The conventional explanations being thought up to explain what is happening in the atmosphere fall far short of the mark. So far, none of the mainstream scientific community has dared to mention the possible role of radioactivity in causing the breakdown of the climatic regime that has prevailed for the last 5,000 years or so. A large part of the reason for this glaring omission is the lack of any mechanism understood by orthodox meteorology that could account for the observations.<p>There IS a well-worked out theory that explains all the manifold observations, and is supported by enough solid evidence to be convincing to anyone who examines it objectively. But the history of this theory, along with the personal reputation of it&#x27;s originator, ensures that it will not be examined at all. That, however, is a defect in the education of the scientific community, not a defect in the theory."],"time":["2020-01-08 19:04:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["goatinaboat"],"id":[21993421],"kids":[21994472,21993578,21993780],"parent":[21992958],"text":["<i>Nuclear energy, to start with, is ultimately not safe<\/i><p>Solar kills more people than nuclear per watt, so that’s the reporter’s personal agenda talking<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;494425&#x2F;death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;494425&#x2F;death-rate-worldw...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-08 18:15:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DasIch"],"id":[21993442],"kids":[21993774,21993900,21993997],"parent":[21992958],"text":["Let&#x27;s assume for a moment there would be no opposition to nuclear in Germany.

For starters, there’s no evidence that military personnel would follow even a lawful order to launch nuclear weapons, especially if there was no evidence of an existential crisis taking place. The only example I can think of in history is the Soviet submarine that was given orders to launch nukes, if it was engaged by the US, during the Cuban middle crisis. Well it was engaged by the US, and the officers onboard refused to use them. The president doesn’t have a button that launches nukes, and I can’t see anybody following an order to, in absence of the US being overrun or hit with a nuke first.<p>Secondly, I can’t see it ever being a good tactical decision. The highest yield conventional bombs are on-par with the lowest yield nukes. If you want to launch a single massively destructive device, there’s already better options. If you want to target an underground facility, then weapons designed to target underground facilities are going to do a better job than just scaling up the yield anyhow. If you’re just looking for a massive effect on target, then a barrage of smaller weapons is going to do a better jobs of that anyway, and do so more reliably.<p>Finally, even if you find the perfect tactical use case, it could never make sense strategically. Using a nuke of any size will provoke the maximum response from any potential adversary, regardless of whether they have any stake in the conflict to begin with, and will deter any hope of support from our allies.

Depending on your use case the tradeoff might not be worth it.<p>On the other hand, I would argue that the idea of a build is an entirely valid and useful construct, it merely represents a point in state space against which test cases (and production) must run. It is impossible to get away from that state. Some tools can make managing it easier, and some make it virtually impossible to manage.

I think this can work really well, but only under certain constraints:<p>- You have a very clean separation between code and data (in HyperCard, the data is the set of cards and backgrounds, and the contents of all the fields; the code is the event handlers attached to each object).<p>- The data format is stable.<p>- There are clear checkpoints where your data is stable and no code is running.<p>Those are <i>sometimes<\/i> the case in <i>some<\/i> applications. Arguably, all of them are nice properties and therefore good targets to aim for.<p>But there are plenty of normal scenarios that don&#x27;t meet those conditions:<p>- You have an expensive long-running task. Trying to change the code half-way through is a fool&#x27;s errand. You need to re-run it from the start, and&#x2F;or find a way to split it up into smaller steps. Unit tests and a good incremental build system are your friends here.<p>- You&#x27;re working on the core data structures. Again, trying to update the code while all the data is still in memory is a bad idea. Just use a good build system and try to make the compilation and startup time as fast as possible.<p>- You&#x27;re changing the navigation system, so the user&#x27;s current position in the app won&#x27;t make sense any more. You&#x27;ll need to reset back to the front page (or whatever).<p>For that last one, &quot;apply changes&quot; in C# or Android Studio will generally do the right thing, even though those are mostly traditional build systems.<p>There isn&#x27;t really a hard distinction between a build system and live coding, it&#x27;s a spectrum. I&#x27;d argue further that a build system (in the traditional &quot;make&quot; fashion) is more fundamental, because you can achieve anything with a build system (even if it&#x27;s tedious and inefficient) whereas some tasks are just intractable with live coding.

Read through the book actively, taking notes.<p>4. “Steelman” the argument, reworking it so that you find it as convincing and clear as you can possibly make it.<p>5.

I build hardware for fun. I also travel, go to church, listen to music, go to concerts, cook, volunteer for NGOs, participate in CouchSurfing, ride a bicycle, take photos, play games, study, parapente, ski, hike, and swim for fun, and somehow even have the time to sit back and watch a beautiful sunset when there is one. I don&#x27;t watch TV, drink, rarely watch movies or YouTube, though sometimes play AoE.<p>Ideas come all the time, usually from those other areas of life. When I have a new idea, it makes a mess all over my browser tabs and desktop while I read all about how to implement it (data sources, existing projects). The idea consumes my thoughts. I talk about it to people who I meet. When I should be praying, I&#x27;m thinking about the algorithm. The obsession is probably rather weird to non-technical people, like my long-distance girlfriend.<p>If I&#x27;m in the office but haven&#x27;t got any pressing deadlines for company work, I&#x27;ll do some coding on my side project. It&#x27;s not usually something that can make money, though it is usually educational. I want to be able to publish it on my Github, although I often procrastinate writing the documentation. Some companies (e.g. Google) say that they support innovation, but they want to own all my intellectual property, and that means that I&#x27;m not allowed to pursue ideas while working there. I&#x27;ve avoided such companies for specifically that reason.<p>When I finally do write it up, my software Show HN will sometimes get onto the Hacker News front page, or hardware on Hackaday. Very rarely, someone might see that and offer me a job. I suppose that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve written less documentation these days; I&#x27;m waiting until I hear a visa result and then I&#x27;ll know about which country I should be working in.<p>My ideas don&#x27;t make money. I&#x27;m probably the only user. Yet in practice, side projects have helped me build up a code base that I can use for all programming tasks, including at work.<p>In case you&#x27;re wondering what kind of ideas these are, here&#x27;s a small sample from the last year:\nEspUSB WiFi keyboard manufacturing, 12V and mains to USB adaptor inside a car form factor, WiFi to VGA on an ESP8266 for PPT slides, Fondant (JavaScript bookmarklet to load pdfjs library to open a PDF file to run a self-contained web app stored as PDF attachments), MySpace Dragon Hoard by country&#x2F;language&#x2F;genre for learning languages through music, a Chinese&#x2F;English chatbot based on song lyrics to automatically write love letters.<p>I don&#x27;t judge people who only code as work; they&#x27;re better at making money than me, and are definitely more likely to be promoted to management and have a good career. All these other things inspire me in a way that LeetCode just doesn&#x27;t. Therefore other people get interviews much more easily, and know how to sell themselves. I&#x27;m bad at front-end design, so as a portfolio most of these look like rubbish. When I have a job (like now!), I don&#x27;t need to worry about food and shelter, and the rest of things in life mean I&#x27;m quite happy, really. Being contented means I&#x27;m not interested in the &quot;hustle&quot;, so I&#x27;ll never make as much money and I know it, but that isn&#x27;t important to me. I hope this resonates with some other passion-programmers, and I&#x27;d like to hear any opposing or similar perspectives."],"time":["2020-01-08 12:09:53"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DERRICKBRIAN"],"id":[21996485],"kids":{},"parent":[21989718],"text":["IF YOU WANTS TO JOIN  ILLUMINATE BROTHER HOOD MAKE SURE YOU&#x27;RE LOYAL AND SERIOUS MINDED INDIVIDUAL.\nI wanna give a concise testimony  of how I became rich and famous\n Read and pay keen interest.....\nWe all underestimate the opportunity that comes across us in life, waking up to see a testimony like this is a blessing no man can pay for.

Ultimate truth and provisional truth.

Essentially bullshitting them.<p>There is also comparison of his teaching to a raft to cross the river. Teaching has utility value to get people across, it&#x27;s not useful to carry it after the river is crossed.<p>Another thing in Buddhist thinking is consideration to how different people understand things and what they need psychologically. There are people who just want to hear from authority figure what to do and they believe it and just do it (maybe majority of people). You must teach them in a that way.<p>As a modern interpretation of this, my  teacher told me that the point of his public talks  is to tell people  something that makes them to attempt  meditation seriously until it &#x27;clicks&#x27;.

Their natures are diametrically opposite when it’s practiced privately vs publicly.<p>All forms of evangelism is advertising. Which brings up the question, why?<p>I have a theory that the reason religions&#x2F;spirituality are actively encouraged to be spread because mob control and crowd control is necessary in a complex world. Being ‘good’ and ‘righteous’ is about creating homogenous societies who all play by the same rules and the reason these mind virii distinguish from each other with practices and icons and beliefs and structures is to be able to recognize and know ‘the other’.<p>Someone in the past said, religion is the opiate of the masses. It isn’t so anymore..it is more like pharmaceutical drugs prescribed by your doctor after a very heavy deductible. I can keep going on with this analogy but it is too predictable. So..please fill in the blanks yourself.<p>The notion is that we should be ‘good’ and easily recognized as ‘one of the tribe’, as it were...and speak the same language. It keeps the peace. Ironically, with the advent of monotheism, not so much anymore. Which begs the question, is the hack..that we know as religion&#x2F;spirituality...outdated? Is it corrupted to the point that the system is attacking itself?<p>Certain themes are universal and don’t need institutionalized religion. I will give an example of forgiveness.<p>Last August, there was a hit and run case and a man died while riding his bike to work. The driver of the car that hit him took off. Last week, he turned himself in..<p>An overwhelming majority of the (religiously diverse) community was glad that he did and almost all of them thought that he did the right thing, he must face his punishment and that he will be at peace now that he doesn’t have to live with the guilt anymore. And then all said he should be forgiven. They never said that he should be let go and avoid imprisonment or trial. But then said that they forgave him.<p>I found that fascinating. Forgiveness is important. And promoting forgiveness is more important.<p>Most of them have children. They were using the same technique parents use with kids. Punishment without forgiveness will make sure that the future mistakes will never be confessed.<p>No punishment can be delivered without chances of redemption. No rules will be followed without the threat of punishment. I understood religion better at that moment. In a sense religion is for the order and well being of society. It is not for personal spiritual ascension. Not the version of religion with rules and strict observances. And publicly displayed.<p>Like the tail of a peacock. I don’t mean to make religion vain or vain glorious. To the contrary, I think we need such performances.<p>My point is that current state of religion is a mixed bag. Some are obviously failing. You can see this in the world arena where there is communal&#x2F;sectarian violence and religious unrest. The hack has failed.<p>I suspect it is mostly due to its commoditization and emphasis on the reward system. There are no more sacrifices for the larger community. It is transactional.<p>My 2c. It was an informative read. Congregations are important to any faith. Religion or politics or family or celebration..all of them require assemblage of like minded people. They assemble because they agree to the rules. For some it is a trial run. Others subscribe to it. Others are initiated and adopt it from their families of origin.

This only works because there is more diversity in roads and streets. My commute in Germany included an area that literally had a speed limit of &quot;walking speed&quot; a main road that had 70km&#x2F;h and of course the Autobahn worth 160km&#x2F;h. These streets and roads were much more clearly differentiated and made a clear trade off between prioritizing pedestrians, playing children and cars.<p>I think some European cities got this inadvertantly, since streets and roads suited for cars had to be fitted on Street the fact.

But there&#x27;s plenty of pitfalls with RSUs too.<p>1) From an investment risk perspective, your personal livelihood is already significantly tied to the company because you rely on the company for a salary.  Holding a significant chunk (relative to your total investments) of stock in your company as well adds to that risk.<p>2) Unless you&#x27;re a C-suite exec, your actions will likely have no direct impact on the stock price.  And obviously, insider trading is illegal.  That means holding your own company&#x27;s stock has no fundamental advantage over holding stock of a company you don&#x27;t work for.  If that&#x27;s the case, you&#x27;re better off picking stocks based on actual performance and eliminate the personal bias.<p>3) You can sell your RSUs once they vest in order to diversify, but you have to wait a year after vesting or short term gains tax will apply to any gains post-vesting.  So, it might be advantageous to wait a year if you don&#x27;t plan to sell immediately upon vesting.  Also, with some companies, a portion of your shares will be surrendered back to the company to cover income tax on the shares.<p>4) From a tax filing perspective, RSUs and ESPPs can be a PITA.  In my experience, tax software and general tax filing services often don&#x27;t know how to correctly record the cost basis, which means you end up getting taxed twice if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>5) When cash is tight, companies might lean more heavily on RSU-based compensation if they can&#x27;t afford raises or cash bonuses.  You need to make sure your company is giving you what you need.<p>6) The golden handcuff effect.  You want to leave for a better job, but you&#x27;ve got a nice chunk of RSUs that haven&#x27;t vested yet and could be worth quite a bit in just a couple more years.  Is that new job worth the opportunity cost of giving up those shares?  For companies that award RSUs as part of yearly performance reviews, you&#x27;re pretty much always going to have some RSUs that are 3 years out from vesting.  It&#x27;s just difficult weighing the potential value of RSUs vs a new job&#x27;s salary&#x2F;benefits and whatever reasons you wanted to jump ship in the first place.

Regardless of who you are, holy hell some people WILL steal your work for their own.<p>My first internship manager in late 1980&#x27;s took my work and patented it as his own! I found out about it years later when I was hired permanently. I confronted him and he told me interns weren&#x27;t allowed to patent. I learned this was false years later, but he had already left the company.<p>In a second instance, that same internship, I also wrote some code that was published in a corporate whitepaper and the motherfucker replaced my name with his in the comments. Different guy, same company.<p>I don&#x27;t think making it public would have mattered because I was just an intern and we were treated as shit, but thinking back on it now makes my blood boil because both the patent and the doc are public record (USPTO) to this day. Maybe today I would have a fighting chance as an intern.<p>If you have a good idea, make sure top brass know it came from you. There&#x27;s no guarantee it won&#x27;t be stolen, but it gives you a fighting chance the more people know that you did it.<p>Heh. 30+ years later and I&#x27;m grumbling about it again. lol.<p>Also, FTA:<p>&gt; Avoid everyone who is really enthusiastic about you being a woman.<p>I always found it creepy how some guys fall all over themselves to remind the only woman on the team that she is the only woman on the team. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;yay, thanks for noticing...??&#x27; but ... hmmm...<p>I&#x27;m guessing it is just a guy new to workplace diversity, and give him some slack. In my experience, it is usually older men (50-60&#x27;s) who are getting the swing of the new generation of &quot;sexism is bad, mmm&#x27;kay&quot; and really want to show they are trying but know they were inherently trained by society to think in 80&#x27;s&#x2F;90&#x27;s way about diversity.
