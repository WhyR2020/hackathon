And like every case of abuse, a child is never at fault.<p>This is accurate, first and foremost before what I say could be interpreted as shifting the blame from these perverts. But one thing not mentioned in this article is why an 11 year old would be on the internet at all. I think we need to have a serious think about whether it makes sense to expose a child to everything to world has to offer, unguided, before they&#x27;re <i>much<\/i> older than 11.<p>There was a lot of optimism about the internet, or more specifically the web I guess, as it developed.

Is that truly the case? I&#x27;d argue not, misinformation is rife, could any child really be expected to critically examine this stuff unguided? I think we were better with something like encarta to be completely honest.<p>Social media is an abomination, I&#x27;m not convinced many adults have the faculties required to use it in a non destructive way. How many of us have parents that seem to be completely radicalised by one Facebook group or another? We know that because they won&#x27;t shut up about it, so what&#x27;s it doing to a bunch of kids that don&#x27;t share what they&#x27;re reading with their parents? God knows.<p>This is all before we admit that children can be really quite cruel, which gets magnified by them not actually seeing the result of their words&#x2F;actions. Putting a screen in-between the bullying is a sure fire way to make it much worse. Couple that with the isolation that&#x27;s felt by this fake &#x27;social connection&#x27; and its a recipe for disaster.<p>I really worry about the future if our education systems can&#x27;t be retooled to teach children critical thinking, and if we don&#x27;t start to change the way we look at the internet to realise its way more dangerous than we expected it to be."],"time":["2019-12-14 20:02:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["atq2119"],"id":[21790599],"kids":[21790794,21791668],"parent":[21790090],"text":["I appreciate that they included real examples of conversations they captured in the article, as disturbing as that may be.<p>A lot of the conversation around sexual predation, especially around child porn, is problematic from a democracy point of view: You get authorities asking for more power (usually, more draconian surveillance laws), without showing evidence of what it is that they are supposedly fighting -- and of course, nobody wants to ask too strongly for such evidence being shown, lest they be accused of being a potential predator as well.

It happens every now and then, but it’s quite rare that some solitary programmer or duo whip up an os library or product that snags as much of the market as an os project managed by one of the big dogs.<p>Burnout on the part of solitary maintainers of non-corporate backed os projects is also quite a real and problematic issue.<p>The adoption of the MIT license, I’d wager, borders on a cultic practice these days and is rarely the outcome of long deliberation on the appropriate license selection on the part of a project maintainer (excluding of course the big companies, whom are incredibly savy and smart about this because they have lawyers).<p>Os projects also have, generally speaking, horrible support. If an os library isn’t small enough or written in such a way that I can read the source and understand it in about a day and a half, maximum, I won’t use it. The adoption of certain libraries also trends toward tribal practice and ritualistic behavior. People select librires based on their popularity or a personal incentive (these two motivations merge, since a thing’s being popular stirs a personal incentive to learn it in order to be more valuable on the market, see react et al.) more oft than they do based on a thorough technical assessment.<p>All in all, os has benefited massive corporations much more than it has benefited solo programmers or users. Tbh, I would not be surprised if a world w&#x2F;o open source actually would have given us more diversity in the tech market—spawning several boutiques of software houses churning out small-scale bespoke, but closed source, tech instead of massive corps who not only use os as a “good grace” but also as a tool to create yet another relation of dependency between themselves and users or other companies—i.e. gain more power.<p>OS’s one invoiable benefit is that it has significantly liberated the auto-didact—its a huge boon for those that can’t learn through other channels...but even this benefit comes with wrinkles.

In my experience, those people – whom I respect – form communities which are oriented around piracy, and pretty separate from the open source world.

Also maybe if you&#x27;re a politician looking to score some jobs for your district.<p>The basic economic lever is simple with implications that go far: it costs more to process a returned good than the value one could accrue from reselling it because returned goods need to be processed three times while regular goods only need to be processed once. If 3% of your shipped goods are returned you are making a healthy profit. If 10% are returned you are breaking even. If 20% are returned you are going under. Goods are usually manufactured at 25% their retail cost and businesses have overhead that profit needs to cover.<p>A lot of the return cost is additional labor and shipping. If you can minimize transport (sort returns at local factories&#x2F;DCs rather than shipping back to China) and minimize cost of processing returns with low-skill labor (say supplementing with high resolution cameras&#x2F;scales&#x2F;machine learning inspection by comparing your &#x27;returned&#x27; good against thousands of known good versions of your good) one could tackle this.

It&#x27;s called the shell game.[1]<p>The aim of the &quot;game&quot; is to bet money on which shell the ball is under after the shells are mixed up.  It&#x27;s played in many other parts of the world, and though in the old days was played with walnut shells, these days they usually use plastic bottle caps, match boxes, or metal cups.  Instead of the traditional ball, these days they usually use a piece of chewing gum or wad of aluminum foil.  Here&#x27;s a video of a famous shell game hustler plying his trade: [2], and another of the shell game being played in Stockholm: [3]  Many more here: [4].  The three card monte[5] is essentially the same scam, with three face down cards instead of shells.<p>The sad thing is that many people think this is a game of skill.  But it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a con that&#x27;s been refined over hundreds of years to non-violently rob you of your money.<p>Something else most people don&#x27;t realize is that when there&#x27;s a shell game going on, the shell game operator (the guy who mixes up the shells) is not alone.  He&#x27;s almost always part of a gang of between 4 to 8 people, each playing a specific role in the scam.  Some of the most important pretend to be players, making noise, having a great time, and apparently winning lots of money, since the hardest thing to do in a shell game con is to get people to stop and play, and this is the main way they do it.  They also have lookouts, who warn the gang if they spot the police, and others with various functions like smoothing over ruffled feathers of the losers or handling trouble.  In the above videos you&#x27;ll also see gang members regularly stand in front of cameras to try to block the view.<p>Unless the shell game operator is incompetent or wants to give the impression that the game is being played fairly (usually when no actual money is at stake), the mark will never be able to guess where the ball is, as the operator has a cheating move to make the ball disappear from under any shell and appear anywhere else he wants.. and if the mark ever does guess correctly, there are numerous ways the hustlers have of making sure the mark never collects his money.  One common way is for one of the gang members to yell &quot;police&quot; and have everyone run away (usually with the mark&#x27;s money).  Another is for one of the gang members to &quot;accidentally&quot; knock the table over before the shell is lifted.  If all else fails for them, they will often not be above just simply mugging their mark a couple of blocks away from the game.<p>Really, the only way to &quot;win&quot; at this &quot;game&quot; is to have a bigger gang.<p>Unfortunately, the police don&#x27;t seem to do anything about this, even though they&#x27;re usually well aware that the games are being played.  I&#x27;ve been told by SF police that they know the shell game is going on there, but there&#x27;s nothing they can do because as soon as they approach the hustlers run away.  All they can do is cite them for littering, because they usually knock their cardboard table over on the sidewalk before they run away.  I&#x27;m not sure why the police haven&#x27;t just dressed as tourists, though.  It should be pretty easy to catch the hustlers then.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shell_game\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shell_game<\/a><p>[2] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xRFlJVTT8FY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xRFlJVTT8FY<\/a><p>[3] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AboNGr7RxKE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AboNGr7RxKE<\/a><p>[4] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;view_play_list?p=61150A4524304AB8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;view_play_list?p=61150A4524304AB8<\/a><p>[5] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Three_card_monte\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Three_card_monte<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-15 00:01:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lordnacho"],"id":[21792121],"kids":[21792388],"parent":[21790045],"text":["The bit about voting for taller people seems misplaced.

Particularly, in C99 (page 214, page 311) [0] , ERANGE is often returned by math functions (but it was also used by strtol, strtoll, strtoul, and strtoull for indicating buffer overflow), and simply defines it as &quot;ERANGE: Result too large&quot; [1].<p>So the conclusion is, although abusing the errno in an ad-hoc basis is not uncommon, but clearly this is not the case here, it&#x27;s perfectly in compliance and it&#x27;s even documented.

My opinion: worth reading by jumping around, not worth reading in linear fashion.<p>Bruce Pascoe&#x27;s Dark Emu is worth a read too. It&#x27;s well researched, but the author does occasionally blur the line between opinion and facts. I attribute it to writing styles. Similar in nature to another book I quite liked in the past - Wisdom Sits in Places, but less focused.<p>Narrative Economics by Robert Shiller would be unfocused to people who are in the tech industry. Nonetheless, the book serves to give context to people who are textmining. Hopefully some changes to economics arise from this.

Christopher de Hamel introduces us to kings, queens, saints, scribes, artists, librarians, thieves, dealers, collectors and the international community of manuscript scholars, showing us how he and his fellows piece together evidence to reach unexpected conclusions. He traces the elaborate journeys which these exceptionally precious artefacts have made through time and space, shows us how they have been copied, who has owned them or lusted after them (and how we can tell), how they have been embroiled in politics and scholarly disputes, how they have been regarded as objects of supreme beauty and luxury and as symbols of national identity. The book touches on religion, art, literature, music, science and the history of taste.<\/i><p><i>&quot;Part travel book, part detective story, part conversation with the reader, Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts conveys the fascination and excitement of encountering some of the greatest works of art in our culture which, in the originals, are to most people completely inaccessible. At the end, we have a slightly different perspective on history and how we come by knowledge. It is a most unusual book.&quot;<\/i><p><pre><code>        - - -\n<\/code><\/pre>\nDon&#x27;t let the page count (~550, modulo references) discourage you.

The intention is to prosecute these cases. There is a provision that requires the user to be notified about this, except if law enforcement specifically requests not to notify the user.<p>The changes to §15a are very broad and allows a variety of government institutions to request not just customer contract data (&quot;Bestandsdaten&quot;, which would be regulated by §14), but also &quot;Nutzungsdaten&quot;, i.e. user IDs, IP addresses, logs or similar usage data, even for misdemeanor-level offences. It&#x27;s a bit of a hyperbole, but to my understanding, this would, in theory, include parking violations and littering, which feels wrong.<p>Requesting such data was, to my understanding, regulated only superfically by the TMG in §15 (5) with unclear scope. Previous court cases established that this would include IP address data (LG Frankfurt&#x2F;Main, 2-03 O 174&#x2F;18). The new paragraph expands on this by explicitly allowing requests to be made using just an IP address (rather than a user identifier), by clarifying the scope to include all usage data, and requiring security measures to be taken to ensure that the data is transmitted securely.<p>The draft document only mentions about passwords in the comments (page 29), not the actual proposed changes to the law, which only mentions &quot;data which can be used to access storage media on a device&quot;.<p>This is an oddly specific provision that likely targets full disk encryption schemes that have a server-side key backup (i.e. Windows Bitlocker). This was copy-pasted from the existing §113 TKG, which regulates ISPs, and calling these &quot;passwords&quot; is a very unfortunate choice of words by the authors of this draft document.<p>Disclaimer: Not a lawyer, but I dealt with law enforcement requests in Germany in a past job."],"time":["2019-12-14 21:35:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[21792233],"kids":{},"parent":[21791605],"text":{},"time":["2019-12-14 22:02:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["ngcc_hk"],"id":[21791834],"kids":{},"parent":[21791605],"text":["Given the Hong Kong police state situation, once again who watch the watchman."],"time":["2019-12-14 21:07:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["paulie_a"],"id":[21793265],"kids":{},"parent":[21791605],"text":["Hand it over.

My machine in 2012 was able to drag the map around and everything would load just fine.<p>* Harder to read&#x2F;understand, especially street names. A lot of the time I have to zoom in 100% and scroll up and down a street to see what the name of the street I&#x27;m looking at is.<p>* Much worse at text parsing e.g. I can no longer loosely type something like &quot;10th and grove to Jim&#x27;s Hardware&quot; and get directions. In fact most of the time I can&#x27;t even type in a major intersection and get what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>* Obnoxiously spammy: they push new &quot;features&quot; on me all the time that I don&#x27;t want to use (including a recent popup mid-directions when I turned on location tracking because I was lost on a busy, complicated highway intersection. It felt pretty dangerous, getting confused by a popup in the map like that mid-intersection), and the phone version asks me to turn on location tracking EVERY SINGLE TIME I OPEN THE APP.<p>* Addresses seem to be getting replaced by some weird google maps-designed address format in Colombia (maybe other countries?) that are useless to humans<p>* While every good review site seems to fail for whatever reason (tough to monetize, and fighting spam&#x2F;fraud is also hard?), Maps seems to have become the de facto review site in many places. But the UX is so godawful I can&#x27;t even wrap my head around it. For example, search for a restaurant, and you get one (ONE) possible filter in browsers: star rating. There&#x27;s also a &quot;more filters&quot; button which brings you to a separate view where star rating is the only available filter. On the phone app, sometimes I can select &quot;open now,&quot; and a few other things about 20% of the time I use the app, and it&#x27;s not clear why those options are gone the rest of the time...<p>I think it&#x27;s a real shame, because I remember in, e.g. 2012 I thought Google Maps was an incredible revelation. It was so much better than MapQuest, it was free, fast, and just worked.

So instead game programming is about making systems flexible. For example, as far as the gameplay code is concerned the inside of players ship is just yet another level. The bounds of any level are defined by what the map designers have layed out, not any pre-planned &quot;ship area&quot;.<p>There are no meetings where project managers request &quot;more playable area for level 7&quot;.<p>Likewise the systems programmer who made the furniture system was not the script writer who created the ladders. The script writer likely thought it was brilliant and elegant to split the entrances and exits, because in game programming it was indeed brilliant. It allowed the save system&#x27;s existing code to handling what would have otherwise been special handling. It allowed the existing combat logic to handling what would otherwise be special handling.<p>Of course regular programming is different. In regular applications if a user&#x27;s data is being sent to a server there is no secondary system which needs to be allowed to kill this data.

The application&#x27;s server checks the validity of the token (without having to contact Google, except for daily key refreshes) and can upgrade that to a session for your browser using its normal session-management machinery.  The idea is to transfer a piece of information between two systems (Google and the server app) through an untrusted system (your browser).  For that, the JWT works well enough.<p>2) I wrote a proxy to convert one&#x27;s external SSO session cookie to a JWT internally.  That ways apps can check the user without having to make any requests to a user service, and can propagate that safely to other backends.  It was very time-limited (min(RPC deadline, global deadline) + a few seconds of slop in both directions) and never exposed outside of an internal network.<p>Some anti-patterns:<p>You don&#x27;t want to store sessions in a database, so you store the state in a JWT that the user stores in their browser cache.

It has a lot of merit, but I think there is small logic hole in it. When the second part attempts to address the issues of token revocation, its only argument is &quot;what if your blacklist is down?&quot;. But that is silly. Blacklist is part of your authentication process, if it is down you don&#x27;t authenticate. Its like asking how would you serve your API if your API server is down. You won&#x27;t, your server is down.<p>Otherwise, blacklisting tokens as a way of revocation process seems just fine to me. Set reasonable expiration to the key, allow users to refresh keys, then when you need to revoke a key, add it to blacklist together with the expiration timestamp and expire it out of the blacklist at the same time the key itself would expire. You can do all of this by magic by using Redis for your blacklist storage and setting expiration on your blacklisted keys. Yes, you would need to check your blacklist on every request, but a) blacklist is going to be smaller than a list of every issued token (like you would with normal sessions) b) you don&#x27;t even have to store the whole token, just calculate some hash and store that, now you only need to read a few bytes on every request instead of reading the whole session.<p>The author does make a some good points though."],"time":["2019-12-13 23:40:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andyroid"],"id":[21787585],"kids":{},"parent":[21783303],"text":["JWTs and sessions are not in any way orthogonal in a system as a whole.

After giving it some thought, I can prove that it is equivalent to &quot;every number will at some point reach a power of 2&quot; because from a power of two you then go straight to 1 through divisions.<p>This result seems even more reachable since I no longer need to prove that numbers eventually get smaller.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is not a new discovery to people who have worked on the problem. But part of me really wants to spend the rest of the day puzzling around with where that approach goes.<p>Edit: Thought about it more. The two ways it doesn&#x27;t hit 1 would be for it to find a loop, that never hits a power of 2 or to grow infinitely.<p>Thinking about how a loop with 3n+1 and n&#x2F;2 would have to function, I think it&#x27;s probably pretty easy to prove that 4-2-1 is the only loop that is possible.<p>That leaves us with the infinite grows, but without ever hitting a power of 2.<p>Edit2: Turns out 4-2-1 being the only loop that is possible is actually not easy to prove at all and isn&#x27;t proven.

Since I know all powers of 2 converge to 1 and only have &#x2F;2 applied to them, my next step is to find the properties of numbers n such that 3n+1 is a power of 2.<p>Only for every second power of 2 is this a whole number. The numbers for the powers of 2: [4, 16, 64, 256, 1024] have the possible precedents: [1, 5, 21, 85, 341]. Interestingly every subsequent number can be built from the previous one by 4n+1. Clearly it&#x27;s 4 because it&#x27;s every second power of 2. I feel like, if you recognize the structure of every number in the tree, you can prove that every natural number has one of those structures. And then you are done.<p>Once again, I&#x27;m completely aware none of this is original thought. But I enjoy it anyway.<p>Edit3: Every even number will be divided by 2 until it is an odd number.

E.g.: 1, s(1) = 2, s(s(1)) = s(2) = 3, and so on. So if we see a number n, we know it&#x27;s s(n-1), which is s(s(n-2)) and so on, until we reach 1. So we have a nice, linear chain, and it&#x27;s trivial to construct an algorithm f(n) [or more mathematically, a function f: N -&gt; {s,ss,sss,...}] that (i) produces the necessary operations to reach any given natural number n in that chain, starting at 1, and (ii) terminates for every input n.<p>Now we don&#x27;t use s(x), but instead two operations that are inverse to the Collatz rules: a(x) = 2*x and b(x) = (x - 1)&#x2F;3 (with b of course is not always being possible). Starting at 1, this can now be used to construct a tree containing &quot;some&quot; numbers, and we can use that it to describe a path to a number from the root.<p>If the conjecture holds, the tree constructed from these functions has to contain all natural numbers.<p>My nudge is then: If I have a number n, can I give an algorithm&#x2F;function f&#x27;: N -&gt; {a,b,aa,ab,ba,bb,...} that (i) finds a path to n, and (ii) always terminates?
