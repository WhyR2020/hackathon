If so, couldn&#x27;t they be churned out by the thousand in a short space of time (ie. days)?  My understanding is that the tooling is comparable to that used to produce a kitchen cabinet.

If you&#x27;re interested in some non-trivial OSS examples, check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transitive-bullshit&#x2F;ffmpeg-gl-transition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transitive-bullshit&#x2F;ffmpeg-gl-transition<\/a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transitive-bullshit&#x2F;ffmpeg-concat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transitive-bullshit&#x2F;ffmpeg-concat<\/a>.<p>One non-obvious piece of advice I have for developers delving into ffmpeg&#x27;s filter_complex is to try and keep the filter graphs as short and simple as possible. Creating complex filter graphs programmatically (as ffcms does in this case) is super powerful, but I&#x27;ve also found in practice that larger filter graphs often lead to random, impossible to debug errors. This could be due to anything from some combination of VM resource constraints, internal ffmpeg leaks that compound at scale, etc etc.<p>My advice is to think carefully about what you want to use ffmpeg for. It&#x27;s <i>excellent<\/i> at transcoding and doing minor filter graphs but trying to get too crazy with complex filter graphs will lead you down a dark path that imho ffmpeg wasn&#x27;t really meant for. If you can break up your complex filter effects into smaller, isolated ffmpeg commands it may be slightly slower but your rendering pipeline will be significantly more robust."],"time":["2020-03-23 04:47:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_Gyan_"],"id":[22657968],"kids":[22666174],"parent":[22657447],"text":["&quot;<i>-f lavfi -i testsrc - declaration of an input.

Ironically the main hardware missing in comparison is the headphone jack. \nThe ARM chip in the iPad should compare well with the MacBook, only the limited ram could be a cons.<p>But where iPadOS lacks significantly behind MacOS is the software. And this is based on the AppStore rules. Applications are limited in their capabilities which would be natural on a &quot;computer&quot;. With &quot;Files&quot;, applications can finally exchange data, but that still has complexities for the user and is less natural than it works on the Mac.<p>The biggest elephant in the room is the missing ability to do any real software development on the iPad. One might say that the software developers are the minority of the users and that is correct, but the software developers are the critical group for a platform which creates the software which all the other users can use. While the AppStore on the Mac has grown over time, just look how large the software universe outside the AppStore is, to get an idea, how important this is for the Mac platform. Not even counting the number of users, which wouldn&#x27;t qualify as software developers, but are running a few scripts here and there for special task, either written by themselves or grabbed from the internet and modified to their needs. And yes, sometimes you really need a shell.<p>It will be interesting to watch what gets shown for iPadOS 14.

They gained faster processors (their market share was insufficient to keep performance parity) and the ability to virtualize or even dual-boot Windows on Mac hardware. I don’t see these factors changing; iPhones and iPads don’t have the performance properties of laptops and desktops, meaning even Apple’s internally-developed ARM architecture is going to treat Macs as as much of an afterthought as Motorola and IBM did back in the day. Meanwhile, even if Windows compatibility is less relevant, the ability to virtualize Linux distros on Macs has become more relevant.<p>If I’m a software developer and I want to run my code on a x86-based Linux server somewhere, I’ll often want my development environment to be capable of reproducing that same environment, and tools like Vagrant and Docker accomplish this on Macs using virtualization. Without a shared CPU architecture, these tools will either stop working entirely or rely upon emulation, which would hinder performance and potentially introduce inconsistent behavior compared to the real hardware. Now, it’s true that iOS development relies on the Mac performing ARM emulation. But there’s already a working solution for this, and you can still use actual iOS hardware for testing. If I had to connect my Mac to an x86-based Linux box for testing and development, why wouldn’t I just use the Linux box? And the Linux box is a server that I can either Remote Desktop or SSH into, why would I need a Mac to be able to do that? Maybe I’m biased because I already think Macs aren’t a very good development environment, but I don’t really see switching CPU architectures as a move that makes them any better.

When a number represent a quantity, it is obvious they should be added, but when a number is a kind of identifier, like an article number, it is obvious that they should not be added.

I didn&#x27;t notice it until I discover all my money was still in the bank end of the month.<p>To make things more ironic my goal was to create superior food which absolutely worked.<p>The main invention was this: For most meals we take a bunch of ingredients and mix them into a deliciously flavored mix and give it fancy names. The grand mistake we made is that the entire meal tastes the same. The second mistake is that every ingredient we use really is an experience to eat in it self. Every 2 ingredients offer 3 different experiences. A, B and A+B<p>With 3 ingredients you get A, B, C, AB, AC, BC! Thats 6!<p>With 4 ingredients you get A,B,C,D,AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD! Thats 10!<p>So I needed some kind of structured platform to carefully plan out this adventure. Pizza was my medium of choice but an oven dish should work too. (I make small 25 cm pizzas)<p>So I got the Gouda, the mozzarella, the camembert and the goat cheese. (there are many more of course) (4)<p>I got some varieties of mushrooms. (2)<p>I got some meat, chicken, bacon, salami, ham. (4)<p>I got some different kinds of fish. (3)<p>Some fruit is fine too. (2)<p>But the largest diversity of tastes are in the vegetables(!)(20?)<p>The &quot;problem&quot; the above presents is that you cant put a lot of anything on there. My pizza is only 25 cm or 490 cm2. Lets say there are 60 bites on it. The goal was to zone it into an adventure of identifiable tastes. More than 4 flavors per bite would ruin the experience.<p>With 35 different ingredients..., at least 1 slice of olive (or it isn&#x27;t a pizza) oregano, thyme, basil, onion, garlic, slices of red pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper.... you just have to many combinations to put everything on it.<p>Each pizza will have to be a sub set.<p>I know it instinctively feels weird and disgusting to put a slices of carrot on the pizza but in practice it really takes the journey of flavors some place else. You wouldn&#x27;t want 3 bites of it but the single bite really creates an additional moment of &quot;oh?&quot; (hilarious note: guests feel the need to tell me the pizza is delicious roughly every 3rd bite)<p>I just buy different boxes of frozen vegetables but you could cook or bake and&#x2F;or freeze your own.<p>We (there is a &quot;we&quot; now) (bake if needed then) sparsely spread the sub-selection of meat and&#x2F;or fish over their own region. Take a hand full of vegetables mix and place each chunk strategically. Put a lot of thought into the adventure and improve it every time. Take the minimum amount of each cheese you&#x27;ve picked and spread it into similar regions as the meat so that they overlap.<p>Really put a lot of thought into it. It helps if you look at an ingredient and ask yourself what kind of meals are prepared with it. Then you take the [for example] chunk of cauliflower, put 2 cubes of potato next to it and some Gouda on top.<p>The end result should be a slab of flour with vegetables on it, good spices and as little meat, fish and cheese as possible. Not because meat, fish or cheese are not wonderful but because they get in the way of the vegetable flavors.<p>Being cheep as fuck is just a side effect.<p>The only down side is that you have to keep making pizza 2 or 3 times per day week after week after week. It never gets boring tho.<p>Final note: Keep as much stuff frozen as you can or your adventure ends up chasing expiration dates."],"time":["2020-03-22 16:36:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lokl"],"id":[22655441],"kids":[22655554,22655460],"parent":[22654646],"text":["What is the feasibility of the postal service delivering non-perishable food to every residential mailbox?

When a hotel room costs $300 to $500 per night, then this will quickly burn your travel budget.<p>Two, Airbnb hosts are often, rather dishonest with their listings.<p>But, Airbnb is the only way to rent someone’s house in a distant location, where your family and extended family can stay together to get away.  It’s impossible to do this with a hotel, and very expensive too.<p>Initially, some people got enterprising, and rented out their homes to help pay their mortgages.  And they charged a modest fee for it. For a while, this seemed ok, as you were helping out someone to pay off their expensive mortgage. Like, Yeah!

Action is easy, thinking is hard: acting after thinking, uncomfortable. Every beginning is joyous, every threshold a point of expectation. The boy stares in wonder, impressions condition him, he learns in playing, seriousness takes him by surprise. Imitation is natural to us all, but what to imitate is not easily ascertained. Rarely is the best discerned, still more rarely appreciated. Height attracts us, not the steps upwards; with the mountaintop in our eyes we linger lovingly on the plain. Only a part of art can be taught, an artist needs the whole. Those who know only half of it, are always confused and talk a lot; those who have the whole, act and talk little, or long afterwards. The former have no secrets and no strength, their teaching is like freshly baked bread, tasty and satisfying for one day; but flour cannot be sown and the fruits of the grain should not be ground. Words are good, but they are not the best. The best is not made clear by words. The spirit in which we act, is what is highest. Action can only be grasped by spirit and portrayed by spirit. No one knows what he is doing when he acts rightly, but we are always conscious of what is wrong. He who works only with signs, is a pedant, a hypocrite or a botcher. There are many such, and they get on well together. Their gossiping impedes the student, and their persistent mediocrity alarms those who are best. The teaching of a real artist opens up sense; for where words are lacking, action speaks.

There&#x27;s two sides to every trade, so you&#x27;re generally playing poker against professionals with armies of quants.<p>But this game really just proves that you can&#x27;t time the market while knowing nothing about the outside world.<p>Headlines sometimes matter.<p>Not all the time. Talking heads generally overstate how much one random speech matters, &quot;politician X says Y, therefore stocks are reacting&quot; is generally just over-analyzing noise. It&#x27;s annoying to see post hoc rationalizations the norm in financial... in all news. People claim causation for anything they happened to read.<p>But occasionally, once a decade, say? Headlines do send a strong signal. &quot;Crisis on Wall Street as Lehman Totters&quot; was a headline that came just before the biggest cliff in 2008.<p>In February 2020 we didn&#x27;t know as much as we do now, but people already started talking about difficulties in containment. China--which likes itself some economic growth (if only to keep the Party going)--decided a near total economic shutdown was necessary. The virus was already in a few dozen countries and Singapore was surrounded by container ships that couldn&#x27;t dock.<p>So let&#x27;s split out two separate claims:<p>1) The weak efficient markets hypothesis: you can&#x27;t time the market blind.<p>2) Strong EMH: you can&#x27;t time the market, not even once in a while, with your eyes wide open.<p>In defense of (2), the housing crisis really started in October 2007, and ended in February 2009. You can delve for headlines for those moments, but they are way more specious. Here&#x27;s the real test: what will be the best signal of the rally after the pandemic?<p>1) China hitting zero active cases, reassuring the world it can be done.<p>2) Global new case &quot;growth rate&quot; below 1 for two straight weeks? [Growth rate being the ratio of today&#x27;s new cases to yesterday&#x27;s new cases, with lower than 1 a tipping point away from exponential growth, and probably the halfway point in the crisis.]<p>3) China keeping no new local cases even after reopening its economy?<p>4) Some decision about how to keep airlines solvent?<p>5) Unemployment nearing historical normals after skyrocketing beyond anything we&#x27;ve ever seen?<p>Any of these seem plausible. But who knows which will be right? However, if we are attacking strong EMH, we don&#x27;t really have to time things maximally, we just have to do slightly better than the index. So maybe just wait until the S&amp;P 500 has recovered a quarter of its losses and get in then?<p>Maybe the general problem with active investing is the financial sector&#x27;s approach: hire people to study market signals full time and generate algorithms that can trade more and more actively. Full time people are expensive, and tuning algorithms is expensive. So that means you burn through fees (on top of probably not outperforming the market, because you&#x27;re competing against noise).<p>If you hire people to do something full time, they will find ways to justify their time. If you hire someone to play rock paper scissors full time, and give them some of the highest bonuses in the world, they will come up with some very nice models. And usually not outperform a random thrower, but give you lots of reports on why and how they&#x27;ll do better next time.<p>But if all the daily signals are noise except for one really blaring foghorn once a decade, maybe the better solution would be to hire a part time market hobbyist on a contingency fee. &quot;Hey, if you see a signal that the entire market should be shorted, maybe short the market. You get two trades per decade max. Otherwise, just index and hold.&quot;<p>Probably also wouldn&#x27;t work, but I really like the idea of some plumber in Poughkeepsie controlling billions of dollars in hedge fund money, you know, just as a side hustle."],"time":["2020-03-22 15:11:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["legulere"],"id":[22654943],"kids":{},"parent":[22652584],"text":["Is there also a version with the Nikkei 225?"],"time":["2020-03-22 14:54:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["RickJWagner"],"id":[22654656],"kids":{},"parent":[22652584],"text":["Excellent game!

The economy there has basically shut down. Consumer spending has collapsed, production has collapsed, and logistics are increasingly untenable.<p>What can we expect? Six months of this (and some people are projecting up to eighteen months) are going to shut down demand. There’s a term going around now “demand destruction” — I’m not going to pretend to know more than I do, so I’ll admit forthright that I had never heard it until a few weeks ago — that seems to meet the requirements here.<p>It’s uncertain whether the supply side of the economy will be similarly affected. Probably yes, as governments curb production to slow the spread at the workplace.<p>Even three months will be dreadful.<p>Now, let’s think of a few things: governments are stepping in with public support to support businesses, provide liquidity, and support workers that do not have income. That means debt. That means interest payments in future, for those businesses that are fortunate enough to survive. Taxpayers will be on the hook for decades.<p>The situation is so severe that German economists are proposing a 1 trillion euro Eurobond issue to help support the economies because the southern economies cannot hope to cope with this.<p>I guess I’ll sum it up thusly: this might turn out to be a “great pause”, but economies and demographics cannot idle without incurring enormous financial costs."],"time":["2020-03-22 13:43:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mrich"],"id":[22654834],"kids":[22664712],"parent":[22654131],"text":["Some thoughts:<p>- Short term we need government to step in and avoid a large-scale meltdown of businesses that would be more catastrophic than the virus itself.

This will increase costs for a few, potentially a lot of industries (everything travel, potentially logistics)<p>- I have some fear that some countries which are simply not able to get the virus under control will be disconnected from the rest of the world economy, since no one wants to risk importing the virus from them again.<p>I hope most of the countries go the way China went in Hubei: Take the most radical measures immediately - i.e. total lockdown, government backs the economy.

Plus $2+ trillion coming from Congress, which includes checks directly to consumers and also up to $4 trillion more in direct lending to small businesses with forgivable loans.  Not to mention interest rates at 0% and gas prices at $1.50&#x2F;gal. The financial sector is healthy. Big tech companies are still sitting on a few trillion in cash.<p>2. Everyone has cabin fever and missed their spring breaks and perhaps summer vacations. Prices on travel and leisure are at an all time low. A weeklong trip to Hawaii for a family of 5 is down to like $1500.<p>3.  At some point (I believe in days&#x2F;weeks) there will be a medical breakthrough.  Hydroxychloroquine+Azithro has had stunning results in South Korea, China, and France. Many US docs are already prescribing now. Even if this works only 40% of the time, that’s significant enough to flatten the curve and most importantly lower the death rate around the seasonal flu. Early anecdotal evidence suggests it’s been effective in 90%+ of cases.<p>4.  I think by mid-April folks especially in the U.S. are gonna say enough is enough and break containment.  The rest of the 80% of America isn’t willing to shutdown the entire economy for the 1% who face almost certain death from this disease.  I know that’s crude and sounds cold-hearted, but Fox News is going to be very convincing that we should just resume our normal way of life and let the chips fall where they may. Election season starts in earnest in mid-Spring and Trump I believe will end the shutdowns and tell us to go back to living our lives.  Biden will almost certainly do the same with a focus on rebuilding America. People can shut down for a week or two, anything longer than that and you face rebellion. School has been out since early March and the soccer moms here just want to go back to being normal. Expect a presidential candidate to jump out first with a “let’s get America back to work” strategy and end the shutdowns and maybe only recommend quarantines for the at-risk population."],"time":["2020-03-23 05:07:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mam2"],"id":[22654506],"kids":{},"parent":[22654131],"text":["What about putting everyone in chômage technique ?"],"time":["2020-03-22 13:35:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bashwizard"],"id":[22661766],"kids":{},"parent":[22654131],"text":["Oh it has just started. 2008 will be a fart in the wind compared to the shitstorm we&#x27;re heading towards."],"time":["2020-03-23 07:40:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwVKPPQHQZ"],"id":[22660361],"kids":{},"parent":[22654131],"text":["It would be wise for mostly everyone in the West as an investment for the medium and long term status post the pandemic to start learning Chinese."],"time":["2020-03-23 02:06:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bashwizard"],"id":[22661760],"kids":{},"parent":[22654131],"text":["Oh it has just started.<p>The Buffett Indicator."],"time":["2020-03-23 07:39:29"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["aussiegreenie"],"id":[22659093],"kids":{},"parent":[22654131],"text":["It will be as bad as 1974."],"time":["2020-03-22 22:56:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["loraa"],"id":[22654674],"kids":{},"parent":[22654131],"text":["I feel reeaaal bad for anyone who doesn&#x27;t own a gun."],"time":["2020-03-22 14:06:28"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["brown9-2"],"id":[22654701],"kids":[22654775,22659007],"parent":[22654131],"text":["Why are you posting this question as if anyone here knows the answer?"],"time":["2020-03-22 14:12:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throwaway29358"],"id":[22654588],"kids":[22654782,22654873],"parent":[22654131],"text":["The more the economic crisis worsens, and the more people have to watch their parents and grandparents die prematurely, the more virulent the global anti-China sentiment will get.

It’s about as painful as you’d imagine it is to wake up after surgery with a half dozen screws through now your two pieces of fibula. I remember being scared of hitting the frame on things because of how painful it was.<p>At 17 I was able to take advantage of an internal lengthening rod, so no frame needed. It’s much nicer than a frame and I would say that is what all the article’s patients use. Remarkable medical tech.<p>By the time my last one was near I’d forgotten how bad the experience was. I took only 2 weeks off work. I was stupidly overconfident. I spent 1 week in hospital really drugged up and in heaps of pain, with a freshly broken femur, and then got home and had a worse week. It was too painful to sleep for a couple of months and the lengthening itself was awful, as my quad muscles were being stretched in ways that a child’s muscles will handle but my adult muscles were hating. I’d spend over an hour a day stretching my leg that originally could only bend 50 degrees, and more than once the pain brought me to tears.<p>Once I could get to a physiotherapist she was shocked at how cut up and bruised the surgery had made me. Over half the surface area of my right buttock, hip, and upper leg was purple, with 6 new scars. By that point, a month in, I had come to reckon with how brutal this surgery is, and that I had months and months of recovery left. I was not a happy person. Pretty angry, to be honest.<p>I couldn’t walk unaided by crutches for over 6 months, and I’d been aching to be able to walk since about day 14 of my recovery.<p>My right femur is now 4cm longer.

I was collecting receipts and playing a bit with scanning of these, but the amount of noise in the data and inconsistencies between shops were a bit pushing away (unless you want to dedicate time cleaning the data and training own tailored information extraction models).<p>One of the options to solve the data entry could be:\n- good quality automatic scanning of receipts (not only individual barcodes) from shops using OCR possibly supported with image recognition for double-checking (can happen that products will be mis-labelled or without quantities, etc)\n- when ordering on-line, the receipt should be available, so should be also much easier\nYet, not always one will have a meaningful receipt available...<p>Solved the data entry and being able to predict own&#x27;s supply needs would be also great to have a up-to date management of the inventory. Here are even more challenges on the tracking of the available goods at home, where these are and how many items (and in what state, expiration date, etc) would require most probably implementing different solutions from IoT (connected cameras, sensors, etc.).<p>Then, having a connected home with own groceries supplies under control, one can then automate further the shopping process with feeding-back the information about own&#x27;s demand to on-line groceries one is subscribed to. This can enable customer subscription plans, and for retailer keeping a possible continuous flow of goods.

Our basic process is:\n1. Pre-season: estimate requirements based on previous years and do a few large orders with various suppliers for delivery to coincide with the annual food lift (we can&#x27;t drive all the way to our club). Primarily this is meat and non perishables such as tinned&#x2F;packaged items, toileteries and cleaning products.\n2. Every few days during the season: perform a stock take of what&#x27;s on-hand in the club. Send to the catering officer. \n3. Catering officer orders according to his&#x2F;her assessment of requirements. Mainly this will be perishables such as fruit&#x2F;veges, eggs, bread, milk but later in the season may include other items \n4. Items are delivered to common stock room and carried up the mountain by club members. Items are checked off the order list provided by the catering officer and added to various storage areas (fridges&#x2F;freezers, store room, kitchen pantry etc).<p>Based on a quick run through the demo system I think grocy will meet our requirements for managing consumables.<p>Additionally club members staying on a particular night are assigned duties by the lodge leader e.g. breakfast dishes, vegetable prep, cooking dinner. We may be able to use the &quot;Chores&quot; function to help with that.<p>Personally for home use I would not use this because it would not be practical for our family.<p>Regarding an additional feature: I would recommend looking at Cozi which we use for a shared family calendar which is really valuable for us.

Unfortunately, the JavaScript-based UPC&#x2F;EAN barcode scanning is unusable. Too slow, even on a 2018 Mac Pro, sometimes only scans a partial barcode, and asks for permission to access the camera for every scan. I&#x27;ve ordered a USB bar code scanner, I&#x27;ll see if that makes it more usable.<p>I used to have a really neat device called the Hiku. It was essentially a WiFi-enabled hockey-puck sized scanner, with a microphone for voice recognition for items without bar codes, and a UPC database. Sadly they went out of business a few years ago but their app still works (not sure if new users can sign up for it), and is great for shared shopping, e.g. yesterday I was shopping and I could see my wife add items to the list in real time, as well as cross them out.<p>My main challenge is that I downsized to a much smaller apartment, and a lot of our dry groceries have to go in plastic bins that are shoved in dark corners, so it&#x27;s hard to know what we have or don&#x27;t have, leading to duplicated purchases and also wasted food when it expires.<p>One challenge is the absence of a good universal UPC&#x2F;EAN database. I tried one with one item from the bin (a box of some obscure knock-offs of Meiji Chocorooms), and when the phone scanner finally managed to get the item right, the online DB identified it as a Disney Princess doll, so it seems UPC&#x2F;EAN is so badly managed they can&#x27;t even avoid duplicate codes.<p>Finally data entry of expiration dates is going to be too cumbersome. A better approach would be to have some sort of of statistical model that estimates the shelf life from the product descriptions, e.g. 2 years for canned goods. Less precise, but more manageable, it could show alerts like &quot;check how much longer this can of tuna has left&quot;, and if still has some ways, you could enter the precise date only then."],"time":["2020-03-23 18:25:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ipnon"],"id":[22647159],"kids":{},"parent":[22646358],"text":["If I didn&#x27;t have to do the input myself I would subscribe to this for life."],"time":["2020-03-21 16:27:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["antpls"],"id":[22653329],"kids":{},"parent":[22646358],"text":["I dont see usecase even for a family of five, because this is solved with authority&#x2F;responsibility and habits, and it works good enough most of the time.<p>However this could be useful for Airbnbs management, open-spaces with kitchen, and also that new trend of young independent people living together but sharing a kitchen.

Maybe but those systems always seem too complicated and we&#x27;ve tried several (most recently &#x27;plan to eat&#x27; which we paid an annual subscription).

If it&#x27;s time to shop we can quickly decide on a few meals, check the pantry and freezer and then just add items we need to baking, grocery, meat, etc..., almost always by clicking an item from the &#x27;Recent Entries&#x27; section.<p>If we were feeding larger groups of people with a restaurant or a college meal coop where we shared the cooking and managed volume orders I&#x27;d want something fancier that managed meals and ingredients and shopping a bit better.<p>But for my wife and I this relatively simple works great.

I&#x27;m excited about this because roguelikes make up for their extremely simple graphics by tending to have extraordinarily complicated systems. Of particular interest to me are procedural map generation (tons of interesting algorithmic possibilities here) and monster AI.<p>Besides, building a 3D renderer is not something that particularly interests me currently, so skipping that and just using sprite sheets made to look like ASCII chars is perfect."],"time":["2020-03-22 01:53:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kirubakaran"],"id":[22651359],"kids":{},"parent":[22648431],"text":["I&#x27;m working on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;histre.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;histre.com&#x2F;<\/a> - Effortless Knowledge Base<p>The idea that we throw away a lot of the signal we generate while doing things online and this can be put to good use for ourselves.<p>As it is right now, Histre aids the casual online research we all do (ie the explore -&gt; filter -&gt; decide loop). For example, it removes friction in taking notes on links you&#x27;re looking at, with free-form tags that you don&#x27;t have to create first and other such niceties that add up. And it easy to group notes into notebooks and share with teams. In short, when you have to look at a bunch of links for something (decide on AirBnB, people to hire, material for your next blog post, etc) Histre makes your life easier. But this is just the starting point for what Histre intends to do.<p>IMHO the biggest problem with apps like Evernote, Notion, Pocket etc is that it becomes digital hoarding, and not a knowledge base. And the knowledge base focused apps out there involve a lot of manual upkeep, which almost never happens, especially at work. Things start out okay and quickly fall into disrepair. I&#x27;m differentiating from the other note taking apps by automatically putting together a knowledge base (grouped by topic etc). Automatic Upkeep (WIP): Histre detects links&#x2F;notes related to your existing notebooks and offers to update those notebooks with the new links and notes. This is similar to how Google Photos suggests new photos for your existing albums. This solves the upkeep problem. Currently people create knowledge bases with good intentions and it becomes stale and useless quite fast.<p>Exports: I&#x27;m working on org-mode exports, as I&#x27;m an Emacs user myself.

Plus configurable tradeoffs – instant delivery and offline storage (via federated server you own) vs non-instant but aggressive resilience to network disruption (should work over mesh networks), dark routing (for zero-trust hostile networks) vs fully exposing transport layer details (if you talk to your kid over your home wifi router, why would you care about hiding IP address or send your message to the datacenter across the globe).\nI spent some time in the messaging, and clearly see how many of the tradeoffs just push people to use centralized servers, and that makes sense and works fine, until it doesn&#x27;t (think Telegram and Rostelecom IP addresses block).

It’s a service that allows you to send email attachments to your cloud storage account. At the moment, I’m considering pivoting this slightly into an email archiving service, but haven’t yet decided.<p>I ended up learning quite a bit about how email works and how to setup an email server from scratch. The email backend is written in Rust and hooks into a Postfix server as a filter. Since I am not storing any mail, I’d like to eventually migrate to either an LMTP server or a custom SMTP server.<p>I also used this as a chance to learn Ansible. I’ve been pretty impressed with how much easier server provisioning becomes, especially when compared to a more manual approach.<p>Currently, the mail backend is fully working for Dropbox. Right now, I am setting up a landing page to gauge interest. After that, most of the work will be on the web app side.<p>The project is open source, for now: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aksiksi&#x2F;vaulty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aksiksi&#x2F;vaulty<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-21 21:01:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}}]
