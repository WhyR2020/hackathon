It advertised on Facebook asking for people who wanted antibody testing. This has an enormous potential effect on the sample - I&#x27;m so much more likely to take the time to get tested if I think it will benefit me, and It&#x27;s most likely to benefit me if I&#x27;m more likely to have had COVID. An opt-in design with a low response rate has huge potential to bias results.<p>Sample bias (in the other direction) is the reason that the NIH has not yet released serosurvey results from Washington:<p>We’re cautious because blood donors are not a representative sample. They are asymptomatic, afebrile people [without a fever]. We have a “healthy donor effect.” The donor-based incidence data could lag behind population incidence by a month or 2 because of this bias.<p>Presumably, they rightly fear that, with such a high level of uncertainty, bias could lead to bad policy and would negatively impact public health. I&#x27;m certain that these data are informing policy decisions at the national level, but they haven&#x27;t released them out of an abundance of caution. Those conducting this study would have done well to adopt that same caution.<p>If you read closely on the validation of the test, the study did barely any independent validation to determine specificity&#x2F;sensitivity - only 30! pre-covid samples tested independently of the manufacturer. Given the performance of other commercial tests and the dependence of specificity on cross-reactivity + antibody prevalence in the population, this strikes me as extremely irresponsible.<p>This paper elides the fact that other rigorous serosurveys are neither consistent with this level of underascertainment nor the IFR this paper proposes. Many of you are familiar with the Gangelt study, which I have criticized. Nevertheless, it is an order of magnitude more trustworthy than this paper (both insofar as it sampled a larger slice of the population and had a much much higher response rate). It also inferred a much higher fatality rate of 0.37%. IFR will, of course, vary from population to population, and so will ascertainment rate. Nevertheless, the range proposed here strains credibility, considering the study&#x27;s flaws. 0.13% of NYC&#x27;s population has already died, and the paths of other countries suggest a slow decline in daily deaths, not a quick one. Considering that herd immunity predicts transmission to stop at 50-70% prevalence, this is baldly inconsistent with this study&#x27;s findings.<p>For all of the above reasons, I hope people making personal and public health decisions wait for rigorous results from the NIH and other organizations and understand that skepticism of this result is warranted. I also hope that the media reports responsibly on this study and its limitations and speaks with other experts before doing so.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;COVID19&#x2F;comments&#x2F;g32wjh&#x2F;covid19_antibody_seroprevalence_in_santa_clara&#x2F;fnotu78&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;COVID19&#x2F;comments&#x2F;g32wjh&#x2F;covid19_ant...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-17 20:16:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["beamatronic"],"id":[22900487],"kids":{},"parent":[22899272],"text":["“These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases.

The other, which is what I&#x27;m hoping for but not expecting, is that we take this opportunity to acknowledge that Keynes was right, and we don&#x27;t have to work as much as we do.  If we can strengthen our social safety net so that being out of work does not necessarily imply falling deeply into poverty (not that being unemployed should necessarily be a great deal, just that folks shouldn&#x27;t be losing their homes and their health insurance, and should still be able to lead a fairly basic life), then I think this whole crisis might have a silver lining."],"time":["2020-04-17 20:13:59"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sputknick"],"id":[22901324],"kids":[22901459,22901515],"parent":[22901065],"text":["I think the challenge here is the government is probably offering better terms than can be expected from Buffet.

In a centralized world where most people get most of their (fake) news from Facebook or WhatsApp, RSS&#x2F;Atom doesn’t stand much of a chance for gaining broader mainstream use.<p>The biggest advantage of using an RSS reader is that it’s a single place that has content ready for you to consume in a list based interface. The web browser interfaces of websites, on the other hand, have all kinds of crazy and trendy layouts where content is a third class citizen (first class and second class are both reserved for ads). This makes skimming easier and quicker. There’s only one way to skim in an RSS reader regardless of which site’s feed you’re looking at. You don’t have to go through the mental exhaustion of skimming several different website layouts, fonts, colors, etc.<p>I use a couple of RSS apps across devices, and at least one of them is running all the time to refresh content periodically so that I don’t miss something (I know there are online aggregators, but I haven’t found something that I liked and preferably very cheap too). I don’t try to read all the articles across sources since that’d be an endless effort, not to mention completely wasteful. I skim through, read some, star some for future reference or use and mark the specific source (or all) as read.<p>One thing I hate about many sites that provide RSS feeds is the lack of full text content in the feed. It’s always a jarring experience to open the link to the full content and experience chaos that’s in complete contrast to the reader experience.<p>On Mac and iOS, I’d recommend NetNewsWire (free and open source).

We charge customers in USD but we are forced to convert to SGD and conversion fees adds up. On 99USD charge, with the current conversion, we get around 138 SGD but the net for us is 133 SGD because the processing fee is ~5.20SGD. That fee was lower before.\nThere is no problem for us getting an extension of our account in USD currency so we could avoid unnecessary conversion USD-&gt;SGD fees.<p>2. Chargebacks. A real pain in the ass. I shared a post on IH about it. Basically there is no way for us to issue someone a refund if they are doing a chargeback. This is a real problem that is relatively easy to solve. PayPal does it - basically, if the customer submits dispute, PayPal first tries to contact the seller to voluntarily provide the refund and only if they refuse, the dispute is being reviewed. Why Stripe cannot work this way? That would save a lot of drama and stress involved running the business for both sides - you and us, your customers.<p>3. Pricing info. It&#x27;s still very confusing on your website to understand what and how you charge for particular add-ons and whether we are grandfathered and have these add-on services included free of charge (since we have been with you since 2016)."],"time":["2020-04-16 19:48:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toptal"],"id":[22892547],"kids":[22892881],"parent":[22889778],"text":["Adyen:<p>$25b market cap, with 2019 full year net revenue being $538m, up 43% year-on-year.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adyen.com&#x2F;investor-relations&#x2F;news&#x2F;h2-2019-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adyen.com&#x2F;investor-relations&#x2F;news&#x2F;h2-2019-financ...<\/a><p>Stripe:<p>Significantly less than Adyen, as many have reported.<p>----<p>Same business model, with Adyen having a higher operating margin.<p>This should be interesting to see how this plays out.

I signed up for an authorize.net account through a merchant account called Capital Merchant Systems (later acquired by EVO Payments).  At the time, the process required filling out a pile of paperwork, including writing an actual cover letter to get approved.<p>Things were fine until recent years, business for this particular service had slowly dropped to the point where it was no longer feasible to run through authorize.net.  So I decided to finally make the switch over to Stripe (which I&#x27;d used for a number of years on another project).<p>Signing up for Stripe is so painlessly easy, straightforward, and friendly.<p>After switching my system over, I called and emailed my merchant account to cancel (this was in August). Then I called and emailed again in November.  Then I called and emailed again in January.<p>All the while, they&#x27;ve been withdrawing from my checking account.<p>Then I emailed again in April, and filed reports with the BBB and FTC.  Only then have I heard back from them, and they&#x27;re claiming my January request is the first request.<p>So the short of it is, use Stripe. They are amazing, open, and transparent, their API is a joy to work with, and their dashboard is great. I wish Stripe was around 16 years ago when I first got started processing payments.<p>And DO NOT, under any circumstances, use EVO Payments.

Rather, will there be any significant shift towards centralized compute in the next decade?<p>Currently, a large institution&#x2F;corporation has to manage thousands of individual machines.

Alternatively, in a centralized compute environment, they could just allocate a new machine, and work entirely out of a data center.<p>And what about software updates and upgrades?<p>In the centralized model, both software updates and hardware upgrades can be managed more easily. Sure, we have good software tools to update all networked devices, but if that fails, the admin still sometimes needs physical access.<p>One market I see this potentially taking off in is academia and hospitals. (Though I’m biased because I’m employed by a Medical School)<p>Much of the record keeping is already done with a centralized infrastructure.

Sure, the current solution is to spin up your own VM and move your program. Often, academic institutions have their own on-prem compute for this purpose.

All the same elements, a machine with a display &#x2F; keyboard &#x2F;mouse that had a network protocol to talk to some hardware acting on my behalf in a machine room. I could sit down at any station and open up my desktop, just as I had left it. It is a pretty decent experience even with only a 10mbit Ethernet network.<p>The second time I got to experience this architecture was in the Citrix days (late 90&#x27;s early 2000&#x27;s) Now the OS was always Windows and the network protocol was proprietary, but you could bring up an entire enterprise without all that pesky installing&#x2F;rebooting that was the life of an early Window&#x27;s system administrator. Also gave you control over employees trying to put bogus software on the computer. No Netscape Communicator for you! Work work work. :-)<p>Somewhere after Citrix imploded with all the problems that come with a walled garden with razor wire on the walls, we started seeing deployments using virtual machines and VNC. That gave you the &quot;what you see is what is happening&quot; feel of Citrix but now you had a different choice of operating systems and better vendor flexibility. VNC over a SSH SOCKS proxy replaced X11 over SSH as a more &quot;universal&quot; way of implementing this architectural design pattern.<p>Of course Google gave us &quot;the browser is the computer&quot; with ChromeOS and now the machine as a browser target where the browser is something more standard.<p>I like the architecture but in the previous iterations there was always some big problem it was addressing, X terminals addressed mobility, Citrix addressed enterprise configuration management, VNC&#x2F;VM addressed multiple OSes other than Windows while retaining enterprise configuration management, and ChromeOS went for a better security model, mode-less configuration, and minimal cost of entry.<p>What problem does Workstream address either better or differently than what the above solutions address&#x2F;addressed?"],"time":["2020-04-16 21:27:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["KingOfCoders"],"id":[22898221],"kids":{},"parent":[22890016],"text":["What I wonder, is there a special cloud service for compilation?

I could run them as a Linux terminal, but I usually run them with a Python program that performs the telegraph office functions.<p>The lack of lower case is less of a problem in this application than the lack of emoji. I put the entire dictionary of emoji names into the program, and it spells out the emoji as (happy face), etc. That&#x27;s amused some people who sent emoji-heavy messages.<p>The Right To Repair people would love those machines.

Thus, it is not impossible to improve precision on a small scale by the correct operations. So, when we build this stuff, it is necessary at each step to improve the accuracy of the equipment by working for awhile down there, making accurate lead screws, Johansen blocks, and all the other materials which we use in accurate machine work at the higher level. We have to stop at each level and manufacture all the stuff to go to the next level – a very long and very difficult program. Perhaps you can figure a better way than that to get down to small scale more rapidly.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Many ideas contributed to the modern process of 5nm lithography, but having flat surface plates whose precision is determined by the correct application of operations rather than an external standard has turned out to be one of the most profound.<p>Now, of course, you can buy a granite surface place with accuracy exceeding almost anything available 100 years ago, for $30.

GraphQL is better when what you are requesting is best expressed as a tree (or a &quot;graph&quot;, though only the DAG variety). This is not always the case, but it very often is when building API:s for production use.<p>Of course, you <i>can<\/i> express tree structures in table form, but it is not very convenient for clients to consume. In particular if your client is rendering nested component views, what you want is very often something hierarchical.<p>Another aspect of GraphQL that is better for us production people is that the performance is more predictable, exactly because the language is more restricted. You can&#x27;t just join in all the things,  or select billions of rows by accident. The schema dictates what is allowed.<p>Of course, again, it is possible to restrict this in SQL, just configure your schemas, limits etc appropriately, but SQL is anything-goes by default, whereas GraphQL is nothing is allowed by default. Whitelist vs Blacklist.<p>This said, as a language, SQL is clearly superior. It is the most (only?) successful 4GL (declarative) language. I wish more languages were this well-designed, and that there would be more language innovation in this direction.<p>The way I see it, GraphQL is a DSL for flexibly requesting hierarchical data from API:s in JSON format, optimized for complex evolving API:s. SQL is a full-fledged generic language for relational data transformation. They have different niches, but SQL has a much bigger one.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joakimlundborg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1250916922029457408\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joakimlundborg&#x2F;status&#x2F;125091692202945740...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-17 00:55:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kabes"],"id":[22893371],"kids":[22893538,22894641,22893717],"parent":[22892946],"text":["The author makes a case for just sending sql queries from the frontend.

Implementing GraphQL endpoint is as simple as specifying a set fo resolver functions (parent, args) -&gt; result (of course there could be more sophisticated implementation but the point is that you can start just from that). Now if you want to implement a &quot;virtual table&quot; which would work with SQL — it&#x27;s much more work.<p>I&#x27;d be very cautious to expose SQL based API (because the languages is so expressive). And if I&#x27;d have a task to make SQL less expressive to make it fit then it&#x27;d probably look a lot like GraphQL but with a weird syntax.<p>2. Secondly, SQL is not really as ergonomic as GraphQL for nested data. Even given the modern extensions, it is designed for querying relations, not for nested object structures we like to operate in our JavaScript programs.<p>3. And third, SQL grammar isn&#x27;t as composable as GraphQL one. Look how GraphQL has fragments in the language to support composability. It&#x27;d be very weird to do the same with SQL.

I found this [1] deeply fascinating. Some highlights:<p>- Corporate earnings have been pretty much flat since 2014 (this one in particularly surprised me). So the last 5 years has been a disconnect between earnings and valuation and that always comes crashing back to earth at some point, Covid-19 was just the spark.<p>- The demand for US dollars will likely devastate some developing nations (who borrow in US dollars) with all that entails;<p>- The US is in a fiscally weak position;<p>- Because of the strong dollar and huge deficit the US essentially has to print money to buy its own bonds. A real (rather than nominal) devaluation in US government debt is not out of the question;<p>On the Covid-19 front:<p>- Making a vaccine takes time. Proving it works and is safe takes time. Even after you&#x27;ve done all that you have to manufacture it somehow. This is a nontrivial problem. For the flu vaccine the US government actually pays billions to grow eggs for this purpose [2]. This is unsatisfactory in many ways and there has been a long search for an alternative but so far to no avail. Influenza viruses reproduce in chicken eggs. Coronaviruses do not.<p>- It will take time--possibly <i>years<\/i>--for spending to return to previous levels. We have examples of this already with the SARS and MERS outbreaks in Hong Kong and South Korea where spending took 6 and 12 months respectively to return to previous levels [3].<p>- Some industries will take years to recover. Cruise lines are an obvious one but airlines, hotels and tourism are in the same boat (at least it&#x27;s not the Diamond Princess). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a lot of frequent flyer miles just evaporate or getting hugely devalued;<p>- Some businesses just won&#x27;t come back. Those businesses spend money. They paid employees who spend money. All that money went to other people and businesses who then spend money.<p>- Social distancing may be here for the long term [4].<p>- My own belief is that the protracted response to this is there will be some permanent changes in behaviour. This will create new opportunities but also devastate some sectors.<p>For some reason, share buybacks are the latest bogeyman and I really don&#x27;t understand why. They&#x27;re just another form of dividend (ie returning money to shareholders). Borrowing money at low interest for share buybacks is just a tax deferment strategy (one that I don&#x27;t think should exist but it does).<p>There&#x27;s still significant market and economic downside potential and at best I think we&#x27;ll have stagnant growth for several years.<p>The problem here is that many people now have no memory of what an actual recession looks like.
