While CDOs were involved in the last financial crisis, they weren&#x27;t the fundamental culprit. That honor would belong to ill-coordinated banking regulations between the US and Europe.<p>In order to provide a public backstop without encouraging moral hazard, banking regulators impose risk-taking limitations on banks. In the US, this took the form of encouraging asset sales into capital markets, under the assumption that this would make any risk the banks take dissipate away harmlessly. In the EU, this took the form of leverage limits based off the credit rating of the asset, with the highest rated asset commanding the largest leverage limits.<p>These regulations combined in a very unfortunate way in the transatlantic CDO trade. The CDO part isn&#x27;t the important innovation, though; as long as the above structure persisted, <i>something<\/i> would be found to take advantage of it. Anyhow, the short of the crisis is that American banks would sell their risky assets into concentrated positions of systematically important banks, particularly ones outside of the narrow American regulatory purview. On the other side of the Atlantic, they accidentally applied a <i>massive<\/i> incentive to figure out a way to slap an AAA rating on stuff, and the market delivered that in spades.<p>The cherry on top of this entire system is that when American banks make loans, this cash gets transferred and winds up sitting in some money market fund somewhere. These funds are searching for short-term dollar-denominated yields, and the best way to get that is to lend money to European banks secured by AAA-rated assets.

Many investors (e.g. insurance companies, pension funds) need to match liabilities with assets yielding reliable returns. With a constrained supply of safe assets, this demand drives yields down. Austrian economists argue that the resulting level of interest rates may be artificially low, leading to &#x27;malinvestment&#x27; [1], a misallocation of investments that ultimately leads to economic contraction.<p>CDOs attempt to manufacture safe assets from riskier ones. Various debts are pooled, then the pool is divided into &#x27;tranches&#x27;. Each tranche has a different rating, indicating riskiness of the tranche, according to the tranche&#x27;s claim on distributions. A higher rated tranche will get paid before riskier tranches, allowing investors to choose their risk tolerance. Riskier tranches have higher yields commensurate with a greater risk of not being paid.<p>In theory, this structure is sound, provided that the debt being pooled has known characteristics. During the financial crisis, ratings fraud contributed to the breakdown of CDOs [2]. Lenders made unsound loans and lied about the characteristics of the collateral and the borrowers. Ratings agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&amp;P) then rated this debt as being less risky than it actually was, due to having false information and perverse compensation incentives. Additionally, structurers assumed that diversifying geographically would prevent correlated defaults on individual debts (which was not the case). These assumptions led to CDOs having unsound risk pools. More exotic products, like CDO squared (CDOs composed of CDOs), further amplified problems.<p>Similar products (e.g. CLOs) have been in high demand, as there is a genuine need for safe assets. Ideally CDOs can be produced without succumbing to the issues they faced during the financial crisis. The current interest rate environment exhibits suspicious behaviors, including negative yielding sovereign debt and investment grade&#x2F;high yield spreads [3][4] roughly as tight as they were prior the financial crisis. Increasing the supply of safe assets may help lead to a rates environment that would previously have been considered normal.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voxeu.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;safe-asset-shortage-rise-mark-ups-and-decline-labour-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voxeu.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;safe-asset-shortage-rise-mark-ups-...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Malinvestment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Malinvestment<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;macromarketmusings.blogspot.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;academic-vs-wall-street-economists.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;macromarketmusings.blogspot.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;academic-vs-...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;BAMLC0A0CM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;BAMLC0A0CM<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;BAMLH0A0HYM2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;BAMLH0A0HYM2&#x2F;<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-29 17:57:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22182317],"kids":{},"parent":[22181758],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-29 17:29:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22182133],"kids":{},"parent":[22181758],"text":{},"time":["2020-01-29 17:16:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["csense"],"id":[22186363],"kids":[22186469,22186714],"parent":[22181758],"text":["Hopefully by now, everyone knows a bunch of banks bought CDO&#x27;s, and then in &#x27;08 they collapsed, or nearly did, and took the world economy with them.<p>If you run a bank, and you know this product is dangerous and causes banks to fail, why in the world would you buy one of these products?

It is a deep, multivalent historical process with many radically different stakeholders over many different time-scales. People who invent technology never get to set the rules for what is done with it<p>Well said.  Pessimism is a reasonable reaction to this sweeping line, but I offer a quick summary of what I hope is non-naive optimism:<p>1) Problem: When we think technology is neutral, we miss how it creates <i>niches<\/i> outside our intended design and social&#x2F;political constraints, since the environment of economics thwarts all.  We have agency as individuals, yes, but the environment rewards and select for <i>any<\/i> uses of the technology which yield advantage.  “If you incentivize something, it will happen.”<p>2) Solution?: Nobody fucking knows.  But “Game ~B” is what people are calling a nascent research effort to identify what attributes a more cohesive civilization must have to allow better collective “sense-making” and “choice-making” so we may become capable of directing technology instead of leaving it to the emergent dynamics of hapless competition. What&#x27;s also interesting are the considerations for employing antifragile, transitionary social structures that can thrive in our current entrenched “Game A” dynamics to plant said attributes.  Gotta change the underlying rules instead of designing atop those which are broken.<p>3) Future Ethics: I&#x27;ve also seen some excitement about a so-called non-relativistic ethical framework within Game~B, called The Immanent Metaphysics. It claims to be commensurable with — but not derivable from — science, rigorously formalizing intuitive ethical principles, to at least create a consistent grounding for making effective ethical choices.[1] The hope is to better inform (but not determine) our use of technology after we step into a more coherent phase of civilization.

I can&#x27;t remember the last time that was a problem. I was definitely doing it on a daily basis back when KDE was somewhere at a 3.x release, so before 2008. At least single-monitor setups work fine, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried it on multi-monitor setups in a very long time.

It <i>might<\/i> help.<p>Well, this blog post barely scratches the surface.<p>The Linux userspace display stack is currently undergoing a big overhaul, following the changes that happened in the kernel a few years ago (DRI3, KMS, atomic modesetting, etc).<p>All of this made Wayland possible. That, plus the fact that apps rasterize their surfaces themselves nowadays (GPU-accelerated trough OpenGL&#x2F;Vulkan).<p>So, here comes Wayland with a new security model: you can&#x27;t spy on other windows, so you cannot hack together a desktop sharing solution. A proper, cross-desktop solution is actually being worked on: pipewire[1].<p>Pipewire aims to replace both pulseaudio <i>and<\/i> jack for audio, and bring video in as well. So you will be able to direct which video feed goes where, use the same webcam for multiple applications, and have applications take a video feed, transform it, and plug it elsewhere. You can see where this is fitting with desktop sharing: one feed per window, one feed per screen, one feed for the whole desktop, plus variants. Want to overlay a webcam? No problem. Everything is backed by Gstreamer for realtime hardware-accelerated video encoding&#x2F;decoding.<p>And the icing on the cake: Flatpak spearheaded the development of &quot;portals&quot;[2]: cross-desktop interfaces for individual programs to ask the user when accessing restricted resources (like a microphone, or a folder on your computer).<p>So, what&#x27;s needed here is:<p>* Finish up pipewire and have it shipped on most distributions (should be installed in fedora 31, optional for sound in 32, default for sound in 33)<p>* Have compositors talk to pipewire [3]<p>* Have browsers and other software talk to pipewire [4]<p>* ???<p>* Profit<p>Good progress is being made on these points, except maybe the last? I expect support to start working out-of-the-box in some distros&#x2F;browser&#x2F;compositor combinations in 2020. Actually, support seems further along than I thought it was. But it seems that wlroots-based compositor haven&#x27;t yet decided to support the xdg screensharing portal, and rely instead on a custom wayland extension. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if such a portal is implemented for those.<p>The main issue here is everyone waiting on everyone else before enabling&#x2F;implementing it. But it looks like we&#x27;re 80% there, and it just needs to be enabled in some cases (and pipewire installed). Then it will trickle down to most distros and electrons apps.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think legacy X apps will be able to continue sharing the desktop (they can still be shared by wayland capture programs, or capture the desktop if they implement the new interface). I guess pipewire might be able to create a virtual webcam for these, though.<p>Valve might be working on their own stack with their &quot;Gamescope&quot; wayland compositor[5], for their streaming solution.<p>And in the end, this should work much better, with hardware encoding, actual security, zero copy, etc. Hopefully there won&#x27;t be a &quot;next big thing&quot; that breaks everything in just a few years.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipewire.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipewire.org&#x2F;<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;PipeWire\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;PipeWire<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.github.io&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal&#x2F;portal-docs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.github.io&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal&#x2F;portal-docs.htm...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.github.io&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal&#x2F;portal-docs.html#gdbus-org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.github.io&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal&#x2F;portal-docs.htm...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgrulich.cz&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;screen-sharing-in-plasma-wayland-session&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgrulich.cz&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;screen-sharing-in-plasma-wayla...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgrulich.cz&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-to-enable-and-use-screen-sharing-on-wayland&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgrulich.cz&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-to-enable-and-use-screen-...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;Mutter&#x2F;RemoteDesktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;Mutter&#x2F;RemoteDesktop<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;linux&#x2F;comments&#x2F;8le7rm&#x2F;first_steps_for_kde_screencast_on_wayland&#x2F;dzfqftz&#x2F;?context=8&amp;depth=9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;linux&#x2F;comments&#x2F;8le7rm&#x2F;first_steps_f...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emersion&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal-wlr&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emersion&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal-wlr&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1496359\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1496359<\/a> (looks disabled by default at compile time)<p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=682122\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=682122<\/a> (pipewire disabled in chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;flags until v81 due to waiting on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flatpak&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal-gtk&#x2F;issues&#x2F;204\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flatpak&#x2F;xdg-desktop-portal-gtk&#x2F;issues&#x2F;204<\/a> &quot;dialog hell&quot; it seems)<p>[4] zoom currently uses a gnome-specific screenshot API as a workaround: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dr8yld&#x2F;zoom_screenshare_via_screenshot_emulation&#x2F;f6gfzds&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dr8yld&#x2F;zoom_screens...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamingonlinux.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;valve-give-a-little-more-info-on-what-gamescope-actually-does-for-linux-gaming.15783&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamingonlinux.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;valve-give-a-little-m...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-29 14:25:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["7777fps"],"id":[22179629],"kids":[22181081,22179702],"parent":[22178011],"text":["Hacker news, where everyone proves the point by recommending a dozen different solutions."],"time":["2020-01-29 13:10:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["swiley"],"id":[22179963],"kids":{},"parent":[22178011],"text":["The sad state of wayland on Linux."],"time":["2020-01-29 13:58:45"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cygned"],"id":[22179821],"kids":[22179839],"parent":[22178011],"text":["A colleague of mine streams one of his screens through VLC and then to Skype to have proper one-screen sharing."],"time":["2020-01-29 13:40:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Jedd"],"id":[22179428],"kids":[22179483,22185088,22180870],"parent":[22178011],"text":["I&#x27;ve had good success with krfb &#x2F; krdc -- but on both sides of that it&#x27;s been one monitor only.<p>TeamViewer is good, but ohmy is it expensive if you want to use it for commercial purposes.

Mobile Internet is only available at very low speeds, according to a report from The Wire.<p>When government officials in India decided to shut down the Internet, software engineers working for an IT and data analytics firm lost half a day of work and fell behind in delivering a project for clients based in London. A hotel was unable to pay its employees or manage online bookings for tourists. A major hospital delayed staff salary payments and restricted its medical services to the outpatient and emergency departments.<p>At a time when many concerns surround online censorship by authoritarian governments, India represents both the world’s largest democracy and the world leader in deploying Internet shutdowns as a political tool. Since August 2019, Indian officials have maintained the longest Internet blackout ever to occur in a democracy, in the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. Broad legal and regulatory government authority over Internet service providers has also enabled officials to frequently order short-term Internet shutdowns on a regional and even city district level.<p>“One of the reasons why India has so many shutdowns is that the institutional framework enables them,” says Jan Rydzak, a research analyst at Ranking Digital Rights, a nonprofit research institute based in Washington, D.C. “It is a framework where local officials have very broad discretion to order shutdowns.”<p>That institutional framework helped India implement more than 100 Internet shutdowns in 2019, according to the Internet Shutdown Tracker run by the Software Freedom Law Centre in New Delhi. A conservative estimate by the Top10VPN website found that the 2019 shutdowns alone cost India’s economy at least US $1.3 billion last year—not including the many cases where officials blacked out mobile communications within individual city districts for several hours.<p>Another report [PDF] by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations previously found that Internet shutdowns cost the national economy approximately $3 billion between 2012 to 2017. And it documented many examples of the economic impact felt by individual workers, students, businesses, and even government officials.<p>“Every single statistic you’re going to see on the total number of shutdowns by country shows that India just dwarfs every other country on the planet and most likely has had more shutdowns in the past five years than every other country on the planet [combined],” Rydzak says.<p>The Indian government’s powers represent “colonial vestiges” of laws first implemented during the British Empire’s rule over India, says Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital liberties nonprofit based in New Delhi, India. Such power stems in part from the Section 144 Criminal Procedure Code that empowers officials to prohibit large gatherings and block the Internet in specific geographic areas in the name of public order.<p>India’s central government also gets regulatory power over the Internet from the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which originally gave British colonial officials authority over telegraph lines in India. This provided the basis for India’s government to implement Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules in 2017 that further formalized the way officials could issue orders for Internet shutdowns.<p>As a result, the government needs no advanced kill-switch for the nation’s Internet—local officials have the legal authority to compel individual telecom companies to manually shut down services. When ordering an Internet shutdown, officials typically write a letter and email it to all Internet service providers with regional offices in a specific geographic area, Gupta explains. The Internet service providers then block all incoming and outgoing data moving through cellphone towers and fiber-optic networks in that particular area.<p>More than 90 percent of India’s estimated 451 million active Internet users rely on their phones’ mobile data plans for online access, according to a report [PDF] by the Internet and Mobile Association of India. And India’s network of cellphone towers is dominated by just a handful of major telecom companies, including Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel. That makes it fairly straightforward for officials to lean on these big telecom companies when ordering Internet shutdowns.<p>“It’s fairly easy because you don’t have a large multiplicity of backbone providers in India,” Gupta says.<p>In practice, India’s Internet shutdowns resemble a total communications blackout that also blocks phone calls and text messaging services alongside data connectivity. One recent example came from the government ordering the big telecoms to shut down voice and Internet services in the capital of New Delhi and other cities during protests over a new and controversial citizenship law in December.<p>More than 90 percent of India’s estimated 451 million active Internet users rely on their phones’ mobile data plans for online access.\nThe government usually justifies shutdowns as necessary to maintain public order and prevent violence during times of unrest. But Rydzak’s research has found that India’s Internet blackouts have not reduced levels of protest, and may have even worsened violence during such periods.<p>On a similar note, Gupta pointed out that protesters are more likely to use mobile communication and Internet access “to coordinate messages of safety, to organize peacefully, and to challenge the government within constitutional means,” as well as to record and share pictures and videos of any excessive violent responses by law enforcement.<p>Furthermore, government officials have not been very transparent about publishing the written legal orders they’re supposed to provide in the case of Internet shutdowns. The government has typically resisted making such orders public, Gupta says, even in response to lawyers’ requests made under India’s right to information law. That makes it tricky to understand and potentially challenge a given Internet shutdown order.<p>“Without such orders, the public cannot address judicial forums and assert constitutional rights in challenges,” Gupta says. “It prevents people from having their day in court.”<p>That may now be changing. On 10 January, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the ongoing Internet shutdown and other suspensions of civil rights in Kashmir represent a violation of constitutional fundamental rights. Specifically, the Supreme Court of India pointed out that the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules do not allow for indefinite suspension of Internet services, says N. S. Nappinai, a Supreme Court of India lawyer and a cyber law expert.<p>The Supreme Court ruling requires Indian officials to review the Internet shutdown orders about every five to seven days and publish the orders to demonstrate their legal basis. Such requirements for greater transparency and “adherence to the settled tests of proportionality and due process” would also apply to future Internet shutdown orders, Nappinai explains.

Anything older than prior year is electronic. Some current year documentation is not yet scanned, but will be during the tax prep season<p>* Second, backups. Follow the rule of three. One offsite (crashplan), two onsite (main computer + storage device), three different file systems (whatever crashplan uses, OSX, Netgear &#x2F; USB). I test my offsite recovery monthly with a sample selection.<p>* Three, I have a single precise location on computer with directories for each tax year.<p>* Four, I have subdirectories under each tax year that have a consistent retention requirement. 1 year after filing, 3 years, 5 years (FBAR), 7 years, until my retirement so +30 years, and until my death so +50 years, and active meaning do-not-delete until the tax event closes whereupon the retention period can be set. So like US bank statements that have a 1099, statements go into directory A with a 1 year retention. 1099s go into a different directory with a 3 year retention. A purchase of a new stock, the confirmation for that transaction would go under &quot;active&quot; meaning there is no deletion date, and that confirm would stay under &quot;active&quot; until the stock position was sold. At time of sale, that data is refiled into the correct tax year, where the appropriate retention period is applied to the info.<p>* Five, I use an application called TagSpaces, create a date specific retention framework, then tag each sub-directory from steps three and four with a destruction date. So tag &quot;2019-12-31-7yr&quot; was applied I think to tax year 2011. This past new year, I checked all objects tagged &quot;2019-12-31-7yr&quot;, made sure nothing was misfiled under the tag, and then delete the object.

In that field, the iPad Pro, specifically the Procreate app, has been revolutionary -- every single famous digital illustrator, concept artist, and comics artist I follow on Instagram has one, and they post gorgeous work done on them regularly. It&#x27;s the only tool that comes remotely close to challenging the gold standard workflow of Wacom tablet + Photoshop, and Wacom and Adobe have been feeling the heat, ratcheting up their marketing efforts to try and attract back budding young artists to their tools.<p>On the other hand, the iPad can&#x27;t seem to actually <i>replace<\/i> those tools. Those pro artists still use a Wacom for their professional corporate work. The problem is less the software, I think, than the limitations the software forces by nature of the hardware. For professional work, you need as big a screen as possible -- Wacoms go up to 32&quot;. You also need hotkeys for an efficient workflow. Hunting and tapping through menus on a touchscreen is, by nature, going to be slower then having your left hand ready to hit the undo command at a moment&#x27;s notice. Sure, it might be possible to plug a big external screen and a full keyboard into your iPad, but at that point, is it really an iPad anymore?

It&#x27;s not very good at replacing a full professional art setup on a desktop. But should it really aspire to be? In other words, I agree with this article, but disagree with its conclusions.

My main gripe is keyboard behavior which is very buggy, but not related to how easy&#x2F;hard it is to make and move apps around the screen.<p>The fact is that the iPad is only useful because of its software. In my case it&#x27;d be useless without Files, Working Copy, Blink, Wireguard, and Screens. Only 1 of those is built-in and still it&#x27;s a fairly recent addition. And it&#x27;s the latest version on iOS 13 which is really the version which turbo-charged using many apps together easily. I use these apps to pretty much avoid directly using my &quot;real computers&quot; as much as possible via VMs or remote access via Wireguard.<p>But, I think we&#x27;re only seeing the beginning of the iPad. I can relate to the feeling that <i>&quot;we should have more of what we expected by now&quot;<\/i>, but the fact is that designing these power user interfaces, actually redesigning them for touch while making them compatible with existing ones, is very difficult.<p>A great example for HN is how we develop like we&#x27;re in the 70s with text terminals and executing commands. Where on the iPad it might make more sense for the terminal to be rich like a REPL where commands&#x2F;expressions act more like the results of a Shortcut (rich data, not just text) or code might be edited as an AST instead of the text which allows the concept of a &quot;source file&quot; to go away and instead there be a source database.

Fair point there. Apple can still breathe life going forward for developers by rebooting the developer ecosystem. 10 years on the tablet has just arrived for productivity.

We also have abstractions like &quot;files&quot; or &quot;desktop icons&quot; that a user can interact with in a consistent way independent of application.<p>This way of design has pitfalls: You can choose the wrong metaphors and paint yourself into a corner, you can overvalue consistency to the point the UI becomes cumbersome to use or you can find that a new feature doesn&#x27;t fit into your abstractions and you have to shoehorn it in. However, what this design guarantees is that the user has some basic tools to orient themselves, without needing to consult a manual for everything or remember some random onboarding popup that appeared a week ago when the user had completely other things on their mind.<p>I feel today, UI design has shifted away from common abstractions to the point it&#x27;s almost seen as an anti-pattern. Instead, the design process is started with assembling an exhaustive list of &quot;use cases&quot; or &quot;user stories&quot;: The app is supposed to enable the user to do the tasks on the list - and <i>only<\/i> those tasks. Then, every item on the list is passed, one-by-one to the UI team, who add a button, gesture or other affordance to perform <i>exactly<\/i> that task. Finally, users are watched via telemetry to see if they are using the app as intended and if any additional tasks must be added via the above procedure.<p>This method of design does have advantages: The most common tasks are easy to access, even if they are, by themselves, complex procedures involving different components (such as &quot;make a photo, color-correct it, upload it to Twitter and refer to it in a tweet&quot;).<p>On the other hand, everything that falls outside ymthe immediate attention of the developers becomes ridiculously hard to do or even impossible: Take the above photo, but <i>zip<\/i> it, then send it in an email? Sorry, you need an app for that. Take a photo, color-correct it and send it to mastodon? Sorry, not integrated. Etc, etc.<p>To be honest, I have no idea if modern UI design really is done like this, but it very often feels that way. I really wonder if a return to some well-dosed consistency wouldn&#x27;t improve a whole lot of things both for casual <i>and<\/i> power users."],"time":["2020-01-28 15:11:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["throw0101a"],"id":[22169819],"kids":{},"parent":[22166421],"text":["The iPad (and tablets in general) have really changed the game when it comes to flying.

Thank you for all of the feedback! I can address a few of the issues you&#x27;ve raised...<p>Missing some products. This is a known bug in how I&#x27;m currently importing product data from Amazon&#x27;s API. Some products are listed with variations that appear on the same product page but are completely separate products in Amazon&#x27;s catalog. There&#x27;s no way to get the API to return all of the variations at once, so I have to perform several subrequests to enumerate those. Currently, that doesn&#x27;t happen. However, I&#x27;m in the process of reworking a lot of the data import code to use the new PA-API 5.0 and am planning to make variations work properly with those changes.<p>Filter by products sold by Amazon. Initially, diskprices.com was set to filter out products not sold by Amazon, but I received quite a bit of feedback asking me to remove that filter as some of the best deals are from resellers. The new PA-API does have a populated Merchant field for most products, so I may try to expose that.<p>Display prices including shipping costs. This is addressed in the FAQ (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diskprices.com&#x2F;faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diskprices.com&#x2F;faq.html<\/a>), but it really comes down to privacy. I&#x27;d need you to login with your Amazon account or give me your location in order to compute tax and shipping information and I really don&#x27;t want the burden of handling PII.<p>Clicking the Back button does weird things. This is a bug. Whenever you change a filter, a bit of JavaScript updates the URL in your address bar so that you can copy&#x2F;paste a link to the page you&#x27;re looking at with the current filters and send it to someone. It appears I&#x27;m not capturing the Back event and updating the filters to match the address bar. I&#x27;ll get this fixed soon.<p>External SSD category is missing. Up until the last few months, there really weren&#x27;t many external SSDs for sale on Amazon, but it looks like this is definitely becoming it&#x27;s own product category, so I&#x27;ll add it.<p>Add Amazon.co.jp. Funny story, diskprices.com had support for Amazon Japan when I first launched it, but they suspended my account and sent an email telling me why, written in japanese. Google Translate couldn&#x27;t make any sense of the email and I&#x27;d had some significant data quality issues with the filters, so I decided not to pursue it further. This is the first time somebody&#x27;s asked for Amazon.co.jp support. I&#x27;ll look into setting it up again, but Amazon&#x27;s added some new restrictions on API access across all regions since then, so it&#x27;s a bit more difficult to get new regions added now.<p>Account for per-port cost in calculating prices. This is something I&#x27;ve been thinking about for a while. I think this feature ends up looking a lot like pcpartpicker, with a constraint solver bolted on the side... Given a set of parameters for total capacity, redundancy, bandwidth, etc, optimize for the best price&#x2F;performance. I currently don&#x27;t have enough metadata about most of the drives to implement this properly and it&#x27;s a big feature to develop, but it&#x27;s something I want to experiment with eventually.<p>Again, thank you all for the feedback!<p>edit: formatting"],"time":["2020-01-28 07:50:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Havoc"],"id":[22167158],"kids":[22167448],"parent":[22156292],"text":["More interested in the tech behind the website.

For two reasons:<p>1) it completely breaks the functional programming model that we all learned as toddlers (instead of call A and then, after that&#x27;s done, call B, Async is call A which just installs B as a callback, returns immediately and then an &quot;event loop&quot; calls B).

By clicking and popping up a pie menu, looking at the labels, moving the cursor in the desired direction, then clicking to make a selection, you learn the menu and practice the gesture to “mark ahead” (“mouse ahead” in the case of a mouse, “wave ahead” in the case of a dataglove). With a little practice, it becomes quite easy to mark ahead even through nested pie menus.<p>&gt;For the expert, they’re efficient because — without even looking — you can move in any direction, and mark ahead so fast that the menu doesn’t even pop up. Only when used more slowly like a traditional menu, does a pie menu pop up on the screen, to reveal the available selections.<p>&gt;Most importantly, novices soon become experts, because every time you select from a pie menu, you practice the motion to mark ahead, so you naturally learn to do it by feel! As Jaron Lanier of VPL Research has remarked, “The mind may forget, but the body remembers.” Pie menus take advantage of the body’s ability to remember muscle motion and direction, even when the mind has forgotten the corresponding symbolic labels.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@donhopkins&#x2F;pie-menus-936fed383ff1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@donhopkins&#x2F;pie-menus-936fed383ff1<\/a><p>&gt;Pie Menus: A 30 Year Retrospective<p>&gt;By Don Hopkins, Ground Up Software, May 15, 2018.<p>&gt;Pie menus should support an important technique called “Mouse Ahead Display Preemption”. Pie menus either lead, follow, or get out of the way. When you don’t know them, they lead you. When you are familiar with them, they follow. And when you’re really familiar with them, they get out of the way, you don’t see them. Unless you stop. And in which case, it then pops up the whole tree."],"time":["2020-01-29 01:54:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["CodingSucks"],"id":[22175553],"kids":{},"parent":[22169775],"text":["Aaron Schwartz didn&#x27;t kill himself."],"time":["2020-01-29 00:56:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["thrower123"],"id":[22170069],"kids":[22170182],"parent":[22169775],"text":["The Epstein connections are deeply concerning."],"time":["2020-01-28 16:11:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jstewartmobile"],"id":[22170141],"kids":{},"parent":[22169775],"text":["It&#x27;s ok to take the convicted pedophile&#x27;s money.

A major reason I want to use a device management system is to make sure we can fix potential OS-level security issues.<p>Another concern is pricing. $5&#x2F;device&#x2F;mo is probably fine for enterprise, but that can be 100% of revenue for many consumer devices.

When I saw your post on HN, I visited your github page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane<\/a>) to learn more.<p>I was a bit surprised by the numbers on the github landing page which showed 800+ stars and 60+ forks. I typically look at these numbers to get a indication of project activity&#x2F;popularity, obviously not the only metric to look at but normally a pretty good first data point.<p>This got me interested to learn more, as my initial though was that this project must have been around for a while with an active community. But things did not add up, the project only had 3 contributors (probably people from the company behind the project).<p>Looking closer at the forks (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;network&#x2F;members\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;network&#x2F;members<\/a>), majority of them reference a different repository name (npm-algos) which does not seem to at all related to deviceplane. Then it became apparent to me that this must have been a rename of an organization and repository, as <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;npm-algos&#x2F;npm-algos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;npm-algos&#x2F;npm-algos<\/a> redirects to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane<\/a>.<p>Now I became even more suspicions on what is going on here. So I did a bit more digging using the github API and looking up when the repository got their stars which showed that majority of the 800+ stars came before 2019-01 which was the &quot;initial commit&quot; of the deviceplane repository and the stars where dating back to 2015, so they must have been for the &quot;npm-algos&quot; repository.<p>Then to the conclusion, it seems that an older unrelated repository was repurposed (renamed) to manipulate metrics on github to provide a misleading view of activity&#x2F;popularity. I find it hard to believe that something like this happened &quot;accidentally&quot;, git repositories are fairly cheap :) and renaming an organization&#x2F;repository on github is a somewhat involved process.<p>This is a practice I have never seen before, and not sure I like it. The goal seems to be to mislead users.<p>Would love to hear thoughts from the deviceplane folks, but also from the HN community."],"time":["2020-01-31 10:18:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jackhalford"],"id":[22174041],"kids":[22174087],"parent":[22171446],"text":["I tried to enroll a server into deviceplane but there is a hard requirement on systemd.<p>Are there any plans in the future to support more linux distributions?"],"time":["2020-01-28 22:08:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tacLog"],"id":[22174357],"kids":[22174398],"parent":[22171446],"text":["Hey I was trying to reach out to sales@deviceplane.com and keep getting:\n550 5.1.1 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable\nIs there a better way to reach out?"],"time":["2020-01-28 22:41:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simlevesque"],"id":[22173472],"kids":{},"parent":[22171446],"text":["Could you compare your product to AWS GreenGrass ?
