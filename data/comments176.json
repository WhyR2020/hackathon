However, that grammatical framework served me incredibly well as time went on. I found it filled in holes of knowledge without need to go back and correct them later. IMO, it is not a bad place to start, a traditional grammar focused class.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for tips, the biggest is to maximize exposure - speaking, reading, writing, hearing the language. It is simply a matter of time if you force yourself into it. In addition to everyday language practice with my colleagues to do my job (don&#x27;t let them speak your native tongue with you, ever!), I hosted french movie nights, read in french, and installed Antidote for my emails (seriously - if you&#x27;re learning French, buy Antidote).<p>Seriously, don&#x27;t let them speak your native tongue with you, ever, for any reason. Force the language you want to learn without exception - conversation language patterns are very, very hard to undo once set.<p>Last point: Contrary to the author, &quot;heavily accented French&quot; to me is France French, I am far less fluent with it.

For some reason people seem to think that you&#x27;re not immersing in a language unless you&#x27;re in a country where that language is frequently used. They somehow equate being immersed in a language with physically being in a country where that language is frequently used.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, being in a country is a great way to immerse yourself in a language, but it is by no means a requirement.<p>In terms of exposure to content in the language you&#x27;re learning, what&#x27;s the difference between someone who is living in a country where they see that language on TV, in the newspapers, hear it on the radio, and speak it with native speakers, versus someone who watches content in that language on youtube, reads articles&#x2F;newspapers online in that language, talks online with people who speak that language, but lives somewhere where they don&#x27;t speak it? Not much.<p>Setting up a &quot;local immersion environment&quot; requires putting effort into finding native resources and trying to reduce your exposure towards your native language. It&#x27;s certainly more effort than being in a country where you can&#x27;t help but be surrounded by your target language, but it&#x27;s definitely not impossible.<p>The idea that listening to music, listening to podcasts, watching youtube videos and reading articles in your target language is not immersion is silly, since this is what native speakers living in their country experience on a daily basis.

I never completed it all, but there&#x27;s not much left.<p>-Then I followed a couple major Danish newspapers on Twitter.

So thanks for the long and detailed write up.<p>I wanted to point out that the limitations that were encountered are normal. The OP learned 95% of what can be learned without living in the culture itself. Sure, you could learn all these extra details by chatting online, but it’s not until you need the vocabulary to get something from the French bureaucracy or to do your job that it all sinks in.<p>1. Don’t worry about Québécois, most French cannot understand it either. I once saw an interview on French public television that subtitled the French (Québécois) in French. To the French from France, it’s a very heavy and rustic accent, such as an Irish or Scottish brogue to an American English speaker. And it has its own local variations, such as between urban and countryside, with all its own idioms as well. The subtitled conversation was an old person in the country, young urban dwellers know to speak slower and clearer on purpose, unless they get familiar with slang and cussing.<p>2. Verlan is also just slang, interjections, and cussing, what the young and hip youth speak to be unintelligible on purpose. It also has overtones of poor, working-class, and immigrant identity, thus many layers and uses. Many words have made it into mainstream speech, though never into formal or newscaster speech. And when verlan words became mainstream, the original speakers just flipped the words again and kept on going (not sure if there have been 3 reversals yet). Like in any language, familiar speech can be a minefield: what’s used and appropriate depends on whether you are speaking to friends, homies, co-workers, managers, shop-keepers, bureaucrats, family, children, etc,<p>3. Phrasing just takes time and exposure to native speakers. All languages have these subtleties, such as gynmase &lt;-&gt; salle de sport and how they are used, so you can only learn them through exposure, not vocabulary decks. Plus the concepts are cultural as well, sometimes we don’t have the equivalent concept in American culture, and vice-versa, the concept you want to convey isn’t apparent in French culture (for example, membership gyms with weight rooms and such are relatively new in France). The salle de sport might be closest to a rec center or the Y, but both have slightly different cultural connotations in American English as well. This sample also shows how you are&#x2F;were translating phrases and ideas from English. They sound vaguely off to a French speaker because they would approach the whole topic with different concepts and constructs. That level of expression cannot come until you live in the culture for years and interiorize it’s thought patterns.<p>4. Verb tenses have rules and everything, but they later just boil down to an extensive vocabulary: you just memorize the words for each case, in the sense that your brain just knows the words for each subject-verb combination. We do the same in English for a few remaining times we use complex tenses: would you have known, what could you have done, etc.<p>5. All languages blend and trim words, dontcha know? The French do have a tendency to speak quickly, and compress some of the extra wordiness of the language—so it happens even more than in English.<p>6. For complex or technical topics, again it’s just about learning extensive vocabulary and word combinations. French isn’t that difficult a language to learn (compared to others) but both English and French have some of the largest vocabularies meaning there is a huge mapping from one to the other. French also has centuries of cultural expression and academic publication, and has thus developed both a special style and vocabulary for many domains."],"time":["2020-02-16 21:56:10"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["andrewzah"],"id":[22343029],"kids":[22345003,22343378],"parent":[22341983],"text":["&gt; Started consistently covering 50 new words a day on Anki<p>For anyone here who has used anki, that&#x27;s a huge number. This person is really dedicating their time at this point, because 50 new cards&#x2F;day very quickly snowballs and you&#x27;re doing 300+ reviews daily.<p>I did 20 reviews&#x2F;day for ~6 months straight for Korean, and that took me 30-60 minutes, every day. Thinking about 50&#x2F;day sounds utterly exhausting.<p>It&#x27;s a good thing a french 5k deck exists also, as they saved a lot of time on not having to make cards manually. On average a word entry takes ~1-2 minutes (I have to query 3 dictionaries), so that comes down to only ~45 words per hour...<p>---<p>&gt; <i>I firmly believe that learning languages in school, especially in the United States, is generally extremely inefficient.<\/i><p>This, so much this. Classes provide rigidity but having a tutor + finding people to talk with helps you out significantly more. I went to a language exchange that wasn&#x27;t bad* where I was able to speak for 1 hour with 1 korean person, a teacher, who would point out my mistakes and write down words when I had to dip into English. My conversational ability improved dramatically after doing that for ~1 month.<p>* Most language exchanges are shit. Because they&#x27;re unstructured. People randomly filter in&#x2F;out and a lot of people are shy or aren&#x27;t sure what to do. It often devolves into a) &quot;Any korean questions??&quot; or just general conversation. Great for making friends, terrible for seriously practicing Korean.<p>---<p>&gt; <i>As much as Duolingo likes to tell you this, 5 minutes a day of fumbling around with the mobile app isn’t going to make you fluent.<\/i><p>I get why duolingo does this. At the same time, I hate them for advertising themselves as &quot;the world&#x27;s best way to learn &lt;Language&gt;&quot;. Not only is this not true, their Japanese and Korean courses were (still are?) notoriously terrible compared to their Spanish and French courses. Not that a language can be learned from 1 resource, anyways.<p>---<p>&gt; <i>On the other hand, since I spent so many hours just casually talking with people, I got pretty good at having generic conversations.<\/i><p>This is where I got after ~12-15 months as well. I can quite easily converse about basic things like me, my hobbies, work, etc for hours but as soon as the conversation delves into a niche like politics or just more advanced discussion, I falter pretty hard. Also describing things beyond a basic level is rough: &quot;I like this, that&quot; vs &quot;The mood of the film was twisted but exhilarating&quot;.<p>---<p>What I find interesting here is how far one can progress in only 12 months with a language like Spanish or French (with a mother tongue of English). For Korean, I wasn&#x27;t even remotely close to understanding things like news articles at 12 months of study. I&#x27;m still not, because that vocabulary is quite advanced and not really used in regular conversations that much.<p>The simple truth for learning a language is as the author here mentioned: consistent and diligent studying, with humility. There is no shortcut, no one app that does it all. You just have to study, and be able to honestly evaluate yourself and your mistakes. (Recording yourself speaking the language greatly helps here)."],"time":["2020-02-16 19:36:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["commondandy"],"id":[22344623],"kids":{},"parent":[22341983],"text":["If you enjoyed this post, you will also like this one:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22344602\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22344602<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-17 01:22:23"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Denzel"],"id":[22343026],"kids":{},"parent":[22341983],"text":["Just in case the author stops by HN: I want to echo the sentiment that this post was awesome, informative, and motivating.

If the the idea here is “vouchers for gym subscription”, the closest in French would be “des abonnements à des clubs de fitness&#x2F;salles de sport”.<p>&gt; Il est évident que faire du sport nous aide beaucoup à bien gérer le stress et améliorer la santé.\nYou can improve _your_ health, not _the_ health. Given that he used “nous”, that would be “… améliorer notre santé”.<p>&gt; Cependant, il est parfois difficile de trouver le temps pour s’inscrire à un bon gymnase\nSame comment as above regarding “gymnase”.<p>&gt; et se dédier à l’assister\nLiterally translated “dedicate yourself to assist the gym [the building]”. A correct wording would be “et y être régulier”.<p>&gt; particulièrement quand on est tout seul.\nPerfectly fine.<p>&gt; Si on donne aux employés des credits pour faire du sport,\nSame comment as above regarding “crédit”.<p>&gt; il sera probable qu’ils se motiveront et ils iront le gymnase ensemble.\nHere, the conjugation (the tenses) are plain wrong – it’s really obvious yet whoever did the correction didn’t have a clue. And it lacks a preposition and a grammatical article. Literally translated “it is going to be likely that they will be motivate themselves and they would go to the place where all sorts of sports take place together”. Properly translated “il est probable que cela les motive et qu’ils participent à cette activité ensemble”.<p>&gt; Cela pourrait beaucoup réduire le stress parmi nos employés\nOk.<p>&gt; et faire en sorte que\nThat’s perfectly fine and the “correction” isn’t any better. They are synonyms.<p>&gt; notre entreprise trouve toujours le succès.\nThat’s fine from a grammatical point of view but that is not a wording that would be used in that context. Once again, the “correction” isn’t better. The general idea of the text is that, in the context of a fictional company, providing employees with vouchers for gym subscriptions could help reduce their overall stress, have a positive effect on their health and, at the end of the day, contribute to the success of the company. The last sentence would be used by a sect and would roughly translate to “our company will always manage to find success”.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runwes.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;learningfrench&#x2F;image1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runwes.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;learningfrench&#x2F;image1.png<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-17 06:14:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justlexi93"],"id":[22345350],"kids":{},"parent":[22341983],"text":["Studying French with audio is a must if you want to learn French to communicate: understand spoken French and speak French yourself.

AMA<p>Clearing some MRI misconceptions:\n1. It&#x27;s indicated ASAP in specific emergencies and will change how we manage them. For acute ischaemic stroke, it detects patients within the recomended time window for thrombolysis. Simply, it shows the cellular swelling in the brain, gives an estimate of the onset and we decide the risk&#x2F;benefits of dissolving the clot.\nSecond use, for cauda equina syndrome. Again we&#x27;re looking for acute CNS tissue damage, this time from spinal chord compression, and the change in management is emergency neurosurgery (good luck getting them out of bed without an MRI)\nFor herpes encephalitis, MRI is debatable because you can start empiric treatment. But I&#x27;ve seen it done.<p>Another misconception for the first use scenario in stroke. The MRI sequences we&#x27;re interested in only take 1-3min and CT doesn&#x27;t help us. But in my experience the whole scan takes 2h to organize, so point of care MRI is a game changer. Every minute counts when you&#x27;re saving brain tissue.\nAnd Lower definition with artifacts are acceptable because you&#x27;re looking for gross changes in a critically unwell patient.<p>Bonus: A report from when I managed my first suspected stroke as a junior doctor.<p>&quot;49yo lady day 1 post op for total knee replacement (elective admission). Commorbidities of hypertension, obesity and osteoarthritis. She was just started on apixaban and gabapentin as per protocol, when I was asked to see her for new onset upper limb bilateral tremor.<p>On examining her I found the symptoms had started 1h ago. She was presenting bilateral upper limb ataxia as well, reflexes were reduced on the left and there was numbness corresponding to C4 dermatome. \nAt this point I was worried about acute stroke whithin the 4h window for thrombolysis. I discussed the case with the acute stroke consultant and examined the patient with him. We requested an MRI brain to assess for acute posterior circulation stroke, because he thought time of onset was unclear (as per WAKE-UP protocol).\nI acompanied the patient to neuroradiology services. The MRI sequences we were most interested was DWI and FLAIR which only took a few minutes. We quickly scanned through the images noting there were was no DWI-FlAir mismatched high intensity signal areas within the brain parenchyma. This allowed us to rule out acute ischaemic stroke.<p>6h later the symptoms subsided and I was satisfied they were due to an adverse reaction to gabapentin.&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-16 08:55:11"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jackcosgrove"],"id":[22339244],"kids":[22341635,22339551,22340539,22339249,22347485,22341765],"parent":[22339059],"text":["From what I saw of this at RSNA, they were only demonstrating head scans.

This mostly is due to two reasons: the high use of the unique word processor(Hangul Word Processor) and the legacy ActiveX plugins used for cryptography when banking.<p>In the 90s, multiple internet service providers used ActiveX technology (for people who doesn’t know, it’s basically binary plugin technology to provide unlimited access to the local environment) to provide services. They were used to provide VOD services, etc... and when online shopping &amp; banking started in the mid 90s the government mandated use of a 128bit crypto algorithm. At that time, the dominant browser IE only had 40 bit crypto due to US’s export restrictions — so the 128 bit algorithm they decided to use was a independently developed algorithm called SEED, which was then implemented in ActiveX by the banks and shopping malls. This became a legacy, and for a long time even after the restriction was removed, people were forced to use ActiveX plugins until the smartphones came and the banks were forced to rewrite the system. There are still a lot of banks mandating the use of Windows for desktops — that’s one reason why the Windows was so popular.<p>Windows 10 AFAIK (I’ve never used it, so I’m not really sure) is much more strict to the binary plugins, and Internet Explorer is almost going to die — so a lot of people were staying on Windows 7, including most of the government. By the deprecation of Windows 7, the government thought that this was a good time to remove much of the legacy that enforces Windows, and is considering Linux for one of its options.<p>One of the reasons why I have some hope on this project is because the government’s use of Windows is basically for two things — the ActiveX plugins in the web (which are mostly disappeared thanks to smartphones) and the Hangul Word Processor, which was exclusively only on Windows until about 2008, when a Linux version was released for a short period of time (and was removed due to the lack of interest). If the government decides to transition to Linux, Hancom(HWP’s developer) can prioritize the Linux port — which, in 2008 was already fully featured and has almost zero compatibility problems! (People using Linux still use the 2008 version by dockerizing the whole environment.)<p>Some context on the operating systems that were mentioned:<p>The Harmonica OS is a Linux Mint-based distribution that is localized thoroughly and has a lot of baseline programs (like the input methods) installed, and is pretty great for daily use.<p>The Tmax OS is... basically a scam OS that... well uses a big mix of Linux, BSD, and Wine’s code, a homemade custom DE that is a poor ripoff of the windows interface and tries to integrate them (unsuccessfully)... and advertise as a ‘pure Korean OS’ to the officials."],"time":["2020-02-16 19:56:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dmurray"],"id":[22342759],"kids":[22343901,22342837],"parent":[22342493],"text":["Is this actually likely to happen, or a negotiating manoeuvre with Microsoft?"],"time":["2020-02-16 18:50:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["morpheuskafka"],"id":[22343154],"kids":[22344879],"parent":[22342493],"text":["Their friends to the North have been using Linux for many years know, although pirated copies of Windows are still prevalent as well.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Red_Star_OS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Red_Star_OS<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-16 19:59:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ThinkBeat"],"id":[22344048],"kids":[22345230],"parent":[22342493],"text":["It will be interesting to see how it will work.<p>If they have been Windows for so long and all the way up to \nWindows 7, they must have a lot of software and more interestingly hardware that Win7 manages to get working.<p>All sorts of bits and bobs hardware will potentially make trouble.<p>I also see in the article:\n&quot;The South Korean government also plans to implement a Desktop as a Service (DaaS) that uses a virtual PC environment that runs on a cloud by the second half of 2020.

If you aren&#x27;t - for 9 months out of the year the Nile has a moderate flow rate that is sufficient to support human settlement and agriculture. For the remaining 3 months the Nile&#x27;s flow rate increases dramatically and it floods a huge area around its river banks.<p>That flooding might sound bad but its not. Using soil for agricultural purposes will deplete it&#x27;s minerals within about 100 years. That&#x27;s a long time compared to a human life, but not compared to a civilization. When the soil runs out of minerals you can&#x27;t grow anything in it anymore, and it turns out that this is the limiting factor for most civilizations. IE, a civilization will begin intensively farming its soil, deplete the soil, then starve to death.<p>In the modern world we&#x27;re able to replenish the soil&#x27;s minerals with fertilizer. They were sort of able to do this in the ancient world as well, but this involved transporting huge amounts of animal manure which is difficult to do and, in practice, if an ancient civilization had to manually fertilize the soil it would result in very low agricultural yields.<p>This is what makes the Nile&#x27;s floods so good for the development of civilization - every time the Nile would flood it deposits a huge amount of new soil in the areas that got flooded. The source of that new soil was hills and mountains in Central Africa, so it was filled with minerals. Or to put it another way - every year the Nile naturally dumped a huge amount of fertilizer on Egypt.<p>This natural fertilizing allowed Egypt to be by far the most productive agricultural region West of India for thousands of years - everyone from the Pharaohs to Alexander the Great to the Roman Empire fed themselves using the food that the Nile was able to grow.<p>How does this relate to China? The Yellow River in China is the same type of river as the Nile. It spends most of the year with a moderate flow rate, then has massive floods for a few months that deposit a bunch of new soil along its banks.<p>Where the Yellow River is different from the Nile is in its size. The Nile is a single, small river with practically no tributaries or lakes. The Nile&#x27;s floods only cover a small geographic area located immediately adjacent to it.<p>The Yellow River, on the other hand, is a massive system with hundreds of tributaries and lakes. When it floods, it covers almost the entirety of South East China - which is an area thousands of times the size of that covered by the Nile.<p>The Yellow River basin has been among for the most productive agricultural areas on Earth for much of human history. Because the only limiting factor to population size is a region&#x27;s ability to produce food, this also means that the Yellow River Basin (and by extension, China) has managed to maintain a huge population for the entirety of human history.&quot;<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;explainlikeimfive&#x2F;comments&#x2F;exghji&#x2F;eli5_how_did_the_chinese_succeed_in_reaching_a&#x2F;fg84swh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;explainlikeimfive&#x2F;comments&#x2F;exghji&#x2F;e...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-16 16:00:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["foobar_llc"],"id":[22339888],"kids":[22340159],"parent":[22339596],"text":["I guess that&#x27;s why coronavirus blew up so fast."],"time":["2020-02-16 06:05:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["toronto_tic"],"id":[22339754],"kids":[22342748,22340020],"parent":[22339596],"text":["And most probably that&#x27;s were everything started as well...!!!"],"time":["2020-02-16 05:16:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lostgame"],"id":[22344234],"kids":[22344489,22344431,22348165,22347032,22347282,22348167],"parent":[22343917],"text":["The Dreamcast is by far and large one of my all-time favourite consoles.<p>SEGA’s level of innovation here was extreme.<p>From great developer support, online play (even if the Broadband Adapter for Ethernet was extremely rare); the VMU, and an extremely impressive library of quality titles (Skies of Arcadia, Crazy Taxi, Soul Calibur 2, etc) - it was literally a situation that seemed geared to greatness.<p>If it had a DVD player, I think it literally could’ve saved SEGA, after the awful litany of repeated terrible decisions they made in the mid-90’s.

They bought popular privacy-focused browser extensions like &quot;Web of Trust&quot; and turned them into spyware, sending every URL users opened in their browsers to their backend. They then slapped some token &quot;anonymization&quot; on the data and sold it to whomever was willing to pay. They even provided a sample consisting of more than two months of browsing data from three million people in Germany to a team of journalists posing as a startup as a freebie. The data contained tons of highly intimate and sensitive information and users where trivial to re-identify in many cases, e.g. via URLs that contained usernames, e-mail addresses or access tokens.<p>Chrome and Firefox briefly banned the extension from their app stores, but a few weeks after the incident it was suddenly back, happily exfiltrating data from unsuspecting users again.<p>I then realized that browser vendors often have perverse incentives when it comes to privacy and really don&#x27;t care so much about it.

It&#x27;s how things behave when they are evenly distributed over multiplicative operations instead of additive operations. By this I mean things are as likely to be x% bigger than x% smaller instead of the more common definition of evenly distributed (things x unit larger are as likely as x unit smaller).<p>Being evenly distributed over multiplication is natural for many measures. I think it is considered the most even, &quot;maximum entropy&quot; distribution for things that can&#x27;t be negative.<p>The most even, maximum entropy distribution for an unbounded (-infinity to +infinity) prior is an unbounded uniform distribution but you can&#x27;t apply it, for example, in the case of the size of objects since it would imply that negative sizes are as likely as positive sizes (and objects don&#x27;t have negative sizes).<p>In general position parameters tend to be uniformly distributed over addition&#x2F;subtraction whereas scale parameters tend to be evenly distributed over multiplication (uniform over log(x)).

It only requires a 20 percent increase to get from 5,000 to 6,000, and that is achieved in one year.<p>&quot;When the Dow reaches 9,000, it takes only an 11 percent increase and just seven months to reach the 10,000 mark, which starts with the number 1. At that point you start over with the first digit a 1, once again. Once again, you must double the number -- 10,000 -- to 20,000 before reaching 2 as the first digit.<p>&quot;As you can see, the number 1 predominates at every step of the progression, as it does in logarithmic sequences.&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-16 10:27:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Symmetry"],"id":[22341966],"kids":{},"parent":[22338755],"text":["I used this, well the idea that numbers often tend to be distributed evenly in exponential space, in my MEng thesis.

It&#x27;s about time I introduced myself. I&#x27;m Marc de Groot, the founder\n    of Immersive Systems, Inc. in San Francisco.\n\n    I started ISI to sell Meme, which is a virtual world development\n    system. Meme is intended to create a single shared virtual universe on\n    the net.\n\n    ISI released the alpha version of Meme last month.\n\n    Meme stands for Multitasking Extensible Messaging Environment. Meme started\n    life as a programming language. Some &quot;OS-level services&quot; were added to the\n    system, and finally the messaging mechanism was added to allow virtual objects\n    to communicate. At this point, Meme is evolving into a communications\n    protocol.\n\n    I heartily agree with the statements that have been made on this mailing\n    list about net software: make something proprietary, and the net hackers will\n    write a free replacement which everyone will use.\n\n    I intended to make the protocol public later this year, after ISI had fulfilled\n    higher priority obligations, however the establishment of this list has\n    prompted me to put some preliminary information on the net at this time.\n    I have put up a WWW page for Immersive Systems. The URL is\n\n    http:&#x2F;&#x2F;remarque.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~marc&#x2F;home.html\n\n    &gt;From the home page, you can read an overview of Meme, look at the programming\n    manual, and download a demo world to try on your own PC.\n\n    Meme has certain features that I would want to see in any specification for\n    VRML. In particular, Meme allows the world designer to specify platform-\n    independent executable code for the object&#x27;s behavior. Without this\n    ability, objects have relatively rigid, uninteresting behavior.\n\n    That platform-independent code needs to load over the net with a minimum\n    of overhead, and needs to execute efficiently. Meme satisfies both of\n    these requirements.\n\n    That completes my thoughts for now. I will post in the future, as time\n    permits.\n\n    Marc de Groot\n    Immersive Systems, Inc.\n    immersive@kg6kf.ampr.org<\/code><\/pre>"],"time":["2020-02-16 19:09:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DonHopkins"],"id":[22342920],"kids":[22344503],"parent":[22342800],"text":["Immersive Systems Inc:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;19990125100147&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.immersive.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;19990125100147&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.immers...<\/a><p>[I&#x27;ll quote some of the page here for people with sensitive eyes]<p>&gt;Meme tm: Real VR for the Net!<p>&gt;&quot;A brilliant idea...&quot; -Andries van Dam<p>&gt;Meme tm was designed from the ground up for multi-user networked virtual worlds.<p>&gt;Meme tm is a platform-independent standard for networked virtual reality.<p>&gt;High performance.

E.g. KPI meetings, or telemetry meetings<p>Then I put the rest meeting notes on reverse chronological order (most recent at top)<p>In this way, I can always review the previous meetings, as well as the most urgent issues in under 5 minutes, which is good because I work in Agile and in most of the companies that I worked for, this means Fast, not Efficient.<p>PART II - Electronic notes, scripts, dashboards and spreadsheets<p>I have a top-level One-Drive folder called &quot;Company_Team_Name&quot;, which is also shared between Win10 (Host) and Ubuntu (VirtualBox). I have two child folders under it, &quot;Company_Team_Name&#x2F;Project&quot; and &quot;Company_Team_Name&#x2F;Task&quot;.<p>I use the following tools:<p>Excel, for results of analysis and other stuffs;<p>SQL, my bread and butter;<p>Python, sometimes I write Python scripts to help my analysis. I do not like notebooks so I write fully operational programs;<p>Shell, some Linux command line tools, like csvsql, are very useful for simple tasks;<p>Tableau, for all dashboards;<p>Typora, for all research note taking<p>I organize the project folders in Datagrip, as I pretty much need SQL for every report.<p>1 - In Ubuntu&#x2F;Win10, create a new folder under &quot;Company_Team_Name&#x2F;Project&quot; with the name of the new project, assuming it&#x27;s a 4+ JIRA long project, not an overnight task.<p>2 - In Datagrip, create the following folders for each report (I worked long enough to know that we need these reports):<p>&quot;.&#x2F;Pre_Analysis&quot; -&gt; For pre analysis of the project, usually some data dumps or small analysis of similar features in the past;<p>&quot;.&#x2F;AB_Test&quot;;<p>&quot;.&#x2F;Small_Analysis&quot; -&gt; We usually release a feature to only 5%-20% of the population for technical sanity check and small analysis (actually same as full analysis but only on most important KPIs);<p>&quot;.&#x2F;Full_Analysis&quot; -&gt; 100% population Full Analysis, usually performed twice because CXOs will require a more detailed look after reading the first full analysis;<p>&quot;.&#x2F;Tableau&quot; -&gt; put all dashboards here<p>3 - SQL scripts, Python scripts, Typora mds and Excel spreadsheets will be grouped under each report sub folder<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;m considering writing a shell script, or a Python script to automate creating those folders. I&#x27;m also considering using each Project folder as the venv directory for Python, but since all projects use the same Python package configuration (pandas, odbc, etc.) I just install packages on the primary Python interpreter.<p>This is a configuration that I find to be extremely efficient to work in an Agile environment."],"time":["2020-02-16 20:36:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nataz"],"id":[22342621],"kids":{},"parent":[22341518],"text":["How I take notes:<p>For professional life: Pen + dot grid notepad - developed independently, but similar to the bullet journal technique. Dot grid plus pens make the whole thing ultra customizable. I can sketch engineering designs, make a calendar, track action items, take detailed notes, all in the same format. The key is to be strict with page numbers, dates, and index as much as possible.<p>Things I occasionally miss - keyword search (I can still look things up by date or subject in the index), multimedia inserts (think dragging video&#x2F;photos&#x2F;sound clips into one note), never ending space (notebooks run out of pages), easy backups (thinking about digitizing with photos or scans), team collaboration (if this is necessary I use Trello).<p>Things I like - no OS&#x2F;tech stack compatibility issues, &quot;it just works&quot;, lighter then a laptop&#x2F;tablet, don&#x27;t need to charge, easy to read, can bring into a secure area (where outside electronics are not permitted), travels well, hard to damage.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bulletjournal.com&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bulletjournal.com&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;<\/a><p>For personal life: add Google keep for simple lists, and then a mix of Trello and dot grid for larger projects (less strict formatting than professional life project management).<p>How I index using pen&#x2F;paper:<p>Every page has a number in the upper outside corner.<p>Every entry into the note book has a title + subject tag, date, and the initials of a list of people linked to that entry. For easy reading and scanning I put all of this on one line. The title and subject are dark lined (thick), followed by the date MM&#x2F;DD&#x2F;YY, and then the initials inside a ( ). Each piece of info is separated by a &quot;;&quot;. All of the info listed is underlined.<p>under the intro line, I also break down actions, notes, calendar adds, etc with 3-4 different symbols. All I all this makes it clear and easy to scan quickly as you are looking for things.<p>Each month I have 4 or 5 pages devoted to organization.<p>I have a task list. Two bulleted columns. Old tasked are migrated over from the previous month. New tasks are added as soon as they are generated. Completed tasks get an X through the bullet. Migrated tasks get an &gt;. Tasks that are linked to journal entries get a page number and a tag.<p>I have a calendar page. 1 column, all dates of the month listed . Meetings, important actions and events are are listed by day, or with arrows over multiple days. Linked by tag&#x2F;page number if applicable.<p>I have a subject index. Major tags, reoccurring subjects, get a line or two. Page numbers with those subjects are added to the index.<p>I realize this sounds complicated, but it&#x27;s not once you get into a routine. The biggest this is it&#x27;s okay to make &quot;mistakes&quot;, and to get used to not having a delete key. Change is part of the notebook. Think of it like a change log. It&#x27;s also important to be able to see what you change. Since I work in pen, I just make a single line through things I want to change.<p>Note: when I finish or complete something on a task list or the calendar, I&#x27;ll mark or change the symbol, I won&#x27;t cross something out just because I&#x27;m done with it.<p>Finally, I have a bunch of multi color pens I use. They are all the same brand&#x2F;model, but I tend to use a different color each day. That makes it obvious as you are scanning that you are on the next day. I don&#x27;t use specific colors for anything in particular, too hard to keep track of.<p>Hope this helps.<p>Reposted from an older thread @<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17799232\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17799232<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-16 18:30:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ssivark"],"id":[22343795],"kids":[22344273],"parent":[22341140],"text":["In context, allow me to share this gem of a comic: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kiriakakis.net&#x2F;comics&#x2F;mused&#x2F;a-day-at-the-park\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kiriakakis.net&#x2F;comics&#x2F;mused&#x2F;a-day-at-the-park<\/a><p>I won&#x27;t say anything about it, because I don&#x27;t want to spoil it for you."],"time":["2020-02-16 22:12:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pattisapu"],"id":[22342022],"kids":[22344061,22345132,22342467],"parent":[22341140],"text":["“If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” -Albert Einstein<p>Reminds me of:<p>&quot;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.&quot; -Abraham Lincoln"],"time":["2020-02-16 16:45:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tlb"],"id":[22342091],"kids":[22343431,22343426,22342678],"parent":[22341140],"text":["Before the internet, I user to spend a lot of time pondering questions to which the answer was in a textbook somewhere.

He expresses fear that without some restraint that sites might become &quot;like 8chan&quot;. To which I have to ask, why is that a problem? Because its a hotbed for hate speech? What is hate speech? I&#x27;m sure I dont need to elaborate further on what I see wrong with that. What people seem to forget&#x2F;ignore is that hate speech and other forms of taboo content a) existed before 8chan, 4chan, and other sites with similar cultures, b) would continue to exist even if these sites were removed, and c) currently exists on every other digital platform where people may create communicative content. Taboo content will always exist. You may not like it. I may not like it. But even if it was made illegal to say anything stronger than &quot;I do not accept &lt;x&gt;.&quot;, people would still go on the same way as before, albeit likely with more subtlety.<p>With that in mind, I&#x27;d also argue that there should be spaces for &quot;anything goes&quot; content. If people are going to do it anyway, why not give them their own space? Let it be an outlet for those who choose to partake in such content. If we arent willing to accept certain kinds of content everywhere, lets at least allow it somewhere. It will still exist regardless of what we do, but at least if it has its own space we can separate oursepves if we so desire.<p>Lastly, to make sites like 8chan out to have no value other than content some might find deplorable is, frankly, as close minded as those who the author apparently fears. If you hadn&#x27;t geussed already I use 4chan regularlly and its brought much more positive value to my life than negative. The technology board is what got me into programming in the first place. Its through them that I learned about Linux, the benifits of FOSS, the history of computing, and skills that have lead me to be succesful in my life. They are even the ones who lead me to hacker news. Maybe the messages they gave me were worded in a way that some deem undesirable. But when looking at the message itself and not the envelope its wrapped in there is value to be found in these spaces. If the culture is not for you, thats fine! I understand.

Usually, there&#x27;s generations between new things appearing and their effects being seen, and one can only read in books about what your ancestors though about this new thing and marvel about how wrong they are. Now, we live in the happy time where it takes mere decades.<p>And so, 30 years after, the Internet did change the world. And it didn&#x27;t.

Some expected that. What they - and myself - didn&#x27;t expect at all that formerly &quot;progressive&quot; movement, academia and large segments or highly educated and cultured people will join the most oppressive governments in calling to reign in free speech, restrict the freedom of information flow, and deny people with non-mainstream opinions access to free speech, and threatening with vicious harassment and prosecution anybody who dares (or ever dared) to voice a controversial opinion.<p>I remember when freedom of speech debate was about &quot;should we allow the (actual) Nazis to express themselves publicly&quot; and the answer was &quot;we don&#x27;t like them, but yes&quot;.

And it&#x27;s even worse on the Internet, because it&#x27;s not 10 miles, it&#x27;s everywhere. What happened to all those free speech supporters? Did they get old and die?

The Protestant Ethic was the ideology of a self-confident and independent propertied social class. It was an ideology that extolled the virtues of accumulating wealth in a society organized around property and that accepted the stewardship responsibilities entailed by property. It was an ideology where a person’s word was his bond and where the integrity of the handshake was seen as crucial to the maintenance of good business relationships. Perhaps most important, it was connected to a predictable economy of salvation—that is, hard work will lead to success, which is a sign of one’s election by God—a notion also containing its own theodicy to explain the misery of those who do not make it in this world.<p>&gt; Bureaucracy, however, breaks apart substance from appearances, action from responsibility, and language from meaning. Most important, it breaks apart the older connection between the meaning of work and salvation. In the bureaucratic world, one’s success, one’s sign of election, no longer depends on one’s own efforts and on an inscrutable God but on the capriciousness of one’s superiors and the market; and one achieves economic salvation to the extent that one pleases and submits to one’s employer and meets the exigencies of an impersonal market.<p>And the punch-line:<p>&gt; Men and women in bureaucracies turn to each other for moral cues for behavior and come to fashion specific situational moralities for specific significant people in their worlds.<p>&gt; As it happens, the guidance they receive from each other is profoundly ambiguous because what matters in the bureaucratic world is not what a person is but how closely his many personae mesh with the organizational ideal [....]"],"time":["2020-02-17 17:14:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["commandlinefan"],"id":[22341802],"kids":[22342265],"parent":[22339190],"text":["&gt; This ethic of ceaseless work and ceaseless renunciation of the fruits of one’s toil provided both the economic and the moral foundations for modern capitalism.<p>Well, that turned into communism fast..."],"time":["2020-02-16 15:58:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["justinjlynn"],"id":[22340269],"kids":[22342584,22342162,22340300,22369949,22342684,22340870,22341167],"parent":[22339548],"text":["Yikes, please don&#x27;t do or encourage using these in public - there are many accessibility devices (hearing aids, cochlear implants, etc.) which depend on MEMS microphones to function.

The status quo is a bit of mess.<p>- For many transcendental functions, 1 ulp error bound is reasonable but not necessarily reproducible, and 0.5 ulp (optimal) error bound algorithm exists but is significantly slower, to the point that Kahan [1] has once pointed out that some versions of MATLAB hard-coded log10(10^n) cases to give a false illusion of accuracy.<p>- The optimal algorithm is, fortunately, computationally tractable. Many functions have been thoroughly analyzed for the closest outputs to IEEE 754 binary64 values and therefore the number of bits required to accurately round them, and that number of bits is small enough (~150 bits) that all trig&#x2F;log&#x2F;exp&#x2F;pow functions can be computed without bignums.<p>- For a long time CRlibm from INRIA was the only library implementing optimal algorithms, and it was licensed in GPL. A successor to CRlibm, Metalibm, was in development with no licensing statements available, but nowadays a version of Metalibm [2] is licensed in MIT so you can probably make use of them.<p>- If I recall correctly, CRlibm had way too big code footprint (several hundreds of KBs when compiled) that I couldn&#x27;t really use that anyway. The main culprit seems to be five sets of functions for each possible rounding mode. I haven&#x27;t checked yet if a new Metalibm is still big.<p>- There are many approximation algorithms and libraries if you don&#x27;t want the full accuracy. One notable example is Sleef [3] that has multiple functions for desired accuracy (from 0.5001 ulp to 3.5 ulp). Assuming that we will eventually have a set of small and portable libms necessary, I believe a variation of Sleef&#x27;s approach is desirable for future programming languages: a (compile-time) argument for accuracy, all the way from the optimal (0.5 ulp) to the crude (2^20 ulp?).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~wkahan&#x2F;LOG10HAF.TXT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~wkahan&#x2F;LOG10HAF.TXT<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kalray&#x2F;metalibm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kalray&#x2F;metalibm<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sleef.org&#x2F;purec.xhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sleef.org&#x2F;purec.xhtml<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-17 09:42:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["crazygringo"],"id":[22344661],"kids":[22344739,22351581],"parent":[22343276],"text":["Seems like the correct answer is exactly what the author admits at the end: use an &quot;epsilon&quot; so that tests only compare against the expected result to a certain number of decimal places.<p>The author&#x27;s preferred solution is to use a cross-platform library that always gives the same answers.

The appeal of hydrogen arises from its <i>extreme<\/i> energy-mass density: a kg of hydrogen offers several times the oxidized enthalpy of a kg of kerosene, with zero carbon pollution, so much less fuel would need to be hoisted up to 40,000 feet. Hydrogen-burning aircraft could devote the difference to more payload, or to the same payload with a much lighter airframe and smaller engines. Older aircraft simply could not compete. The hydrogen could power fuel cells for electric drive, or be burned in turbines, or some of both, e.g. turbines for takeoff, fuel cells for cruise.<p>The only problem with hydrogen is that, even liquified, it takes up a lot of space. This demands a change to an architecture with more interior space, such as a lifting body (or just a wider body), to provide room for more tankage. More tankage for carbon fuel would be pointless because the extra weight would displace cargo lifting capacity; anyway, present aircraft have enough range.<p>Liquid hydrogen tankage has become much more practical since the discovery of aerogels. Mass production of aerogel enables practical commercial liquid-hydrogen tankage.<p>Hydrogen for aviation is much more practical than for other modes of transportation, because there is no distribution problem. Hydrogen can be produced anywhere using solar and wind generating systems, operating whenever the sun is out or the wind is blowing. The oxygen also produced, that would otherwise be vented, could also be liquified and and carried on board for cruise at very high altitudes, further improving efficiency.

A language can have (or not) generic types while separately being able to define enumerated types (or not), as just one example.<p>The interesting thing (at least to me) about Rust is that Rust goes beyond describing types to describing (at compile-time) ownership of data. There is a developer cost to this and a compile-time cost. Personally my view is:<p>- Compile time errors are cheaper to debug and fix than run-time errors. That&#x27;s the whole point of having a type system: to catch errors at compile-time. Better that than a segfault. Rust is novel in that it eliminates a whole class of problems with data ownership, lifetimes and access. Not every problem of course.<p>- Memory-safety is just too important such that Rust will increasingly fill a niche because this is just too easy to get wrong in, say, C&#x2F;C++.<p>You do have to jump through hoops go properly describe ownership semantics so the Rust compiler can satisfy safety constraints. Like a type system, there are limitations to this and you can intuitively come up with examples that you know are safe but are hard if not impossible to describe to Rust.

Every so often it happens, but more likely is to start with <i>something<\/i> and get better. So the map replacement is one: the vision for these screens may be 1. As a revenue stream, 2. Help the visually impaired, 3. allow more functionality - like calling a staff member quickly (whatever, I don&#x27;t live and NY, this is just examples).\nThe implementation is rubbish, but if it&#x27;s the first iteration, that was always ever going to be the case.<p>Finally, here&#x27;s a bit of mirroring, do what you like with it: Clever people take great pride in their cleverness.

The only feedback that gets measured are things like revenue and sales, and the only thing leadership sees as driving revenue is the constant spew of features--because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re doing. The insights that you get from revenue are very generic: &quot;Money is coming in--keep doing what you&#x27;re doing&quot; or &quot;We&#x27;re losing money. Do something different!&quot;.

My first exposure to programming was at age 24, as I fell into it with an IT tech position. Went from there to a series of jobs at several startups. Before applying to a FAANG, I went through Elements of Programming Interviews and solved all the problems in it, which at around 10 hours&#x2F;week took maybe 6 months of prep. I then sent in two applications, one to FB and one to GOOG, immediately got phone screens, passed, and then two weeks later went through the on-sites. Every one of the questions was either lifted from the coding prep book or trivial.<p>End result? Offers from both, joined as an L4, at a total comp higher than I had ever dreamed of, and significantly higher than friends in medicine who have easily spent over a hundred times as much time preparing and studying as I have.<p>So I&#x27;m kind of left flummoxed. Am I just incredibly lucky? There are huge issues in the hiring process, but if you want a job at FAANG, as far as I can tell it&#x27;s incredibly easy to game the system. Set aside some time each week (easy, if you don&#x27;t have kids), study for a couple months, and then apply. There&#x27;s literally no other field than ours that is so open to motivated people without paper qualifications and that simultaneously offers so much in terms of lifestyle and compensation. Whether it hires the best candidates is another question entirely, but that&#x27;s an issue for the company, not for the applicant.<p>But, when I give an interview to an applicant and use my go-to question, which I initially feared would provide no useful hiring signal for being too easy (and which, yes, I&#x27;ve tested on all my coworkers, who solve without any difficulty), I find that only maybe a third of applicants complete it at LH or higher.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m calling this out as a blind spot I have--there&#x27;s clearly a massive gap in perspective here--but hopefully it&#x27;ll provide a useful data point for why tech screens aren&#x27;t universally hated and why they manage to persist."],"time":["2020-02-15 05:47:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Solar19"],"id":[22332601],"kids":{},"parent":[22331804],"text":["The potential red flag in this account was Jared interrupting the interviewer who was asking a question that mentioned microservices to say that he had no experience in microservices.<p>Why did he interrupt the interviewer?

More programmery than designery, so I would kind of expect the ideal candidate to have heard of Typescript, and to have maybe written a unit test before.  Our recruiter put a job listing on the usual places with those exact criteria, and ... we got hundreds of resumes by the time I took a look at the queue a few days later.  I reviewed them all!  90% of the applicants had gone to a bootcamp and had nearly identical resumes.  They wrote down their camp projects as though they were work experience.  They linked to their Github that had line-for-line identical code between applicants that went to the same boot camp.  Some were just directly the output of create-react-app with no additional code added.  The common theme was, &quot;I hear you get paid a lot to be a programmer.  Count me in!&quot;  The other 10% of applicants didn&#x27;t really have anything negative going on.  They have some claimed programming experience, and they want to get paid to write computer programs.  Why not call them up and ask them to find the k-th element of a binary tree?  It&#x27;s not a super-obscure area of study.<p>When I was at... erm... &quot;Giant Search and Advertising Company&quot;..., I did in-person interviews.  I went through a lot of the shared interview questions to use, but ultimately came up with my own: given a stream of events from a variety of event sources, count how many unique event sources emitted an event in the last 5 minutes and last 30 minutes.  I chose this because I literally wrote this exact program, and it took me a few iterations to get it to be optimal.  (Or what I think is optimal!)  For that reason, I found it to be a pretty fair question.  The answer is just a few lines of code.  The problem is a real-world problem.  It&#x27;s not a puzzle, but it does involve some thinking and maybe asking some questions.<p>The last thing I&#x27;ll say, which I know is kind of snarky...  As a Senior Software Engineer at Google, your total compensation is going to be north of $300,000 a year.  You should be able to find the k-th element of a binary tree.  Teach yourself how; it&#x27;s kind of fun, and might someday be useful.<p>I agree with the HN consensus that hard CS comes up somewhat rarely in the day-to-day life of a programmer.  But when it does come up, you really do need to know it.  You will never be finding the k-th element of a binary tree.  But there will be tree structures, and you will come up with some brute-force algorithm because you haven&#x27;t seen that class of problems before, and you will push your &quot;uses too much memory and time on production-sized datasets&quot; hack to production, and production will crash, and then you find yourself with a production outage you don&#x27;t have the tools to fix.
