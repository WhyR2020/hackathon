Absolute loyalty is demanded and expected all the way up the management chain and it trumps (no pun intended) all else, including job competence. What some Americans may not realize is that this isn&#x27;t universally true globally.<p>What we have now is a president who comes from and exemplifies this culture so his administration absolutely reflects that. Jeff Sessions recusing himself on the Russia investigation instead of blocking it even if it cost him everything, personally, was an unforgivable sin to an absolute loyalist.<p>So I guarantee you that the prime consideration for this pandemic (which it now officially is, according to the WHO) in the US government is how this impacts the GOP in general and Trump&#x27;s reelection in particular. Nothing else matters.<p>Go back to, say, the Watergate era and you had behaviour by a president that even his own party ultimately found unacceptable. If Watergate repeated today, it would be &quot;fake news&quot;, painted as partisan Democratic slander aimed at the administration and defended beyond all reason.<p>The sad and scary part of this is that we now have 40% of the population who will absolutely eat this up and refuse to believe anything that makes the president look bad. To be fair, there are absolute devotees on the other side too but objectively we&#x27;ve seen nothing to the degree of GOP blind loyalism on from the Democrats (yet).<p>There was a time when our representatives held higher loyalties to the institutions they represent because undermining those is incredibly dangerous. Those days seem to be a distant memory as we have a mass organized effort to disenfranchise those who tend to vote Democrat (under the guise of removing &quot;felons&quot; from voter rolls), a refusal by the Senate to take up legislation that would pass at a completely unprecedented rate, a Senate whose only priority is filling lifetime judicial nominees with more loyalists and the refusal to even take up a president&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee with flimsily-constructed justification you know for a fact wouldn&#x27;t apply if the situation was reversed.<p>This is the trait of dictators and despots. Why do you think Trump admires Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-Un?<p>So yes, it should come as no surprise that the planning, messaging and response to this pandemic is being seen through the exact same filter: how does this help or hurt Trump?<p>And it will kill people. I don&#x27;t wish ill on anyone here but it&#x27;s hard not to see the irony that the most at-risk groups of death from Covid-19 are, well, Trump&#x27;s core voters and Fox News&#x27;s core target market for fearmongering and dog-whistle racism.<p>Classifying public health responses is unprecedented. Yet as long as Trump&#x27;s base (40% of voters) don&#x27;t hold the government to account absolutely nothing will change.

Intermediate pixel are lost on each fragment step.<p>In current game engines, when a semi-transparent object is rendered, it can only know the previous blended state of the pixel it is writing into. So instead of being able to do something like `blend(p1, p2, p3, p4, ...)`, you work around it with a blend model that looks like `blend(..., blend(p4, blend(p3, blend(p2, p1))))`. A common working (partially) solution uses a linked list of pixel colors, encoded in a texture (src: NVidia RnD) to be able to preserve these colors until the final image is rendered. It is still costly in terms of computation and space. There are other solutions but each has its own, unavoidable drawbacks.<p>So I figured as a newbie, maybe this hash table can store pixel location as key and a linked list of colors as value to mitigate for the computation cost of NVidia&#x27;s algorithm.

Its exactly what Japanese automakers pioneered for their dive into Luxury.  Take an existing platform and powertrain, and &quot;goose&quot; it with a few luxury features.  Then, break the bank on marketing (which is all luxury brands really are anyway these days.)  switches and buttons for seat options came prewired into the base models, but were built out in the luxury models, so this saved a lot of time and money.  regular shocks, coilovers, struts, etc...were swapped for primo, and the seat design was slapped up with leather instead of cloth.  you <i>can<\/i> do this and it <i>does<\/i> work.<p>Fast forward to 2015 and the auto industry learned bupkis from their crow dinner at congress begging for handouts in 2008.  Chrysler basically blocked the memory out entirely, dove hard off the deep end  and came out with garbage like the hellcat.  Its not even in the top 20 fastest cars, and most importantly its a loss leader with custom engine work, custom drivetrain, custom paint, etc...that is shared by <i>no model.<\/i>  people want reliable cars with good gas mileage and good performance like the Ford Focus and its ST counterpart which were well executed.

Pontiac basically prayed at the altar of Iacocca with the G6, the G8, and the Solstice, and their willingness to damn the consequences and innovate was already on display with the Aztek...whereas Buick was still hucking 80&#x27;s designs around their Lucerne.

I gotta say, some get it, some simply want to put heads in the sand. My own brother, me being the oldest of 8, has a kid on the way, is a paramedic, lives in our home state of GA. He&#x27;s a paramedic. I called to let him know my concerns and he brushed me off. Let&#x27;s say it bugged me abit. My grandparents are innocent, in their late 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s. Here locally, in MO, in my area, I&#x27;ve tried to tell people to do this&#x2F;that, be reasonable, help out if possible, etc. Hoarding is ridiculous though, stealing, only the beginning. I was in the service for 8yrs, 2 deployments, seen the worst in people in war. I gotta say, at my point in life, at the early years of my middle age, I&#x27;ve got kidney problems so my doctor told me to stay indoors which I usually do anyway, had to stop working for myself so it&#x27;s just my wife making most of the money right now. It&#x27;s hard on everyone. When I hear the term &quot;young &amp; old people&quot; I roll my eyes, it&#x27;s everyone, younger, middle, old folks.\nIf the U.S. where I live, loses almost 2 million people, and many of them are oldest, well, I can&#x27;t lie, those who have the money&#x2F;power who&#x27;ve been doing us in before even I was born, for too long, for those types, good riddance. For those like my grandparents and others I don&#x27;t know, they&#x27;re innocent. Just as the rest of us are who are being cautious, like I am. My wife has a protocol I&#x27;ve given her, something similar to how the military does things. Hard to let go of many years doing things a certain way with vet&#x27;s like myself. Whether or not things are followed or not, if we lose that many people, we&#x27;ll see what we see. I see it day&#x2F;day.\nAnd I got no proof, just a theory, based on what I&#x27;ve seen in the field by merc&#x27;s, and then the Chinese, some of them, blaming our U.S. Army when some went to an event there in China back late last year for doing this to them, I hold down my stance that the U.S. Govt did this by sending a team out there dressed in our uniforms, but them being merc&#x27;s, they don&#x27;t care, they&#x27;ll still be safe and secure for the money. No ROE, nothing. I&#x27;ve seen it too much.\nFor the rest of everyone, just stay safe and try to minimize contact. Washing hands alot, etc. My life is mid-way over and I&#x27;d like to make it to 50, if I can. I&#x27;m not far from that. We live paycheck to paycheck as most do here, but, at least the electric company here is suspending and forgiving late payments and so on. Then we&#x27;re about to hit flood season here, it&#x27;s already rising. It happens alot here, it&#x27;ll make this worse too. My neighbor, one of several, lost his job for the time due to it being in the restaurant business. My wife&#x27;s job has cut out all 70+ patients and instead, are doing things over the Skype and stuff for visits. Everyone else is being tested for fever as they come there before entering. Smart. Yet, no security. I&#x27;m speaking more about localized issues here, but we just got 10 new cases confirmed nearby in the county my wife works in. The Rolling Stones aren&#x27;t coming here now, for now, because of this. All things considered, my theory, my position to be safe and smart and not be ridiculous when it comes to buying products, which we&#x27;re already experiencing a shortage of, is to ration and keep those hands and feet clean. Keep uniforms from work separate from your people at home as my wife is doing now.\nWe&#x27;ll see what we see, as another put it, it&#x27;s a number&#x27;s game, time will tell, the virus will eventually burn itself down to a point that normality, whatever you want to call that, will come back. The Guard has been on alert, as all states here are on state emergencies. I&#x27;ve been hearing of forced removal though, some being asked to leave too, don&#x27;t know all the facts on that yet, but I&#x27;m tracking this. I see locally how some people think this is just a &quot;cold&quot; &amp; nothing more. Okay, well, we&#x27;ll see. I already know it&#x27;s not, so at least here locally some folks are listening to people like me. I am no scientist, but, I&#x27;m not stupid, been in the field, had to help injured folks from the enemy trying to kill us, etc. I expect the worst, hope for the best.

A few suggestions for WFH for a month (lessons learned from working remote 100% in my previous job):<p>* Avoid working a 12 hour day. This will happen with having no more commute. 9-5 will turn into 7-7. Suggestion: Get an early start to your day but take a few hour long breaks in the middle of your day.<p>* Also set a hard stop to when you will stop working. Brain chemistry = your productivity spikes a bit around 4pm after the 2pm snooze; making you work longer into the evenings. Set a hard stop for when you are done and don’t look back. My plan is to stop working after walking my dog in the evening.<p>* Put your shoes on. Working barefoot at home is awesome but the act of putting your shoes on will subconsciously make you more likely to be active and less lethargic during the course of the day.<p>* Take a shower everyday despite us not being able to smell you on Hangouts ;-) No need to do it in the morning but might be a good way to use your first long break of the day.<p>* Make some Hangouts&#x2F;Zoom&#x2F;WebEx friends - try to do 1:1 sync with someone else on the team (not just your manager) once or twice a week. It’s basically the coffee break conversation with zero risk of virus spreading.<p>* Make dinner plans (also a good way to force yourself to stop working end of day).<p>* Ask yourself at the end of each day “when was the last time I went outside” - sounds silly but there was this one time when I had stayed at home for 4 days straight just working and crashing at the end of the day<p>* Lastly, set aside 1 or 2 spots at home for you to work out of. When you are done with the day, leave those spots. Do NOT work on your couch or bed if that’s where you will be after you’re done working; Will help you disconnect&#x2F;re-connect in the evenings&#x2F;mornings,"],"time":["2020-03-11 21:49:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hef19898"],"id":[22550204],"kids":[22550286],"parent":[22549300],"text":["In my experience the risk of working longer hours is huge.

Not an issue so much with modern hardware, but still.

I lock myself in my home office and tell the wife and kids to act like I&#x27;m at the actual office.<p>The work&#x2F;life balance is actually better because I don&#x27;t have to commute.  Just make sure if you normally go to the gym that you keep that up...assuming your gym doesn&#x27;t close because of this.  The gym seems like a primary place to close down because of this virus.<p>We use Skype and Teams to keep the chic chat style banter and useless meme-sharing alive and well."],"time":["2020-03-11 22:47:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stared"],"id":[22550165],"kids":{},"parent":[22549300],"text":["Track your time, automatically.

I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s what works best for me, so it&#x27;s what I stick to.<p>- I do work from my normal desk. At my last job, it was a super big no-no to use your own computer, so I switched the input on my monitor and had my keyboard, mouse, and DAC running through a usb hub I could easily swap to my laptop.  At my current job, I just supplied a separate SSD and dual boot. Either way, the point is I have good ergonomics and fantastic peripherals and don&#x27;t need double space or equipment.<p>- Find the morning ritual you need to get your head in the game for work; mine is a shower and painstakingly making coffee or espresso.<p>- House chores are basically off limits. I may load or unload the dishwasher if I get a snack or another coffee, but I do that in our physical office too. It&#x27;s a 5 minute task at most.<p>- If anything, feel MORE comfortable leaving your workspace and going somewhere else if you can&#x27;t get in the groove. I have a bad habit of staying in the office and basically staring at the walls because I can&#x27;t get my brain in the game some days, yet when I WFH I&#x27;m far more likely to catch that 15 minutes in, pack some shit up and head to a local coffee shop and see if a change in venue jump starts something.  More often than not, it does.<p>- Set a timer. If you start at 8 and don&#x27;t take a lunch, that means your timer should be going off at 4. Pack it up, you&#x27;re done. Go for a walk or go to the gym and start your evening.<p>For myself, my partner doesn&#x27;t bother me during the day; we still chat online even if we&#x27;re 6 feet apart, but nobody is talking and distracting the other. We don&#x27;t have kids, so that doesn&#x27;t factor in for me, but I know some of my coworkers have been struggling badly lately because they don&#x27;t have a home office and their kids are too young to understand why mommy or daddy can&#x27;t pay attention to them.

Tips to avoid boredom, routine and unhealthy habits:<p>Leave the house, stretch your legs: Without disregard to government recommendations and instruction and provided that you keep safe from gatherings and other groups, going for a walk to get some sun will help make you happier and clear your mind;<p>Walking 1:1s: We all love walking 1:1s, and this is a great opportunity to keep doing them, but instead of walking side by side with your teammate, you can do it over a phone call;<p>Work-life balance: Working at home can make you more productive, but do not forget to set limits for yourself. Know when to finish work and start enjoying your day, even if you do not leave the same physical space.<p>Home office: Set up a small office at home, preferably in a place where you usually do not use to relax and use it just to work. This way you can have a clear distinction between your workspace and mindset, and your own time.<p>Virtual coffees: Even if you don’t have a random coffee planned for today or this week, try to connect with your teammates outside of work topics. We are social creatures who need social interactions to be happy. Take this as an opportunity to engage with people you usually wouldn’t.<p>Do not overuse pyjama days: Although it feels great to work in your pyjamas sometimes, using normal clothes as if you were going to the office, helps to change the mindset from being at home chilling to work mode.<p>Communicate proactively: We won’t be able to engage with each other on our work interactions in person, so regardless of the tool we use to communicate make sure you keep doing that, proactively, remotely.

I&#x27;ve set up a designated space at home to work from with some proper ergonomics, and I&#x27;m interested in hearing general advice and recommendations about staying productive, striking the work&#x2F;life balance, and keeping the casual&#x2F;social in-person environment alive. Any specific recommendations?<p>Full time remote here.  I don&#x27;t know if this works for everyone but here&#x27;s what I do and have found to work well enough:<p>1) I have a dedicated area for work.<p>2) I have a computer dedicated for work (provided by employer).  Also a proper, 30&quot; screen &amp; adjustable desk.  I don&#x27;t use it for personal stuff, and also I don&#x27;t use personal computer for work stuff.<p>3) I try to schedule my day as if I were working onsite: I get up in the morning, grab a coffee, and get to work.  I&#x27;m available and at work during normal office hours, and then I log out and I&#x27;m done.<p>4) I allow myself longer lunch breaks if I don&#x27;t feel too motivated to work; but I try to keep them under 90 minutes.  Usually about 50-75 mins.  Wind down with coffee, read HN, maybe put away clothes or do the dishes or something.  Don&#x27;t get into anything too addictive.  (At one point I played games during lunch break but I found that to be too addictive and I ended up stretching my break and not feeling rested or relaxed when I finally forced myself to stop and go back to work).<p>4.5) Two little coffee breaks per day.  A third one if I really need it, though usually that&#x27;s just a coffee I quickly make and drink while working.<p>5) From day zero, I never gave in to the temptation to start doing non-work stuff at home during office hours.  The concern is that it&#x27;d just turn into procrastination, and I&#x27;d be putting work off, and before long I&#x27;d be working late at night to make up for the hours that I put off; that&#x27;d eat away my free time and then I&#x27;d end up in the dreaded &quot;always at work&quot; situation.  I much prefer that I&#x27;m done in the afternoon and then I don&#x27;t think about work at all until next day.<p>6) When I&#x27;m done really am done.  I&#x27;m logged out, my work computer&#x27;s screen is dark and I&#x27;m not checking on it.  (Also it&#x27;s a different room).  Ok, well, sometimes I make exceptions, like if I decide to grab a coffee and heat some food in the oven after work, well, I might just sit back at the work PC and sip away while the oven is getting warm, and chat with colleagues or read up on stuff, maybe merge some trivial pull request.  But at that point I&#x27;m really not doing any heavy lifting.<p>Sounds boring?  Yeah, that&#x27;s work :P  But anyway, done this way, work&#x2F;life balance is pretty much exactly what it would be with an onsite job, except that there&#x27;s no commute, and you can go exercise or do something else with that time.  I think that is strictly a win.<p>Yeah I know it sounds a bit stiff.  My hat is off to those who can spend their days very flexibly and work whenever they feel like it, and not feel stressed about the things they&#x27;ve been putting off.  I can&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m OK with keeping a very boring and simple schedule.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to improve my morning routine a bit by incorporating some light exercise before work but I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet.  I have to admit I haven&#x27;t been able shed off all the early morning grogginess when going from bed to coffee to work takes only ten minutes.<p>As for the social side... well let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m <i>very<\/i> introverted.  I do miss meaningful (deep) relationships in my life, but I don&#x27;t miss the physical presence of colleagues at work; that only drains my energy."],"time":["2020-03-11 22:55:13"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sbbr"],"id":[22550072],"kids":{},"parent":[22549300],"text":["Lock your fridge."],"time":["2020-03-11 21:22:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lxi92"],"id":[22550810],"kids":{},"parent":[22549300],"text":["Get a cat."],"time":["2020-03-11 22:20:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22555507],"kids":{},"parent":[22549300],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-12 12:00:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":[true]},{"by":["asd123asd"],"id":[22555559],"kids":{},"parent":[22549300],"text":["asdzxc"],"time":["2020-03-12 12:11:32"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["one2know"],"id":[22549967],"kids":[22550090,22550031,22552230],"parent":[22549300],"text":["The need for casual&#x2F;social environment is largely a myth.

As part of solving that task I spent some time looking into the design of SGX, and I gotta say it doesn’t sound promising.<p>The basic idea is to be able to run code on an Intel processor that cannot be tampered with or even examined by any other part of the system, including the OS, hypervisors, etc. The entire code and data segment of this program runs in its own world, the “secure enclave”, in user mode (ring 3). The attack model is that every piece of software executing on the CPU (user code, OS code, hypervisors) and every bit of hardware outside the CPU (network interfaces, hardware buses, memory interfaces) could be compromised and attempting to leak data from your Secure Enclave, and the enclave code&#x2F;data should still remain tamper proof and unreadable. The SGX implementation even includes an attestation system, using a trusted server operated by Intel, which will attempt to verify that the CPU itself is not compromised.<p>The entire thing depends on a lot of cryptography. Sealing keys to encrypt data that will be persisted to disk from the enclave. Memory protection keys to encrypt everything going to RAM. Page encryption keys to encrypt any memory that the OS tries to page out. Attestation keys to cryptographically verify that the CPU measured itself to be OK. Cryptographic signatures to validate the initial enclave code and data to protect against tampering of the initial state. Session keys to protect the enclave’s communication with whatever application server is providing the code&#x2F;data for the enclave’s computation. The OS and even the ring 3 application hosting the enclave have a MITM position on absolutely everything the enclave does, so the disclosure of just one of these keys breaks the security of the whole system.<p>I am not surprised at all that SGX wound up being vulnerable to a low-level CPU attack.

Depression notoriously clouds peoples&#x27; judgment and makes simple tasks seem impossible. Depression also encourages a lot of binary thinking, where people tend to give up because they can&#x27;t achieve the optimal solution and can&#x27;t imagine anything in between optimal and complete failure. And most importantly, depressed people almost never want to hear someone else telling them that they should <i>do<\/i> something to change their own condition. If you&#x27;ve ever been through a depressive episode, you&#x27;ll understand how unpalatable this idea is if it&#x27;s not delivered carefully. Be careful to not make depressed people feel even worse about their condition.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve known several depressed people who spiraled deeper into depression when they could no longer perform their regular 60 minute gym sessions multiple times per week. It took a while for them to accept that a 5-minute walk around the block is better than no exercise at all. From there, they could push to 10 minute walks on good days, then 20 minutes, then 30 minutes, and eventually work their way back up to gym visits.

If you feel depressed, maybe that’s ok, maybe that’s part of the human experience. If it endangers your life that’s perhaps not ideal, but if it endangers your goals, perhaps that is ok. I think modern society pathologizes feelings and acts like anything that detracts from your ability to be “successful “ must be cured. It’s ok to feel bad feelings it’s how we react to them that’s more often a source of frustration. Meditation gets mislabeled as some way to reduce stress and clear your mind when I believe it’s training for how to learn to react to difficult thoughts and feelings.<p>I have many more thoughts on this topic for when the time is right but as much as self-care advice gets responded with “thanks I’m cured” self-care is the foundation to recovery.

Happy to share experience:<p>The threat model reduced to mobile malware that grabbed private&#x2F;secret keys, and how the harvested keys could be used at scale. Banks didn&#x27;t want it, because the net improvements on passwords were edge cases and it didn&#x27;t have enough standards based compliance assurance to transfer liability to the user.<p>Things like smoother UX, and customers not having to manage a passwd db were the sell, but those weren&#x27;t really anyone&#x27;s problems at the time.<p>The key problem isn&#x27;t authentication, it&#x27;s identity assurance, which means user enrolment that can be &quot;trusted&quot; and then secure personalization of the credential with unique keys. If you are extending the telcoms user idenity trust model, it&#x27;s sufficient for a few things, but not anything I&#x27;d bet a $10k account reimbursement on at scale. You can actually trust an oauth2 partner for identity assurance with some additional data sets.<p>Second, (first really) an AuthN method is only as secure as it&#x27;s recovery process, and so the benefits of adding factors, keys, and protocols are just shuffling cards in the same deck.<p>Apple can do this because they have a secure element on their phones that can store trusted keys, derive new keys, and facilitate personalization. Android fragmentation means you can&#x27;t rely on this storage on other devices, and you are reduced to the security of the android ecosystem, which is almost as bad as the windows ecosystem in the 1990s.<p>So how could something as awful as passwords be better than what you are proposing? They are backed by standards, compliance, and maturity, the risk of a compromise can be passed to the user, they do not provide a false sense of security, it&#x27;s marginally harder to harvest them from a user base using malware than a stored key.<p>The only people who have done this well have had a separate hardware device (apple&#x27;s secure element, yubikey&#x27;s physical device with an SE, etc.) and Authy&#x2F;Google authenticator and Duo, which are 2nd factor OTP token providers. The only way to provide value in security is to process in a separate, privileged domain. Without this, there is no security value to add.<p>The privileged source of &quot;entropy,&quot; whether it&#x27;s as analysis or key material, is the only value we can provide in security. It is literally exogenous assurance. There is no endogenous security.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve read your product wrong, but it&#x27;s so similar to problems I spent time on there are some inevitable blockers I can spare you having to waste weeks or months trying to sound out for yourselves, and perhaps you&#x27;ve found the customer who is ready to make these compromises in exchange for the purported benefits?"],"time":["2020-03-11 02:56:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["100-xyz"],"id":[22538936],"kids":[22539056],"parent":[22538578],"text":["Good job.

That means using transfer-learning from related problems in which the similarity of problems is based of the (method,efficiency) differency.<p>Problem P1 is locally  similar to P2 if (method,efficiency,P1) meassured in computation time is similar to (method,efficiency,P2) for method in a local space of methods. The method should learn to classify both problem and methods, that&#x27;s similar to learning words and context words in NLP or matrix factorization in recommendation systems. To sample the   (space,method,efficiency) space one need huge resources.<p>Added: To compare a pair of (method,problem) some stardardization should be used, for linear problems related to solving linear systems the condition number of the coefficiency matrix should be used as a feature for standardization and, for example in SAT an heuristic using the number of clauses and variables should be used for estimating the complexity and normalization of problems. So the preprocessing step should use  the best known heuristic for solving the problem and estimating its complexity as both a feature and a method for normalization. Heuristic and DL for TSP is  approaching SOTA (but concord is better yet).<p>Finally perhaps some encoding about how the heuristic was obtained could be used as a feature of the problem (heuristic from minimum spanning tree, branch and bound, dynamic programming,  recurrence, memoization, hill climbing, ...) as an enumerative type.<p>So some problems for preprocessing are: \n1) What is a good heuristic for solving this problem.\n2) What is a good heuristic for bounding or estimating  its complexity.\n3) How can you use those heuristics to standardize or normalize its complexity.\n4) How big should be the problem so that the assymptotic complexity takes over the noise of small problems.\n5) How do you encode the different types of heuristics.\n6) How do you value the sequential versus parallel method for solving the problem.<p>Finally, I wonder if once a problem is autoencoded then if some kind of curvature could be defined, that curvature should be related to the average complexity of a local space of problems, also transitions like in graph problems should be feautured. The idea is using gems of features to allow the system to combine those or discover  new better features. Curvature could be used for clustering problem that is for classification of types of problems.  For example all preprocessed problems for solving a linear system should be normalize to have similar efficiency when using the family F of learning methods otherwise a feature is introduced for further normalization.
