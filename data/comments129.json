I believe that this is just a combination of several factors:<p>- Japan acted sooner than most by closing schools, tightening their borders, informing their citizens and asking for their cooperation.<p>- Japan&#x27;s culture is a big factor, people respect and obey their government in general, the use of masks is common place, practicing social distancing is already part of their culture, with no kissing, hugging or handshakes for the most part, the exception being their public transportation, which are well known for how packed they are near the Tokyo area.<p>- Japan has a good health care system <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;whr&#x2F;2010&#x2F;en&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;whr&#x2F;2010&#x2F;en&#x2F;<\/a><p>Lastly, let us assume that Japan isn&#x27;t testing everyone they can as suggested by some, as a way to somehow keep the Olympics going.<p>- Japan has an older population, which is high risk group as we know.<p>- IF they are in-fact manipulating numbers as some suggested by not testing, than we would be seeing a spike in the death rate for the 60-80+ age groups. Now I can&#x27;t provide a metric to prove or disprove this and the only thing we can do is wait and see, but I have doubts about the government ignoring their people in-favor of an event that likely won&#x27;t happen this year or at least not the early half of the year.<p>EDIT: Lastly and this is a factor that none of us even suggested, is luck.

Viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post-infectious loss, and over 200 different viruses are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections. Previously described coronaviruses are thought to account for 10-15% cases. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the novel COVID-19 virus would also cause anosmia in infected patients.<p>There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia&#x2F;hyposmia. In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases.<p>In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience. I have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia – I usually see roughly no more than one a month. I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation.<p>While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation.<p>Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps).<p>There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers."],"time":["2020-03-21 19:23:52"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ErikAugust"],"id":[22650705],"kids":{},"parent":[22648580],"text":["Copy of article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.trimread.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;8606\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.trimread.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;8606<\/a>"],"time":["2020-03-21 23:20:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ncfausti"],"id":[22651674],"kids":[22652547],"parent":[22648580],"text":["Oh man.

So I do not need to do manual testing during runtime to discover typo in my code.<p>In javascript I can write literally any crap and the system lets it go. Intellisense sucks big time as well. As a result of this and usual typos I have to literally go and do a lot of clicking to see if this part blows up at runtime.<p>So all in all I&#x27;d say productivity in C++ is way better. And C++ is not a stellar example of easy language. Actually it is easy for me. Not because I am super-duper programmer but your basic coding with the help of standard library is a piece of cake.

There would also be questions of reliability of such devices. These issues could be mitigated by authorizing use of such equipment only during state of emergencies.

Personally I work on projects for a really long time in private, not having to worry about dealing with other people since everything is done by me only, and wonder how I should eventually portray the project to the public. My motivation to do things shifts wildly from week to week, and I can spend months at a time on one single project and suddenly just stop cold one day as if it never happened. I keep wondering how that&#x27;s compatible with involving yourself with the community, if they&#x27;ll wonder where I&#x27;m at a month from now. In my case the project is specifically meant for contribution for other people or it won&#x27;t take off (a mod system) so it feels inevitable I&#x27;d have to do it some day. But I don&#x27;t know if I can keep it up after it&#x27;s announced without getting burnt out by interacting with people, and delivering on the things I want to accomplish. I&#x27;m reminded of the author of uBlock Origin specifically refusing donations for this reason, to ensure he feels no sense of responsibility to &quot;make good&quot; on what people give him. He also mentions the same motivation issue.<p>I have at one point been in a spot where I&#x27;ve worked on something with a similar amount of zeal for months on end, literally <i>every single day<\/i>, then dropped it out of nowhere, then had someone come up to me and ask me to finish it with them, and then literally being <i>unable<\/i> to get myself to write more code. Like, I was sitting at the screen, doing <i>nothing at all<\/i> for <i>hours<\/i>, unable to bring myself to care. Even though this person reached out to me personally over one of my projects, which had never happened before in my life, and I liked their company! Part of me still wanted it to be finished too. But I just didn&#x27;t feel like it anymore. I feel a lot of guilt over that, still. So I know I have been in that spot before.<p>I keep working at my current projects though, regardless of the amount of progress. It&#x27;s just an interesting hobby right now, if a somewhat obsessive one. I&#x27;m always reminded of the portrayal of Robert Graysmith in the film <i>Zodiac<\/i>, where he explains he does so much investigation into the titular case &quot;because nobody else will.&quot; That&#x27;s exactly how I feel with my long-term projects. Perhaps byuu felt the same at some point. Maybe that attitude is what got me this far all along.<p>Still, so many times I feel like I&#x27;m just grasping at straws or not making the progress I want. But giving it to the community leaves a sense of obligation if I have these goals that are still left unfulfilled, which I easily end up imagining worst-case leading into whatever drama of &quot;such and such project not doing what it envisions.&quot; And of course I will never <i>expect<\/i> someone to pick up the torch, tempting as it feels. They <i>could<\/i>, but in the end it&#x27;s their choice, and I have no right to obligate them.<p>This thought bothers me a lot. What reminded me of this in relation to the article specifically was the author&#x27;s mention of wishing he could just code in peace without all the extra baggage surrounding the project and other things in his life he describes. Currently I would describe myself as &quot;coding in peace,&quot; it being closed-source at the moment, and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;ll end up getting myself into all that someday. Then again, the alternative feels like wandering aimlessly in this solitary coding marathon for months on end at a glacial rate of progress, not quite knowing if my designs or implementations are the &quot;right&quot; way to advance the project, which feels equally troublesome. I don&#x27;t feel smart (or perhaps arrogant) enough to believe that outright. And also, wasn&#x27;t I supposed to use this thing if it <i>does<\/i> get finished? Otherwise why spend so long coding it up at all?<p>After a while this cycle of thinking wears me out. I can totally understand the author&#x27;s feelings, even if they aren&#x27;t quite caused by the same reasons. It&#x27;s a lot of time spent on a small amount of things, in the pursuit of these potentially lofty goals. I guess it&#x27;s necessary to step back every once in a while and reframe things.<p>That doesn&#x27;t even go into careers, which is a different boat entirely.<p>All that might have been a random tangent. It&#x27;s just a thought I&#x27;ve been mulling over.<p>Anyway, I should say this: Thanks, byuu, for all your contributions to the emulation scene over the years.

It will force you to challenge yourself.<p>2) Learn line editing with GNU Readline. What is this? E.g., when you have a bash shell open and you hit Alt+B, your cursor moves back a word. This will make your time in the shell a lot more pleasant. Similarly, the basics of VIM, which will make text editing a lot more pleasant. Less friction means everything comes quicker, and you get tighter learning iteration loops. Don&#x27;t go overboard on this: it&#x27;s mostly about navigating around and editing text, not installing plugins or anything beyond an hour or two of study.<p>3) Don&#x27;t waste time purposefully memorizing userland tools. You&#x27;ll forget them in a week, and most of the time they&#x27;re pointless clutter in your head. There is zero value in memorizing all the options for `tar`. Memory will come naturally with use.<p>4) Do not waste time building the perfect set of dot files (e.g. `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`). Know where they are, but futzing with them should be &lt;1% of the time you spend learning.<p>5) Do not waste time building a Linux desktop, configuring a window manager, etc. Linux is, first and foremost, an operating system for servers, and the skills needed to get a polished Linux desktop user experience are entirely separate from (and usually dependent on) the skills needed to get a solid Linux server environment up and running.<p>6) Man pages are your friend. Before Googling how to do `something`, try `man something`. If you don&#x27;t even know the man page you&#x27;re looking for, try `man -k something`. If it&#x27;s totally new, read the whole man page. If you&#x27;re just looking for an obscure `tar` option, just skip to that section.<p>7) Cert book for RHCSA. Honestly pretty much every non-junior developer <i>should<\/i> have the skill level of a RHCSA. It teaches you how an entire system fits together. Note you don&#x27;t have to pony up some obscene fee to RedHat to actually take the test and get the cert (though, as far as certs go, it&#x27;s one of the better ones); the point is the content. And actually do all the labs&#x2F;exercises in whatever book you get.<p>8) Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment (APUE).

When I was in high school I was fortunate enough to find a copy of <i>The Unix Programming Environment<\/i>[0], which is a marvelously accessible tutorial introduction to incrementally building UNIX® programs using nothing more than the pipe operator, which means you can start writing &#x27;programs&#x27; that work on the output of other programs, until your program snowballs into a longer pipeline. The book was published in 1984 and works verbatim on any Linux system today.<p>Once you grasp how powerful this closed system of incrementally processing text is, you are sort of unstoppable at the command in a *nix system.<p>Pay careful attention to regular expressions, which are a universal tool in Unix for processing text. Along with Unix&#x27; treatment of files as a stream of newline terminated strings, this how Unix gets away with working with unstructured files instead of something like XML or S-expressions): that is, most Unix tools expect you to work with a file (or file descriptor, which is a pointer to any file-like thing in memory), and to process it one line at a time, and to use regular expressions to parse those lines into fields.<p>Working with lines using regular expressions is how the original editor, &#x2F;bin&#x2F;ed, was conceived, before the existence of visual editors like Vim and Emacs: you can find, print, and also edit lines in the file using regular expression syntax in ed, and this knowledge, btw, translates to fluent use of regular expressions in both sed (&quot;stream editor&quot;, or basically a non-interactive version of &#x2F;bin&#x2F;ed, which essentially executes your editor commands and then exits), and egrep (which searches for lines matching your regular expression).<p>In fact, once you start to see these pieces come together, look for examples in Kernighan and Pike[0] which demonstrate the use of awk. Awk is an extremely powerful but also extremely simple tool for processing data in Unix, using all the concepts I just described, and not much else. It has a few extra features, like variables and loops, which you&#x27;d expect in a programming language, but you are expected to use Awk exactly like you&#x27;d use things like grep, ed, and the shell.

( Assuming perfect condition ), All of a sudden your phone only worth half of its price you bought it for.<p>( The above numbers are for illustration only )<p>Compared to Apple <i>extremely<\/i> stringent pricing and minimal margin to retailers. Apple prefer to give a package bonus if you achieve your sales target. Something Samsung has also been following in recent years. The wholesale pricing of iPhone hasn&#x27;t drop much at all. And hence their 2nd hand value tends to be higher.<p>The question then obviously comes to why dont Android vendors keep their wholesaling price higher. For a few reasons, they need to give higher profits to retailer to help them push for sales. A sales will need higher commission. As far as I know, no Android Vendor command the same market power as Apple. Trying to keep Wholesaling price up is basically giving other Android Vendor opportunities for market share. Android can switch brands, iPhone users switch models.<p>Second being Apple&#x27;s Supply Chain Management is a Just in Time operational marvel that no one has yet been able to copy. At the end of the cycle when it is hard to judge supply and demand, you will have Phone sitting in warehouse that either do not get sold and zero cash returns, or lower the wholesaling price and try to clear it out so you have better cash flow."],"time":["2020-03-22 00:58:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22628685],"kids":{},"parent":[22628376],"text":{},"time":["2020-03-19 16:58:34"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["gumby"],"id":[22650978],"kids":[22651644,22651517,22653658,22651636,22651984],"parent":[22649638],"text":["I&#x27;ve never understood this fetish with discarded body parts.

On top of that it will save the US about $500 billion per year. So it’s right for both moral and fiscal reasons.<p>But from the perspective of your average politician they just want to get re-elected, and maybe make some extra cash through grift along the way. To do that they get financed by lobbyists that include business interests which are against this. Some that are against it for direct reasons (they’re a health company) some for less direct reasons (they’re a big US business and they like the control employer based health care gives them over their workers).<p>So few politicians are pushing it. And they don’t have to because in our system so long as they other side doesn’t push it either, they can just give a bunch of weak excuses and it never happens.<p>Will this pandemic change that? Hard to say. The current Dem front runner has said quite literally that he would veto it. Even if all the hard work was done to get it through the house and senate, all he had to do was sign it into law, he would veto it. So you know where the Dem leadership stand on this, solidly with their donors and against giving people healthcare.<p>And so far in terms of response we have seen that instead of direct and simple solutions they are focused on creating complicated and means tested solutions that leave out significant chunks of the population including the most vulnerable. (And overall acting incredible slowly given the seriousness of the situation.) So I don’t think if it happens it’ll happen easily.<p>On the other hand, if Trumps opinion ratings go down and he decides he wants to be remember he may have a crazy brain fart and spurt out an order to give everyone healthcare in this pandemic.

We had ample time since SARS in 2003 to be working on a vaccine, but right-leaning politicians have cut federal medical research funding since the 2000s (when I began seeing the connections between tech and politics). See this National Institutes of Health funding graph (NIH in green):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaas.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019-06&#x2F;Disc-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaas.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019-06&#x2F;Disc-1.jpg<\/a><p>Background:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;economy&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;86369&#x2F;erosion-of-funding-for-the-national-institutes-of-health-threatens-u-s-leadership-in-biomedical-research&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;economy&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2014...<\/a><p>Here is an article from 2010 on using zinc against coronavirus, when I first realized just how long it&#x27;s been around:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plospathogens&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.ppat.1001176\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plospathogens&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;j...<\/a><p>So a great deal has been known about the virus for quite some time. But we didn&#x27;t commit the federal funding to properly address it, because we didn&#x27;t feel it was a priority, because it didn&#x27;t affect us directly yet. I watched the same thing as a child when the powers that be actively worked to undermine AIDS research in the 80s because it didn&#x27;t strike the members of happily married nuclear families.<p>Before we have the conversation about socializing the vulnerable sectors of our economy, I think we need to get to the heart of why we are so divided politically.<p>To me, it began when Ronald Reagan said &quot;The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I&#x27;m from the Government, and I&#x27;m here to help.&quot; That framed subsequent discussions as being between the people and the government, as two separate entities. But the US was founded on We the People. We&#x27;re the government of the People, by the People, for the People.<p>Personally, I vote to start breaking down that distinction. I want to see our tax dollars at work again, solving real problems. Not going to pork barrel programs and unaudited black holes in the military industrial complex, and now the pharmaceutical industrial complex. We don&#x27;t need twelve remedies for diseases of affluence like hair loss. We need hard research done by universities again, to find cures, with real money available immediately to free researchers from spending the entirety of their careers groveling for funds.<p>The way I see it, the glorification and defense of pure capitalism is misguided. Capitalism is a process, like evolution. It&#x27;s the default position that groups of people and economies fall back to, like barter. It&#x27;s a very efficient method for distributing goods and services. But unfettered capitalism eventually leads to crony capitalism, late-stage capitalism, monopoly and oligarchy.<p>An alternative is humanism. In a situation like this one, where we have to choose between eliminating 2% of our population or losing money in our economy, I would hope that we choose human lives over capital.<p>I&#x27;m aware of the benefits of a good work ethic, doing a hard day&#x27;s work etc. We don&#x27;t need to debate the basics of capitalism vs socialism, or point fingers that someone is lazy or getting a free lunch. I&#x27;m talking about the meta-level debate about the purpose of the US government and whether we should serve the public again or double down on catering to a small handful of wealthy oligarchs."],"time":["2020-03-21 17:23:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["grayed-down"],"id":[22646965],"kids":[22647397],"parent":[22646579],"text":["I do believe you&#x27;re missing quite a lot.

To date we have formed a team of engineers, designers and medical practitioners to develop new, low resource interventions, all working collaboratively online. Bag Valve Masks (BVM), 3D printed and traditionally manufactured components are being considered to maximise potential manufacturing capabilities. We will also include other challenges and problems as they arise from frontline healthcare workers, which we will encourage our volunteers to tackle.<p>We have a core developer team publishing open source designs with ongoing communication with medical professionals regarding needs requirements, testing and validation processes. The developer team is led by OpenLung in Canada  in collaboration with an Irish based engineering and operations team.

I did research Tuesday and it seems like ventilators are positive pressure only, and they cycle between a low pressure and a high pressure. If this is the case, could an air compressor with a regulator be used as the pressure source? If so, a small device with just two pressure regulators and an electronic valve could be used to cycle between high and low pressures for each patient. I keep seeing open source ventilators that use a fan and a motor, but those seem likely to fail. Air compressors are abundant and could literally be taken from construction sites to be used. You put a pressure regulator to go down to the (very low) pressures one might want as a maximum for any patient, then you can gang that up to a whole bunch of hoses. Finally a little box with a couple of regulators can adjust the per patient high and low levels.<p>This to me seems much simpler and more reliable than ventilators with their own fan. But I don’t have a good way of reaching anyone. I’ve created a thread on my website with my sources, thinking, and some questions.

If I were to go back and do it all over again I would definitely spend my time doing literally anything else. I was so convinced that if I just followed my fancy, worked hard and made cool stuff, learning anything and everything I could along the way, then eventually I would find work doing things I liked, formal degree be damned. It did not work out that way, at all.<p>After years of searching for work in the Redmond area and failing to do so (because, no professional experience, no degree), I randomly happened to find work by randomly logging onto a forum I hadn&#x27;t visited in years and randomly happened to find a thread where a guy was looking to hire for remote webdev contract work. After that contract was complete, I spent another couple years looking for further work, and had to eventually move back home away from Redmond because the cost of living was too high while I was unemployed. After plural years of searching again, I finally managed to get a second remote webdev job. I don&#x27;t like modern webdev and would much rather do almost anything else but now I&#x27;ve had two jobs doing it and I feel despair—am I locked into this for the rest of my career? With no degree and only these two jobs&#x27; worth of &quot;Professional Work Experience&quot; under my belt, it sure seems that way. Recruiters and hiring departments seem to care about little else. They sure don&#x27;t give a shit about any personal projects, in my experience. And this is even in spite of the fact that I more or less picked a new language and&#x2F;or framework for each project, which, in my mind, shows an aptitude for learning new things, being adaptable, and having an above-average &quot;general programming aptitude&quot; than someone who&#x27;s made fourteen React projects in the past couple of years or whatever.<p>But apparently companies don&#x27;t see things this way, or maybe I&#x27;m just not good at finding the ones that do, or maybe there&#x27;s something else to my approach that has been All Wrong.
