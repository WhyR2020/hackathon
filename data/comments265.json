A topic that hasn&#x27;t been tapped into that much, but which has an existing audience just waiting to get involved. This was the case with Wario Forums, which had no competition whatsoever when it launched, and was started pretty much because myself and a few others in the fandom wanted a forum about the series and were willing to help get one off the ground.<p>2. An awful lot of dedication to the field from its founder. It&#x27;s a cliche now, but forums and communities in general are usually not built in a day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month. So the founder needs to be super dedicated to the subject area, and willing to put in potentially weeks of unpaid work getting the site off the ground.<p>3. Unique and interesting content about the topic. Again, this was pretty easy for me on Wario Forums, the people I invited had experience translating games from Japanese, creating remixes of the music, making mods and level editors, etc, and I had a lot of knowledge of the series and what kinds of discussions would be interesting to a fan.<p>But yeah, this is where the whole &#x27;passion&#x27; aspect comes in again.

Eller&#x27;s was one I considered but without being able to take notes it was hard to keep track of the set structure. Recursive division is fairly easy to do by hand but creates ugly mazes.<p>The other constraint that I had was that I was designing mazes that were created by wall addition, rather than passage carving (limitations of the media) so many of the algorithms just couldn&#x27;t apply (like recursive backtracking), or were tricky to figure out how to translate to a wall addition version.<p>The algorithm I settled on is what Think Labyrinth calls the &quot;Perfect&quot; wall addition algorithm. It generates perfect mazes and is capable of generating all mazes (and depending on how you choose segments, it can be made uniform, but my human brain based random number generator is limited). Basically you choose a spot on any wall at random, and start drawing a line from there. The line can fork, and turn, and wind all around, but it can never touch another wall. Then, at some point, you pick up the crayon and start again at another random point. Now whenever I see a maze I can&#x27;t help but look at the structure of the walls, and see the forest of trees rooted on the outer edge rather than the open passages in the maze itself."],"time":["2019-12-19 16:32:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kevinwang"],"id":[21830028],"kids":[21830364],"parent":[21828903],"text":["Hey, this reminds me of the Advent of Code problem today (day 18)!

It contains much of the history that lead up to the decision to base significant portions of the soundness of mathematics on top of set theory (and by proxy: Cantor&#x27;s work on infinities). My recollection is fuzzy since it was years ago but I recall it starts at Zeno&#x27;s paradox and follows along to calculus and beyond.<p>The book suggests there was a lot of displeasure and argumentation within the philosophy and math communities because it was felt that there was no real basis for infinitesimals. Some mathematicians (I believe Hilbert and Frege among them?) became determined to shut-up the pesky philosophers by proving the soundness of math based on some logical axiomatic fundamentals. Of course, this was later proven to be impossible by Gödel but at the time they considered it a win that philosophers and mathematicians could at least agree on logic (and more broadly &quot;logical empiricism&quot; which is a basis of &quot;analytical philosophy&quot;).<p>I recall being completely dissatisfied at the arguments presented in favour of ZFC (not mathematically, but philosophically). I remember there was a single paragraph somewhere in the final third of the book that I head to re-read several times before I finally gave up in frustration. My impression of this history is that the mathematicians &quot;won&quot; in some sense by railroading their ideas. Calculus works, right? It is extremely effective and leads to correct results ... so ignore the seeming paradox of summing an infinite quantity of infinitesimally small values and move on already! Further, ignore the actual paradoxes inherent in infinite sets. And this was all done not because there was some problem to be solved but rather to shut-down debate that seemed to undermine the philosophical position of logical empiricism.<p>Another interesting (if historically questionable) exploration of this topic is the graphic novel Logicomix [2].

[1]<p>For me, I would have preferred even less text than currently in the tutorial. If you look at the image on the first Lines X page I link below of the two turquoise dots, that&#x27;s the first page of that tutorial. No text at all. You have to connect the two dots by swiping. The next tutorial screen has some extra black dots, and you learn that you have to cover all black dots with your line as well, not only connect the colored dots. Though I have to say, my mother couldn&#x27;t figure that step out in Lines X without my help, even when she&#x27;s into different types of puzzles, so it can be argued that having no text will only appeal to more hardcore users.<p>But something similar could be done in your game. I didn&#x27;t need the text in the first tutorial screen, because the 4 \nand the empty squares would make me swipe to see what happens, and I can at a maximum cover 4 squares in any direction. Also, the line changes color when you reach the correct number of squares, which is plenty information that this is the intended length. On the second screen, I don&#x27;t need text to tell me lines can&#x27;t overlap, because the tutorial won&#x27;t advance until I create the correct solution.<p>I would allow a bit more trial and error from the user instead of explanatory text. The minimalism can be taken further. That way you can learn the game and figure out the rules at the same time.<p>Here are some suggestions, that you can use if you wish:<p>1. Hide the text in the tutorial by adding the text &quot;help&quot; next to &quot;quit&quot; in the bottoma of the UI, or a question mark somewhere. The first tutorial page should (according to me) just be the puzzle! Clicking help would show the text and the heading &quot;Welcome to Ordinary Puzzle&quot; and so on, and clicking help again would hide all text from the page.<p>2. Consider showing currently solved and the maximum number of puzzles of each size. For example:<p>small 3&#x2F;100<p>medium 0&#x2F;100<p>large 0&#x2F;100<p>That way the player gets an estimation of how large the game is, and it might encourage players to finish more puzzles. Or if the number of puzzles are automatically generated and infinite in number, a would like to know how many I&#x27;ve finished of each size.<p>3. Clicking the number and stars in the top right should lead to a progress page or at least an explanation of stars. Currently I don&#x27;t know what &quot;38<i>&quot; means after solving a couple of puzzles. It would make more sense to me if it said the number of finished puzzles, but right now I don&#x27;t know what the number means. Total number of squares with lines in finished puzzles? I just finished a new puzzle and it says &quot;+27<\/i>&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know what the 27 stars are from.<p>4. After finishing a puzzle, I don&#x27;t need the screen that shows the puzzle name and having to click &quot;new puzzle&quot;. I&#x27;d like the game to automatically start the next puzzle, possible after showing the puzzle name and &quot;completed&quot;, which would make me finish more of them in succession. If I want to stop playing, I can click quit from the next puzzle, I don&#x27;t need to be asked between every puzzle.<p>5. I agree with the other poster who wanted to start from any square, where the line would be tossed if it doesn&#x27;t connect to a number. On the other hand, I can definitely view the current implementation as a slight quirk of the game, and accept the way it works. It doesn&#x27;t take much away from the game the way it is, and it reinforces that you have to interact with the numbers in some way and not just swipe randomly. So having the numbers start each interaction makes sense from that perspective.<p>[1]<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nintendo.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;detail&#x2F;lines-x-switch&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nintendo.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;detail&#x2F;lines-x-switch&#x2F;<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nintendolife.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;lines_x_is_a_relaxing_puzzle_game_coming_to_switch_next_week_and_its_less_than_usd1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nintendolife.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;lines_x_is_a_relax...<\/a>"],"time":["2019-12-19 13:47:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hankstenberg"],"id":[21829922],"kids":{},"parent":[21812679],"text":["Awesome game.

You are there to develop a strong (broad) foundation of understanding and skills, on top of which you can (in the future) paste domain-specific knowledge to rapidly level-up and acquire skills.<p>IMHO, concentrating on CS to the exclusion of all else (eg: as an undergraduate major) is too limiting, too early in one&#x27;s development. Computers happen to be a very &quot;artificial&quot; system with arcane rules, and an understanding of computers tends to be less generalizable than an understanding of natural systems -- both physical systems (science&#x2F;engineering) and human systems (humanities). The more mathematical aspects of CS are definitely generalizable (to the extent that computation is basically applied math!), but IMHO CS as a field has not developed enough to make that link obvious -- let alone teach it to undergrads. Also, when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail -- we are currently infatuated with &quot;CS&quot;. That should (likely) relax to a more reasonable state in ~10 years. (eg: there is absolutely no reason for &quot;machine learning&quot; or &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; to be considered a sub-field of CS, other than the fact that incidentally it happens to be implemented on computers. Breakthrough ideas in ML will likely come from other fields.)<p>Computers are definitely a fantastic tool, and offer great leverage, <i>if and only if you have developed a refined &quot;taste&quot; of problems worth tackling, things worth building, and visions worth pursuing<\/i>. You will likely not acquire that taste by just studying CS.<p>A little pondering will make one realize how it is quite impossible for every &quot;major&quot; to have the same number of &quot;credits&quot; worth of knowledge -- and exactly enough to fill up 4 years of requirements. The corollary is that not all course credits are equally valuable. If you want the best value for your time in college, try to pick the most challenging&#x2F;foundational&#x2F;important courses in a field, and then, instead of spending too much time on the relative &quot;fluff&quot; in the same field, go find equally foundational courses in an adjacent field. The easier stuff can be tacked on top later with little effort. That way, you are uniquely well-placed to make interesting connections, and are better prepared to respond optimally to a changing environment. (See: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dilbertblog.typepad.com&#x2F;the_dilbert_blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;07&#x2F;career-advice.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dilbertblog.typepad.com&#x2F;the_dilbert_blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;07&#x2F;car...<\/a>) The analogy in the context of investing would be: it is crazy try betting on a single company over the long run (~50+ years); better to bet on a broader portfolio.<p>If you are looking for a very concrete suggestion, one way to operationalize that advice: in addition to programming&#x2F;CS, learn a bunch of math, a bunch of at least one of the hard sciences (Physics&#x2F;Chemistry&#x2F;Biology), and the basics of engineering &#x2F; systems modeling (linear system theory, control theory, signal processing, etc.). IMHO, the humanities can wait till one is older&#x2F;wiser -- it can be learned easily enough outside university, and is probably wasted on 20 year olds without enough life experience. Nothing wrong with the minimum humanities requirements -- pick something you find interesting and try to get the flavor rather than getting bogged down with the details. All that was just individual learning. If you can work on collaborative projects, and learn to work well with others and lead when necessary, it will serve you well in life (that is a rare and extremely valuable skill).<p>Needless to say, this is not the path to a 4.0 GPA, or the highest paying internship&#x2F;first-job, etc. but you get out what you put in, so if you work sincerely, you&#x27;ll be fine in the long run.

If the answer is no, then we&#x27;re going to be wealthy for the rest of our days.<p>Nobody knows the answer to this question.    In the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, programming tools got better and better and we all thought that we&#x27;d have some rational case tool type deal that managers would voice activate and make software without programmers, or, if programmers were still needed, they&#x27;d be regular joes making regular joe money.   And that looked realistic.  as a teen in the mid &#x27;90s, home computers were super common and a bunch of people at my (not very good) high school did basic programming.   None of us thought this was the road to dentist money.   (but then, most of us would have been pretty happy with manufacturing money.  Expectations were low.)<p>In the aughts, this idea fell away, and now in the teens, it&#x27;s nigh unthinkable;   big companies throw a lot of money at the best computer people they can find, and these people then code in editors that look primitive compared to the IDEs of the late &#x27;90s.   I strongly suspect we&#x27;ll see some swing back towards more reliance on tools and less reliance on genius in the coming decades, just &#x27;cause I expect things to cycle that way.    I personally think there&#x27;s something to genius? but... I also think that things won&#x27;t always be as good for us as they are now.  Perhaps it is because I started my first programming job in &#x27;97, but I expect business cycle swings to be extreme and temporary.  The business cycle goes up and the business cycle goes down.<p>If you had my opportunities (i.e. no college)  I&#x27;d say that CS was almost certainly your best bet; go deep, go hard, ignore everything else and get yourself a job while the getting was good.  learn breadth later.     But if you are the sort who got into an elite school, well, you have a lot more opportunities, most of which I probably don&#x27;t entirely understand (and that I&#x27;m certainly not qualified to evaluate)<p>I would bet all the money I can borrow on the continued importance of computers... but my personal bet?  my personal bet is that in the future it will be more like literacy.  Sure, sure you need to be able to tell computers what to do.   but you also need to know a thing so you know what to tell them to do.   Tools will continue to evolve. There will be lots of spaces for people who can understand both what we are trying to get the computer to do (be that business, medicine, whatever)  <i>and<\/i> how to tell the computer how to do it.<p>My own advice to you is to get some breadth.    I mean, if you can, get that FAANG internship; working at a top-tier company has huge differences in pay and prestige from working at a second or third tier company.   Do that now while it&#x27;s hot, if you can.   (this is general advice I&#x27;d give to young me:  don&#x27;t be so afraid of super hot trends, they are fun, and super remunerative!)<p>It took me two decades (more if you count the IT work I did in high school)  to get to a top-tier company, and it is a huge difference.   If you can do that out of college?  you will have a huge leg up financially.   (and in terms of choices as to what you can do next)<p>All that said, you have a lot more opportunities than I did.  You&#x27;ll be fine.  Enjoy it.   Learn stuff. meet interesting people.

But I feel like it&#x27;s VERY hard to figure this out about someone. It&#x27;s pretty easy to test how well someone knows a particular technology or tool (given some variance for operating in a high-pressure scenario etc.) but it seems pretty hard to tell if someone can learn new things quickly, and learn the right things. I feel like this is what algorithm tests are trying to do, but I also feel like a lot of algorithms are based on having a key insight into a problem that is, at least in my experience, pretty hard to have when you&#x27;re in a room with strangers on a timer and being judged, so if you don&#x27;t know the particular algorithm to apply, good luck. And also it&#x27;s pretty easy to go study algorithms and hope you remember how to implement DFS if that&#x27;s what they ask you in the interview. And there is some non-zero value to just knowing about different data structures and algorithms for certain types of work for sure. I don&#x27;t think many of us web developer types will be implementing DFS ourselves, but I run into issues pretty often where having knowledge about different data structures and algorithms comes in handy.<p>So I can see the appeal to doing a test like this that has nothing to do with a particular skill, where you&#x27;re trying to evaluate someone&#x27;s judgement and how quickly they can absorb new ideas or figure something out on the fly etc. BUT, I just think there are too many factors that can really muddy this up, and I still don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s an objective way to measure &quot;smart and learns quickly&quot;. Even &quot;learns quickly&quot; is somewhat vague; I personally wouldn&#x27;t expect someone to pick up, say, functional programming in an hour just by saying &quot;go read about it.&quot; Some things take longer to learn than others.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s no silver bullet. I still feel like we end up making pretty subjective decisions about other people when interviewing them. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re even all that aware of them ourselves. I would say though that if you&#x27;re interviewing somewhere, you&#x27;re getting useful information about that place by how they interview you, and so I wouldn&#x27;t feel too disheartened if you feel like the interview is unfair or doesn&#x27;t work for you.

When she tried to cancel it for me through their online portal, she asked for my email address, which was required to cancel the service.  I refused to give it to her.  She didn&#x27;t know what to do because that portal was the only tool that she had to work with, and it required the information (she was professional the entire time, btw, as was I), so I told her that I would take care of it.<p>I walked out to my new truck (still in the sales lot), pressed the OnStar button, and the operator came on, asking me to set up my service.  I told them that I wanted to cancel the service completely.  What did they do?  They asked for my personal information.<p>I had a back-and-forth with them for 10 minutes or so, with the operator telling me that they could not turn off OnStar unless I gave them my personally identifying information, and I kept telling them that they did not need that information at all and that I would not give it to them (they already knew my vehicle&#x27;s ID... it&#x27;s automatically included with the OnStar call).<p>When asked why I would cancel a &quot;free&quot; service period, I told them in no uncertain terms that I disliked the OnStar company, that I did not consent to sharing any private information with them, and I wanted the &quot;demo&quot; service (that was active when purchasing a new vehicle) disabled completely because I had purchased the vehicle.  They kept telling me that they could not cancel the service unless I provided my personally identifying information.<p>I offered them an alternative.  I told them that I could hang up, and the OnStar would stay in the unlimited &quot;demo&quot; mode where I would continue to get the service for free.<p>They put me on hold, and when they came back, I was told that their supervisor OK&#x27;d the cancellation without me giving them any personal information.<p>I should have just removed the antenna!"],"time":["2019-12-18 16:50:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Shivetya"],"id":[21823405],"kids":[21824601,21824597,21829643],"parent":[21816479],"text":["I haven&#x27;t seen it mentioned, but as a Tesla owner one concern I had was that if I sold my car Tesla might not get around to wiping the information it had on me.

This seems like the most thorough way to make sure every buyer at all levels of the supply chain takes this environmental cost into account in their decision-making, whether they are specifically thinking about it or not.<p>So it seems the best way to avoid this issue would be for cobalt based on child labor to be unavailable for purchase and a second-best way would be to make sure it&#x27;s more expensive so that buyers within the supply chain will automatically avoid that dependency.<p>When we get to the point where consumers need to step in and do the decision-making because nobody else will then this is probably the most inefficient way to do it, but it seems the supply chain won&#x27;t do it unless they are pushed into it?"],"time":["2019-12-18 15:49:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["baybal2"],"id":[21824804],"kids":[21836657,21826618],"parent":[21824178],"text":["Cobalt and tantalum are truly the Achilles heel of industrial economies.<p>No cobalt - no lithium batteries, and no mobile gadgets<p>No tantalum - no high spec capacitors omnipresent in compact power supplies, thus again no high value electronics as such unless you want to put huge electrolytic caps into your smartphone."],"time":["2019-12-18 14:56:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["krupan"],"id":[21825410],"kids":[21825439,21826678],"parent":[21824178],"text":["Do we all feel better blaming the tech companies for this than blaming ourselves, the customers of the tech companies?"],"time":["2019-12-18 15:55:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["twodave"],"id":[21825244],"kids":{},"parent":[21824178],"text":["There&#x27;s a mining-friendly city in Ontario literally named Cobalt where there are believed to be large deposits of the mineral.

It validated some of my own observations of how businesses are actually built and although it didn&#x27;t even get off the landing ground, it was nice to read even as a technical report of what not to do.<p>While I do not have experience of running my own start-up, I have with keen interest seen people build start-ups around me and by far the biggest leading factor to their success is the team. The team is everything. Sure, you can maybe sketch up a decent app and maybe sell it to couple businesses but then what? You&#x27;ll be over your head with work and maybe hire some of your friends and if things work out well, it could work. But why didn&#x27;t you hire those great friends then in the beginning? Why didn&#x27;t you cofound the company together?<p>See there&#x27;s something about people working cohesively in groups that just outmatches anything that a 1-man team could do. Now I&#x27;m generalizing here a little, but the fact of the matter is that alone, without your peers to constantly revalidate, build and improve your business-idea, you&#x27;ll be miles away from those teams that are actually doing it. And if the idea sucks, you&#x27;ll just pick another one. It&#x27;s just that easy. When you have a group of friends who are that driven and capable as you are, it&#x27;s only matter of time when your start-up actually takes off. There are so many would I say &quot;mediocre&quot; folks running perfectly good companies because they had great co-founders, had those social skills and networks to grow larger and eventually it became self-sustaining.<p>Hmm it&#x27;s still a bit hard to pinpoint the exact reason why I think it is so. Maybe if I put it in this way: you are creating a machine made of humans. In the heart of it is the dynamo, the moving force. That is what keeps it moving. And even if it would one day be gone for some reason the machine will keep running, by its inertia, for who knows how long. But to build this starting unit, this dynamo. It is what starts this whole process.<p>In this case, sure you made the wrong calls with your tech choices. Understandable. But if you had a good co-founder, or even better a good team, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d have together figured out in no time that this was a dumb way of doing this, and picked up something you knew and were able to execute with quickly. It could have been just jQuery and PHP5 and be just as fine as any new framework (with a massive technical debt waiting, sure) but that alone would have not killed your start-up."],"time":["2019-12-19 01:44:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sky_rw"],"id":[21830623],"kids":{},"parent":[21827844],"text":["&quot;Software as a Service&quot; implies a business.

The takeaway is that you&#x27;re more likely to consume because it is there.<p>2) Mobility - It&#x27;s mobile, unlike a bong. Get high right before your favorite song at a concert. Whip out the vape pen.<p>3) Stealth A) (Form Factor) - I think these are becoming popular with teenagers primarily because, if a teenager wants to smoke in their parents house, and avoid detection from their parents, a vape pen is less obvious. The pen is objectively easier to hide than a flower setup.<p>B) (Stench) Vape pens don&#x27;t smell as much. I&#x27;ve seen signs on businesses refusing service due to the marijuana stench on customers. People even smoke vapes in public and it&#x27;s indistinguishable from vaping tobacco unless closely inspected or smelled. (The smell from vape pens exists, it&#x27;s less noticeable than flower.)<p>4) Convenience - The steps to smoke a vape pen (push of a button and inhale) are simpler than the process of smoking out of a bong.

It lets you see, manage and deploy to various platforms like OpenStack, VMWare, RHEV, OpenShift and public cloud like AWS and Azure, with single pane of glass view across them all. It has its own orchestration engine but also integrates with Ansible for automated deployments.<p>As best I can tell, their CloudForms updated Statement of Direction article (behind paywall, sorry) shows that Red Hat is killing off support for non-Red Hat platforms like VMware, AWS, Azure, etc. The justification is to focus on open platforms, which I think means CloudForms will ultimately disappear entirely with Red Hat focusing on OpenShift instead.<p>We made a strategic decision to focus our management strategy on the future — open, cloud-native environments that promote portability across on-premise, private and public clouds.<p>CloudForms updated Statement of Direction\nHowever to me this is still a big blow to users of the platform, where I’m sure most will have at least some VMWare to manage. Indeed, when implementing CloudForms at work and talking to Red Hat, they said that their most mature integration in CloudForms is with VMWare.<p>According to the Red Hat article, CloudForms with full platform support is being embedded into IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management and users are encouraged to “migrate your Red Hat CloudForms subscriptions to IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management licenses.” Red Hat’s CloudForms Statement of Direction FAQ article lays out the migration path, which does confirm Red Hat will continue to support existing clients for the remainder of their subscription.<p>So in short, CloudForms from Red Hat is being crippled and will only support Red Hat products, which really means that users are being forced to buy IBM instead. Of course Red Hat is entitled to change their own products, but this move does seem curious when execs on both sides said they would remain independent. Maybe it’s better than killing CloudForms outright?<p>We can publicly say that all our products will survive in their current form and continue to grow. We will continue to support all our products; we’re separate entities and we’re going to have separate contracts, and there is no intention to de-emphasise any of our products and we’ll continue to invest heavily in it.<p>Jim Whitehurst as Red Hat CEO"],"time":["2019-12-19 00:18:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jakemal"],"id":[21830662],"kids":[21830799,21830988],"parent":[21830223],"text":["The headline is extremely editorialized and attempts to steer the discussion in a very specific direction.

The example they use (of Noorderwaard being &quot;given back to the water&quot;) is a result of the &quot;Ruimte voor de Rivier&quot; (Room for the River, verbatim) programme, and the implication is that these policies are necessary due to sea level rise caused by climate change. But that&#x27;s not completely true!<p>The Netherlands has a very well-protected coast (after the big flood of 1953 the Delta Works were built to prevent coastal flooding from ever happening again on such a scale), so coastal flooding isn&#x27;t that big of a threat. And while it&#x27;s true that rising sea-levels imply a rise in water-levels in the rivers too (esp. the &quot;backwater effect&quot; is dangerous), that&#x27;s mostly a slow and predictable change - dykes can be raised to deal with it.<p>The issue is the annual floodings of the rivers; they&#x27;ve been growing in intensity due to a) more meltwater from the Alps upstream and b) more&#x2F;heavier rain, both a consequence of climate change. Another effect climate change has is subsidence; the country is gradually &quot;sinking&quot;, allowing for more land to be flooded in the case of high river tides.<p>BUT a big motivation for the programme is also the fact that more and more people have been moving to areas susceptible to flooding. The Netherlands has a very high population density, and about 4 million people are currently living within a river basin, and the programme seeks to protect these people.<p>So really, I don&#x27;t think the country will disappear - it has the most experience in the world in dealing with these problems. The rivers can be contained, you just won&#x27;t be able to live right next to them; and reclamation of the entire country is unlikely imo. Especially if the other countries located in the watershed of the Rhine up their game - the Netherlands has essentially been facing these issues alone due to it being downstream, but Germany, France, Switzerland, etc. can all help contain the Rhine &amp; reduce flooding.

There are tens of thousands of them. Their owners are often passionate. They compete with each other, so there&#x27;s incentive to write hard-to-adjudicate competing claims. Many have commercial backing, which further warps incentives. The projects themselves are highly technical; many, like Arrow, are software development tools and components. There are few authoritative sources that reliably track open source projects. Keeping up involves directly following bug trackers and message boards and then synthesizing a narrative, which is the definition of &quot;original research&quot;, forbidden in the encyclopedia.<p>It&#x27;s likely that Arrow does deserve a WP article. But Arrow&#x27;s sponsors misunderstand more about Wikipedia than Wikipedia does about Arrow. Writing a defensible article about their project will require work; in particular, they&#x27;re going to need to spend the time tracking down authoritative sources for why Arrow is notable, and those claims will probably need to be something more persuasive than &quot;hundreds of companies use it&quot;; hundreds of companies use all sorts of things that don&#x27;t, and shouldn&#x27;t, be featured in their own encyclopedia articles.<p>I understand the impulse behind &quot;this project is important; it should have a Wikipedia article&quot;.

It might not have been when someone first tried to create a Wikipedia page for it in 2017 (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Draft:Apache_Arrow&amp;action=history\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Draft:Apache_Arro...<\/a>), but in the three years since it has become a major project, see e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.apache.org&#x2F;foundation&#x2F;entry&#x2F;the-apache-software-foundation-announces46\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.apache.org&#x2F;foundation&#x2F;entry&#x2F;the-apache-softwar...<\/a> Notability is clearly subjective, depends on what the author and reviewer find interesting. In the variant I submitted yesterday I tried to make it clear why it&#x27;s notable - Apache arrow is a standard format that connects different languages, runtimes, data systems, communities, e.g. the Python and Java data communities. See e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wesmckinney.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;apache-arrow-pandas-internals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wesmckinney.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;apache-arrow-pandas-internals&#x2F;<\/a> - Apache Arrow is to my knowledge partly the brainchild of Wes McKinney, creator of pandas, it&#x27;s his attempt (looking strongly like success) to resolve a major issue in data science.\n- I think it&#x27;s a good point Justin made at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dremio.com&#x2F;why-apache-arrow-wikipedia&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dremio.com&#x2F;why-apache-arrow-wikipedia&#x2F;<\/a> that it&#x27;s bad that Wikipedia editors reject articles on stuff they know nothing about - if you look at their profiles, they don&#x27;t seem to have any knowledge or interest about technology or software. That&#x27;s not a good system.\n- I haven&#x27;t contributed to Wikipedia really before, and I don&#x27;t understand the rules, I admit that. Probably what I did yesterday was just not following their process, and that&#x27;s the reason my edit was reverted. I guess it&#x27;s also true that Justin at first didn&#x27;t do a great job at submitting an impartial, non-PR article. However, my understanding from looking at some drafts and the talk page is that he then took the editor comments into account, and the last variant of the page he tried to submit in July 2019 was OK.\n- So overall I think the answer to the question &quot;Why isn&#x27;t there a Wikipedia page on Apache arrow?&quot; is that it&#x27;s an unfortunate case of authors and editors not doing a great job. At least I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t do a good job yesterday, I wanted to help, but only had an hour, not a day to learn how Wikipedia ticks and to do more research to find better references. I hope someone with more experience in Wikipedia and Arrow will try to re-write and re-submit the Wikipedia article in the future.\n- The rule to discourage (or forbid?) people involved with Apache Arrow from contributing to its Wikipedia page is unfortunate. I recently started to use it and learn about it, but I don&#x27;t know much about it at this point. E.g. Wes McKinney has written at this point 8 high-quality blog posts about it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wesmckinney.com&#x2F;archives.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wesmckinney.com&#x2F;archives.html<\/a>) - those don&#x27;t count as references? Even if he or the Apache Arrow team wrote a paper about it, it wouldn&#x27;t count because it&#x27;s a primary source, and Wikipedia only wants secondary sources to establish notability? There are ~ 100 videos on YouTube, and many blog posts and a few podcasts (e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineeringdaily.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;17&#x2F;apache-arrow-with-uwe-korn&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineeringdaily.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;17&#x2F;apache-arrow...<\/a>) that mention Apache Arrow. Naturally almost all of them are from Apache Arrow contributors, or from companies using Apache Arrow.\n- Apache Arrow has an interesting story, and it has evolved over the past years and will keep evolving, so I think exactly for that reason a Wikipedia page would be good to have, since the current project page and old blog posts don&#x27;t capture that well."],"time":["2019-12-19 14:25:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["swayvil"],"id":[21829579],"kids":[21829646],"parent":[21826974],"text":["Wikipedia is administrated by inbred autistics.

In theory the bank is not allowed to fall below a certain reserve threshold because they would be too fragile towards bank-runs. This is needed because left to their own devices banks would just leverage to the max regardless of their cash position.<p>The crucial point is that the reserve is only measured at the end of day, so a bank can dip below the safety thresholds as long as they make it up by the evening. Overnight loans allow them to ignore the safeties since they just loan the cash for a brief moment to be in the clear with regulation come the daily measuring, but just return the money straight after the measurement has taken place.<p>It is an organized method by which the Fed facilitates regulation dodging for the financial sector."],"time":["2019-12-18 19:12:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["funemployed"],"id":[21827168],"kids":[21827398,21827987,21827684,21827947,21827740,21827608,21827363],"parent":[21826758],"text":["If I lend my friend $10 every day for lunch and he pays me back the next day and this happens 5 days in a row in what context would it make sense to say I have lent him $50 dollars?

I feel conflicted after reading it because while I sympathize with the plight that journalists face, I also just see so many problems with this author’s analysis and questions.<p>There is a fundamental distinction between the internet and radio&#x2F;broadcast television in that the usable spectrum of airwaves is a finite public resource. If I’m broadcasting on 700 AM then you’re not. The licensing and regulatory structure that is (debatably) appropriate for public broadcast has no application to the internet. There is room for everyone to publish what they want.<p>The advertising model is not broken. The wealth of information and services available to users at zero monetary cost is a miracle of the “free-market free-for-all” and is most beneficial to those with the least amount of disposable income. Coining “surveillance capitalism” as a pejorative term to describe the success of this model is ridiculous.<p>&gt; While it’s true that public service media like Wikipedia have had to share the landscape with increasingly sophisticated commercial companies, it’s also true that they fill a void in the marketplace.<p>Wikipedia is not a “public service” media organization. The author uses the same term to describe the BBC. If that were the case, then the sale of every internet-connected device would be taxed to fund Wikipedia and the organization would be run by the government. Instead Wikipedia is funded by voluntary donations from millions of individuals. The fact that it fills a void in the marketplace is a testament to the success of the free market approach to the internet.<p>&gt; We’ve grown so used to the idea that social media is damaging our democracies that we’ve thought very little about how we might build new networks to strengthen societies.<p>Built into this is the assumption that social media is doing more damage than or is more susceptible to malevolent influence than state-run news organizations or the monopolistic broadcast and print publications of the 20th century and I reject that. If you don’t like Twitter and Facebook, then stop using them. Asking the government to get involved is the least productive thing anyone can do. Increased regulation will only serve to further cement the current crop of companies in their dominant position and we don’t need any more Quaeros.
