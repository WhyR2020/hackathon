Since it&#x27;s built on Chromium, it has all the common extensions I use with Chrome (Dark Reader, uBlock Origin, etc.). It has built-in Tor and a rich set of default privacy features. The ads it provides are opt-in and the way that it allows the user to choose which website&#x2F;content creators to reward allows a level of freedom to users that other browsers typically don&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t know about the ethics behind everything Brave is doing - but this built in functionality of 404 redirects with the help of the IA&#x2F;Wayback Machine is, to me, an interesting and welcome feature. I did not know, before reading this thread, that other browsers had plugins&#x2F;extensions available for this. The fact that Brave is simply building it in natively seems to be a bold move. If other browsers adopt similar functionality natively, we&#x27;ll know that it was a winning move. When all is said and done, despite any missteps Brave may be making, it is trying a different approach, and I think that in the end, whether or not Brave succeeds, that&#x27;s healthy for a competitive browser ecosystem.<p>Edit: One thing I&#x27;d really like to see for Brave&#x27;s mobile browser in the future is the ability to use Chrome extensions - it seems completely strange to me that this hasn&#x27;t been implemented yet (if I&#x27;m slow on the uptake and this capability has been added, please correct me)"],"time":["2020-02-26 03:27:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["katsura"],"id":[22419308],"kids":[22419350,22419753,22421678],"parent":[22417627],"text":["I used Brave for a couple of months, but in the end I had to switch, because it is just not ready to be used in everyday situations.<p>I actually tried their crypto ads, out of curiosity.

For all\nthree this happens via the search autocomplete feature, which\nsends web addresses to backend servers in realtime as they are\ntyped. In addition, Firefox includes identifiers in its telemetry\ntransmissions that can potentially be used to link these over\ntime. Telemetry can be disabled, but again is silently enabled\nby default. Firefox also maintains an open websocket for\npush notifications that is linked to a unique identifier and so\npotentially can also be used for tracking and which cannot\nbe easily disabled.<p>Safari defaults to a poor choice of start\npage that leaks information to multiple third parties and allows\nthem to set cookies without any user consent. Safari otherwise\nmade no extraneous network connections and transmitted no\npersistent identifiers, but allied iCloud processes did make\nconnections containing identifiers.<p>From a privacy perspective Microsoft Edge and Yandex are\nqualitatively different from the other browsers studied.

The Indian TV reporter describes the Taj Mahal as the &quot;enduring symbol of love&quot;.

Something to behold. Oliver does this with crucial evidence showing Modi&#x27;s divisive Hindu nation-state ideologies linked absurdly (only because it is true) to Hitler&#x27;s Nazi ideologies! It is simultaneously comical, absurd and terrifying. Then there are revelations of the ruling party&#x27;s (BJP&#x27;s) systematic attempt at revising Indian history in school curricula - excoriating the proud history of India&#x27;s secural founding &quot;fathers&quot; in favour of aspects of bizarre creationist style text about the origins of different races! (I balked).<p>This episode stands out as one of Oliver&#x27;s best because he crafted the best &quot;shit sandwich&quot; argument I&#x27;ve seen in a while. He neatly folds the absurd proposition made by Trump that Modi is a unifier of the people. But only ironically for the opposite reason!

Which is why I will be cheering them on.<p>If they reproduce their results in other clinical settings, the immediate impact on patient care includes: \n1) accelerating diagnosis (and treatment) for patients with traumatic brain injuries (by effectively up-scaling lower resolution scans)\n2) healthcare providers in developing countries will effectively get a low-cost &quot;upgrade&quot; to their existing equipment\n3) cancer patients in rural America could be monitored for treatment response in a setting that is closer to home (because rural communities tend to be resource-poor in terms of medical technology).<p>If we consider that a logical extension of their work could be to develop a compression algorithm for MRI data, then it&#x27;s easy to see an even broader impact that includes: 1) connecting rural patients with high-quality radiologist services (i.e. remote MRI interpretations), and\n2) decrease the cost of long-term storage, access, and retrieval for MRI data.<p>On the topic of FB&#x27;s issues with privacy: I agree that FB has a long way to earn my trust as a doctor and a patient. That being said, it&#x27;s important to give credit where credit is due. It seems that FB gained access to the imaging data by working collaboratively with NYU on this specific project. By comparison, it&#x27;s an open secret among those of us in the biomedical informatics community that over the course of many years Google Cloud has quietly gained access to the personal health information of millions of Americans.

This result is statisti- cally significantly better than either alternative with p-values 1.09 × 10-11 and 2.18 × 10-11 respectively, and the adver- sarial approach was ranked as the best or tied for best in 85.8% of 120 total evaluations (95% CI: 0.78-0.91). The dithering approach is also statistically significantly better than the standard approach.\nWe also asked radiologists if banding was present (in any form) in the reconstructions in each case. This evaluation is highly subjective, as “banding” is hard to define in a pre- cise enough way to ensure consistency between evaluators. Considering each radiologist’s evaluation independently, on average banding is still reported to be present in 72.5% (95% CI: 0.62-0.82) of cases even with the adversarial learn- ing penalty. The radiologists were not consistent in their rankings; the overall percentages reported by the six radiol- ogists were 20%, 75%, 75%, 80%, 85%, and 100% for the adversarial reconstructions. In contrast, for the baseline and dithered reconstructions, only one radiologist reported less than 100% presence of banding for each method (80% and 85% presence respectively, from different radiologists).\nWe believe these numbers could be improved if more tuning went into the model; however, it’s also possible that features of the sub-sampled reconstructions generally may be con- fused with banding, and so any method using sub-sampling might be considered by radiologists as having banding.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s method of preparing coffee is probably my favorite:<p><i>“The Danish philosopher’s day was dominated by two pursuits: writing and walking. Typically, he wrote in the morning, set off on a long walk through Copenhagen at noon, and then returned to his writing for the rest of the day and into the evening. The walks were where he had his best ideas, and sometimes he would be in such a hurry to get them down that, returning home, he would write standing up before his desk, still wearing his hat and gripping his walking stick or umbrella.<p>Kierkegaard kept up his energy with coffee, usually taken after supper and a glass of sherry. Israel Levin, his secretary from 1844 until 1850, recalled that Kierkegaard owned “at least fifty sets of cups and saucers, but only one of each sort”—and that, before coffee could be served, Levin had to select which cup and saucer he preferred that day, and then, bizarrely, justify his choice to Kierkegaard. And this was not the end of the strange ritual. The biographer Joakim Garff writes:<\/i><p><i>“Kierkegaard had his own quite peculiar way of having coffee: Delightedly he seized hold of the bag containing the sugar and poured sugar into the coffee cup until it was piled up above the rim. Next came the incredibly strong, black coffee, which slowly dissolved the white pyramid. The process was scarcely finished before the syrupy stimulant disappeared into the magister’s stomach, where it mingled with the sherry to produce additional energy that percolated up into his seething and bubbling brain—which in any case had already been so productive all day that in the half-light Levin could still notice the tingling and throbbing in the overworked fingers when they grasped the slender handle of the cup.”<\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Daily-Rituals-How-Artists-Work&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307273601\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Daily-Rituals-How-Artists-Work&#x2F;dp&#x2F;030...<\/a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2013&#x2F;oct&#x2F;05&#x2F;daily-rituals-creative-minds-mason-currey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2013&#x2F;oct&#x2F;05&#x2F;daily-ritual...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-25 05:38:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cairo_x"],"id":[22410810],"kids":[22410867],"parent":[22403856],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writingroutines.com&#x2F;routines&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writingroutines.com&#x2F;routines&#x2F;<\/a><p>Had a scroll through those interviews.

Fitts&#x27; famous law considers all axes of motion equal -- i.e. it&#x27;s a model that describes moving horizontally, diagonally, horizontally or anything in-between as equally difficult.<p>This isn&#x27;t the case for phones, especially not when they&#x27;re used with a single hand. Horizontal motion at the bottom of the screen is very hard, because your thumb just don&#x27;t bend that way. So is vertical motion on the right-hand side of the screen (for right-handed users -- left-hand side for left-handed users). Diagonal motion is easier because, well, that&#x27;s how the thumb bends. It&#x27;s not just about the difficulty of making the motion happen -- the motion is inherently imprecise (this is what Fitts&#x27; law effectively cares about, not necessarily the amount of physical effort).<p>We tried to sketch a &quot;revised&quot; model but it was a little unwieldy to plug into the beautifully-logarithmic Fitts equation.

Being homeless is far, far more difficult than being part of the rat race. What it comes down to is, people feel that they suffer an indignity that someone would dare risk everything to be free rather than be conscripted to an employer. It threatens their entire religious heteronormative worldview that life is about pulling the yoke to provide for one&#x27;s children. If they have to suffer, then everyone else should too. Why should that guy get out of working when I have to get up at 6 am tomorrow? And so on and so forth.<p>Since wealth inequality is so extreme now globally, all labor slides into full-time and overtime. Some people look at the risk-reward value proposition of that, and correctly opt out. We label them homeless. But personally, I think of them as starving artists, freedom fighters and probably gifted. Some of the most dynamic people that I have ever met were on drugs, suffering with some form of mental illness like PTSD&#x2F;ADHD&#x2F;manic-depressive or one step away from living on the streets. Luckily they became computer programmers.<p>To a first-order approximation, homelessness is a measure of how authoritarian a society is. The choices are the $100k+ career at 40+ hours per week, menial labor at 50-60 hours per week, or homelessness. We pretend that there are 20 hour per week jobs that pay enough to launch a business, but of course that&#x27;s all make-believe. It&#x27;s not really even possible to work every other year, or have two people apply to the same job so they can alternate shifts. Systems of control lock us down by rents and medical bills and debts to the point that anything short of indentured servitude is not sustainable.<p>I&#x27;m seeing that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to live off the grid in a medium-sized city in the northwest where people actively work to ban city camping and prevent giving tiny homes to the homeless. Surely it must be impossible in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles. So I dunno, after a lot of trying to create some kind of free life for myself, after 20 years of struggle and poverty, I might just have to throw in the towel and get a job at a major corporation. I might be a slave then, but at least the system would provide for my basic needs.<p>This isn&#x27;t the future I signed up for, and more and more every day I am coming to terms with the fact that the American Dream is probably dead. I&#x27;ve found the Office Space&#x2F;Fight Club&#x2F;Mr. Robot portrayal of the working world to be uncannily accurate. I actually enjoy earning a paycheck and working with people as it happens, but when burnout sets in and I finally find myself unemployed again, the 6 months of living expenses that I&#x27;ve saved after years of lost life doesn&#x27;t feel like much of a consolation prize. The people who have it figured out are the sociopaths, able to skim income from other people&#x27;s labor and rationalize it by calling it capitalism. But there is no future in hard work. And lately, no market for it either.<p>This is a garbage comment and I&#x27;m not sure I even believe half of it, but it felt real in the moment so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and just post it.<p>EDIT: In the spirit of offering solutions rather than dwelling on problems, I think that an answer can be found in the gig economy, sustainability and expanded consciousness.

You could argue about the entire approach, but instead the author complains about commas and ifs. The things about the ifs and other potential control flow constructs makes it clear that the author doesn&#x27;t get what a declarative approach really means.<p>Likewise, the section about &quot;wraps&quot; where the author feels the SwiftUI API is inconsistent because stacks &quot;wrap&quot; and padding &quot;wraps&quot; so they should use the same syntax.

(I would say stacks arrange a list of views and padding pads a view. Also, bold() operates on Text and returns Text because Text holds styled text and bolded Text is still Text. padding operates on any View and returns some View. The types flow naturally from the problem domain, so that&#x27;s good.)<p>Also the conclusion: &quot;The solution…is to be dumb and explicit!&quot;\nThat&#x27;s really asking for a completely different framework.

For example, across evaluations of your UI SwiftUI needs to track the identity (and location in your view graph) of all of your views, in order to keep their state, bindings, and other stuff that needs to remain consistent across time.  The position if your view in a type hierarchy is the default way SwiftUI does so.  This starts to blur the line between code and the type system, which I think the Functional Programming folks have been exploring for years.<p>One more nitpick: the use of View Modifiers on children noticed by parents (like the `navigationBarTitle` example he uses (as discussed in the &quot;Child Privacy Invasion&quot; section), is to allow for children to specify metadata that the parent might care about. This is actually pretty nice, because then you can nicely compose together the various parts of your app without having to spread around the configuration for your tab bars and such (which is a bit messy in UIKit).<p>edit: formatting.

It also didn’t help that the Trump Administration went on a negative media assault for the past 3 years to demonize the Chinese, so they are now an easy scapegoat for all troubles in the world. This really does not help the situation.<p>Now, how about a different theory?<p>Animals normally develop immunity to their environment, and from the viruses that exist in that area. This is the law of natural selection in play. Those that survive, go on and reproduce, and carry the antibodies to protect their offspring. Those that don’t, will die off, and their bodies will be eaten by vultures.<p>I suspect that the coronavirus mutated and appeared, because of an animal from one part of the world, was shipped to another part of the world, where it didn’t have natural immunity to the diseases of that region. In this case, a bat carrying the virus.<p>Maybe an animal from Africa, was transported to Asia, where it would have never traveled there by itself. That animal got sick, and triggered a mutation, which infected a human handling it, which mutated again, and infected another human, and now, we have an outbreak.<p>The key to understanding this may be in how the MERS virus appeared.  It’s believed to come from bats, which infected a camel, which infected a human. Do people in the Middle East eat camels?  No, I don’t think so.<p>So why should SARS and this COVID-19 virus be any different?<p>Limiting the transport of live animals, to different areas of the world, should help minimize future virus outbreaks. But, humans have been transporting live animals all over the world, for hundreds or thousands of years, ever since boats were first invented. So I suspect, that it is only a matter of time before another novel coronavirus appears. And global warming may also be playing a factor too, in triggering viruses and diseases in nature, that had previously been dormant.<p>This is HN.

Just insurance companies.  Other companies are regulated by Congress as part of antitrust regulations which would prevent them from doing this kind of thing.  Insurance companies, however, are not regulated by antitrust laws.  Insurance is declared to be &quot;not commerce&quot; and therefore not answerable to antitrust laws.  They are permitted to break any antitrust law they please.  This is why medical insurance companies, for instance, hold national meetings every few years to decide what price they are willing to pay for medical goods and services.  This is price-fixing, and it is illegal in absolutely any industry - except insurance.  In insurance, they can do it publicly because there literally is no law against it.  There&#x27;s a law PROTECTING it.  It was called the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  The plan was to repeal it as part of the Affordable Care Act.  It was the clause that enabled the ACA to survive the entire revision process... and was then promptly removed from the bill immediately before its passage.  This is why the insurers have never really fought very hard against the ACA.  If it ever gets repealed, the McCarran-Ferguson act, that is, insurance companies will fall under antitrust regulation and have to change almost every business practice they follow.  They will have to compete against one another on price, compete against each other on what prices they pay, etc.  It would destroy their profit margins and probably result in the majority of them going out of business quite quickly.  Don&#x27;t hold your breath.  It&#x27;s why the insurance industry spends so much on lobbying and every lobbyist for every single industry will fight its repeal.  In other words, it will NEVER happen.

For instance, a plaintiff beat Katy Perry based on expert testimony that the songs were similar &quot;with regard to their pitch, rhythm, texture, pattern of repetition, melodic shape, and timbre.&quot;[1] The way these cases are being decided, plaintiffs could avoid dismissal by claiming copyright in some nebulous combination of protectable elements, even if melody is a key part of similarity.<p>One ray of hope: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which decides most of these cases, since it encompasses LA) is reconsidering these issues in the case where Led Zeppelin was accused of ripping off the Stairway to Heaven riff.

I&#x27;m getting to the thread a little late so it&#x27;s possible (probable) that no one will read this but I feel a bit better letting it out.<p>1. We cheated and got caught. On one hand the penalties are pretty severe.  Draft picks mean that in 5-8 years we may be awful again.  AJ Hinch was a DAMN good manager and when the Mets hire him in a year I&#x27;m going to be sad. Jose Altuve - for whom there is no evidence that he cheated - is one of the best hitters of the last decade and may never make the HOF b&#x2F;c of this.  The penalties individually and collectively are not small.  On the other hand, I agree that more punishment could have been handed out.<p>2. MLB has done a TERRIBLE job explaining that not only was immunity essential for getting the truth but also that punishing players would wind up in a YEARS-long dispute with the Player&#x27;s Association.  Fans and the sport alike get all pissy that there is no official record of steriod users...well immunity wasn&#x27;t offered.  Can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>3. MLB is also shooting itself in the foot not releasing the Red Sox report during the height of the Astros story.  It is probable that the 2018 champs will ALSO be exposed as cheaters.  ANd they had the MVP that year as well.  I will smirk at least a little when the Astros hatred starts to abait in June just in time for the Red Sox to re-kindle the story.<p>3. I have friends that work in Baseball. Of course it&#x27;s speculation but 3 of them independent of each other have told me that the 3 teams that cheat the most are Houston, LAD, and Arizona.  ANd all 3 conversations ended with the punchline of how little the Diamondbacks have to show for their cheating.<p>4. The sanctimony in baseball is comical AND sad. No sport likes to eat it&#x27;s young like baseball. The same reporters that used the 1998 home run race to their benefit now vote against steroid players getting into the HOF.  Anything to protect your 2 inches in the Sunday edition, fellas.  LOL<p>5. Being mindful of #1, anyone that thinks the cheating is limited to Houston, Boston or just a couple teams is sniffing glue. ALL teams and players creep as close to the line as possible. Are there players that refuse to participate? ABSOLUTELY. Are there teams that play every game on the up and up?  No way. There is simply too much at stake and the transfer of players and execs and coaches between teams means that the knowledge of skirting the rules isn&#x27;t limited to Houston.<p>5b. You want examples? The team that closes the dome to induce more short fly balls. The team that lets the grass grow longer to make grounders in the infield slow down. The team that overwaters the dirt in the base-paths to slow runners.  on and on and on.<p>6. MLB allowing ANY current-game film in the clubhouse is so stupid as to defy words.  So a batter can walk into the clubhouse and review the at-bat he completed 30 seconds ago to look at pitch sequences and locations.....that&#x27;s okay?  Absolutely STUPID.  Suggested result: eliminate replay on anything but scoring plays. Remove replay in the clubhouse and prohibit players from leaving the dugout except for bio-breaks with an MLB escort.<p>7. Finally, if anything ever drives me away from baseball it will be this: the &quot;inside&quot; baseball talk.  Reporters and players and former players that patronize fans with things like &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t understand...&quot; or &quot;there is a game within the game...&quot;  A sport that allows&#x2F;supports putting a fastball in a guy&#x27;s ribs if he preens after a home run.

[1] Annually, over 1 million people die globally in car crashes.<p>Driving is both the source of trillions of dollars of economic value annually, as well as the cause of ~$1 trillion a year in economic damages (including pain, suffering, and loss of life).<p>A focused and alert human is, overall, fairly awesome at driving, even in surprisingly adverse conditions. Humans, however, can also be lazy, easily distracted, and make irresponsible choices.<p>Cars to some extent try to protect humans against making these bad choices (like seat belt warnings) but to other extents respect that humans are not to be subjugated by a machine, and this means even being allowed to make bad decisions.<p>ADAS systems like AutoPilot and Level 3-5 self-driving are the most promising solution to the daily devastation that occurs on our roadways. This is literally a multi-trillion dollar problem. For an ADAS system to be most effective, it must be reliable and predictable, and it <i>also<\/i> must be easy to use. An ADAS system cannot increase driver safety if the driver turns it off, or won&#x27;t turn it on because it&#x27;s too annoying.<p>As a Tesla owner I can definitively state, that the safest way for me to drive is with AutoPilot enabled, with my hands on the wheel, and looking out the damn windows.

While Tesla consistently and repeatedly instructs drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and to remain alert, it doesn&#x27;t stop humans from taking their focus off the road, just like humans do consistently with or without AutoPilot.<p>My point is basically this; it does not necessarily make driving <i>more safe<\/i> to make AutoPilot impossible to abuse.

As a result, defer can now be used in performance-critical code without overhead concerns.<p>- Goroutines are now asynchronously preemptible. As a result, loops without function calls no longer potentially deadlock the scheduler or significantly delay garbage collection.<p>- Per the overlapping interfaces proposal, Go 1.14 now permits embedding of interfaces with overlapping method sets: methods from an embedded interface may have the same names and identical signatures as methods already present in the (embedding) interface. This solves problems that typically (but not exclusively) occur with diamond-shaped embedding graphs.

I guess a lot of people think cloud resources are something that is efficiently shared (consider S3, you pay per byte you store, store 0 bytes, pay $0).  But that&#x27;s actually a rare case, most of the time you are provisioning something for your exclusive use; if you have a database server it costs you the same whether it&#x27;s doing 10000 transactions per second or sitting completely idle and never logged into.<p>(Incidentally, the true sharing model used to be popular.  Shared hosting with no isolation between tenants predated AWS by a decade.  You got a chunk of a computer and shared Apache, MySQL, and PHP with hundreds of other randoms.

When I saw Book of Proof then Spivak then Apostol on his list I chuckled because that’s exactly the route I ended up following as well. Studying from 04:30 to 06:30 in the week and about 8 hours split up over the weekend, Spivak took 8 months to complete (excluding some of the appendix chapters) but if you can force yourself to truly master the exercises - and Spivak’s value is the exercises - then you’re close to having that weird state called “mathematical maturity” or at least an intuition as to what that means. You can forget about doing the starred exercises, unless you’re gifted. Spend a lot of time on the first few chapters (again, the exercises), it will pay off later in the book. It was a very frustrating experience and I had so much self doubt working through it, it’s an absolutely brutal book. Some exercises will take you literally hours to try and figure out.<p>If you do Book of Proof first you will find Spivak much easier, since Spivak is very light on using set theoretic definitions of things. Even the way he defines a function pretty much avoids using set terminology. Book of Proof on the other hand slowly builds up everything through set theory. It was like learning assembly language, then going to a high level language (Spivak) and I could reason about what’s going on “under the hood”. Book of Proof is such a beautiful book, I wish I had something like it in high school, mathematics would have just made sense if I had that one book.<p>I read a quote somewhere, think it was Von Neumann that said, you never really understand mathematics, you just get used to it.

Which varies depending on what you actually want to use math for."],"time":["2020-02-24 12:38:18"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22401221],"kids":{},"parent":[22400375],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-24 03:45:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["gshubert17"],"id":[22406373],"kids":{},"parent":[22400375],"text":["Another book similar to Morris Kline&#x27;s _Mathematics for the Nonmathematician_, which the OP mentioned, is Lancelot Hogben&#x27;s _Mathematics for the Million_.

I thought it was like the CS information analysis when looking at the course title.  It was nothing like that at all.  It didn&#x27;t help that the professor teaching it was pretty bad.  I remember he used to jog into the class carrying a tennis racket and in tennis sporty dress with headband, seemingly just coming back from a tennis practice and acting to be cool.  People just rolled their eyes.  The teaching was just reading off the book.  Darn, it was one of the top schools.
