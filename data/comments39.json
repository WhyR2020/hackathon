The idea is that, instead of writing a PostgreSQL extension in C (which is the only option for interesting extensions), you can also write one in pure rust.<p>I&#x27;ve eagerly awaited many features to make this work reasonably well, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased how much rust has helped my use case over the last few years.<p>Although lots of languages have a C FFI, that&#x27;s really not enough to extend a complex codebase. Postgres has it&#x27;s own setjmp&#x2F;longjmp-based error handling, it&#x27;s own system of allocators, it needs a way to find the right functions in an extension and call them the right way, its own way of dealing with signals, etc. There are zillions of internal structs, and the extension needs to be able to read&#x2F;modify them without copying&#x2F;translation. Oh, and also, postgres doesn&#x27;t like threads at all, so the extension better not make any (at least not ones that call back into postgres APIs).<p>The only language even close to getting all of this right is rust:<p>* it has no runtime that causes problems with threading, scheduling, signal handling, or garbage collection<p>* typically GC&#x27;d languages can&#x27;t operate very well on unmodified C structs; rust doesn&#x27;t have a GC so it can<p>* rust goes out of its way to support C-compatible structs without any copying&#x2F;translation, and can even treat some plain C representations as more interesting types in a binary-compatible way (like a nullable pointer in C could be treated as an Option&lt;&amp;MyStruct&gt; in rust)<p>* the tokio library allows nice concurrency without creating threads if you use the CurrentThread runtime<p>* it supports changing the global allocator to be the postgres allocator<p>* rust has good procedural macro support, which is important because a lot of postgres APIs heavily use macros, so making the rust version ergonomic requires similar macro magic<p>Areas rust could be more helpful, but which I&#x27;m trying to address on my own to the extent that I can:<p>* Support for setjmp&#x2F;longjmp. I know this is not easy, but important for interacting with C code that already uses it. I realize it would be unsafe, and that it can&#x27;t be wrapped up in a safe way directly, and it would be delicate to create safe APIs that use it at all. But I still want it. I made a crate[2] that adds support, but it has a few issues that can&#x27;t be resolved without compiler support.<p>* Better support for cdylib shared libraries that might call back into the host program that loads the library. Right now, you have to pass platform-specific flags to get it to link without complaining about undefined symbols (because they won&#x27;t be resolve until the library is loaded into the host program). Also, it&#x27;s difficult to test the shared library, because you have to guess at the location of the built library to be able to tell the host program where to find it before you can begin your test. I made a crate[3] to help with these things also, but it would be nice to have better support.<p>Oh, and one more thing on my wishlist not directly related to this project is that it would be nice to have support for datastructure-specific allocators (like a mini-allocator just for a hash table). Then, you&#x27;d be able to monitor and control memory usage by inspecting that allocator; and when you destroy or reset the hash table, you can know that the memory is freed&#x2F;cleared as well (without worrying about fragmentation). Maybe these mini-allocators could also be used in other contexts, too, but it would probably be easiest to get the lifetimes to work out if it was tied to a data structure.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;postgres-extension.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;postgres-extension.rs<\/a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;setjmp.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;setjmp.rs<\/a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;cdylib-plugin.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeff-davis&#x2F;cdylib-plugin.rs<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-15 18:39:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["joshlk"],"id":[23191209],"kids":[23191409,23191390,23191225],"parent":[23190885],"text":["Is there a roadmap for the next 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;5 years?"],"time":["2020-05-15 14:12:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pot8n"],"id":[23194383],"kids":{},"parent":[23190885],"text":["Despite Rust is way cleanly built, superior in almost every aspect than Go can ever dream to be, I doubt it will really take off really in the cloud business until there is:<p>1. official gRPC support<p>2. official Kubernetes API client support<p>3. official cloud vendor SDK support (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc...)<p>4.

I was hooked on my first reading and would go on to read it several more times before I entered my teens. It was tied with Tenney L.

During the summer breaks from Georgia Tech, Al Montgomery and I built an organic synthesis lab in an old chicken house on the edge of town where we made research chemicals to sell. Most of them were noxious or either explosive. No one else wanted to make them, somebody wanted them, and so their production became our domain. We suffered no boredom and no boss. We made enough money to buy new equipment. Max Gergel, who ran Columbia Organic Chemicals Company, and who was an unusually nice man, encouraged us and bought most of our products, which he resold. There were no government regulators to stifle our fledgling efforts, and it was a golden age, but we didn&#x27;t notice it. We learned a lot of organic chemistry.&quot;<p>The chicken coop lab full of noxious chemicals isn&#x27;t far removed from how Max Gergel got his start in the chemistry business either.<p>In this humorous, anecdotal chronicle of Max&#x27;s life from high school mad scientist to successful operator of a chemical supply business, you&#x27;ll learn where metallic potassium should NOT be stored, how to prepare perfectly alcohol-free n-dodecyl bromide, and why one man would be crazy enough to want a preparative scale procedure for methyl isocyanide. You&#x27;ll also learn, humorously but quite clearly, how the golden age of &quot;no government regulators&quot; contained the seeds of its own destruction, as horrendous odors, accidental poisonings, dumpings, fires, and miscellaneous accidents and occupational hazards take their toll on Gergel and his employees, neighbors, and surrounding environs.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;gergel_isopropyl_bromide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;gergel_isopr...<\/a><p><i>The Scientific Method: A Personal Account of Unusual Projects in War and in Peace<\/i><p>Famed Harvard chemistry professor Louis Fieser&#x27;s personal history of development of incendiary weapons during WW II, including the infamous Bat Bomb, plus development of cortisone, antimalarial drugs, and educational material for students.<p>Louis Fieser joined the American war effort before America had even officially entered World War II, as one of 20 professor invited to the house of Roger Adams in October 1940 to join the National Defense Research Committee. He was instructed early on to work on chemical vesicants but, considering them inhumane, quickly made a lateral move to begin development of gelled gasoline incendiary weapons. He led the research effort behind napalm, several other components of large-scale incendiary ordnance, and smaller special purpose incendiary devices for use by spies and saboteurs.<p>Fieser&#x27;s strangest project was development of the Bat Bomb: a cluster-bomb arrangement of hibernating bats carrying time-delayed incendiaries. As the bats fell from bombers over enemy cities, they would rouse from hibernation mid-air and seek shelter in attics of the city below. Their incendiaries would then start concealed, hard-to-fight fires. The project was surprisingly successful for one never deployed, and included the own-goal immolation of an administrative building during testing.<p>When Fieser was not working on setting fires he also had time to begin work on the first edition of his organic chemistry textbook, research cortisone chemistry, and work on antimalarial drugs. The information given late in the book about getting cats to pose for photographs with chemical apparatus is invaluable because it comes from real experience.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;the_scientific_method.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;books&#x2F;the_scientif...<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.sciencemadness.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2]"],"time":["2020-05-15 18:41:09"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ChrisMarshallNY"],"id":[23193943],"kids":{},"parent":[23192651],"text":["Awesome book!

Basically we share screens (on Zoom) while talking about whatever is going on at work. It&#x27;s sorta of a &quot;open-space&quot; equivalent but online and with a mute button.<p>Comm-work is more about showing than telling. A screen is always shared (or a whiteboard). We share emails on screen and sometimes write them together, we hear in into a customer call (like through Teams whilst we remain connected through Zoom), or we just tune out into our thing. It&#x27;s an impromptu that can last anywhere from 20 to 90 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s not scheduled, it&#x27;s not a standup, you don&#x27;t have to report status (yuck!) or say anything. Just keep working if you feel like it. You can mute yourself or others. Most of our teammates (not all teams are the same) feel like sharing something, be it a milestone, a cool widget they found or a piece of code they feel are blocking. This works great because it just naturally surfaces issues <i>before<\/i> they are issues.<p>The bad part, if anything, is that it is run by a manager who knows how to improvise, when to call one up (and call it off if someone has to take their kid to the doctor) or how to dig into the team&#x27;s mind and create the meeting narrative. It also requires some degree of direct speak (&quot;Hey you, whats up with that task?&quot;) which also does not work with every ego around. So this is not something that I think can be taught at seminars as it&#x27;s not very scientific. It&#x27;s just natural and basically arises whenever a chat room becomes to chatty. I personally believe comm-work is deeply more effective than any agile standup or kanban, which never ever worked for us. Being such an improv keeps people on their feet. They never know when the team is going to meet, what the next customer email will say. Your code editor becomes not so much of a secret place.

But from my angle, a normal Chinese guy working in the field of material research in China for a decade and deep inside the system, my points would be:<p>1. you guys really worry too much about our ability to innovate, seriously. There is no room for real innovations. But at the same time the system rewards stealing and copying. The system, the education, the overall political environment are not designed with innovations in mind but to help a few to stay in power. My personal take on this is that Chinese &quot;innovation&quot; is now built upon: Chinese with foreign education&#x2F;working background bringing back technologies, CCP buying foreign companies with OUR everyday people&#x27;s money, and of course hacking&#x2F;stealing directly. I don&#x27;t believe we have a change winning the innovation war, not in the long run.<p>2. for a &quot;private&quot; company like huawei, isn&#x27;t it weird that it&#x27;s always backed by CCP? Lots of Chinese private companies get balls kicked everyday and why only huawei get treatment worthy of a state owned business? Even us Chinese knows better.<p>3. please think about us everyday Chinese citizens. we are currently under direct information warfare and systematic repression waged by CCP for decades, and our lives&#x2F;future squeezed out in order to found companies like huawei and projects like one belt one road, without a f<i><\/i>king vote. It&#x27;s much bigger than us vs huawei, at least from our side.<p>btw it is not my field of expertise but I&#x27;d like to call for experienced software&#x2F;hardware engineers from the west, help us bring down the CCP&#x27;s GFW system before it&#x27;s too late.

I thought it was more accurate to say it was a continuum, and using two different techniques was a sign that we still had not figured it out. After all, a blog post about programming might have an interactive example. An article about retirement might embed a calculator. If you try to categorize a site or even just a page as Document or Application, it gets fuzzy. But if you look at a page and just try to categorize it section by section, as Document or Application, it&#x27;s easier. (Hence, Web Components make more sense to me.)<p>So anyway, most people spend some time surfing the web --- by that I mean visiting Documents. Clicking links from search results, to articles, to more articles. If you aren&#x27;t using an adblocker, I can&#x27;t imagine how you don&#x27;t end up throwing your laptop against the wall. I ended up just turning off JavaScript for most sites, and the web looks more like how I think it should look. Every once in a while these people will post a rant, and it will resonate with most people.<p>But then an Application Developer will read it after a long day and say, hey, wait are you saying I should write my Application (like GMail) in jQuery? To be honest, Applications don&#x27;t bother me the way overscripted Documents do. I almost expect them to be kind of slow. After all, even some Desktop Applications still have loading screens. So I don&#x27;t mind so much if you&#x27;re using React or whatever for your Application or even for that calculator embedded in the article about savings.<p>But for Documents --- like articles, blog posts, company home pages --- well, one thing I agree with SPA developers is that there could be less server-side rendering. These kinds of sites could often be compiled ahead of time into static HTML.  Server-side rendering is better than SPA for these kinds of sites, but static sites are better than server side.

I built a couple myself (albeit not with a Pi, but with some Wemos D1) and can share a few lessons learned.<p>First of all, safeties. I was lucky to add my work to existing motorized garage doors - which already came with enough sensors, but since you are providing everything including the motor, these should be in from the very start, or in any accident you&#x27;d be held liable. Actually you may even be held liable if someone implements it from your github repo and then has an accident. I know you have a disclaimer, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out being sued.<p>You want a sensor which detects any anomalous power draw in the motor and immediately cuts off power. Something as simple as an ACS712 (follow guides for reading an inductive load though!) which is a couple bucks (or less if you buy a bucket from China). The motor may come with built in safeties if it&#x27;s meant for a garage, but this is something I&#x27;d still consider.<p>You will want not only a sensor but also a couple emergency buttons on both sides of the door which instantly stop all movement.\nWhile you&#x27;re there, activating a couple very visible flashing LEDs for a few seconds before you start any movement is also a good safety precaution.\nYou have 2 relays which could due to a bug or other unexpected circumstance be energized at the same time - Depending on the motor this could cause a fire, or fry your relay board&#x2F;Pi. I would use one relay with its NO contact going to the DOWN motor pin, and the NC going to the UP motor pin, and connect it in series with the other relay which cuts all power. This way it&#x27;s not possible to energize both in any case (beware: even abruptly switching directions may ruin a motor - always cut power first, THEN toggle direction, THEN provide power again)<p>Happy to discuss a few more points if you feel like."],"time":["2020-05-15 10:43:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["woutr_be"],"id":[23189743],"kids":[23192989],"parent":[23174493],"text":["Very cool project, I&#x27;ve been wanting to do something with my Raspberry Pi as well.<p>I mainly wanted to focus on turning my AC units on and off.

To start to understand it, find a tool that he uses regularly (assuming such a thing exists).  Maybe it is Excel.  Now have him solve some kind of problem with it.  And then schedule a meeting with his friend the following week to review his spreadsheet.  Then add requirements that his spreadsheet must handle.  Tell him he must hurry so that those requirements are complete before his meeting.  Ensure that there are too many requirements for the spreadsheet or that there isn&#x27;t time to properly reorganize it.<p>In the meeting, explain to his friend that he has been the mastermind of this spreadsheet design.  Have him first demo the calculation features of the spreadsheet.  The have him walk through the design, show the formulas in the cells, explain his naming scheme.<p>The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate why engineers seem to be so concerned about their code organization and technical debt.  Which is that they have their name on any mess they make in the code, and they have to maintain it as it changes.

That is to say, freedom for Nozick is freedom to own and control not just your own personhood, but any property that you own.

Like the comic imagines, a monster that lived forever and bent its entire will to owning more and more land could, theoretically, through entirely voluntary transactions, own all of the land. If this situation arose, the monster would have infinite leverage in any negotiation that it entered into, because everyone on earth would starve unless they made a deal with the monster. From Nozick&#x27;s point of view, because neither party was physically coerced, and the monster&#x27;s property came from a history of free transactions, the monster&#x27;s ownership of all its property is just and free. However, the situation that it leads to seems to be one that severely lacks freedom.

There is a small supply of drugs that treat that cancer. The vast majority of the population would derive little utility from being allocated this drug (there is some small chance that they may get the same cancer in the future, so having it available does have value, just not much) whereas the person who has that cancer derives a much larger amount of utility from the resource. The cancer patient is in this case a utility monster and giving it cancer medicine is feeding the utility monster.<p>Consider even further the case where most of the population is middle class but some fraction is living in absolute poverty. A single dollar provides little utility to the middle class people but a tremendous amount of utility to the extremely poor. Taxing the population some small amount and allocating it to the poor individuals would not only be feeding a utility monster but it would be directly decreasing the utility of everyone else to do so.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a third scenario: a researcher is trying to cure some terminal disease but requires test subjects who may die as various possible drugs are tried. The utility gain from curing a disease once and for all would be immense compared to the life of one or even a few individuals. Carrying out this research is again feeding a utility monster, and in this case literally sending people to their deaths to do so.<p>While people might disagree on how we&#x27;d go about feeding these monsters in practice, society has widely accepted at least in principle giving medicine to the sick, providing welfare to poor, and taking calculated risks in the name of progress.<p>The utility monster only sounds appealing as an ad absurdum argument because the existence of such a utility monster presupposes such an absurd situation. One can easily imagine that a utility monster which derives more utility from every resource than the whole of humanity combined could exist, but actually imagining such a monster is much harder. It feels wrong to support sacrificing the whole of humanity to one being because I can not truly comprehend a situation where one being could derive enough utility to justify such a sacrifice. But in this hypothetical scenario where the sacrifice actually was justified, I would by definition be able to imagine it, and thus I would apply the same logic I do to the utility monsters which I can imagine, and there is no reason to believe I would reach a different conclusion.

I realized that I need to thoroughly test my views first before sharing publicly. So to test my changing views, I mentor a group of student learners every day after work and during weekends. I observe their progress throughout their interview process and then how they perform in the software engineering world. To this day, I still don&#x27;t have a concrete answer, so I haven&#x27;t blogged since.<p>It&#x27;s particularly painful when my ideas are wrong and the students I mentored turned out to be the kind of engineers I wouldn&#x27;t want on my team. It&#x27;s not their fault and blogging about my failures would single them out and I don&#x27;t have the heart to do it.<p>So over the past 10 years, I eventually stopped shied away from being &quot;Public by default&quot; until I have experimented enough to be sure."],"time":["2020-05-15 21:35:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["the_jeremy"],"id":[23193490],"kids":[23194331,23194200,23194298,23193989],"parent":[23190538],"text":["When you define &quot;great developer&quot; as &quot;top contributors on StackOverflow&quot; (or the ones responsible for founding it), of course the overlap will be 100%.

In 1989, Bombieri and Pila showed that if one takes a box with sides of length N then C can obtain no more than O_{d,\\epsilon}(N^{1&#x2F;d+\\epsilon}) integer points within the box. Importantly, the implied constant makes no reference to the coefficients of the curve. Examples of certain rational curves show that this bound is tight but it has long been thought that when restricted to non-rational curves an improvement should be possible whilst maintaining the uniformity of the bound. In this paper we consider this problem restricted to elliptic curves and show that for a large family of these curves the Bombieri-Pila bounds can be improved. The techniques involved include repulsion of integer points, the theory of heights and the large sieve. As an application we prove a uniform bound for the number of rational points of bounded height on a general del Pezzo surface of degree 1.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1301.4116\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1301.4116<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-15 20:16:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["LolWolf"],"id":[23195027],"kids":{},"parent":[23193145],"text":["Wow, this is an absolutely lovely presentation of that result.

I enjoy seeing the sublet ads that ask for someone to take over a 3000&#x2F;mo 1 bedroom apartment in Hells Kitchen. They’ll be back in September. Until then, pay their full rent to live in a neighborhood that was sketchy before, but barely habitable now. I don’t even feel safe driving through there after sundown.<p>Which brings me to the point: I think the racial imbalance in terms of who gets sick is clearly driven by the ability to work from home, ability to actually socially distance, and the ability to just leave the city and go back home until things blow over.

To be honest, I did not love my homeschool experience and would have preferred not to do it, but I got into a decent college and now working my dream job as a software developer so I guess it worked out fine.<p>A piece of advice: it sounds so obvious, but every child learns differently and has different features that will fit will with some styles and not others. Be nimble and adaptable. Don&#x27;t immediately invest in an expensive set of math instruction manuals (classic rookie HS parent mistake) or commit to an opinionated learning plan without evaluating it in practice w&#x2F; your kids first.<p>For content, the consistent thing that has set well prepared homeschooled students (or any kind of student in my experience) apart from their less prepared peers is outstanding reading and math skills. There are lots of other things that are really important, but if you have great reading and math skills then you have the fundamental tools to learn and do well in pretty much any career. Don&#x27;t worry too much about the book you use to teach math. I mostly used Saxon - it was good for some things, not others. The most important thing for a kid is spending time doing math, practicing math, getting math problems wrong and working through why they were wrong.<p>For reading, read.

Find resources and make a program to ensure your child progresses in this subject. If there are contests, or certifications in this subject you may aim them.

I&#x27;ll resist the urge to describe all the background a-ha moments, experiences, observations, etc. I&#x27;ll just cut to the minimum viable product that&#x27;s rolling around my head.<p>The system is a database of &quot;topics&quot;. A topic is a very bite sized element of training. If you&#x27;re teaching kindergartners math, it&#x27;d be something like &quot;adding 0 to a number just gives back the same number&quot;. It&#x27;s almost just a sentence&#x27;s worth of definition.<p>Each topic has a handful of prerequisites. This is not some kind of taxonomy a la the Dewey Decimal System. The prerequisites are just a rough curriculum outline. For example you can&#x27;t learn about adding zero to a number, unless you have already learned single digit counting up to 10 or 20. I am not an educator so exactly what is a prerequisite for what is not my forte. And this doesn&#x27;t have to be super complicated. Just a nice smooth progression from simpler lower level concepts, up through more complicated higher level concepts.<p>Each topic is accompanied by videos. These videos are very short, because the topics are very short. Think 5min or less. For K and 1st grade they might even be just 1min or 2min. Each topic has many of them. They could be crowd sourced or produced like something you&#x27;d get from an education company, whatever. The point is: there is a back log of videos that teach each topic. So if you&#x27;re topic is &quot;adding 0 to a number just gives that same number&quot; there would be at least 1 but maybe multiple videos in the system that teach that topic.<p>Each topic has a series of questions, each question has correct answers, and incorrect answers. As much as humanly possible we have a catalog of multiple choice questions for each topic. The questions can be written in a variety of ways, the correct and incorrect answers can be written in a variety of ways. For example one question might have a few ways it can be written such as &quot;1+0=?&quot; or &quot;one plus zero is what?&quot; or &quot;one + zero&quot; etc. The point is you can randomly select a series of questions, and you can randomly select one of the correct answers, and a few of the incorrect answers, or construct &quot;all of the above&quot; or &quot;none of the above&quot; and even if two people have the same questions in the same order, their experience and what they see might be totally different.<p>Finally, each student account has a list of the topics they have &quot;mastered&quot;. So your account is like a tree of the topics you&#x27;ve mastered, which adjacent or peer topics you haven&#x27;t mastered yet, and which topics you have mastered all the prerequisites for. I could randomly select a topic, and by walking the tree of prerequisites a little bit, find a topic quickly that is appropriate for you.<p>Okay those are all the nouns. Now for the verbs. How does this work? Basically the experience is a loop. A student comes in to the system. The tool randomly selects a topic that the student has mastered all the prerequisites for. They are presented with one of the videos for that topic randomly. Then they&#x27;re presented with a short quiz randomly built from the questions for that topic. If they get a 100% correct on all the questions, they&#x27;ve mastered that topic. Wash rinse repeat until they&#x27;ve graduated from college.<p>If you get a quiz wrong, all the prerequisites for that topic are no longer mastered. In essence we &quot;back up&quot; one node in the prerequisite tree. Over time a student will repeat some topics more than once, as they push the outer boundary of the leaf nodes of the topic tree they&#x27;ve mastered. This is to be expected.<p>Since we are randomly selecting topics, randomly selecting videos on those topics, randomly building quizzes, and each topic is only a few minutes long, we should be able to keep this up for a hour without getting too bogged down in any one topic or any one quiz or any one subject. It should flow smoothly, quickly, without friction, without complication. I&#x27;d estimate my 1st grader could plow through 3 or 4 topics in an hour. My 4th grader should be able to easily handle 5 or 6 no problem.<p>The system has hardly any user interface at all. There might be a single button to say &quot;I&#x27;m ready for the next topic&quot;. While the video plays there might be a single button to back up 30 seconds. Then the quiz begins and there is only 1 button for each of the 4 multiple choice answers, and then back to the beginning. The fidelity of the user interface is comically minimal.<p>The system does not have any obvious grades, percentage completion, progress reports, awards, kudos, etc. The loop of video, quiz, repeat, is all there is. If you wanted to do reporting on student&#x27;s progress you could do so, outside of the system, but within it the experience is on rails. The student is not alerted to wrong answers, correct answers, whether or not they&#x27;ve &quot;mastered&quot; a topic, what the upcoming topics are, etc. None of that is presented to them.<p>Okay that&#x27;s enough of a description. Each of these design elements is backed up by my experience being Mr. Teacher and has specific reasons for being there.

This scratches multiple itches for me.<p>Itch the first: I&#x27;ve missed having a vegetable garden since I moved out of my parent&#x27;s place and into apartment life years ago. While a small garden plot can&#x27;t wholly replace the need to go to the grocery store for fruits and vegetables due to the inherent seasonality of growing food at small scale, it&#x27;s damn hard to beat truly fresh fruits and vegetables that were picked not an hour before they landed on your plate. And any surplus left when the growing season is over can be preserved and stored for the winter.<p>Itch the second: It&#x27;s _my_ creation, not my father&#x27;s with which I am merely helping. When living with my parents, my father had his way that he&#x27;d like to lay the garden out. Granting that a man who grew up in a rural agricultural community probably knows a thing or about vegetable gardening, watching how he did stuff did always leave me wondering if there wasn&#x27;t room for improvement. Since this is my garden, I can make my own experiments and decisions on how the garden is to be arranged, and what vegetables I want to grow (e.g dad loves beets; I do not). I&#x27;ve been reading about companion planting, and am eager to try things like growing corn and beans together, or growing chives near my peppers and tomatoes to keep aphids away (seriously, fuck aphids).<p>Itch the third: It lets me develop useful skills outside of my career in tech. While I have no delusions about quitting being a sys&#x2F;net admin and going and becoming a farmer, I do think it&#x27;s important to nurture useful skills outside one&#x27;s main career.<p>Itch the fourth: I have something to automate with tech. Gardens <i>do<\/i> need to be watered. Under-watering will limit your yield, but over-watering is also harmful to both the garden and the wider ecosystem of one&#x27;s immediate area. There&#x27;s a goldilocks-zone when it comes to watering, and the just-right amount of water depends on a number of things: what you&#x27;re growing, your climate, the soil, etc. There is a real danger that before the close of summer, the garden bed will have an automatic, multi-zone drip irrigation system, complete with soil-moisture sensors, controlled by a Raspberry Pi or similar SBC.<p>During April I built a loft bed frame out of framing lumber.

I always need 2 months of a stable rhythm to be fully sure that I got a rhythm locked in.<p>Here is what I figured out so far:<p>- Magnesium before sleeping<p>- Vitamin D when I wake up, especially now since I&#x27;m sitting inside all the time.<p>- Obviously basic sleep hygiene that all the popular blog posts write about (fun fact: I use Iris instead of Flux, it dims the screen even more).<p>- Melatonin when I can already tell I won&#x27;t be able to sleep anytime soon. I used to try to fall asleep on my own strength for way too long. Things I&#x27;ve tried: meditation (my username is derived from it), progressive muscle relaxation, not thinking about anything (I am quite good at this), visualizations of being in familiar places, exercise and going to the doctor. It all doesn&#x27;t work. What does work: melatonin. Only since recently I&#x27;ve been a bit more aggressive with it (after 25+ years of sleep issues).<p>This leaves me with one issue: sometimes I wake up after 4 hours of sleep. My usual way of dealing with this is being awake for another 4 hours, so I can sleep my second quartet of hours. The problem: I wake up around 11:00 AM when I go to bed around 11:00 PM.<p>So what I&#x27;m trying now, since my lifestyle supports it, is waking up between 04:00 AM and 06:00 AM so that I have enough leeway to sleep a bit more.

I was inspired by this post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21660718\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21660718<\/a><p>Basically our hourses are 1-3 orders of magnitude dimmer than the outside; this is not good. Ben Kuhn&#x27;s approach was to buy a big 30k lumen LED bulb for $100. I am doing a more DIY approach with a number of small LED COBs. Each finished module will output 13.5k lumens for a bit less than $100 (so multiple will be needed per room), but it comes with a number of benefits:<p>- The light is extremely high quality, almost the exact same as sunlight. Fluorescent bulbs and normal LEDs do not give off the full spectrum of visible light we get from the sun and incandescent bulbs. In fact I tried growing some plants indoors a while ago, and even though they were seemingly well-lit they ended up dying due to a lack of light.<p>- The light can be dimmed to warm. Each module has four LED COBs. Three are bright white and put out 13.5k total lumens. The other one is a warmer white which should be useful at night - like IRL flux&#x2F;redshift. And these can all be dimmed smoothly from 100% to 1% brightness.<p>- The modules are controlled with an ESP8266, so they have WiFi. Aside from controlling them via a phone&#x2F;computer, I am going to set up a Raspberry Pi running some timed scripts to automatically adjust them. For example they can all turn on in the morning as a natural wake up alarm (I have a separate alarm clock project I&#x27;m working on to give this a normal physical alarm clock interface). And I&#x27;m going to investigate using PIR sensors to make them automatically respond to human presence.<p>In the end this method is a bit more expensive than just buying high power bulbs (and more expensive than buying normal bulbs, but you would need like 70 of them in a room to match the total light output), but it has a number of seemingly useful advantages. Right now I&#x27;m working on the second (and hopefully final) prototype; the first was electrically OK but had thermal issues (LEDs still get very hot!).<p>It&#x27;s an interesting break from normal software engineering. There&#x27;s a huge emphasis on getting it right, and on getting it right the first time. Since there are a couple of amps of power running through the system, it needs to be well designed and safe from the very beginning. And $6 shipping every time you order from DigiKey punishes iteration heavily, since if you&#x27;re making small iterations then your shipping will be much more expensive than the parts. I spent probably around 60 hours researching before making the first order. After finding out that the thermal solution was inadequate I spent a bunch of time theoretically fixing that and finishing up every single loose end (up to well over 100 hours total now). So now my second order will very likely result in a 100% complete, functional, and safe (I think!) product.<p>The only thing left is to design a lamp-style enclosure. The module is small enough to replace a lightbulb in an overhead socket, but the wiring would need to be changed slightly and working through a small hole in the ceiling is not really practical."],"time":["2020-05-14 19:33:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["gnull"],"id":[23184563],"kids":[23187735],"parent":[23170881],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gnull&#x2F;kalina\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gnull&#x2F;kalina<\/a><p>I&#x27;m working on a console-based RSS client in Haskell. The original plan was to implement the basic functionality of Newsboat (which currently is being rewritten from C++ to Rust).<p>It&#x27;s still raw, but I already started using it as my primary RSS client. Right now it can fetch feeds, display them in a nice menu, maintain read status, open urls in a browser. The next features I&#x27;m going to add are support for configuration files (everything&#x27;s hardcoded now) and tags + filtering.<p>--<p>Newsboat had a few problems inherent to C++ (like occasional segfaults) and the TUI library it used. Knowing about these, I started googling for alternatives written in a higher-level language. And spotted the announcement [1] of the Newsboat author, saying that he&#x27;s going to rewrite Newsboat in Rust. When I read that, the rewrite was already going on for months with still no end in sight. I thought, &quot;Heck! I can implement this in Haskell in a few days!&quot; By now I spent about a week of full-time work on the project (spread over months), and got a bare working prototype.<p>My estimate was too optimistic, of course, I didn&#x27;t foresee all the difficulties I encountered later and all the things I had to learn. But still, I think if I spend one more week on this, I can get a fully-featured and polished RSS client — Haskell makes programming a lot cheaper.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;newsboat&#x2F;newsboat&#x2F;issues&#x2F;89\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;newsboat&#x2F;newsboat&#x2F;issues&#x2F;89<\/a>"],"time":["2020-05-14 21:57:19"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["marban"],"id":[23179196],"kids":{},"parent":[23170881],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flipso.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flipso.com&#x2F;<\/a> — Mix of Posterous and Tumblr.
