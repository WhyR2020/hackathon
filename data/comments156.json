Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology.

It looks like they mostly eliminated functionality in their app code wherever it was redundant with either OS functionality, SQL Lite capabilities, or the Messenger backend servers at Facebook&#x27;s datacenters.<p><i>&gt;One of our main goals was to minimize code complexity and eliminate redundancies. ... To build this unified architecture, we established four principles: Use the OS, reuse the UI, leverage the SQLite database, and push to the server.<\/i><p><i>&gt;We accomplished this by using the native OS wherever possible, reusing the UI with dynamic templates powered by SQLite, using SQLite as a universal system, and building a server broker to operate as a universal gateway between Messenger and its server features.<\/i><p><i>&gt;... the existing OS often does much of what’s needed. Actions like rendering, transcoding, threading, and logging [and JSON processing] can all be handled by the OS.<\/i><p><i>&gt;To simplify and remove redundancies, we constrained the design to force the reuse of the same [UI] structure for different [UI] views. So we needed only a few categories of basic [UI] views, and those could be driven by different SQLite tables.<\/i><p><i>&gt;Now, ... All the caching, filtering, transactions, and queries are all done in SQLite. The UI merely reflects the tables in the database.<\/i><p><i>&gt;We developed a single integrated schema for all features. We extended SQLite with the capability of stored procedures, allowing Messenger feature developers to write portable, database-oriented business logic, and finally, we built a platform (MSYS) to orchestrate all access to the database, including queued changes, deferred or retriable tasks, and for data sync support.<\/i><p><i>&gt;MSYS is a cross-platform library built in C that operates all the primitives we need. ... With MSYS, we have a global view. We’re able to prioritize workloads. Say the task to load your message list should be a higher priority than the task to update whether somebody read a message in a thread from a few days ago; we can move the priority task up in the queue.<\/i><p><i>&gt;With MSYS, it’s easier to track performance, spot regressions, and fix bugs across all these features at once. In addition, we made this important part of the system exceptionally robust by investing in automated tests, resulting in a (very rare in the industry) 100 percent line code coverage of MSYS logic.<\/i><p><i>&gt;For anything that doesn’t fit into one of the categories above, we push it to the server instead. We had to build new server infrastructure to support the presence of MSYS’s single integrated data and sync layer on the client.<\/i><p><i>&gt;Coordinating logic between client and server is very complex and can be error-prone — even more so as the number of features grows. ... <\/i><p><i>&gt;Similar to MSYS on the client, we built a server broker to support all these scenarios while the actual server back-end infrastructure supports the features.<\/i><p><i>&gt;[To minimize code-base growth] We also built a system that allows us to understand how much binary weight each feature is bringing in. We hold engineers accountable for hitting their budgets as part of feature acceptance criteria. Completing features on time is important, but hitting quality targets (including but not limited to binary size budgets) is even more important.<\/i>"],"time":["2020-03-03 05:20:42"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ronald_dregan"],"id":[22467951],"kids":{},"parent":[22466462],"text":["Yea, but it&#x27;s still Facebook Messenger, so it&#x27;s trash.<p>If you use Facebook for any reason, you are stupid and I do not respect you.<p>Fuck Facebook, fuck everybody who works for them in any capacity (to the HN people who work there - re-evaluate your life choices, scumbags), fuck everybody who uses their products and services.

Appeal to the customers by giving away free games every week. Epic pays developers for you, so you get a free game while the developer also gets paid.

Here are a few impressions:<p>1. The game catalog is totally the most important thing and they don&#x27;t have any really big games. I&#x27;m not a Fortnite person, but they don&#x27;t have that, nor Apex, nor PUBG. Battle Royale may not be the biggest thing in gaming anymore, but this is the type of game that at least a lot of people enjoy and they have none on the platform.<p>2. They sold Stadia as being able to achieve higher quality than local hardware at a fraction of the cost. Yet it&#x27;s been shown multiple times that the games running on Stadia are running at less than promised quality, with techniques like upscaling being used for 4K instead of native 4K: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;google-addresses-complaints-of-sub-4k-image-quality-on-stadia&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;google-addresses-comp...<\/a>.<p>3.

You can&#x27;t output 1440p to a monitor at all, and 4K is only available if you have a Chromecast. Why?<p>I&#x27;ve also tried Shadow and GeForce now. Shadow is easily the best in terms of quality, because you can run at arbitrary resolutions and pump the bandwidth up to a max of 70Mbps down, which is astoundingly good looking compared to what Stadia offers. GeForce Now is great too, but point 3 applies to it: you can&#x27;t run at non-preset resolutions, which really stinks if you have a bigger monitor with a higher native resolution. However, both Shadow and GeForce Now leverage existing game libraries, look better, and are generally more approachable than Stadia&#x27;s &quot;rebuy everything, run at lower quality, and lack significant features&quot; plan."],"time":["2020-03-01 21:04:15"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["axaxs"],"id":[22458393],"kids":[22458926,22458875,22458818,22458769,22460274,22459108,22458953,22460053],"parent":[22458022],"text":["I&#x27;m both bullish and bearish on cloud gaming, if that makes sense.

I like the way it looks on a shelf, and how I can always trade it at a local store for something else. I like that I can demo titles via Redbox. I like that I own my hardware and can get some value out of it if I sell it. Downloadable games don&#x27;t have those qualities, but at least they can (generally) be played offline and still allow for permanent ownership. That said, all of those qualities have essentially vanished with music and video streaming and gaming isn&#x27;t fundamentally different than those mediums.

Where are the games like &quot;Bloodstained,&quot; &quot;Shovel Knight,&quot; &quot;Dead Cells,&quot; and &quot;Untitled Goose Game&quot; — the blockbuster indie games that sell millions of copies and inspire sequels?<p>I think this points to a somewhat more important problem for Google. As the article points out, to incentivize developers and their studios to do the work to move their games to the Stadia platform, Google would need to offer to them the benefit of a base of dedicated users. If we consider that many prospective users may already be using Steam or home gaming consoles, the question becomes: how does Google attract these users to their platform? In my opinion, as someone who has played games from an early age, the best way to do that would be to either develop a game for the platform themselves (however feasible that may be) or hire a studio to produce a game for the platform with at least a temporary exclusivity deal. I&#x27;ve known many young kids throughout my childhood who were inspired to go out and get a game system simply because there&#x27;s that one game that can&#x27;t be played anywhere else. Whether it&#x27;s Mario on Nintendo, Halo on Microsoft, or Uncharted on Sony, every gaming platform has historically had exclusive games that can&#x27;t be played anywhere else. Imagine if Google Stadia had secured Fortnite as an exclusive game - Fortnite would probably have not been as successful as it is now, but Stadia may likely have received a serious boost in consumer attention, all things staying the same."],"time":["2020-03-02 04:59:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjmlp"],"id":[22459700],"kids":{},"parent":[22458022],"text":["No surprise here, even their Android game related tooling is a joke compared with what Apple offers on iOS SDK.<p>SpriteKite, SceneKit and MetalKit aren&#x27;t without their share of bugs, however on Android&#x27;s side they are just inexistent.<p>At any GDC, or IO, the only thing Google seems to be able to talk about is PlayServices, even the Vulkan support on Android is a joke, asking developers to clone github repositories and compile shaderc from scratch.<p>They just don&#x27;t know how to talk to game developers."],"time":["2020-03-01 23:06:20"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["p1necone"],"id":[22461587],"kids":{},"parent":[22458022],"text":["I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but if any of these cloud gaming services want me as a customer they need to give me access to my existing Steam&#x2F;GOG&#x2F;Epic&#x2F;Whatever library on their cloud system.<p>I&#x27;d also <i>much<\/i> rather build my own system though, unless they put a datacenter in my suburb I don&#x27;t see this ever being a better experience than my own machine."],"time":["2020-03-02 05:10:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["lostgame"],"id":[22466689],"kids":{},"parent":[22458022],"text":["I don’t get the concept of buying a console or using a service that streams the games, meaning I cannot play them offline (I play games mostly in Transit, buses, subways, etc that don’t have wifi) - and meaning I ultimately don’t own the games I buy, and when Google predictably shuts this service down as it is notorious for doing, I don’t have anything to show for my investment?<p>I would never buy a serious console game on anything but hard media.<p>In a couple years, all the money people spent on games for Stadia will literally have been completely wasted - and my Sega Genesis I got when I was six, and the games I paid for 20 years ago will probably still work (I’ll admit bitrot is a concern, but that’s a hugely different issue), along with my PS5 or whatever I’m using at that point.<p>This is a zero-value, long-term net-loss concept for me.

Happy to answer (almost) any questions?<p>PR API is part of a set of specifications designed to improve payments on the Web. Most importantly, it is the invocation side of a cross-origin payment service ecosystem we&#x27;re trying to seed.<p>The other half is Payment Handler API which is less mature but has been rolled out in Chrome and Edge: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;payment-handler&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;payment-handler&#x2F;<\/a><p>Think of PR API as the payment service discovery&#x2F;invocation side and PH API as the service provider side with the possibility of the service provider being a native app if the platforms supports it (e.g. Android lets apps register as payment apps and Safari + ApplePay works like this already).<p>The website invokes the PR API (I want to get paid and these are the payment methods I support) and the browser matches the supported methods the website supports to payment apps the user has installed that support the same methods then prompts the user to pick the app they want to use. (Payment apps register&#x2F;install themselves via the PH API)<p>If you invoke Google Pay on Chrome today both of these APIs are already in use. Google Pay is deployed as a fully web-based Payment Handler with no special privileges in Chrome.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that many of the tricks (like hidden iframes from PSPs) that are used to make payments frictionless today are going to become useless as browsers roll out more changes to protect user&#x27;s privacy (e.g. killing 3rd party cookies and storage). The privacy improvements are good but they have significant side-effects on UX.<p>PR API and PH API offer a way for websites to invoke a payment app from another origin (eg. shop.com invokes paypal.com) without losing context (the payment app is rendered in a modal window not via a redirect) and without needing to know up front what payment methods the user supports (good for privacy).<p>I agree with @mixedbit that there is a risk this doesn&#x27;t gain sufficient adoption to stick around but I believe the combination of a decreasing number of alternatives and increasing support and interest from browsers suggest it has a very good chance.<p>We are also working closely with the card networks to support Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) via these APIs providing a significantly better card payments experience than most websites offer today.<p>Finally, the movement toward payer-initated payment methods whereby the payer or a third-party payment initiation service (think PISPs under PSD2) is handling the payment (as opposed to a PSP on behalf of the merchant capturing the user&#x27;s card details) suggests the API will gain traction if we can get the design right to support these new payment methods (e.g. SEPA instant credit etc).<p>If you have strong opinions about factors that will contribute to the success of the API (especially wrt adoption) please provide your feedback on our Github repo linked from the spec.<p>There is a lot in the wikis that covers our current thinking, the whole process is done in the open."],"time":["2020-03-02 16:13:58"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["zhoujianfu"],"id":[22471586],"kids":[22471757],"parent":[22464063],"text":["I wish somebody would make a crypto wallet&#x2F;gateway combo that worked with this.<p>That combined with a auto “spend and replace” would actually make using crypto as simple and easy as say, Apple Pay.<p>And merchants could accept it without a payment processor, and pay no fees, have no risk of chargebacks, maybe pass some savings back to the customer, etc.."],"time":["2020-03-03 04:40:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["wk0"],"id":[22464740],"kids":[22464778,22467157,22464871],"parent":[22464063],"text":["Fairly related: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interledger.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interledger.org&#x2F;<\/a><p>Pretty sure a lot of blockchain projects are banking on this spec becoming official."],"time":["2020-03-02 15:36:12"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pjc50"],"id":[22464689],"kids":[22465086,22468109,22464707,22464882],"parent":[22464063],"text":["c.f. the &quot;Epistemic standards for “Why did it take so long to invent X?”&quot; thread, I kind of wonder why this took so long to arrive.

One: Why the extra struct? For example, to create a single event, you have to do:<p><pre><code>  Event{\n    Payload: &amp;Event_Create{\n      Create: &amp;Create{ID: &quot;123&quot;},\n    },\n  },\n<\/code><\/pre>\n...instead of just:<p><pre><code>  Event{\n    Payload: &amp;Create{ID: &quot;123&quot;},\n  },\n<\/code><\/pre>\nSecondly, isEvent_Payload is private! So given a <i>Create or an <\/i>Delete, you can&#x27;t store it in a single variable:<p><pre><code>  func nextEvent() isEvent_Payload { &#x2F;&#x2F; &lt;-- not possible\n    if something {\n      return &amp;Create{...}\n    } else {\n      return &amp;Delete{...}\n    }\n  }\n<\/code><\/pre>\nThe reason for this appears to be so that the generated serialization can be very dumb and not rely on type switches.

If you have a class where this doesn&#x27;t work (e.g. because it contains pointers into its own footprint) then you either need to refactor your class for Rust (e.g. change those pointers to offsets) or disable the move trait entirely and provide a utility function for move-like creation.<p>This is a trade off: as a class writer you get less flexibility, but as a class user you get much more predictable behaviour.

He was first introduced to the concept of high-dose vitamin C by biochemist Irwin Stone in 1966. After becoming convinced of its worth, Pauling took 3 grams of vitamin C every day to prevent colds.[13] Excited by his own perceived results, he researched the clinical literature and published Vitamin C and the Common Cold in 1970. He began a long clinical collaboration with the British cancer surgeon Ewan Cameron in 1971 on the use of intravenous and oral vitamin C as cancer therapy for terminal patients.[143] Cameron and Pauling wrote many technical papers and a popular book, Cancer and Vitamin C, that discussed their observations. Pauling made vitamin C popular with the public[144] and eventually published two studies of a group of 100 allegedly terminal patients that claimed vitamin C increased survival by as much as four times compared to untreated patients<p>(...)<p>medical establishment concluded that his claims that vitamin C could prevent colds or treat cancer were quackery.[13][151] Pauling denounced the conclusions of these studies and handling of the final study as &quot;fraud and deliberate misrepresentation&quot;,[152][153] and criticized the studies for using oral, rather than intravenous vitamin C[154] (which was the dosing method used for the first ten days of Pauling&#x27;s original study"],"time":["2020-03-02 21:09:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["KWxIUElW8Xt0tD9"],"id":[22469676],"kids":{},"parent":[22467105],"text":["look up papers by Dr. Klenner on the use of intravenous vitamin C<p>see also &quot;living proof&quot; a New Zealand 60-minutes segment"],"time":["2020-03-02 23:22:07"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["british_india"],"id":[22467582],"kids":{},"parent":[22467105],"text":["Fresca is packed with Vitamin C."],"time":["2020-03-02 20:01:03"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["Sharma"],"id":[22466347],"kids":[22467034],"parent":[22465675],"text":["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divjoy.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divjoy.com&#x2F;<\/a> did a great job of providing reactjs(and extras) and was free for initial few months.
