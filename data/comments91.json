Looking at Zillow a quarter acre of land in the Acres Home area sells for ~$50-$75,000, and substantially less if you buy a bigger lot. And per the article, banks are providing home mortgages, thus substantially financing construction. Unless they&#x27;re selling the houses for significantly less than the cost of construction, it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Even if you had to heavily subsidize risk premium on the mortgage, a $105,000 expense per home seems exorbitant and not sustainable.[1]<p>I bet costs could come way down if there was some serious money put behind a project like this to scale it up. Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places around the world (often former British colonies, because of smart U.K. housing policies immediately before decolonization) build affordable housing using similar schemes (99-year property lease, transfer covenants, etc), but on a much larger scale. San Francisco could (and should) do this, rather than spend years negotiating over developer exactions for every tiny project.<p>[1] It would make more sense if most of that $105,000 was recovered on the first sale.

I like the detail, especially in\u0010 Making a Great Speech To Text Model.<p>It looks like their research is against an older wav2letter model (likely the conv_glu model from the original 2018 Gated ConvNet paper). Facebook has released a lot of interesting architectures since then, my favorite of which is the Streaming ConvNet arch [1]<p>Ideas from the post compared to my experience with wav2letter:<p>1. Model Stride - increased model stride to 8x<p>Streaming ConvNet increased the stride to 8, while the original conv_glu model had stride 2 (cite: [2]), so Facebook agrees on this one.<p>2. Compact Regularized Networks - use separable convolutions, add skip connections, and attention modules<p>Streaming ConvNets use Time-Depth Separable Convolutions, but no skip connections or attention. Facebook&#x27;s &quot;state of the art 2019&quot; research tried a lot of architectures, the most accurate of which was a transformer model trained with attention and seq2seq criterion. However in my experience it was very large and slow to train.<p>3. Using Byte-Pair Encoding<p>Streaming ConvNets model uses 10,000 word pieces, which is a similar thought (the token set FB uses is here: [4] but I&#x27;ve had better luck with a sentencepiece model trained on more text data) instead of a ~26 letter alphabet from the original conv_glu model.<p>4. Better Encoder<p>The blog post conclusion here isn&#x27;t very obvious, it seems to hand wave that you could maybe use a transformer architecture but doesn&#x27;t go into specifics.<p>5. Balance Capacity<p>I don&#x27;t completely understand what they changed here but it seems useful.<p>6. Stabilize the Training in Different Domains, Balance Generalization<p>When adding domains to wav2letter, I&#x27;ve basically trained entirely from scratch using all available data. I long for a catastrophic forgetting mitigation like EWC but for now I&#x27;ve had a lot of success by just making the data funnel bigger and more varied. Data matters quite a bit, in this post [5] I compare a model I trained on a wide variety of data, with Facebook&#x27;s equivalent model as well as Facebook&#x27;s State Of The Art model. The wide-variety model generalized significantly better than both of Facebook&#x27;s examples that had only trained on audiobooks.<p>7. Make a very fast decoder.<p>The beam search decoder in this branch [6] of Talon&#x27;s wav2letter fork was at the time significantly faster than Facebook&#x27;s decoder. It was hand optimized and even includes some code for threaded decoding (which I&#x27;m not using at the moment because single threaded is fast enough for my workload). On single threaded decoding it can hit a realtime factor in the ballpark of 0.01x, or 100 seconds of audio per cpu second. With my smallest model (a significantly reduced size conv_glu wav2letter model), which is also in the 0.01x ballpark for encoding, we can consistently hit around 0.02x end to end on a consumer CPU.<p>To demonstrate, here is a random sample of debug timing information from my machine when recently decoding command phrases with wav2letter during real interactive use (the very long audio samples aren&#x27;t the model&#x27;s fault, I was testing a mic in a noisy environment):<p><pre><code>    [audio]=1260.000ms  [emit]=16.164ms (0.01x)  [decode]=11.326ms (0.01x)  [total]=27.490ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=1260.000ms  [emit]=16.164ms (0.01x)  [decode]=11.326ms (0.01x)  [total]=27.490ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=930.000ms  [emit]=12.853ms (0.01x)  [decode]=3.716ms (0.00x)  [total]=16.569ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=1080.000ms  [emit]=14.936ms (0.01x)  [decode]=3.296ms (0.00x)  [total]=18.231ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=1020.000ms  [emit]=12.976ms (0.01x)  [decode]=10.058ms (0.01x)  [total]=23.034ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=930.000ms  [emit]=13.836ms (0.01x)  [decode]=9.998ms (0.01x)  [total]=23.834ms (0.03x)\n    [audio]=1140.000ms  [emit]=14.535ms (0.01x)  [decode]=3.589ms (0.00x)  [total]=18.124ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=1650.000ms  [emit]=20.516ms (0.01x)  [decode]=5.281ms (0.00x)  [total]=25.797ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=3480.000ms  [emit]=31.386ms (0.01x)  [decode]=32.966ms (0.01x)  [total]=64.352ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=29760.000ms  [emit]=253.671ms (0.01x)  [decode]=325.198ms (0.01x)  [total]=578.869ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=8850.000ms  [emit]=70.844ms (0.01x)  [decode]=76.267ms (0.01x)  [total]=147.111ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=960.000ms  [emit]=13.924ms (0.01x)  [decode]=8.135ms (0.01x)  [total]=22.060ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=1770.000ms  [emit]=19.760ms (0.01x)  [decode]=18.612ms (0.01x)  [total]=38.372ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=930.000ms  [emit]=12.488ms (0.01x)  [decode]=6.842ms (0.01x)  [total]=19.330ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=1050.000ms  [emit]=15.726ms (0.01x)  [decode]=7.645ms (0.01x)  [total]=23.371ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=930.000ms  [emit]=13.899ms (0.01x)  [decode]=8.714ms (0.01x)  [total]=22.613ms (0.02x)\n    [audio]=40410.000ms  [emit]=292.916ms (0.01x)  [decode]=289.109ms (0.01x)  [total]=582.025ms (0.01x)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;models&#x2F;streaming_convnets\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;r...<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;issues&#x2F;543#issuecomment-588062135\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;issues&#x2F;543#is...<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;models&#x2F;sota&#x2F;2019\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;r...<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.fbaipublicfiles.com&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;streaming_convnets&#x2F;librispeech&#x2F;librispeech-train-all-unigram-10000.tokens\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.fbaipublicfiles.com&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;streaming_convnets...<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;issues&#x2F;577\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookresearch&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;issues&#x2F;577<\/a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;talonvoice&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;tree&#x2F;decoder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;talonvoice&#x2F;wav2letter&#x2F;tree&#x2F;decoder<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-15 03:10:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["DanielBMarkham"],"id":[22864612],"kids":[22864858,22865463,22865066,22864831,22865144,22866649,22867316,22866814,22865423,22882974,22866195],"parent":[22861452],"text":["Making sense in what fashion, to what end?

I was like, those people are grown man, how come they fear something they do all the time? And why does investors mood correlates to financials? How can a grown man have a fear of investing as an investor, it was odd at a time for me. Then I went ahead and played outside like nothing is happening.<p>I&#x27;ve read a lot of books just about everything, like on every topics i could get my hands on. Some of em are: Thinking, Fast and Slow, The power of habbit, Deep Simplicity, Intelligent Investor and much more, not exclusively from hackernewsbooks.com.[0]<p>I always arrived at the conclusion of the market is eventually run by people(no shit). At some point in time people come up with the idea of having a stock exchange or whatever you want to call it. Without people it would be non-functional, non-existent. So if you want to know about the working of market, you better of reading about humans, human mind. What drives us, why we do things, fears, and so much more. And the best thing about this is that you can see for yourself, it feels I am doing a research, but on myself.\nThere is not a single silver bullet in this topics of course, but one book I most often hear is Thinking, Fast and Slow, mentioned before, its really worth to read it!<p>Sometimes its driven by fear, like right now. In 2008 it was greed (yeah its usually not just one thing, but you get the idea). So at the why and how, I usually end up with human behavior. And since you cant determine what someone is going to do, feel or think, you cant really tell what is going to happened next, or in the future.\nBut after reading more and more about humans, it gets a little bit clearer as you read more books and connect the dots. And you are going to experience everything for yourself. You can be your own research subject.

Just yesterday I was explaining my layman&#x27;s understanding of econ, namely that money itself is zero-sum, so the prices of goods and services float on the free market according to how much people are willing to pay for them.<p>Central banks inject money into the economy, inflating the economy, reducing costs across the board. This acts as a wealth transfer from wealth holders to wealth producers, by that I mean businesses.<p>Normal inflation happens in a healthy economy, in an unhealthy one like this one, they dust off the lever known as QE. In a QE environment, the central bank injects money directly into the economy by buying up government bonds and other financial instruments.<p>This coupled with fractional reserve banking means that the banks can make a whole lot more loans, flooding the system with liquidity so that money can start moving again.<p>I had implied that QE increases the money supply, and so was corrected and told that it was actually the money base that was increased. On to Wikipedia I went to upgrade my knowledge.<p>There I found out that the concept of money base is referring specifically to the amount of money banks can lend on using fractional reserve banking. So while nominally it&#x27;s referring to the amount of hard currency in circulation, that &#x27;in circulation&#x27; part is key, it&#x27;s not just the amount of &#x27;real&#x27; money out there.<p>Economics shouldn&#x27;t be mysterious, one&#x27;s first stop should be Wikipedia to understand the boring concepts.

It compares the macroeconomic effects of the black death in England in Egypt. The relative power of the aristocracy to control or fail to control the supply and price of labor not only affected wages in the short term but agricultural productivity and eventually the foundation for industrialization and entrepreneurship.<p>I am only a third of the way through, but it so far seems thoroughly researched, without the dodgy understanding of economics in many (most?)  historical nonfiction books. The only potential problem is that I <i>want<\/i> to believe that the dystopian sounding world ruled by mamluks was an economic disaster waiting to happen, so I am wary of my reading being overly credulous. It could be that irrigation dependent agriculture was more brittle infrastructure, but I haven&#x27;t yet had time to finish or digest the book yet.<p>From the introduction<p>England:<p>&gt; In spite of the disputes over many significant issues, scholars agree about certain aspects of the outcome in Western Europe, particularly northwestern Europe. In many areas, urban and rural wages rose, land rents declined, grain prices dropped, agricultural output became more diversified, and unemployment levels decreased. Furthermore, the percentage decrease of agrarian and total output was less than that of the population, and per capita incomes rose. Overall economic recovery was largely completed by the year 1500. Landholding systems were transformed, and the manorial system, which was on the wane in some areas, collapsed in many parts of Western Europe, and was replaced by tenant farming or small peasant landholdings. Where these conclusions are accepted, they are often accepted as an axiomatic response to the relative scarcity of labor and the abundance of land that accompanied depopulation. The concessions that landlords made to peasants also seem to be an obvious consequence of the relative scarcity of rural labor.<p>Egypt:<p>&gt; Wages dropped precipitously, land rents increased, grain prices rose, agricultural output became less diversified, and unemployment levels increased. The percentage decrease in agrarian and total output was greater than that of the population, and per capita incomes plummeted.

IMHO it really depends on the resources and environment that each individual is able to have."],"time":["2020-04-14 18:59:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["rootusrootus"],"id":[22866673],"kids":{},"parent":[22864827],"text":["I have found that working from home is great, right now.

However, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  Some people just don&#x27;t like the remote work lifestyle at all.  It&#x27;s also not for every kind of job or office.<p>I think we&#x27;ll see a lot of hybrid arrangements in the post-covid world.  Some offices might institute work-from-home only for tuesdays and thursdays.  Or just have everyone come into the office on Mondays and cram all the important in-person meetings into that day.  Or in some situations it will be an at-will flexibility (come in for specific meetings when it makes sense, or come use the office like you would a co-working space when your home life is a little crazier because the kids are out of school for the summer and&#x2F;or there&#x27;s a contractor remodeling the kitchen, etc).<p>I think most seemingly-virtualizable businesses that had offices before will still have offices for the foreseeable few years, but by implementing various hybrid policies they could see their average headcount onsite per day shrink significantly over time.  For many the office will become optional and&#x2F;or a part-time thing.  One way they could react to this is to downsize their commercial real estate the next time contracts are up.  Another way they could handle it would be to remodel the space they&#x27;ve got, trading out cube-farm areas for more private offices and private conference rooms that can be reserved ahead, which will draw some employees back for more hours on-site, until they find a balancing point.<p>The deeper transition for managers is getting away from the control-freak model of tracking &quot;hours worked&quot;, and starting to focus instead on the &quot;things done&quot;.  The reason you hired your employee is not to punch a clock and stare at a wall for a fixed number of hours; you hired them to accomplish goals, and you&#x27;re actually going to have to focus directly on measuring true work rather than time in a post-office-hours world.

I don&#x27;t really know, but I got interested in the subject about a decade ago when my daughter was &#x27;self-assembling&#x27; inside my wife. Lying in bed next to a pregnant woman, knowing that cell by cell, bit by bit, a human body is being formed, got me wondering how such a thing is possible.<p>Before you can experiment with ideas on how this all works, you first have to come up with a good model of a cell.

The constraints that make it interesting are that (a) no cell has any idea where it is in the system, (b) a cell can only communicate with an immediate neighbor, and (c) a cell has no memory per se.<p>An aspect of CYCELL that some might find intriguing is a version of &#x27;morphogenic fields&#x27; that I&#x27;ve incorporated into the program.

Of course, what &quot;too large&quot; was varied by device;<p>- HTTPS was abysmal for raw throughput on all but the beefiest of computers;<p>- To get the best results you needed to turn off a bunch of stuff like Nagel&#x27;s algorithm and any implicit gzip compression;<p>- You&#x27;d have to send random data to avoid caching even with careful HTTP headers that should&#x27;ve disabled caching.<p>And so on.<p>Perhaps the most vexing issue that I was never able to pin down was with Chrome on Linux. In certain circumstances (and I never figured out what exactly they were other than high throughput), Chrome on Linux would write the blobs it downloaded to &#x2F;tmp (default behaviour) and never release them until you refreshed the Webpage. And no there were no dangling references. The only clue this was happening was that Chrome would start spitting weird error messages to the console and those errors couldn&#x27;t be trapped.<p>So pure JS could actually do a lot and I actually spent a fair amount of effort to get this to accurately show speeds up to 10G (I got up to 8.5G down and ~7G up on Chrome on a MBP).<p>But getting back to the article at hand, what you tend to find is how terribly TCP does with latency. A small increase in latency would have a devastating effect on reported speeds.<p>Anyone from Australia should be intimately familiar with this as it&#x27;s clear (at least to me) that many if not most services are never tested on or designed for high-latency networks. 300ms RTT vs &lt;80ms can be the difference between a relatively snappy SPA and something that is utterly unusable due to serial loads and excessive round trips.<p>So looking at this article, the first thing I searched for was the word &quot;latency&quot; and I didn&#x27;t find it. Now sure the idea of a CDN like Cloudfare is to have a POP close to most customers but that just isn&#x27;t always possible. Plus you hit things not in the CDN. Even DNS latency matters here where pople have shown meaningful improvements in Web performance by just having a hot cache of likely DNS lookups.<p>The degradation in throughput in TCP that comes from latency is well-known academically. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be known about, given attention to or otherwise catered for in user-facing services. Will HTTP&#x2F;3 help with this? I have no idea. But I&#x27;d like to know before someone dismisses it as having minimal improvements  or, worse, as degrading performance."],"time":["2020-04-14 16:41:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["elsif1"],"id":[22870991],"kids":{},"parent":[22864573],"text":["I&#x27;m curious as to how good the bandwidth estimation is.

Sure, it&#x27;s definitely possible that in a given instant one&#x27;s language might constrain or otherwise influence one&#x27;s cognition, but it&#x27;s vastly more likely to be the other way around: if the language is unable to support a concept in one&#x27;s cognitive process, an individual is prone to bend the language, whether by grabbing a loanword from some other language, recombining roots to create a new word, or what have you.<p>That&#x27;s the fundamental issue with programming language design that I think the author&#x27;s trying to articulate: they&#x27;re <i>designed<\/i>, and more fatally, they&#x27;re designed in such a way that they&#x27;re rarely able to evolve as needs dictate.

Phrases turned to compound words turned to shared roots.<p>This is in contrast to most programming languages; yes, at some point they were obviously created to satisfy a certain need and give &quot;words&quot; to certain computing concepts, but very rarely are they able to fully evolve to address new computing paradigms (at least not without rigidly declaring a new version or new dialect of the language with new syntax or keywords, which just punts the issue a bit farther into the future).  There are a handful that are better at this (Lisp, Forth, and Tcl - and their respective descendants - all come to mind), and they happen to lend themselves well to DSLs, but I feel like they stop just a little bit short of being able to entirely evolve on their own; programming languages need implementations and runtimes to be actually useful, and few (if any) languages provide the mechanisms to freely manipulate their own implementations&#x2F;runtimes (there are certainly plenty of Lisps that can bootstrap themselves and other Lisps, but that&#x27;s almost always an ahead-of-time operation with little to no exposure to the language user, nor any practical means for said user to leverage that within one&#x27;s own code to tailor the language and the implementation thereof to the exact problem domain)."],"time":["2020-04-15 09:24:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hashmal"],"id":[22870937],"kids":{},"parent":[22863528],"text":["In an article that argues that something is or is not a language, I would expect the term to be defined first.<p>Ironically, a definition for the term &quot;define&quot; is given."],"time":["2020-04-14 22:18:51"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sporkologist"],"id":[22873995],"kids":[22874134],"parent":[22863528],"text":["&gt; While the world is a continuum, we slice into tiny pieces, we discretize it with words.<p>To me the world is objects.

The purpose of digital signature is to solve the following scenario. Alice has a digital document and she wants to attach some “proof” that can be used to prove that she had approved this document. Therefore, digital signature can be recognized as an analogue to her handwritten signature on an ordinary document.<p>It is very critical to clarify and confirm that who had signed the contract. In order to prevent forged digital signature, we have to apply public-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be disseminated widely, and private keys are known only to the owner. Using this cryptography primitives, the basic idea of digital signature is that the person who signs a message by his private key, and anyone can use the associated public key to verify the signed message. Meanwhile, an ideal digital signature should have the following properties:<p>1. A signed message can unambiguously be traced back to its originator as a valid signature is only generated by the unique signer’s private key. Only the signer has the ability to generate a signature on his behalf.<p>2. Anyone can use the public key to convince himself&#x2F;herself that the signer has actually approved this message.There are three popular public-key families, namely integer factorization, discrete logarithm of finite fields or elliptic curves. Each of these allows us to construct to ideal digital signatures: RSA, DSA, ECDSA. Bitcoin and Ethereum both adopt ECDSA as the standard method of digital signature because ECDSA has shorter signature comparing to others such that we can save more signatures in a fixed space.<p>In the architecture of digital signature, anyone can sign transaction by using the correct private key. Therefore, key management plays a significant role in blockchain technology regarding digital assets protection. Practically speaking, losing private keys leads to great losses. Improper key management and poor system implementation may increase the risk of asset being transferred maliciously. Take an extreme case that happened before as an example, a principal died suddenly and no one was able to recover keys so that the whole asset was frozen. To solve these problems, experts therefore propose two solutions: multi-signatures and threshold signature scheme (TSS) to reduce the risk of key management. The purposes of both are:<p>1. Avoiding a single-point of failure, making it substantially more difficult for the asset key to be transferred.<p>2. M-of-N backup where loss of a single seed doesn&#x27;t lead to loss of the asset. Multi-signature requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, rather than a single signature from one key. In detail, the multi-signature can be t-of-n type where any t private keys out of a possible n are required to move the money. For example, a 2-of-3 multi-signature might have your private keys spread across a cold wallet, laptop, and smartphone, any two of which are required to move the money, but the compromise of any one key cannot result in theft. However, the main flaw of multi-signature is not so natural such that we have to write similar logic codes in different blockchains. To solve this problem, TSS has come in view of people. Let n be the number of participants and 1&lt;t&lt;n. A t-of-n threshold signature scheme means that a private key constructed by this scheme is divided into n parts called “share”, and at least t shares are required for creating a signature. In details, threshold signature includes four phases as follows:<p>•Key Generation:Each participant chooses his&#x2F;her secret value first. All the participants run a progress together to determine their private key, the public key, and their own private shares based on these secret values.<p>•Sign a transaction: Each participant uses his&#x2F;her private shares and a public message to be signed as input. All the participants in this protocol will exchange some necessary data such that each person produces a partial signature and broadcast it. Combining these partial signatures will produce a digital signature. The most important thing is that the process ensures that no leakage of secret shares will occur and the private key is never appeared.<p>•Verification: The verification algorithm of TSS and the original case are the same. Anyone who has the knowledge of the public key and the message is able to verify the correctness of a signature.<p>•Refresh share: Refreshing the shares means that we change the value of shares without altering the public key. Periodically refresh can reduce the number of compromised shares to zero. Assuming that old un-compromised shares are erased, the refreshing process makes it more difficult to reach a state where the number of contemporaneous compromised shares surpasses the compromise threshold.<p>Compared to multi-signature, TSS offers shorter signature and better privacy. Most importantly, TSS does not save private key on the server and provides risk control as well as separation of duties. It seems that TSS may be a fabulous solution, but there are still some problems. For example, an important contract not only requires enough shares to sign, but also needs to be signed by a manager. Despite the fact that vertical access control can be realized on the application layer and tracked by an audit log. Once a hack happens, we will have no idea about who to blame for in TSS. To solve this scenario, Professor Tassa introduced Hierarchical Threshold Signature Scheme by assigning different ranks of each share such that any valid signature generated includes the share of the manager (i.e. All shares in TSS have the same rank). A naive application of HTSS in cold wallets describes as follows. Assume that t =2 and n=3. In this case, we generate two high-ranked shares into different cold wallets and a low-ranked share in the cell phone or computer (ie. more risky place). After we generate all shares, one of the cold wallets can be used as a backup. Remember that if we want to sign a transaction, it should be either a high-ranked shares combined with a low-ranked shares or two high-ranked shares. As usual applications, there exists two situations to be considered:<p>1. Low-ranked shares lose: No matter how many low-ranked shares lose, no one can generate a correct signature due to the advantage of HTSS. Because any signature should involve at least a high-ranked share.<p>2. A cold wallet lose (i.e. a high-rank share lose): User uses his&#x2F;her backup cool wallet to transfer his&#x2F;her property to a new address. Or another solution is to add a new share and then refresh all the shares.<p>In conclusion, we regard that HTSS is more flexible and more suitable for applying in business models."],"time":["2020-04-14 05:08:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["yellow_postit"],"id":[22869103],"kids":[22869720,22870694],"parent":[22868645],"text":["Previous discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22868054\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22868054<\/a>"],"time":["2020-04-14 19:52:05"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jb775"],"id":[22870699],"kids":{},"parent":[22868645],"text":["It&#x27;s about time for unions to make a comeback."],"time":["2020-04-14 21:58:39"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["0x262d"],"id":[22870717],"kids":{},"parent":[22868645],"text":["A sharp reminder that “free speech” under capitalism effectually doesn’t apply to your job, ie the thing that you spend nearly half your waking hours on and your primary way of contributing to the functioning of society.

(Presumably there&#x27;s one for music listening...)<p>I understand the drive toward cross-app communication, but I don&#x27;t understand the &quot;one app per use&quot; way of thinking. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I rarely use FB and have never used Twitter&#x2F;Insta&#x2F;Pinterest. To the extent that I want to broadcast my online social activity at all, I want to do all my posting with one UI, in one place (i.e. in one &quot;app&quot;, my CMS) , and I don&#x27;t care whether someone looks at my stuff by reading my website or subscribing to my feed. I think if someone just wants to see photos, or articles, or &quot;tweets&quot;, or whatever, why build a separate app? Why not just filter the incoming content?<p>Running e.g. a Mastodon instance requires someone to administer the server. Once that&#x27;s in place, a community can grow up on that server. This seems to mimic more traditional web forums. Is that part of the draw?

Since then, a lot of Kotlin specifics have crept into Spring. Also, there&#x27;s an effort to move to a fully declarative Kotlin DSL for driving spring (kofu), which gets rid of basically all anotations, AOP processing, and other magic that makes spring both nice and hard to debug. At this point, if you are using Spring and not using Kotlin: you are doing it wrong. You are missing out on a ton of stuff the Spring people did to support Kotlin. Yes Java is still supported but it is increasingly in the same way that Google hasn&#x27;t completely deprecated Java for Android yet despite that obviously very much being a second class citizen in that ecosystem.<p>In short, if you are a conservative institution like a bank and evolving your tech stack at a glacial pace; yes you can still use Java. Everybody else, you probably should be using Kotlin.<p>My advice to anyone looking to do this is:<p>1) Do it, it&#x27;s easy and you end up with better code. You can start simple and mix Java and Kotlin code. I would advice starting with some tests or some new features.<p>2) Beware of the java idioms and cruft in Spring and do things the Kotlin way. So, DSLs instead of annotations + AOP, co-routines instead of spring flux, immutable data classes instead of java beans, etc.<p>3) Spring has a lot of stuff and not all of it is great or even good. IMHO the added advantage of e.g. spring-cloud or spring-data is very limited and sometimes it&#x27;s just very limiting&#x2F;backwards. I ripped out spring-data on several projects where people naively supposed it was the easiest&#x2F;best way to interact with Elasticsearch. It turns out it is neither. Spring cloud sounds nice until you realize most of the stuff you need is supported in the amazon driver but yet not exposed in spring-cloud. Also all the code samples on Amazon are for their own driver and not for spring-cloud.<p>4) Re-assess if you actually want to go anywhere near hibernate. IMHO it made a lot of sense when java beans were hard to write. Kotlin data classes take away most of that pain and there are some nice alternatives. Also, you should be using non blocking IO for talking to your DB and hibernate is still stuck on blocking IO. That in itself is a good reason to not use it on new projects.<p>Once you get a bit further, you&#x27;ll find yourself wondering if ktor would work. The answer is probably yes.

You never need to get behind the wheel, and even then you&#x27;re better off getting a Lyft.<p>$250&#x2F;mo for a parking spot where random people can still scratch up, dent or break into your car. $100-200 for insurance, $x for gas, $300+ for financing or leasing a car, $y for repairs and maintenance, $z for tickets and parking meters..

A MOSFET, however looks largely like a resistor in the &quot;On&quot; state, so the losses are quadratic with current.<p>There are also switching losses, which are a bit more complicated, but largely scale quadratically with frequency (for IGBTs there usually aren&#x27;t actual formulae but just a curve from the datasheet; MOSFETs are a bit more amenable to calculation).  For relatively low-frequency and high-current switching like a high-power permanent magnet motor, you will tend try to keep switching losses low relative to conduction losses; in any event IGBTs are low-frequency devices so if IGBTs are in discussion typically switching losses will be low.<p>As anyone who has studied asymptotic performance will know, for low-frequency applications, as current goes towards infinity, IGBTs are better.  At low currents, however, MOSFETs trounce IGBTs; A resistor that drops 0.6V at 1A would have 600mOhms of resistance, and a $0.10 Power MOSFET can beat that in low voltage (&lt;120V) applications, with on resistances on the order of 1mOhm.  At 100A there are similar conductive losses.<p>As you design power MOSFETs for higher voltage handling though, the on resistance goes up.  There are ways to design power MOSFETs with lower on-resistance, but they will make them much harder to switch and increase the switching losses to the point where that bit I said earlier about conduction losses dominating becomes not true.  For switching 900V you will want a MOSFET rated for at least 1200V and now you are looking at 100s of mOhm of on resistance, so even at say 2A, the IGBT is looking quite good.<p>Enter SiC.  I know absolutely nothing about semiconductor design, but the way it was explained to me is that the design parameters of an SiC MOSFET are such that it can block a larger voltage than a silicon MOSFET, so that the envelope shifts &quot;up&quot; for working voltage at any given amount of on-resistance ant gate-charge (which relates to switching losses).<p>Lastly, if you aren&#x27;t a racecar driver, most of the time the power draw will be far below the max, so even if an IGBT beats an SiC MOSFET handily under hard acceleration (it almost certainly does), for highway cruising there is a good chance the MOSFET will win."],"time":["2020-04-14 16:20:02"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["timerol"],"id":[22865964],"kids":[22867706,22867445,22866434],"parent":[22861486],"text":["&gt; So he designed the Lucid around a 900-watt architecture. “It’s the only one I’m aware of,” he says. “Tesla’s round about 400 V.

For example, one way this happens is through an external contractor vendor.<p>These vendors are only interested in fulfilling contract requirements and typically will try to sneak developers with least ability they can get away with. As hiring process for vendor-supplied contractors is relaxed it is not at all difficult and will only depend on management of the team&#x2F;project to prevent. Then, if it is no longer sustainable to keep particular developer on the project the vendor will not let go of the developer, it is more likely he&#x2F;she will be rotated to another project.<p>I have worked for a project in Credit Suisse where the &quot;principal developer&quot; was a person rotated from another project where she served as &quot;development manager&quot; and had many years of &quot;experience&quot; as Java developer before that. This person had only barest ability to code, she struggled to write a simple loop. When asked to add Json serializer to an application she was confused and wrote a bunch of code that concatenated strings to produce something not exactly resembling Json. She did not even have knowledge to spot the problems and would blame tools and other team members for parsing errors produced from parsing the code. Surprisingly, these explanations were accepted by the management as she had more &quot;experience&quot; than other team members.<p>When I joined the team and spotted this situation I implored management to reevalute her as principal developer. The management had no development experience either and were taking her explanations on face value. They told me that I need to spend more time on the project to &quot;learn the way they are doing things&quot;. Only after months of persuasion and showing countless examples of glaring incompetence I was able to succeed to resolve this problem.<p>I find it not difficult to imagine more possible settings where people with no competence in coding can flourish when they can initially build a strong position for themselves and can exploit incompetence of their managers and peers.<p>This is especially true for large corporations which have huge appetite to hire developers and huge budgets but also can have managers with no incentive to do their hiring very well.<p>In one project I worked for the manager kept overseas staff even though it was net negative productivity because &quot;higher management said so&quot;."],"time":["2020-04-14 10:59:22"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["hamburglar"],"id":[22863770],"kids":{},"parent":[22862871],"text":["I recently interviewed a guy who decided to solve a problem recursively, and he was allowed to choose his language.

LOC #s are &#x27;real code&#x27; via CLOC. Not a simple CRUD app.<p>It&#x27;s fine.<p>I can&#x27;t say that this would be fine for everyone. We have a very small team (2 fullstack engineers) with good communication; we keep as much logic as possible in the backend; we have a robust test harness for the backend.

Tests can&#x27;t tell you if the result is aesthetically satisfying, so you have to look at it no matter what. Since the backend diligently enforces data sanity, the frontend can&#x27;t really get into too much trouble, and a page reload fixes almost anything. Frontend testing seems to be high-effort low-reward.<p>I don&#x27;t think this would be possible without Typescript. TSX helps too since the compiler (really the IDE) catches what would otherwise be template errors. Large refactorings are pretty painless.<p>I would do this again.<p>I have also reverse engineered about a dozen other company&#x27;s web applications recently (to automate them), and noticed that there are other app design philosophies that would make this approach difficult. Some teams go with a &quot;smart frontend dumb backend&quot; approach that can produce all sorts of nasty data corruption issues if the frontend screws up.

In addition to side-stepping entire classes of attack (i.e. padding oracles), CTR would allow better performance: You can parallelize both encryption and decryption with CTR mode. With CBC mode, you can only parallelize decryption (but not encryption) since the IV for all but the first block is the previous block of ciphertext, which means you&#x27;ll know the correct IV when decrypting but not when encrypting (since you have to calculate it sequentially).<p>Yes, they HMAC the ciphertext [2]. However, their variable name choice doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in its correctness.<p>Furthermore, they truncate the HMAC to 8 byes and attempt to justify the truncation by appending an Ed25519 signature, but that sort of configuration is just begging for a confused deputy scenario, like an old iMessage vulnerability [3]. It&#x27;s no where near as bad (iMessage eschewed MACs entirely, this still uses a MAC, so it&#x27;s not exploitable), but it&#x27;s something that probably would make anyone working in cryptography (and any adjacent fields) give a confused puppy head tilt when they read it.<p>Regarding their ratcheting protocol [4]:  Instead of feeding HMAC-SHA256 back into itself at each ratchet step, I&#x27;d feel way more comfortable if the protocol did HMAC-SHA512 and used one half of the output to derive encryption&#x2F;authentication keys and the other half the ratcheting-forward key (instead of one HMAC-SHA256 for both purposes).<p>Using two distinct 256-bit secrets (even if they&#x27;re generated from the same input at i=0) instead of reusing a secret strengthens the forward secrecy of the entire protocol.<p>HMAC-SHA256:\nOne ring to rule them all (at any given ratchet step).<p>HMAC-SHA512-split:\nIf you (against all odds) guess one of the keys, that doesn&#x27;t give you the ratchet-forward key too, since they&#x27;re two distinct keys (albeit generated deterministically from the same input).<p>Nothing I said above is exploitable, otherwise I&#x27;d be emailing their security team instead of posting on HN. :)<p>That being said, if the Libolm devs want to shore up the security of their protocol in a future revision, the following changes would go a long way:<p>1. Use HMAC-SHA-512 and split it in half for the ratcheting step of Olm&#x2F;Megolm<p>2. Use AES-CTR instead of AES-CBC<p>3.

That gives me concern and I&#x27;ll have to research the ties there before switiching ti Jitsi. I&#x27;m making this a top level comment given its length, but I wrote this after seeing Vinnl&#x27;s question on 8x8.<p>I was an 8x8 customer for about 10 years as a small&#x2F;medium business. I would never buy from them again. I now use Zoom, but am considering switching given the recent privacy revelations.<p>Here was my 8x8 customer journey. Stick around - at the end I highlight their shifty auto-renewal contracting practices and dark patterns to force you to stay.<p><pre><code>     2011-2015: \n<\/code><\/pre>\nStartup phase. Was great to get a VOIP phone at this time! Still needed desktop phones from Polycom for the system to work well. Zero online meetings as far as I knew. Acceptable product, was happy enough.<p><pre><code>     Around 2015 or so through about 2019: \n<\/code><\/pre>\nNewer versions of iOS, that allowed for better phone integration, began to pop up. 8x8 was viable as a mobile-only VOIP provider, but lacked quality features for a growing business:\n  - The ability to retrieve recorded calls from a Mac required you log in with a certain version of Safari that had Flash Enabled. Then, you could only download X MB of calls at a time. All of this had to be done manually. There was no API for reporting, jus CSV exports. This made calculating total customer service costs for our business a massive pain.\n   - If you edited your extensions online, <i>ALL OF YOUR CALL RECORDINGS SINCE THE OPENING OF YOUR ACCOUNT ARE DELETED<\/i>. We found this out the hard way, and there was no warning that adjusting extensions would have this impact.<p><pre><code>     2019 Q1 thru Q3 <\/code><\/pre>\nI wanted to switch to Zoom, because the 8x8 apps had poor usability from our experience, specifically as a remote-only setup. I did not trust that a video product from 8x8 would be acceptable, and I enjoyed using Zoom with other organizations I am involved with.<p>Porting phone numbers to Zoom was really easy. It requires about 1-2 weeks of paperwork and processing time (no matter who you are porting numbers with I think this is the default). <i>However<\/i> - 8x8 tried to block the transfer for about 20% of our numbers, saying that the information we provided was incorrect. After days of back and forth, all the while our numbers were unavailable for use and causing operational problems, the case was escalated and resolved, simply because a new person read the original forms we submitted and processed it correctly.<p><pre><code>     On the 8x8 contract &amp; account management dark patterns: \n<\/code><\/pre>\n8x8 did not have a copy of the PDF of our agreement. I did have a copy. The contract was for 3 years with 12 month auto-renewal clauses.<p>Multiple times in 2018 I requested my account manager offer new pricing, as our rates had doubled from $25&#x2F;number to $50&#x2F;number in just 1 year. The cost was out of control. They never did offer pricing, but continually played the Car Salesman move of &quot;Let me see what I can get my finance department to approve&quot;, come back with a meager 5% discount, rinse, repeat... The account manager would passively threaten that they will take my account to month to month, &quot;but the pricing controls will no longer be in place and your rates could rise&quot;. Big deal, I thought, my rates are already skyrocketing!<p>Multiple times in 2016-2018 I wrote to them asking if I had an auto-renewal. They would not answer this question over email, but instead forced me to call in.<p>When I called in (&quot;...to a recorded line, for quality assurance purposes...&quot;), they would tell me I did have an auto renewal in August each year for 12 months. I would tell them over the phone to mark that I wish to cancel my auto renewal and continue on a month to month basis. I would follow up with my 8x8 Account Manager that I was told over the phone by the 8x8 Billing Representative that my company <i>did not<\/i> have an auto renewal. My account manager never acknowledge these messages.<p><pre><code>    2019 Q3: \n<\/code><\/pre>\nI submitted a cancellation notice to 8x8. They wanted to charge me an Early Termination penalty of more than half the year, claiming I was in a 1 year auto renewal. <i>It took me over a dozen phone calls for more than an hour each<\/i> to get this resolved.<p>I&#x27;ve come to expect garbage contract patterns from legacy companies. <i>However... THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS<\/i> in my opinion was that calls 1 through 11 to 8x8 customer support and billing to resolve this were not successful, in my opinion, because I was being very nice and understanding to the support person on the other line. <i>ONLY<\/i> when I started threatening legal action, &quot;I do not care what the script is telling you to say, I must talk to a manager&quot;, etc, did I get someone to waive these cancellation fees and allow me to transfer my numbers.<p>I have done customer service oriented work, I understand the drain it can have on people. I try to be overly nice to anyone I have to call into because so many people are abusive to the support agents trying to assist them. But at the end of the day, wether its Apple or 8x8, the only success I&#x27;ve had at getting what I need in situations where the company is clearly playing hide-the-ball, is to be threatening to the minimum wage worker on the other end of the line.<p>And that is my take away - you can tell a lot about a company from how they arm (or bind &amp; toss overboard) their front-line support agents to deal with a terminating customer contract."],"time":["2020-04-13 16:09:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["giancarlostoro"],"id":[22855606],"kids":[22855634],"parent":[22855407],"text":["Jitsi was the one Jabber client I used a few years back that I liked.

Certainly, just about anybody who worked on development systems responded really well to that particular demonstration. It really showed how the Smalltalk system could be changed on the fly and be extremely malleable in terms of stuff you could try out in the user interface.<p>Alan Kay: On Smalltalk you could change any part of the system in a quarter of a second. These days it&#x27;s called live coding, but most of the stuff today–and virtually everything back then–used compiled code, so your programming and editing and stuff like that was a completely separate thing. You had to stop the system and rebuild.<p>Dan Ingalls: So you had a regular sort of programming environment sitting there in front of you with windows and menus and the ability to look at code and stuff. But the neat thing about it was that if you edited the code, it would actually change the code that you were running at that very moment. The object-oriented architecture made it really, really quick to make changes.<p>Bruce Horn: Even today if you wanted to change something at the level of the operating system in MacOS or Windows, it&#x27;s simply impossible unless they have decided to give you that option to smooth-scroll or not. It&#x27;s simply impossible to get to the source code to do that unless you&#x27;re an employee–and even then it would probably take six months to get that feature in.
