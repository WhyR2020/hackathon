This guy had some crazy stories and since i know my friend for 20 years it was mind blowing that his dad drove some of my favorite artists&#x2F;musicians and he never talked about it. ahhh.. so much memories.. Ralf and Florian are&#x2F;were very kind persons and it always was nice to talk to them.

There once was a &quot;Studio für elektronische Musik&quot; (Studio for Electronic Music)[4] by the WDR (german radio&#x2F;television). In the later years there were only &quot;private&quot; tours (thanks to Volker Müller - the sound engineer of Stockhausen!) and it saddens me that it&#x27;s not open to the public anymore.

It doesn’t make much sense to have so many recruiters in such environment.<p>For the GH hubs, if psychiatrists are moving online to telehealth, Uber green light hubs are way more simpler to be executed remotely via Zoom.<p>I am classifying this as a offense move, because the defense would have been to raise more money through debts and so many companies are doing it, Uber could have played the same move.<p>It’s pretty scary though, if this does set the precedent for other companies, unemployment recovery in HR&#x2F;Support is going to very very slow."],"time":["2020-05-06 20:21:27"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["waterfowl"],"id":[23091112],"kids":[23091880,23091138],"parent":[23090858],"text":["Seems technology sparing.

It was first observed in 564 BCE by the Chinese Emperor Diocletian. The idea of space travel was not the same as that of modern science, and the Chinese weren&#x27;t trying to be overly scientific (they were doing this during a time when China was ruled by the Han Dynasty and didn&#x27;t have to worry about scientific advancement) so they did not have a good understanding of the universe when it was first discovered. The Chinese did not invent astronomy until the Song Dynasty, and did not have any sort of understanding of the solar system before that. There was a theory in China about the existence of other bodies in the solar system, but it was never really explored and had no evidence to back it up (because most people did not believe in the existence of other celestial bodies, even though there were many theories about the existence of many different celestial bodies). The Chinese did not have the technology to actually observe the moon. They were not able to observe it with telescopes, and so they only knew about the moon. The Chinese did not have an understanding of the solar system before that, and did not have any understanding of the moon, so they did not know what it was. They were not even aware of the existence of other celestial bodies at that time, so they didn&#x27;t know that there was one.<p>The &quot;Chinese Emperor Diocletian&quot; is hilariously wrong, but it flows right and sounds reasonable in context. Similarly the phrase &quot;they were doing this during a time when China was ruled by the Han Dynasty and didn&#x27;t have to worry about scientific advancement&quot;; it sounds like something an educated person would write about history, even though it&#x27;s almost certainly entirely wrong.<p>Oh, and they can fake a news article pretty well:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SubSimulatorGPT2&#x2F;comments&#x2F;et4yj3&#x2F;man_gets_sentenced_to_a_1year_in_prison_after&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SubSimulatorGPT2&#x2F;comments&#x2F;et4yj3&#x2F;ma...<\/a><p>Title:<p>&gt; Man Gets Sentenced To A 1-Year In Prison After Trying To Kill A Pork Custodian By Shooting Him In The Face<p>&quot;Pork Custodian&quot; is the only thing which doesn&#x27;t work there.<p>Now, the fake news, formatting in the original:<p>&gt; A little background on the situation.

The man shot the man&#x27;s neighbor in the face with a .38 caliber handgun.<p>&gt;&gt; The victim was taken to a local hospital.

That&#x27;s just a punch in the gut, especially to developers who oughta be more enlightened on tracking&#x2F;privacy concerns than average users.<p>And I know you can opt out but I&#x27;ve done that and still seen dotnet make network requests on runs.

The cost was too high with existing consultancy-focused solutions. So lots of small repetitive tasks built up.<p>Recently though, RPA has become a popular technology for automating big, repetitive processes.<p>RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is a way to automate using the user interface of applications, rather than APIs. If you’ve ever used an Excel or Emacs macro, it’s the same principle. Companies like UiPath and Automation anywhere have had great success deploying RPA for enterprise use-cases (e.g. processing 1000s of invoices for a multinational)<p>But we believe RPA also has potential as a no-code paradigm for smaller use-cases (e.g a customer support person doing data-entry).<p>That&#x27;s because most people intuitively understand UIs, but not APIs.<p>So we thought, what would happen if you took RPA technology and packaged it up in a no-code Zapier-like SaaS? This way, all the small tasks too small for developer time can get automated.<p>Our current users are mostly non-technical and in roles like sales or e-commerce administration. They have repetitive extract, transform, load (ETL) tasks, like:<p>-Gathering data for sales enrichment, then inputting into their CRM<p>-Connecting and exporting data from e-commerce systems like Amazon and Shopify, where APIs are limited.<p>UI-based automation is not just a way to fill gaps in APIs. We&#x27;ve found it is a more intuitive and faster way for many non-technical people to automate.<p>Along the way, we’ve also discovered many new niches (like sports betting funds) that we didn’t know existed.<p>Axiom is not built for large-scale data-scraping or automated testing, though. These  require specific features we do not yet support (e.g. IP switching, or assertion logic).<p>We don’t touch your data. All data-processing and execution occurs client-side, on your machine. We only store the code for execution. For data storage, we use your Google drive account.<p>Our beta only supports Google Chrome (this is just an MVP. We want to expand support to FireFox and other browsers with time and resources).<p>I’m sure the HN audience has seen how challenging browser automation can be, particularly with the complexity of modern JS-heavy web-apps. We’d love your feedback, experience and thoughts!<p>For example:<p>Some users have said the permissions being requested by our app are off-putting. We’re listening and adapting. We’re removing permissions + improving communication.

All while pursuing his interests, and slacking off occasionally.<p>&quot;Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the University of Edinburgh Medical School (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.&quot;<p>&quot;Darwin&#x27;s neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson. As Darwin was unqualified for the Tripos, he joined the ordinary degree course in January 1828. He preferred riding and shooting to studying. His cousin William Darwin Fox introduced him to the popular craze for beetle collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens&#x27; Illustrations of British entomology. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow and met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as &quot;the man who walks with Henslow&quot;. When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley&#x27;s Evidences of Christianity (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.&quot;<p>- On technology there are too many to count I guess? Bill Gates halted his undergrad at prestigious Hardvard. Or Elon Musk &quot;In 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics&#x2F;materials science at Stanford University in California. Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, however, he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company, Zip2 Corporation.&quot;<p>Perhaps you could redefine Grit as ability to endure pain or keep motivation when you have worthwhile goals in mind (if you want to just adapt the word).

On the 21st of April, completely unexpectedly, a tweet of mine blew up big time.<p>&quot;Fortunate favors the prepared.&quot; The highly random nature of internet karma should probably be more well publicized by now. If ten years ago, I gave myself all the blog posts I&#x27;d write over the next ten years, I would not have predicted correctly which ones would be most popular. Not that I write for the pageviews, or even write all that often. If you think of it as a multiarmed bandit problem, you kinda have to publish without a goal in mind in order to have enough arms to pull to find and iterate on the few good ones. This is why IMO, it helps to have a few input goals as well as outcomes.<p>AFAICT, content marketing is basically posting good stuff and hoping some of the traffic rubs off on your sales funnel. Like that Sparkfun rotary cell phone from way back when, though obviously it helps when you sell the parts to your ironic nobody-would-buy-this product online.<p>&gt; I smashed my infamous $500 MRR goal. It was a huge mental barrier for me. The sad thing is that once again I was tricked. I was chasing this goal for more than two years, and now it means nothing to me. It&#x27;s dead. Cold. Meaningless. Like it was never there in the first place.<p>Elsewhere on his site Alex describes his goals as &#x27;humble&#x27; but that may be part of the psychological problem here; even he believes they&#x27;re not the same as even modest success. $500 MRR feels meaningless because it _is_. Why does 500 MRR matter? If you borrow the OKR framework, perhaps he would reframe the Objective (goal) as &#x27;build a business capable of sustaining my preferred lifestyle&#x27;, and then the MRR target would have meaning as a key result?<p>The Objective&#x2F;Key-Result framework provide two major benefits:<p>First, it gives you the means to tie your metrics to something meaningful, and the ability to fact check your assumptions. Make more money isn&#x27;t necessarily meaningful, but &#x27;quit my day job&#x27; or &#x27;send my kid to art school&#x27; can be. Perhaps the $500 MRR goal feels meaningless because the lifestyle goal _is_ the real Objective, but the $500 MRR Key Result is insufficient to meet it.<p>The second thing it does is provide a process for breaking Big Problems into smaller ones. You&#x27;ll probably need multiple strategies to reach any important Objective, and the KRs help you break them into smaller steps. Which themselves can be treated as Objectives with their own KRs.

If you have a problem that would require repair, you need to instead get it replaced with a refurbished machine. This means you have to back up your machine and set it all up again on a new one.
