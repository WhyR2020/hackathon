The following thoughts may-or-may-not help others.<p>1. Train your chairperson.<p>The meeting chair is usually an important person. Everyone will be there to influence that person&#x27;s thoughts - as well as fight their own corner against professional and personal enemies. The secretary is usually someone a lot further down the pecking order. Which means training your chairperson is gonna be a fraught affair. However, if you can demonstrate to your chair that listening to your advice will lead to happier meetings then they may be happier to learn. I call this the &quot;Dark Art of upwards management&quot;.<p>The keys to a successful meeting - they vary. But a pretty fundamental key is &quot;what is this meeting about&quot;, alongside &quot;what does the chair want to get out of this meeting&quot;. Work these out (by any means possible), then ask the chair if your assumptions are right before the meeting starts. Most chairpeople will (in my experience) indulge your questions in a patronising sort of way the first few times, especially if you can follow up on likely arguments that may block successful outcomes. After a while intelligent chairs will be asking you for a summary of the meeting before it starts. Chairs do not like to have their time wasted. Be the person who helps the chair save their time.<p>2. Take notes during the meeting.<p>Never rely on memory recall after the meeting! Your memory will lie to you, especially about the boring bits which turn out to be really important for some of the participants. And use oldskool pen and paper: typing is essentially one dimensional, whereas a pad of paper has three dimensions and pens can draw arrows, bubbles, and (during the boring bits) relevant doodles as well as record word&#x2F;idea summaries. It should be enough to capture key phrases (which will trigger memories later) - if you need a full record of everything said during the meeting, use a voice recording device.<p>Also, advice for face-blind folks like me. Draw a map of where everybody is sitting at the very start of the meeting, and insist that everyone introduces themselves (for the record) before the bickering starts. Then you can give people numbers or pithy descriptions (&quot;bluedress&quot;, &quot;uglytache&quot;) to help capture who said what.<p>Nowadays online meetings can be recorded. Personally I think it makes the whole thing a lot less fun. Someone still has to summarise the meeting for the files, or action points, etc.<p>3. Write up a first draft of the meeting summary straight after the meeting.<p>Do not put this job off! Tackle it while the anger at being forced to do the work is still hot in your veins. It does not have to be perfect; it just needs to be in the required format. Fuller notes is best - it&#x27;s always easier to cut words later than to add them. Pull action points from the notes into a separate document. The action points are the only thing anyone&#x27;s interested in. But your chair will thank you later if you have a fuller record: being able to say during a subsequent meeting that something has already been decided - and being able to point to the record of that - will save your chairperson the pain of deja-vu ... and give them a reason to like you even more than they already did.<p>Final thoughts ... my ideal meeting lasts no more than ten minutes. If I need to meet someone (eg: client) on a regular basis I will do as much work beforehand as needed to make the meeting as speedy and pleasant for everyone attending. Know what every meeting is for; what I want to get out of the meeting. Know what others want to get out of the meeting before they know themselves. If you know someone will attend the meeting because they really like making everyone listen to their (never-ending!) voice ... lose their invite. If the matter of a meeting creeps way beyond its original scope, or you can see that you have nothing further to contribute, stand up and walk out."],"time":["2020-09-22 13:06:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sAbakumoff"],"id":[24547843],"kids":[24548150],"parent":[24547098],"text":["I think that f2f meetings with real people are in the past and any self-respect online meetings software allows recordings.

Here are some other things I learned when doing something similar recently on my home network (except the router is a FreeBSD box).<p>- You can run `dhclient` interactively to learn the size of the prefix your ISP delegates. The OP touches on this, but the solution is OpenWRT-specific. Most distributions include `dhclient` or have it packaged.<p>- It’s possible that the IP your ISP assigns your router is in a different prefix from the prefix it delegates to you. For example, my ISP for a while assigned an IP in 2607::&#x2F;16 while delegating a &#x2F;56 prefix in 2605::&#x2F;16.<p>- Prefixes can also change. When I switched my router to FreeBSD, I started getting a &#x2F;56 prefix in 2607::&#x2F;16 instead of 2605::&#x2F;16.<p>- Some systems (e.g., Windows 7) don’t support getting DNS via router advertisements. If you want to support them, you need to run a DHCPv6 server and advertise that other stateful configuration is available.<p>- Kea is the successor to the ISC DHCP server. I found it a bit nicer and more flexible to configure.<p>- On Linux, NetworkManager and systemd-networkd handles a lot of this stuff automatically, but your customization options are limited. I couldn’t find a way to do the above without having to do things manually myself.<p>- FreeBSD’s DHCP client in base does not yet support DHCPv6. To get an IP and a prefix, you need to install one from ports. I’m using dhcp6c, following this guide[1] to set it up.<p>- ICMPv6 is integral to IPv6, but if you want to filter it, follow the advice in RFC-4890. Filtering ICMPv6 incorrectly will mess up your network in weird ways (e.g., my MBP could get an IP but wouldn’t get a DNS server until I fixed the problem).<p>- IANA maintains a registry[2] of IPv6 multicast addresses. I found this helpful when writing firewall rules.<p>- When advertising LAN services over DNS, make sure you use the “secure” or “template” IP and not the temporary IP used for IPv6 privacy. Also, you can’t assign domain names to link-local addresses, but you can advertise a DNS server (via RA and DHCPv6) on one.<p>- mDNS is the exception to the above. Avahi and Bonjour advertise link-local address and are able to resolve them properly.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vladvasiliu.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;20180827-0922-ipv6_prefix_delegation_freebsd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vladvasiliu.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;20180827-0922-ipv6_prefix_deleg...<\/a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;ipv6-multicast-addresses&#x2F;ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;ipv6-multicast-addresses&#x2F;ip...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-09-21 16:22:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ncmncm"],"id":[24550583],"kids":{},"parent":[24541652],"text":["Is there an easy way to discover whether your ISP would support v6?

You have some people who open grab and go, and hope only to franchise. You have some young chef who opens in a vacant&#x2F;former kitchen hoping to make his organic vegan dreams a reality. And a serial entrepreneur of hot spots. All other things being equal, they are competing on location, product quality, and marketing.<p>Near my home is Walmart, Target, Marshalls (second market clothes), Nordstrom Rack (second market for Nordstrom). You can shop at each and, when the fashion stars align, you can find the &quot;same item&quot; (IE. summer cotton beige unlined sport coat) at each location with nearly identical materials &amp; finish, yet each is set at increasingly higher prices (competing on marketing).<p>What&#x27;s the difference between &quot;Eames&quot; molded fiberglass wire base side chair ($400) and knockoff molded plastic ($80)? Quality of materials. Fit and finish. Quality control (competing on cost of goods, skilled labor, and capital asset&#x2F;investments)<p>The capital investments increase as you go from restaurant to clothing to furniture (and beyond, ie. auto manufacturing or space rockets).<p>If you look at the cost and investment at the high-end, it stands to reason it would take generations to move a company from creating &#x27;low quality&#x27; products to high quality, or you&#x27;re just happy right were you are (Making Crap since 1929). Or, you step in s#!t, make zillions processing online transactions in finance, then jump into electric auto-manufacturing. haha. It seems so interesting. If you add environmental impact, jobs created, impact on the economy, and even the most boring 4th generation crap manufacturer is dramatic story.<p>On the book, seems the author is talking about another thing entirely--&#x27;useless&#x27; low quality items--novelty items, souvenirs. I recall reading somewhere about religious pilgrimage circuits in Europe (for hundreds of years) where pilgrims could &#x27;buy&#x27; &#x27;souvenirs&#x27;.<p>I wonder if you don&#x27;t necessarily need a wealthy economy. Rather, you need disposable income, and in modern times, low-cost plastics industry, international shipping, and cultures of collecting, plus cultural &#x27;stories&#x27; (sports teams, super heroes, music industry, arts, crafts) which give rise to creative expressions of the culture.<p>And why all this &#x27;crap&#x27;? Money money money. Jobs jobs jobs. (ie. Halmark created holidays to sell more cards; not wealth, per se, but disposable income)."],"time":["2020-09-21 21:14:40"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mcv"],"id":[24552285],"kids":{},"parent":[24543670],"text":["What a terrible, terrible GDPR popup.

They said the same about Facebook in 2013 when it was trading at $33&#x2F;share. &quot;Buying Instagram for $1 billion was so stupid&quot; &quot;Mobile ads will never work!&quot; &quot;There will be a competitor!&quot; &quot;Just a fad!&quot; etc.  They said same about Amazon when it was at $400&#x2F;share in 2014. &quot;Losing too much money on Prime orders!&quot; &quot;Fake reviews&quot; &quot;Share price too high, not enough profit!&quot; &quot;Stealing from the state (in regard to taxes)&quot; etc.  The list goes on and on. For every correct prediction, they get many wrong.  If if valuations are high, what these people ignore is that earnings are surging, so that high PE ratio will come falling really fast. For example, Facebook had a PE ratio of 100 in 2012.  If I were going to try to predict which companies are most vulnerable to being bubbles, I would look for companies that are not a dominant as Amazon or Tesla, but are small and whose products can be easily substituted for cheaper alternatives. Retail is especially vulnerable to this.  But then again, Nike bucked this trend. Bitcoin , unlike Tesla, cannot generate shareholder equity, so in the long-run Bitcoin will always lag equities, as commodities have always done. Bitcoin&#x27;s price is just a function of supply and demand and has no intrinsic worth. Still long tesla and amazon. Ppl need to stop trying to call the tops of these things.

Since the bond yield inverted earlier this year, investors are looking at anywhere to put their cash for an ROI.

These factors are fueling the rise seen in the share market much more than simply “speculative investor sentiment”. Like all bubbles, this one will inevitably deflate (hopefully not pop). I do think that these factors have multiplied which in turn has attracted even more investment. I believe that now is a very dangerous time to invest in the share market.

There is a huge amount of liquidity being pushed into the USD supply by the fed and treasury. It needs to go somewhere. The (government&#x27;s) hope is that it will go into hiring&#x2F;spending and the real economy. Even if that is what happens to the majority of the new money supply (debatable) a large amount will go into financial assets for people who want to preserve their wealth. The expected result (IMO) would be stocks to go up in USD purely because of demand for them. This can alse been seen as inflation or maybe financial asset inflation. The fundamentals of the economy are not good, but the new money has to go somewhere. After paying for living expenses etc, there aren&#x27;t many places to put it besides the stock market.<p>A final thought is that if consumer price inflation remains low and financial assets catch all the inflation, the &quot;rich&quot; or invested benefit the most.

The majority of Pakistanis don&#x27;t date the way Americans do due to the conservative values. When we sign up for a dating app, what we&#x27;re looking for is someone whom we can connect with and marry soon - possibly within 6-12 months timeframe. Tinder is optimized for American dating and is incompatible with our family values. Therefore, when you signed up for Tinder in Pakistan, you saw that it was a hookup app rather than an app that helps you find a lifelong partner. Most Pakistanis who&#x27;re serious about finding a partner use Muslim dating apps like Muzmatch and Minder.<p>Edit: A lot of people have replied below that this does not justify banning the app. I have simply shared my experience and also the experience of many others in Pakistan. Tinder turned into an immoral app (borderline pornography in many cases) and this being an Islamic Republic of Pakistan, it went against the conservative values of the nation to hookup and thus it was banned by the govt. The govt is the democratic representative of the people and does what the majority of the nation expects them to do."],"time":["2020-09-02 13:04:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_trampeltier"],"id":[24351796],"kids":[24351809,24352389],"parent":[24351376],"text":["Meanwhile in the western world banks decide about the content on pages like Fetlife and about the color of dildos in webshops."],"time":["2020-09-02 12:28:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mellosouls"],"id":[24352179],"kids":[24353281],"parent":[24351376],"text":["What is it about Tinder that brings on these flame-wars on HN?<p>It&#x27;s almost like those who question Tinder&#x27;s moral neutrality and innocence in its impact on society have a point..."],"time":["2020-09-02 13:29:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["thewatcher2"],"id":[24351938],"kids":[24351947,24374763],"parent":[24351376],"text":["I&#x27;d support this action.

But that then means you are now maintaining this custom thing forever. If you&#x27;re Amazon, that might be fine, but I suspect that this will be dropped when it is no longer profitable or a competing project supplants it - meaning in 5 years this thing might be gone. (A common theme of custom Linux distributions)<p>And then there&#x27;s troubleshooting. With a stripped-down distro, you will eventually need more tools to debug the thing, meaning you have to build and maintain packages to do that. Bottlerocket&#x27;s answer to this is &quot;run them in containers and use our API!&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sold on this. Have you ever tried to do debugging between host and container, or container to container? There&#x27;s a lot of b.s. you have to hop through, and most Unix tools were not written with it in mind. I highly doubt that it will magically work for everything. If that&#x27;s the case, then this &quot;don&#x27;t worry, because <i>magic<\/i>&quot; idea is not really saving you work over maintaining a traditional OS.<p>Moreover, you don&#x27;t need a custom distro to do live patching. There are simple tricks you can use to juggle files and processes during a live patch, to say nothing of &quot;checkpoint process &amp;&amp; &#x27;mv old_file new_file&#x27; &amp;&amp; thaw process&quot;, etc. Kernels support live patching too. So if the argument is &quot;well it&#x27;s easier to patch&quot;, i&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re not trading away &quot;easy&quot; in one place for &quot;pain in the ass&quot; in another (see above). All of this also argues that it&#x27;s just as effective to treat live-patched systems as you treat immutable infrastructure, and I&#x27;m not convinced of that argument either. The former is just more complex, and complexity attracts failures.<p>Ultimately I think what you&#x27;ll find is Bottlerocket will get a niche following, but also some people will get annoyed by it and go back to regular distros which already have well defined methods."],"time":["2020-09-02 14:57:47"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["moondev"],"id":[24346672],"kids":{},"parent":[24345035],"text":["Cluster API does both!
