A new malware attack can make an entire class of device obsolete overnight.  IoT devices might be fine if you keep them on a private network but expire quickly if exposed to the internet.  A device might be abandoned by a company (no more firmware updates) but later adopted by the open source movement and then updated for a decade.  Everyone might be using a device thinking it&#x27;s safe when actually an APT has had a compromise for it for years.  Maybe a better solution is the ability to force obsolescence, but then companies might misuse that and it could be an attack route itself to turn off the devices.  An expiration date or forced obsolescence can destroy many things that are actually still useful.  A companies commitment to provide updates may be some indication of expected life, but is also a guess and how can you trust that small companies (innovators) will be around in the future?<p>Maybe the solution is the old fashioned approach to hardening devices; keep improving them until we know they are stable and reliable and then keep making the same thing, like old Unix servers.  But people like new things and there are always desirable features that could be added.  All changes are the potential creation of new vulnerabilities.<p>The Soviet Union used common parts to make many different devices, which made them last forever because they were easy to fix.  But that also kept them from switching to new devices because it would obsolete so much infrastructure and the social functions built around it.<p>The only long term solution may be to change society so no one has an interest in doing bad things, it becomes boring and unattractive.  That doesn&#x27;t eliminate all risks though, because the world itself changes and can cause new unforeseen problems.<p>A layered approach could protect devices better, giving them a longer useful life.  And if they were designed well (by iterating) to start with, that would help too.  A plan for what to do, just in case, might help as well.  Risk and cost assessment can help make wise decisions.  Sometimes the only solution will be to just pull all the devices and replace them, at high cost.<p>We&#x27;re already facing multiple problems along these lines (compromised home routers, bugs in CPU&#x27;s, zero days, people not updating software) so there is something to be learned from current problems and solutions.<p>One really difficult problem is we don&#x27;t really know how to make things that last a long time at a reasonable cost.

They do a fantastic job at visualizing data from both my watch and surprisingly also very well from 3rd party footpod powermeters[2], they do this much better than Garmin does on their own website[3] because they overlay right and left shoe on the same graph. They do on the other hand, not have &#x27;social&#x27; features, but you can generate a public sharable URL.<p>Luckily, Garmin is a pretty big company, and the will hopefully not close their service any time soon, but it bothers me a little that on my newer watch, 920XT, I need data connection to extract my activities from my watch directly directly to their platform in order to view it.<p>On my old 910XT, it was possible to extract activities to my laptop, or even to my phone with a 3rd party app[4] and an ANT+ chip. There was even a nice app for viewing activities locally on the device [5] - a really nice solution if you don&#x27;t have a data connection, and you are using an older watch with an android phone.<p>Over all, I have been very happy with Garmin, just with the tiny exceptions of need for online sync, and the decision to remove support for their temperature sensor data field.<p>-cheers<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strava.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strava.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runalyze.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runalyze.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runscribe.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runscribe.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;connect.garmin.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;connect.garmin.com&#x2F;<\/a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.quantrity.ant2net_pro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.quantrity....<\/a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=sk.flashdev.gcviewer.pro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=sk.flashdev.gc...<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-07 18:18:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["edent"],"id":[22266996],"kids":[22267135],"parent":[22266593],"text":["I can understand why.

Suddenly, it was much cheaper to finance a car. Loans made to buyers were snapped up by Wall Street investors looking for returns as income from supersafe Treasurys drifted toward zero.<p>&gt; The combination of rock-bottom rates and yield-hungry investors helped bring the U.S. auto industry back to life. By 2015, auto sales had reached records.<p>&gt; Low rates, in effect, served as a bailout for the entire auto industry. Last year, investors bought a record $107 billion of bonds backed by cars, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. That is the first issuance record since 2005 and nearly triple the amount two decades earlier. The outstanding pile of auto bonds swelled to a record $264 billion.<p>&gt; So far this year, dealerships made an average of $982 per new vehicle on finance and insurance versus $381 on the actual sale, according to J.D. Power, a data and analytics company. A decade earlier, financing brought in $516 per car and the sale made dealers $837.<p>&gt; Finance managers at dealerships typically use an electronic portal to hash out the terms of the loans.

I have wanted to write about this for a while, so this is a good excuse.<p>I serve low-income people as part of my job, and I make $49,000&#x2F;year gross. But my expenses are about half that. I spend $742 on housing and utilities, including phone and internet (remember: small-to-midsized town!). My food budget is $400, thought I haven&#x27;t spent that much yet. I have (or had) a $253 car payment. And so, I consume about half of my post-tax income and can save the other half. If I were co-habitating, I&#x27;d be able to spend even less on housing. Living alone is a luxury.<p>So why are all of my clients in miserable living situations? (I frankly don&#x27;t know how to make ends meet at less than 175% of the federal poverty line without going the rice-and-beans route, so let&#x27;s set those households aside.) Part of it is due to issues highlighted by this article--why do my clients need a $22,000 sedan when I bought mine for $14,000? Part of it is due to the &quot;cycle of poverty&quot;--once you are poor, you can easily get trapped in poverty until you learn some life lessons the hard way (read up on &quot;flex loans&quot; in the state of Tennessee if you want to see some stuff that my clients have to deal with). Part of it is health care, where costs are unforeseeable, and when they arrive they are quite high, throwing a wrench in the plans&#x2F;lives of budgeters who aren&#x27;t extremely careful. And part of it is substance abuse--not the illegal stuff, but the legal stuff: tobacco and alcohol.<p>In the end, I have gone through a lot of clients&#x27; files, and buying a car that&#x27;s too expensive or living in a place that&#x27;s too fancy is rarely the primary reason for their troubles. Why am I in such a good financial position where I&#x27;d be able to make ends meet even if I made half as much? Well, it&#x27;s because I live in a cheap area, don&#x27;t have any substance addictions, am extraordinarily financially educated, have enough savings to buy things like smartphones up front, know how to fight tooth and nail for the cheapest possible option when it comes to big life expenses, and am fit as a fiddle. Oh, and though I am fully on my own now, my parents helped me start my financial life with a good credit score. It&#x27;s hard for people to check all those boxes, and some are out of their control.<p>So eliminating paycheck-to-paycheck living is a multi-faceted problem, with solutions as varied as better financial education, moving to single-payer so that unexpected, burdensome health care costs aren&#x27;t a thing, having robust anti-substance-abuse programs, outlawing 270% APR loans (yes, that&#x27;s what flex loans are...), etc. There&#x27;s a strange dichotomy: it&#x27;s important to have the personal mentality that you are responsible for your own finances, and that the government can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t save you.

A lot of the comments I see here are pretty subjective, anecdotal and emotional. I really don&#x27;t like seeing this on Hacker News.<p>Note in the article it says:\n&quot;WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nine in 10 Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in their personal life, a new high in Gallup&#x27;s four-decade trend. The latest figure bests the previous high of 88% recorded in 2003.&quot;<p>In 2003 there were a lot of issues too. 9&#x2F;11 recently happened, some wars in the Middle East... So why not read the actual article? They try to go into details as to why people are feeling happier. E.g.<p>&quot;Household income, political party affiliation and marital status are associated with the largest subgroup differences in Americans&#x27; satisfaction with their personal life\n. Roughly 95% of Americans who live in high-income households, who identify as Republicans and who are married say they are satisfied with their personal life -- and about three in four among each of these groups are very satisfied.<p>Meanwhile, adults in low-income households are the least likely to say they are satisfied with their life, followed by Democrats and unmarried adults. Among each of these groups, small majorities report being very satisfied. Low-income Americans hold the distinction of having the lowest percentage very satisfied<p>It&#x27;s likely no coincidence that Americans&#x27; heightened satisfaction with their personal life comes as confidence in the U.S. economy and their personal finances are also at long-term or record highs.&quot;<p>The article even talks about races and genders, which again is correlated with income. Being married too. So presumably this happiness is in large part due to the economic boom of late. The article even concludes with this. Comments here can say the question is ambiguous or people don&#x27;t know how they feel themselves all they want, but the evidence, and just plain intuition, strongly suggests it has a lot to do with the economy.

Yes, the dreaded &quot;good enough&quot; argument surfaces again stronger than ever. They are also easy to understand, i.e. use JPEG for lossy photos and PNG for pixel-exact graphics.

The available memory and disk space have grown enormously as well.<p>For example, it&#x27;s not so much of a problem if a background image of a website compresses down to 500Kb rather than 400Kb because the web page itself is 10M and always takes 10 seconds to load regardless of which decade it is. If you could squeeze a half-a-megabyte off the website&#x27;s image data the site wouldn&#x27;t effectively be any faster because of that (but maybe marginally so to allow the publisher to add another half-a-megabyte of ads or other useless crap instead."],"time":["2020-02-07 09:49:57"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["Latty"],"id":[22261855],"kids":[22262020,22263173,22264003],"parent":[22261612],"text":["The section &quot;Works on any kind of image&quot; is really misleading, as it mentions JPEG as a lossy format (alongside  JPEG 2000) then says &quot;FLIF beats anything else in all categories.&quot;<p>It really needs a giant caveat saying &quot;lossless&quot;.

New leads often feel that if they&#x27;re not writing code (or doing whatever it means to be an individual contributor), they&#x27;re slacking off. The definition of &quot;work&quot; has changed. It now means &quot;helping your team succeed&quot;. If you try to be an individual contributor, you are doing your old job instead of your new one, and you&#x27;ll get overwhelmed and sink.<p>- Not asking questions. New leads often think that being a lead means being an expert, so they&#x27;re embarrassed to ask or consult someone else about their team&#x27;s domain, for fear of looking inadequate. Your team and your peers are the experts— it is your job to ensure that expertise prevails, whether it&#x27;s yours or someone else&#x27;s. You&#x27;ll look much more dumb if you&#x27;re too insecure to admit what you don&#x27;t know, or fail to ask basic questions that allow you to get the job done.<p>- Hiding problems. When things aren&#x27;t going well (and often they don&#x27;t), don&#x27;t hide this from the leadership above you. They are there to help you and guide you, and can save you from crashing and burning. You will look much worse if a problem comes to light months after it could have been communicated and dealt with.<p>- Not communicating. Share what&#x27;s going on with your team. Share what&#x27;s going on in the big picture. Don&#x27;t keep people in the dark, either above you or below you.<p>Some leads (moreso if they&#x27;re prone to impostor syndrome) think they have to wait for permission to speak, or to be offered something that they need— don&#x27;t do this. If you have something important to say&#x2F;ask, it&#x27;s your responsibility as a leader to say it and get what you need.<p>- Forgetting the big picture. As an individual contributor, you often only have to think about near-term or small-scope problems. It is an easy mistake to make as a new lead to spend priority on those things instead of keeping in mind what&#x27;s necessary for the entire team to succeed at its high level goal.<p>Good luck!"],"time":["2020-02-06 18:24:06"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["laddershoe"],"id":[22256551],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["I was in this exact position a few years ago! I led a group for a year and a half, with somewhat mixed success. We did some pretty great successes, but also some pretty embarrassing problems that were at least partially attributable to my inexperience. I learned a ton though! The below is my experience, and may or may not translate to yours, but believe me, it was learned the hard way.<p>Being a tech lead is only partly about the tech, and mostly about the lead. You&#x27;ll ultimately succeed or fail based on your team.<p>Being an effective leader requires a completely different set of skills than being an effective engineer. This, as silly as it sounds now, took me by surprise. You may have a decade-plus of dev experience but still be starting from zero when it comes to people. (Or not; some people will be better equipped for this than others. I wasn&#x27;t so much.)<p>Find a mentor. Someone you can be completely honest with, and who will be honest with you. Bonus points if they know your team well \ntoo -they&#x27;ll see things that you won&#x27;t.<p>You may have to be pretty intentional about finding out what&#x27;s going on in your team. Once you&#x27;re in a position of authority, people won&#x27;t always feel free to tell you.<p>Share as much context with your team as you can. They&#x27;ll be more motivated if they understand why their work is important and has value. Even if you understand this... people aren&#x27;t mind readers. They don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in your head.<p>Part of your job now is to be available to people. This may mean you don&#x27;t get to actually work on the tech yourself as much (or at all). It may mean you get interrupted more. That&#x27;s may or may not annoy you, but you need to make the best choices you can for your team now, not (just) for you.<p>Share success when you can. You may find yourself in situations where people attribute your team&#x27;s success to you... and while that&#x27;s not wrong (you&#x27;re the lead after all) it&#x27;s also a great opportunity to share credit with those in your team. It&#x27;s worth so much to people when you do this.<p>People are not interchangeable, and treating them as if they invites trouble. You can have great people, who still have a hard time working together for whatever reason. Be aware of inter-team dynamics; they can sink you. (Situations like this are why it&#x27;s great to have a mentor.)<p>It&#x27;s important to keep a close eye on how things are going, but don&#x27;t confuse that with micro-management. Your best people are going to want some autonomy, and it&#x27;s best for everybody if you find a way to give it to them. If things aren&#x27;t going so well your instinct may be to tighten your grip... not necessarily wrong, but consider that may come across as a lack of trust on your part.<p>Above all: think of your job as less about being in control (though you may be) and more about fostering an environment where your team can do your best work. Get them what they need, shield them from the crap, give them what opportunities you can. Don&#x27;t be selfish or mean.

Read over these notes often enough that you are aware of those things when they happen again. Anecdote: Developers often want time to create a quality feature and if they are frequently pressed for time due to business requirements, they are unhappy and the product suffers, often in less than obvious ways. It was only really obvious that this was a problem when we tried other ways of planning and prioritizing because the assumption was that development pressure was a given for a tech company, turns out that some development work can be offloaded by better planning and prioritization based upon better thought out business objectives.

Planning and collaboration doesn’t come as naturally for most engineers, and becomes increasingly important the higher level that you go.  This is because large software isn’t built by one person that goes all Superman and codes it in isolation; larger software is done in collaboration.<p>1. Collaboration is key:<p>1a. When there are differences in opinion on how to implement something, your desired outcome is that the right thing happens for the company, and that everyone feels like their opinion was heard and legitimately considered. You don’t want to alienate even the most junior engineers even if you have absolute power over them.<p>1b. You need a good relationship with your business partners&#x2F;customers, with your boss, and with your direct reports.  Make this a top priority.  Productivity improves drastically when the customer loves you. You need the upward, downward, and lateral relationships healthy because it’s crucial that you and your people feel safe to talk about the truth and work on solutions together. Counter example: people don’t want to ask for help or talk about what they’re feeling uncomfortable about because they think they’ll be judged as incompetent or a problem child. It’s important that you don’t feel that way when talking to your customers or boss, and that your people don’t feel that way when talking with you and each other.  Foster a culture of love, respect, and acceptance to help with this.<p>1c. Pick your battles. Figure out for example when a design decision really matters strategically and when it can go either way. Give your people as much latitude as you can to give them a chance to learn from their mistakes.<p>I drone on here about collaboration because some of my larger failures in the last few years are because of running afoul of these ideas. Forgetting these ideas often leads to winning the battle but losing the war.<p>2. Constantly work to empower your people And figure out how they need to grow. Figure out their target growth areas, keep notes on those, give them opportunities to grow and learn in those areas. Watch how they do, and give them feedback every chance you get about what they did well and how they can do better.

Pushing back on management and being able to collect data to defend your position and support your proposal - that&#x27;s more difficult"],"time":["2020-02-07 16:12:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dillonmckay"],"id":[22256857],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["There was a good book, written my one of the first Facebook front-end devs, and she was also interviewed about this topic on an HBR Ideacast podcast...<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;the-challenges-and-triumphs-of-a-young-manager\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;the-challenges-and-triumphs-...<\/a><p><i>The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You<\/i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0735219567\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0735219567<\/a>"],"time":["2020-02-06 16:46:35"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tentam"],"id":[22265408],"kids":[22265424],"parent":[22255301],"text":["First ask yourself if you are the kind of person that enjoys serving others.

No ticket should go to an engineer without a basic review. (Edit: 2-3 minutes a ticket)<p>What are things that you should look for, before assigning a ticket to an engineer?<p>- Is the title and description coherent? Written in decent English (or whatever language your office uses.)<p>- Did whoever submit the ticket do an appropriate amount of troubleshooting for their role? (Or are they just trying to pass work off on your engineers?) Specifically, if this is a support escalation, did the submitter follow any troubleshooting steps that you&#x27;ve already documented?<p>- If this is a bug, do the steps to reproduce make sense?<p>- Do your processes require things like logs, screenshots, videos, ect? Are they present? (Edit: QE and support need to be trained on what kind of information to collect before passing a ticket to your team. Being a &quot;team player&quot; means holding other groups accountable for providing your engineers what they need to do their jobs.)<p>- Is this a duplicate of a well-known issue?<p>- Is the bug steered to your team appropriately, or should a different team take the first attempt?<p>- [Edit] Are there multiple bugs &#x2F; support requests in a single ticket? (I have a firm one-bug-per-ticket, or one-escalation-per-ticket rule. It just gets too confusing otherwise.)<p>The above shouldn&#x27;t take long. Specifically, during triage, you aren&#x27;t trying to <i>understand<\/i> the bug or escalation. You&#x27;re just making sure that whoever wrote the ticket put in enough knowledge that you&#x27;re comfortable handing it off to your team.<p>When a ticket doesn&#x27;t make sense, just send it back to whoever wrote it. You might need to meet with other managers to make sure that everyone understands what you need, and expect, prior to assigning work to your team.<p>The point is that you should be the filter blocking other teams from sending crap to your engineers. You can also involve your team members in triage, as long as your team members understand the difference between triage and actively working on a bug.<p>What happens when you don&#x27;t triage well? Bugs pile up on your team and don&#x27;t get solved. Some engineers will be good at asking for clarification for bad bugs, other engineers will just let them sit.<p>In this case, when tickets aren&#x27;t being resolved, the solution is to re-triage and send back poorly-defined tickets."],"time":["2020-02-06 20:08:56"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["qrush"],"id":[22256323],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["Read everything you can from Camille Fournier and consider attending (or at least watching all you can) the next LeadDev conference closest to you."],"time":["2020-02-06 15:47:37"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22263466],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-07 06:26:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["decentralised"],"id":[22258444],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["I&#x27;d recommend getting a mentor.<p>In my experience, it makes a world of difference when you have someone you can reach out to and bounce some ideas off of.."],"time":["2020-02-06 19:04:48"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["chrisweekly"],"id":[22256227],"kids":[22258609],"parent":[22255301],"text":["Read &quot;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;"],"time":["2020-02-06 15:36:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["njacobs5074"],"id":[22259674],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["As several other people have recommended, get a mentor.<p>If it&#x27;s company large enough that it has managers who primarily talk to other managers, you&#x27;re not going to be able to figure things out quickly enough to survive in that role.<p>Trust your team.

Help the business understand how your team&#x27;s successes impact ASP and churn rates.<p>Tell your team they hit the goal. Tell the organization your team hit the goal. Tell the organization where your team can see you telling the organization. Many engineers aren&#x27;t known for their salesmanship, and they can and should improve, but you can step in and rapidly build trust with them and the organization by selling their work on their behalf.<p>Instead of asking for time to fix tech debt, explain to the organization what the tech debt actually fixes: Reliability (churn), Operations&#x2F;Chores (COGS), Resistance to Future Change (ASP), Infrastructure Bills (COGS), App Performance (churn), and like that.<p>The weekly 30-minute O3 is your new best friend, especially with non-technical stakeholders. As a team lead, I usually meet with engineers every other week—you&#x27;re a team lead, not their manager.<p>Understand the differences between Accountability, Responsibility, and Authority. Responsibility is &quot;yup, we&#x27;re on it.&quot; Accountability means the business expects you to accept &quot;consequences&quot; for failure. Don&#x27;t accept Accountability without both Authority to make decisions and compensation for the job risk. More than likely someone else is accountable (an actual manager or maybe a product owner.) Engineers are too difficult to hire to be holding them accountable. As an ambitious founder-turned-tech-lead I bristle a bit at this, but at least you can be aware of how things are set up.<p>But this also means you&#x27;ll have limited authority, and you&#x27;ll have to achieve alignment rather than dictate solutions. Which brings me to:<p>Pre-wire meetings. If you need a decision to go your way, meet with each attendee individually first and get their feedback on your proposal. Don&#x27;t put together the meeting with everyone until you&#x27;re confident it&#x27;s a formality.<p>You can push back on processes that don&#x27;t work for you: too many meetings, scrum ceremonies, taps on the shoulder. &quot;I understand the importance of schedules and status updates to the business. My team needs protected time to achieve our best results. Will you help me batch our meetings into tighter windows so we&#x27;re able to both put in the work and keep the business informed on our progress?&quot;<p>Set up systems. Don&#x27;t take on all the chores yourself. Set up a schedule for a &quot;triage&quot; engineer, include yourself in the schedule. I like rotating out weekly. This engineer intakes all of the bugs&#x2F;questions&#x2F;fire drills and provides answers and verifies things aren&#x27;t on fire. They are assigned less critical tasks that week because they&#x27;ll be interrupted. This gets you protected time to think.<p>Set up engineering &quot;pairing office hours&quot; 4-5x a week. You&#x27;re not a manager: you still need to be on a Maker&#x27;s Schedule. Your engineers will need help and rubber duck sessions, but if you drop everything every time they ask or get stuck, you won&#x27;t ever be able to get in the zone yourself. Likewise, they&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re available to help.

Delegate. Have nothing to do.<p>This is not about being &quot;lazy&quot; or not doing &quot;actual work,&quot; it&#x27;s about giving autonomy to your team. If you do not delegate, your team will constantly be blocked by you and you will not retain them. If you delegate properly, and trust your team, it&#x27;ll feel like you (sometimes) have almost no job at all.<p>A pretty solid way to delegate, is to find out where people want to go next in their career, and offer up decisions&#x2F;work based on helping people get there. It also prevents #2 on my list...<p>2.) Do not horde work.<p>It&#x27;s shitty, I&#x27;ve done it, and learned from it. Every-fucking-time I accidentally did it, it sucked, it would (a) take forever because meetings can eat your life, (b) stress you out because of the time constraints, and (c) MOST IMPORTANTLY someone on my team would have benefited from, and enjoyed, doing the work more.<p>3.) Hire people smarter than you.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to hire people with more experience than you or who are &quot;smarter&quot; in some specific field of expertise than you.<p>You will learn so much by being open to others knowledge, your team will benefit even more by having other people able to guide&#x2F;mentor&#x2F;coach them.<p>4.) Blame process, not people.<p>When shit hits the fan, you should ALWAYS be cool as a cucumber. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the reason is, if someone pressed the wrong button, configured something badly, whatever it was cannot be undone.<p>What you need to do (AFTER) is a root cause analysis; I have always been a fan of the &quot;Five Whys&quot; but to each there own (you can probably google that to get started if its new to you or to find others). You can then implement, document it, and develop new process so that shit storm doesn&#x27;t happen again.<p>Just in case the focus here on process wasn&#x27;t clear, let me spell out the other part to be clear: do not every fucking blame your team. Do not ever blame an individual. You will fix nothing, and your team will grow to hate you as you toss people under the bus.<p>5.) Shit rolls down hill, it also rolls up hill, and you&#x27;re always stuck pushing it.<p>Depending on where you are in the org, this isn&#x27;t quite so heavy, but truthfully, as a manager&#x2F;lead the bullshit you weather for your team is what defines you. The more you prevent rolling downhill onto your team, and the more you prevent rolling uphill to your boss(es), the more loved you will be by both.<p>At some places, without bullshit densities strong enough to make a strange-quark, this won&#x27;t be an issue... At other ones, this will very likely be what keeps your bosses and your team happy in an otherwise (i.e. other departments) not-fun workplace.<p>6.) Be kind and be honest.<p>Don&#x27;t treat people like family. Treat them better. Families have bullshit, families hide things, families have history, families might be kind, but they can also be brutal. You also can&#x27;t fire your &quot;family,&quot; but you might have to your co-worker... So, just fucking don&#x27;t.<p>What to do instead? It turns out, when push comes to shove more than anything they want (a) honesty about the state of the company and their status, (b) to be communicated with kindly. Don&#x27;t yell at people, or talk about them behind their backs, don&#x27;t marginalize people or groups you don&#x27;t think are in the room (I cannot believe what some people will fucking say when they think &quot;no one&quot; is listening)...<p>And we all can have a bad day and maybe rudely reply to someone or do something not our best-selves, and in those situations you just gotta learn to proactively and meaningfully say &quot;I am sorry.&quot; It&#x27;s even good for you if people find out you did, because it means you&#x27;re not an asshole, and again they&#x27;ll trust you more.<p>The best will be when people give you that same respect because you&#x27;ve set the standard and they want to uphold it...<p>7.) Your title doesn&#x27;t mean anything, your experience does, it is the real investment here and completely defined by what you do and how much you put into it.<p>8.) If it truly fucking sucks, leave. Don&#x27;t be afraid to jump shit; with a &quot;lesser title.&quot; See #7 again, as long as you&#x27;ve done it right, you&#x27;ll very likely be getting paid more anyway :)"],"time":["2020-02-07 03:11:38"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nhumrich"],"id":[22263614],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["A must read: peopleware"],"time":["2020-02-07 07:06:31"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jiveturkey"],"id":[22258053],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["fake it til you make it<p>- not kidding"],"time":["2020-02-06 18:25:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["fadifrancis"],"id":[22262226],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["very interesting advice here. thanks y&#x27;all"],"time":["2020-02-07 02:04:26"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jbarbosa"],"id":[22268674],"kids":[22344044],"parent":[22255301],"text":["Recently, I&#x27;ve been in charge of Growth at Whitesmith. For the last months I can pretty much resume everything to talking with everyone. Not only it will give you insights where you should go, but it will also help your team to solve their pains and frustrations and they will naturally grow and follow your lead.<p>So, a few (sorry, not that few) notes:<p>* Too much information around\nYou will feel lost in a sea of information. There&#x27;s an infinite number of posts, blogs, threads talking about tech lead. You will want to read everything before doing any action. However, it&#x27;s impossible, and you&#x27;ll quickly feel overwhelmed with all that info.<p>* Listen your team and know their pains\nMore than knowing everything about tech lead, what&#x27;s really important is to know your team and where you&#x27;re going. 1on1&#x27;s with everyone will bring the knowledge for that. They will tell you their frustrations and pains. These will be the first insights on where to start your job.<p>* Delegate and communicate\nJust because you&#x27;re not coding, it doesn&#x27;t mean you are not working. To me, that was a big issue. So, in order to sort it I try to communicate regularly so that the team has visibility of what I&#x27;m doing. Also, most of the times you will have too much on your plate. Feel free to delegate. I&#x27;m pretty sure that you will have volunteers for certain areas (in my case, infrastucture, front-end,...)<p>* Iterate fast\nIterate and fail fast. One of the biggest pains I felt was the fear of releasing something which was not perfect or that I was not secure of. However, it will never be perfect. Your team is not like any other team described in blogposts. Teams are always different, which mean different approaches. Instead of waiting too long for releasing something almost perfect, release, fail and improve more often. Be aware that if you iterate once each quarter, at the end of the year you have 4 iterations and 4 data points. If you iterate monthly you will have 12 iterations. Way more precision to fine tune your team.<p>* Are we engineers, or are we humans? (terrible pun with The Killers song)\nEach person of your team is different, each one of them has a different life with different problems. We all have our own different battles in life and sometimes we need to spend energy and focus on other things rather than work. Keeping that in mind some are more shy, some not. Some will think that they own you something, that they are behind schedule and hurting the team. Usually these people won&#x27;t feel comfortable about talking their pains. Be their leader and help them. Actively listen each one, give them space and support when necessary.<p>* Align expectations\nMake sure that there&#x27;s a common goal, and that everyone understands it in a crystal clear way. At Whitesmith, more than knowing how to master a couple of techs, our team must be critic about the product. Our good engineers will then find the best tools for the job and then you can step in to define boundaries on which tech is better for that specific problem. But it depends a lot on the company. Question yourself what&#x27;s your most common project type and what&#x27;s your best set of tools. Do you want to be really good at just that? Or do you prefer to be more flexible and allow other tools? Define standards, some role models of your team so that people know where the team is going and consequently where they are going too. It kind of reminds me of Ryanair. All planes are 737 to minimize differences, processes and overall complexity.<p>* Growth aka learning, enineering manager, space for your team to improve\nGive your people space to grow. Try to find time for them to learn something new. However, it&#x27;s also important to find a place for this knowledge to be applied. Learning without a purpose and not being able to apply it regularly, seems to be almost as furstrating as not growing at all.<p>Sorry for the long post. A lot of things coming to my mind atm. Feel free to reach out and disagree. That&#x27;s actually what I do as a tech lead with my team. Also, I&#x27;ve been told the book &quot;The Phoenix Project&quot; is a really nice read for tech leads.<p>All the best!"],"time":["2020-02-07 18:53:25"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["tikiman163"],"id":[22266830],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["I have a few pieces of advice. The general theme, always focus on making other people successful, and make sure things are meaningfully organized with both current and future team members in mind.<p>1. Checklists make everything easier. What needs to be in the checklists should be the most common issues that come up during code review or have been related to defects that made it past the dev environment.<p>2. Good agile documentation means all business rules&#x2F;application behavior requirements should be in the story&#x2F;task and in a centralized wiki. This makes it possible for new team members to familiarize themselves with application behavior quickly, and that list of behaviors is also the documentation on what needs to be tested so QA can implement integration and regression tests.<p>3. Every major code review needs an organized explanation of code changes per business rule. I&#x27;ve got my team using a OneNote where they initially write down each stories business rules at a high level for non-technical people in a list format and add sub items that describe an architectural overview of changes like design patterns and technologies used, and an addition sub level briefly describing code changes. I also have them provide links to an articles they used to make decisions or that describe design patterns used rather than needing to rewrite them. This rarely takes longer than an hour for a large story and it provides a semantic map between business logic and technical terminology for non-technical people and a sort of historical stream of consciousness that can be looked back at to get a feel for the history and direction for a given project.<p>4. Assess how team members are doing with technologies they use and get them whatever training they need.<p>5. No matter how experienced a developer might be before they join your team, new team members should always start out by getting the project to run and fixing bugs. Expecting too much too fast is a guaranteed way to lose high quality talent.<p>6. Always keep your ego out of everything and if someone is getting defensive about code, remind them that there is no such thing as perfect code. There is always room for improvement, and the focus on any changes or development&#x2F;architectural decisions must always be about the potential future cost of each decision. Principals like Dry and Solid are important, but over implementing them will always result in difficult to maintain code. Abstraction is only good if it doesn&#x27;t lock you into a design pattern that might not apply to the future state of all application behaviors you might need in the future. Also, reflection based code is cool to implement and a huge pain to get right let alone maintain or update.<p>7. Always beware implementing anything you&#x27;re excited about. Code should always be focused on efficiency and maintainability, never on how cool or familiar a specific tool is. This is sort the same as keeping your ego out, but more about keeping your excitement out of things.<p>8. Developers should talk to customers, and logging should be implemented in ways that enable analyzing feature usage and user feedback. Many feature request come from managers, but the end users are the people that really need to feel like your software improves their lives.<p>9. Beware any list that has a psychologically pleasing number of items because it is definitely padded out or shortened to reach that number."],"time":["2020-02-07 16:27:01"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":{},"id":[22256525],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":{},"time":["2020-02-06 16:13:46"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":[true],"dead":{}},{"by":["ikaria1234"],"id":[22260113],"kids":{},"parent":[22255301],"text":["Listen"],"time":["2020-02-06 21:46:50"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":[true]},{"by":["jacquesm"],"id":[22258270],"kids":[22258322],"parent":[22255301],"text":["I&#x27;d refuse.

I started\nworking professionally in the industry in the late 1980s.  Since that time, I regret to say\nthat the people who hire we software engineers don&#x27;t see us as anything but factory labor.<p>To wit:<p>- We&#x27;ve evolved into a world with &quot;Agile&quot;, which our paymasters have defined\n    as the equivalent of warehouse&#x2F;factory&#x2F;shop floor process.  Each engineer is\n    &quot;the same&quot;; thus, swappable;<p>- In this view of the world, the only valuable thing to do is the tiny little\n    sliver of work in front of you.  Spending time on anything related\n    to real engineering is verboten.  When you&#x27;re eventually asked why the application\n    is slow, producing work faster isn&#x27;t possible, or new features are difficult\n    to implement, your &quot;technical&quot; answers about &quot;the code&quot;, &quot;the design&quot;, and&#x2F;or\n    the &quot;architecture&quot; are derided as &quot;lazy work&quot; and &quot;not valuable&quot;.  We\n    just don&#x27;t understand &quot;the business&quot;;<p>- Since you&#x27;re a factory laborer now, and there is no expectation that you\n    must &quot;think&quot; to do this job, the notion that you require privacy is laughable.\n    &quot;The business&quot; does not give the shop floor guys privacy, why should they give\n    it to <i>you<\/i>?  Oh, and how long do you suppose it will be before you must\n    ask <i>permission<\/i> to use the bathroom?  Just like factory workers;<p>- Since you obviously don&#x27;t need to &quot;think&quot;, after all you just have to crank\n    out that next ticket&#x2F;card&#x2F;story, then being interrupted isn&#x27;t an issue.  As\n    the foreman of a factory floor, I can reallocate my &quot;resources&quot; however I see\n    fit.  After all, they&#x27;re all assembling the same &quot;widget&quot;, right?<p>- If you&#x27;re lucky enough to <i>not<\/i> be in the physical fish bowl of the modern\n    software engineering shop floor, then you&#x27;re expected to be tethered to some\n    god awful chat client.  Again, what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t complicated, right?\n    You don&#x27;t have to plan.  You don&#x27;t need to design.  You don&#x27;t need to think.\n    That&#x27;s what all the tools, and frameworks, and geegaws they spend big money\n    on are for!  So if you get pinged constantly by 20 different people for 8 hours --\n    and <i>your<\/i> work isn&#x27;t getting done -- there is something wrong with <i>you<\/i>;<p>- If you <i>are<\/i> unlucky enough to be in the fish bowl itself, then being interrupted\n    now includes both the <i>physical<\/i> and <i>virtual<\/i>;<p>- Meetings are what &quot;the business&quot; does and what we do isn&#x27;t important, obviously.\n    So whatever &quot;top of the stack&quot; issue is critical to them at any given\n    moment in time overrides any worthless thing you might be doing.<p>The simple truth is that software engineering is a low prestige career in the majority\nof companies.

The string format bug has the most entertainment value for me -&gt; You can spew CDP packets into a switch&#x2F;device which potentially overwrite other devices CDP data, which means you could potentially issue a poweroff or change the name of said device.<p>5. The phone vulnerability is good too -&gt; If you can broadcast&#x2F;spew CDP from your host, you can be annoying to phones.<p>6. The cameras can only be harassed by plugging directly into it, rendering the vuln somewhat useless.<p>My takeaway is that you can&#x27;t easily escalate vlan privileges via CDP which is good, but you can def monkey with the controlplane and maybe someone will come up with a way to change the IOS configuration."],"time":["2020-02-07 01:01:24"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ga-vu"],"id":[22259729],"kids":[22263302,22259969,22260360],"parent":[22258837],"text":["They&#x27;re not zero-days if they&#x27;ve been privately disclosed and patches are available."],"time":["2020-02-06 21:02:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["kitteh"],"id":[22259586],"kids":[22259662,22263684],"parent":[22258837],"text":["Security best practices have always recommended disabling CDP in an untrusted environment (that applies to things like LLDP, too).

In their world view, the problem is always everyone else. It sounds more like you&#x27;re growing, and learning something about how your ego operates, which is a good sign.<p>The question is how to grow further in this direction. In my life, the thing that has helped the most with this so far is the practice of self-observation as taught by certain spiritual traditions. Here&#x27;s a brief summary: when you observe how you react to things internally, especially if you can observe it neutrally and without judgment, you begin to see a lot about how you&#x27;ve been treating other people and why. The magic is that it then changes on its own, without you having to do anything extra. Self-awareness and self-honesty are the only ingredients you have to add. That&#x27;s fortunate, because self-honesty is already a lot. We have a strong tendency to lie to ourselves, rationalize, and excuse nearly everything. On the plus side, the more that dissolves, the easier it gets to be with yourself. Self-observation is the solvent.<p>If this approach interests you, one thing you might take a look at is the books of Vernon Howard. (Don&#x27;t be put off by their titles. The contents are serious.) If you&#x27;re sincere about self-work, they provide the clearest explanation that I&#x27;ve run across. Self-observation is, of course, a classical spiritual teaching, but Howard distilled it into modern language in a way that is extremely direct and does not ask you to take on any belief (e.g. any religious belief). The main thing that makes his writing different from so much other self-help material is that he does not flatter or coddle the reader. He gives it to you straight.<p>I also agree with the commenters who suggest working with a therapist, because the ego behaviors you&#x27;re asking about are typically rooted in past painful experiences that created a need in us to armor ourselves against future pain. Self-work seems to require journeying back into those realms in order to heal. Then you can let go of your selfish behaviors because you just don&#x27;t need them anymore, just like you wouldn&#x27;t wear a heavy suit of armor once you no longer feel it&#x27;s necessary. What doesn&#x27;t work, in my experience, is trying to be less selfish only in a rational or ethical way. That approach amounts to imposing a censorship layer on top of what you actually feel, which is a form of self-deception which only puts more weight on you and eventually collapses.<p>The thing to watch out for in finding a therapist is the personal connection between you and them. The method matters less than the personal connection.<p>More generally, there are so many good suggestions in this thread that you should probably pick the ones that have the most energy for you and give them a try. Your sincerity is really the thing that will change this for you, so do what feels most inspiring."],"time":["2020-02-06 20:35:44"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["simonw"],"id":[22260244],"kids":[22260603,22260717,22261096,22260551],"parent":[22255268],"text":["I wonder if improv classes might help?

Similar to any kind of generalization... you assign a label to dehumanize them.<p>For example, some commonly associated traits ascribed to narcissism are a desire of power, status, or admiration from others; the the self-perception of being unique, and <i>a lack of empathy<\/i> for others. Now why would someone psychologically end up fixated on these traits? Well perhaps, they&#x27;ve been treated poorly and are dejected from others. They are on the receiving end of lack of empathy, are downtrodden, and abused. If they had power, status, admiration, or generally were treated well they wouldn&#x27;t feel like their ego&#x27;s were so fragile.

My personal conclusion is that it&#x27;s sort of a trait that you&#x27;re born with. I think it relates to a lacking ability to pick up on the subtle social cues that other people send out. Most people can read those signals pretty well, while others cannot. I think, if you cannot read the subtle signals that people are sending out, and if you cannot intuitively pick up on how other people feel, then neither can you respond or react to it in an adequate manner. These are my thoughts after dealing with the said type of personality for quite some years now.<p>If it&#x27;s at all treatable, I&#x27;d suggest training yourself in picking up on the subtler types of social cues and signals that other people send out.

Like you, I&#x27;ve had trouble with interacting with people.<p>The first thing I can suggest is finding a few people with whom you can confide your position, are supportive with wanting to see you be a better person, and willing to give you guidance.

But, I&#x27;m honest with people about it.  My friends and colleagues know this about me.  I tell them, &quot;Just FYI, I have a hard time picking up cues.  Please, just be very direct with me because I really want to help and see people are happy.&quot;  My myopic natural can also be a feature: I&#x27;m willing to dig down into problems and really understand why something isn&#x27;t working right.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me to laser focus on a difficult problem.  Long ago I was taught that every personality trait can be positive or negative depending on how it is used.

They thrive on both negative and positive attention. This is called narcissistic supply. Narcs need a constant supply to keep their egos inflated. It&#x27;s like oxygen to them.<p>* They will utilize a variety of tactics to entangle new forms of supply and keep them confused and entrapped. These tactics include:<p>- Love bombing (Constant praise, stroking your ego, constant attention)<p>- Mirroring (You like snowboarding? I like snowboarding! you like video games? I like video games!)<p>- Projection (You&#x27;re going to cheat&#x2F; steal&#x2F; lie, meanwhile they are doing exactly those things to you. They will accuse you of these things first to muddy the waters when you eventually catch on to their behavior)<p>- Word salads (complete nonsense, logical fallacies out of their mouths to confuse you when talking or arguing)<p>- Extreme mischaracterization or exaggeration of what you&#x27;ve said<p>- Moving goalposts (I&#x27;ll start helping with chores when my minor injury heals when I&#x27;m less stressed when it&#x27;s spring etc)<p>- Conditioning (Like pavlovian training: if you&#x27;re in a good mood doing a certain activity they will start an argument to soil your association with that activity)<p>- Gaslighting (I didn&#x27;t say I liked video games, you must have misunderstood me)<p>- Name calling and aggressive criticism (Usually disguised as a joke or with a &quot;Just kidding!&quot;)<p>- Triangulation or Flying Monkeys (using a third party to torment you further)<p>- Discard &#x2F;devaluation (Once you&#x27;ve caught onto them, or they&#x27;ve found a better source of supply you will be ignored or spoken about in condescending terms)<p>* Narcissists cannot truly generate happiness of their own, so they try to leech it from others and hate them for their ability to generate happiness<p>* Extended contact with a narcissist can lead to CPTSD<p>* Narcissists cannot change because they do not want to change since they see nothing wrong with their behavior.<p>In short, all of this advice to read a book, join a club, start a family, etc is useless for a narcissist. Also, narcissists are highly resistant to therapy. They rarely check themselves in and they only time they end up in front of a therapist is for something unrelated to their narcissism.<p>If you meet one run."],"time":["2020-02-06 22:46:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["_zamorano_"],"id":[22259999],"kids":{},"parent":[22255268],"text":["Just by asking the question you&#x27;ve already done half of the work.
