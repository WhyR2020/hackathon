There&#x27;s plenty of ex-Googlers at Facebook, including Sheryl Sandberg, who essentially built Facebook from &quot;a really cool site&quot; to the profitable ad business it is now.<p>Google bought YouTube in 2006, and now it&#x27;s a huge economy of content creators. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, and it&#x27;s now a growing economy of influencers. There&#x27;s plenty of differences of course, but in the ad-tech space it&#x27;s Google then Facebook, in Machine Learning it&#x27;s Google and Facebook. What big companies are releasing cool open source software, adopted by millions of developers? Google and Facebook.<p>Miss-information, hate speech, political controversy and issues with publishers? Facebook and Google&#x2F;YouTube. In terms of data-tracking only Google is comparable to Facebook— or rather only Facebook is comparable to Google? Virtually complete dominance of a key-part of the web? Google and Facebook. Number of users? I could argue only Android and Facebook are at point where they have to provide free internet to people to gain more users. Diversification into hardware? First Google, then Facebook.<p>The list goes on. Facebook is (perhaps too ruthlessly, and &quot;breaking too many things&quot;) largely another &quot;Google&quot; in many ways. Not sure if this is what the prediction was getting at, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about.<p>&gt; Google will be the Microsoft of the decade.<p>Right now it feels like this is happening. Right now, Google is ubiquitous and feels unbeatable like Microsoft. It also has (1) platform dominance in web and OS and key services, (2) an incredibly diverse set of products and (3) anti-competitive behavior stemming from this dominance. It also has (4) a thick layer of middle-management fighting for relevance leading to (5) lots of product churn, worsened by (6) lack of focus due a &quot;vision&quot; vacuum in upper-management.<p>I&#x27;d suspect the next few years without Page or Brin will be interesting. It&#x27;ll also be interesting to see if Google 1. Can pull of hardware (Pixel was a good start, but the latest iteration has a lot of reviewers disappointed) 2. Can focus (Android, Chrome OS or Fuchsia? Will they commit to a messaging service?) and 3. Can deliver new products that stick.<p>&gt; Microsoft will be the IBM of the decade.<p>Up until Satya Nadella took over in 2014 and his changes started materializing later in the decade this largely sounded like it was the case— old stagnant company, held mostly by slow-to-change enterprise customers, and little in the way of new products.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1026088\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1026088<\/a>"],"time":["2020-01-03 08:14:08"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["bcaa7f3a8bbc"],"id":[21942781],"kids":{},"parent":[21936234],"text":["&gt; JulianMorrison on Jan 1, 2010: Ubiquitous mobile&#x2F;wireless internet integrated into even very trivial consumer goods, with close to 100% coverage across the civilized world.

Kotlin is the most popular backend language.<p>- Server-side rendering is ubiquitous. Previously, motivations for client side rendering were to minimise network bandwidth requirements and to avoid server-side statefulness, reducing RAM and CPU requirements. By 2030, memory and compute resources are so cheap that the inherent advantages of server side rendering make it a no brainer for the most part.<p>- Discovery of extraterrestrial life will occur in mid to late 2020s, most likely in the form of Martian microbes. The James Webb Space Telescope will likely acquire strong evidence of organic lifeforms on multiple exoplanets. Even more surprising discoveries may be made in this area.<p>- Anti aging therapies become mainstream. By 2030, people in developed countries can expect to live an additional 10-15 years in good health. Reaching &#x27;actuarial escape velocity&#x27; becomes a serious possibility for many people alive now. Governments realise the time will come when they will have to step in and bail out pension funds who have unwittingly sold annuities. There will be a group of people who were old enough to get an annuity before they became prohibitively expensive&#x2F;unavailable and who were young enough to reach actuarial escape velocity. They will be labelled &#x27;the luckiest generation ever&#x27;. This may not become totally apparent until 2030s or 2040s.<p>- Real time ray tracing becomes standard by late 2020s. Games are indistinguishable from reality. A murder case where defendant claims &#x27;they thought they were ingame&#x27; makes the news headlines.<p>- Spacex&#x27;s Starlink constellation is a massive commercial success. Partly due to this, and partly due to ubiquitous aerial drone-based delivery, it becomes not only possible, but increasingly desirable for many people to live in remote areas.<p>- Development of space based industry is slower than people hoped. Full exploitation of cheap launch capabilities provided by SpaceX won&#x27;t be seen until 2030s. Blue Origin will catch up with Spacex&#x27;s capabilities by mid 2020s. Private space launch industry will no longer be a one horse race.<p>- Electric cars overtake ICEs in developed nations. Several incumbents who don&#x27;t react in time will go bankrupt and be acquired by electric car manufacturers. As such, the brands won&#x27;t disappear, the executive boards however will be out of a job.<p>- Cryptocurrency will remain off the radar for most of 2020 until, due to major war involving a wealthy, developed country, millions of people will rush to buy Bitcoin to save what they can of their wealth. Price of one Bitcoin will quickly exceed $100,000 during this period.<p>- People will become increasingly afraid to post their physical likeness (appearance and voice in particular) on the internet due to a surge in deep-fake powered identity theft.<p>- North Korea will not collapse. The West will reluctantly accept it as a nuclear armed state. It will gradually normalise relations with the outside world and may even follow the same path China took, becoming a prosperous country in the process."],"time":["2020-01-03 04:20:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["dgzl"],"id":[21942483],"kids":[21943038],"parent":[21936234],"text":["I think the country is going to become very, very divided."],"time":["2020-01-03 03:26:43"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["stretchwithme"],"id":[21943054],"kids":[21943271],"parent":[21936234],"text":["I predict by 2029 Hacker News will be overrun with AI bots and nobody will be to identify them."],"time":["2020-01-03 05:06:41"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["pezo1919"],"id":[21945353],"kids":{},"parent":[21936234],"text":["Rise of Dependent Types in general purpose programming: eg.

Whitehead&#x27;s three stages involve a period of romance, becoming acquainted to a subject and knowledge, precision, systematically learning the facts connected with the subject introduced in the romance period, and, lastly, generalization, where facts are used to create new theory and independent thought by the student beyond what is known. Whitehead explains that this isn&#x27;t a linear process, like our current approach to education, but rather cyclic.<p>Using less summative assessment, like standardized tests based on grade level, to compare students and set the rate of learning based on the mean of a group of children, instead, diagnostic and formative assessment using technology, like what we have seen with the Khan Academy, will be widely used to assist in the difficult often boring stage of precision giving teachers more time to introduce students new subjects and lead them to use their knowledge to make generalizations.<p>My prediction is the end of standardized tests at the grade level by 2030.

Reality becomes mediated through video, not 3D graphics.<p>This is analogous to all the technical components for social networks being there in 1993 (BBSes, Prodigy, CompuServe, AOL, etc.), but Facebook didn&#x27;t exist until 2004.  And in 2010 people and businesses still needed websites -- the web was still growing like crazy 20 years later.<p>YouTube was acquired in 2006, Twitch was acquired in 2014, and there will be another big acquisition of a video company in the 2020&#x27;s.  (I hesitate to say that a video company will become bigger than Google or Facebook, but maybe.)<p>(BTW I followed the link to lesswrong, and someone predicted &quot;videoconferencing&quot; as a 2010&#x27;s technology, and I think that was pretty accurate.

As I noted in the update to my comment, there will be &quot;big data and compute&quot; on the edge of the network, i.e. the data plane.

Computation and data won&#x27;t be as centralized as they are with AWS, but &quot;the cloud&quot; will still be dominant.<p>- Self-driving cars won&#x27;t impact the average consumer in the next 10 years.  It will continue to be cheaper to operate rideshares with human drivers in most parts of the world and most terrains&#x2F;climates.  It will make sense for commercial applications though.<p>- Addendum: Even though IoT products are widely mocked now, and for good reason, I think the trend is inevitable.  Automation is economically valuable and technologically feasible.<p>The IoT tech stack improve and many useful new applications will be found.  There will still be security concerns and thus some significant holdouts.

Batteries (and chargers) become cheap and smaller. This changes a lot of things about small and large gadgets, from watches to buses. Again, already happening, but at 1&#x2F;2th of the cost and size things are a lot more interesting.<p>3. Internet access becomes fast and cheap everywhere. Speed-wise we are already there with 4G, we just need more coverage and 1&#x2F;2th or 1&#x2F;4th the price.<p>Consequences of this technology:<p>- We no longer have wifi in our homes. Consumer cables for data further than 1m away becomes obsolete. Since batteries are a lot better, this also removes the need for permanent cables almost everywhere. No more cabled headphones, power tools, etc.<p>- Energy also becomes decentralized. Except for the larger buildings that still need external energy, it becomes a no-brainer to have a large cheap battery and solar panels in your home. The battery might be part of your car.<p>- Paper stops making sense. For $30 you can get a tablet or e-reader on the restaurant that is also translated and has pictures, so no one keeps those paper-printed menus. Servers only deliver food and clean the table, for now. This happens across all industries.<p>- As labor drops, real state becomes even more important in EU and Asia.

We may see the rise of fully custom car culture, and an uproar over safety.<p>* This decade&#x27;s AI, or, compute-assisted task completion usage will rise. Custom physical&#x2F;virtual interfaces will be created to satisfy any task. Jobs will be lost. Nothing will be done, except the occasional per institution protest. Other jobs will be created, but I can&#x27;t predict what industries will crop as a result of it.<p>* The Four Horsemen of the Infopocolypse will continue to be referenced against any form of privacy or encryption. No progress will be made on either front, and certain individuals in power will continue to treat any sort of encryption as villain-tier behavior.<p>* Web and JavaScript (and all related technologies) will continue to grow and dominate. Chromebooks just came out too early. 2020-2030 we will see compelling browser-only experiences.<p>* Compute could become commoditized or even converted to a utility. Everything between &#x27;local RAM&#x27; and &#x27;cloud RAM&#x27; will be abstracted away. With the rise of custom chips, we will see even better virtualization technologies rise. Computers will drift towards compute-less terminals."],"time":["2020-01-03 03:19:49"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["mv4"],"id":[21942506],"kids":[21942676],"parent":[21941278],"text":["1. some cloud services (storage, delivery&#x2F;CDN) are completely free.<p>2.

(70% - the electric transition will not be nice to them.)<p>The car dealer system will undergo major changes in the USA.  (60% - car dealers and manufacturers are at odds on electric vehicles and manufacturers tied down by car dealer laws are at a major disadvantage against companies without car dealers.  Such as Tesla and companies that will try to enter from elsewhere like NIO from China.)<p>The EU monetary union will collapse.  (70% - An economic union is only sustainable in the long-run with political union, and there is no appetite for political union.  The result is growing tension between savers like Germany and debtors like Greece, Italy and Spain.)<p>The UK&#x27;s economic growth post-Brexit will exceed the EU as a whole.

(30% - SpaceX is the only one who can and a lot has to go right for them to succeed.  But the vision is realistic and out there - it is now mostly a question of when.)<p>Facebook no longer is or owns the dominant social network.  (30% - the value of a social network scales like O(n log(n)) but Facebook recognizes this and is doing a good job of buying competitors.  Eventually they will fail.)<p>College tuition no longer outpaces inflation, and the ending of this trend will be tied to a financial crisis.  (30% - Stein&#x27;s law says, &quot;If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.&quot;  However there are two corollaries by Stuart Stanisford, &quot;It will go on a lot longer than we think,&quot; and &quot;It will end badly when it does stop.&quot;  The first is why I think that it has a good chance of not happening this decade. \n But the second captures the fact that behavior won&#x27;t be likely to change without a crisis.

It might come back, but check back in ~30 years when everybody has gigabit or better.<p>2. One of the big public cloud companies either stops doing public cloud stuff or that business unit gets acquired, and I think the victim will be GCP.

Some nasty new nasty, globally-agreed-upon legislation comes out that effectively cripples cryptocurrency for legitimate uses.

Valve leads with the &quot;cadillac&quot; PC-connected enthusiast hardware. No major quantum leaps - quality slowly improves, but no full dive or anything like that. At least one AAA game is released VR-exclusive and posts good sales numbers.<p>7. Full legalization of cannabis for recreational uses finally happens. One or two states hold out and keep it illegal or greatly restricted within their borders, but most states notice the tax revenue being left on the table and finally relent, and as more and more states decriminalize or legalize, the federal ban is finally lifted with surprisingly little fanfare. It becomes common to see cannabis products in convenience stores right next to cigarettes.<p>8. Solar continues to improve and gets ridiculously cheap.

More consumer robots, more fancy variants of cleaner robots.<p>2. Autonomous cars will be there, at least simple variants which work under some constraints (e.g. highway). (I think this is level 3 or 4, not sure how these levels are defined.)<p>3. More world-wide conflicts, because of politics, and also because of climate change. I&#x27;m optimistic that a world war will not happen, but it will become worse and worse.<p>4. The deep learning hype grows rate slows down a bit. Custom hardware becomes more important, as we are currently hitting the ceiling with computing power, which will not grow as much exponentially as it has before. Custom hardware will first focus on making existing models cheaper and faster to run (think of TPU), but at some later point also lead to different models and learning algorithms (Neuromorphic chips).<p>5. Speech recognition is a solved thing, more or less. The focus will shift towards embedding a speech recognition system&#x2F;model into some bigger system, like an assistant, i.e. with parts like natural language understanding&#x2F;processing, dialog systems, etc, and that will be more like an end-to-end system, not so much separated anymore. I.e. one big neural network for everything. Maybe in the beginning parts of it (like the speech part) are trained individually, or in a pretraining scheme. Current heuristics and hardcoded rules will go away and be replaced by neural solutions.<p>6. Meta reinforcement learning will become more important, and bigger more general neural networks. Generality means that they will solve multiple tasks at once, similar to the dialog system I outlined, but this trend will also follow in other domains. It will all go into the direction of AGI (which basically is exactly that: an AI which is (more) general), but not reach it fully yet. Meta RL will also go along side with online&#x2F;continual learning, and being able to learn new things at inference time. There will be stable basic models &#x2F; learning algorithms which can be easily plugged into some system as a building block, and it can be treated like a black box and will mostly work (think about AlphaZero or MuZero but more advanced, more general, almost no hyper params to tune, all automatically). Meta RL will also solve sample efficiency to some degree.<p>7. Much more electric cars, maybe being the majority.<p>8. Not much people will care about Bitcoin anymore.

Also, the Pre and Post exposure drugs will probably become efficient for infections older than 48 hours. The things with HIV&#x2F;AIDS research is that a discovery on one end of the disease yields results on all of them in a short amount of time.<p>2) Populism and nationalism will start to die out because gen X and Z are brought up in a more data-available world. They&#x27;ll probably have a more Hans Rosling&#x2F;Steven Pinker attitude towards the world than a Trump&#x2F;Johnson one.<p>3) Ethiopia will become the powerhouse of the continent, prompting migration from all over. If an open and&#x2F;or tolerant attitude is kept towards neighbors, it might generate a ripple effect across the whole region - an effect consisting in stability. That&#x27;s what Israel could&#x27;ve done if a dual-state solution was obtained, or Iran if the CIA hadn&#x27;t generate a coup to remove the democratic prime minister because BP Oil couldn&#x27;t buy cheap resources anymore. I really hope no one fucks up this time.<p>4) Poorer countries will outpace the more developed ones in terms of digital governance, administration and bureaucracy since they&#x27;ll start implement administrative reforms with the current available tools that have the power to reach anyone - which are all online. Current administrations from developed countries still need to overcome the integration nightmare of current systems.<p>5) Public photography and filming will get intensely regulated worldwide as the laws haven&#x27;t been adapted to the smartphone era as well as the digital privacy era. For example: currently, photographers are allowed to snap photos of you in public without asking for consent in most of the countries. Then they sell them off for 100 dollars on Getty Images.

On top of that, these governments have no incentive to mitigate the gathering of personal data by companies as they will want access to it as well for political reasons (domestic as well as international mass surveillance provides a big strategic advantage in the context of this cyber cold war).<p>There are many other reasons why I think these problems are being exacerbated but I have tried to summarise what I think are (and will continue to be) the main ones."],"time":["2020-01-03 12:42:00"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["sawyerjhood"],"id":[21942580],"kids":{},"parent":[21941278],"text":["* VR will never become mainstream, but will get an addicting online killer app that will pull in &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers (like WoW was in the 2000&#x27;s)<p>* Multiple companies will publish consumer AR headsets at around the price of a high end cellphone.

I thought maybe something bitcoin would have been it, in 2010s, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s come to pass yet. These companies will become HUGE, bigger than Google by 2040.<p>- UI development in the browser and browser based technologies will be dominated by one framework, and we will stop seeing new frameworks every other month. Think Qt but with web technologies. Performance afforded by native applications will still not be a priority for all but the biggest apps.<p>- Java will continue to be dominant in terms of market share, and JVM will be continue to be huge on the server side. In fact, Java will supersede Scala and Kotlin in terms of the most important features. As in it will have the best parts of both the languages, but designed better.<p>- There will be huge progress in developer tooling for machine learning. Just as how you can do `npm install`, run docker containers, and virtual machines very well, without knowing anything about how it works, you will be able to train and use &quot;good enough&quot; models without knowing how machine learning works. AutoML is just the start, I&#x27;m thinking the stereotypical 17 year old hacker who gets into JavaScript today as their first technology, will instead be getting into Machine Learning based stuff by 2030.

It&#x27;s been a long time (&gt; 75 years) since there has been a big crisis. By the beginning of 2030, we will start to see the sparks of another crisis. It may either be the biggest global recession ever, or something worse.<p>India related:<p>- The government in power will continue to be nationalist through this decade (though not necessarily the current party &#x2F; leaders), however more secular than it is right now.<p>- There will be at least one startup from India whose product will be used widely around the world.<p>- There will be economic and infrastructural gains, but by the end of the decade, it will still feel meh.<p>- At least one place in India will get hit very, very hard by something caused due to climate change."],"time":["2020-01-03 04:36:36"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["nilgate"],"id":[21945068],"kids":{},"parent":[21941278],"text":["- Plant based foods will be ubiquitous and largely replace meats.<p>- Electric cars will take a large share of roads, although traditional combustion engines will still be very common.

The sea levels will rise at an increasing rate.<p>- World will still be dependent on fossil fuels for its energy source, although coal will share a much smaller percentage of that then today as dirty industries move to natural gas. Renewables and nuclear will continue to increase in the share, but still in the minority compared to fossil fuels.<p>- US becomes more isolationist in world policy as it increasingly faces the inward challenges of multiple nationwide health epidemics that will cripple the country (drug abuse, rising healthcare costs, aging population, mental&#x2F;behavior health illnesses, poor healthcare education, obesity, diabetes).<p>- China will lead the world in wireless technology and data processing infrastructure.

U.S. reassures its allies but when push comes to shove, fails to intervene, sending out a signal to those remaining in the alliance that they lack credible commitments.<p>4.

Japan, despite a historically strong public opinion against this class of weapon, may eventually do so as well although much of this will depend on how vulnerable it feels.<p>5.

Although enthusiasts will claim that it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll still suffer from the same useability problems that have it did in 2020, and 2010, and 2000. &quot;Oh there&#x27;s some stupid mouse behaviour which is making your GUI almost unusable? You can change it with this simple hack of X-windows in the shell.&quot;<p>- Social media will still suck, and will still be a vector for significant psyops, both political and commercial, with politically and economically destabilising effects. Dictatorships will be better at weilding this than democracies, which will still be on the backfoot.<p>- The climate crisis will still be going from bad to worse, unfolding as a series of localised extreme weather events and population displacements. Although the sociopolitical response to it will finally be turning the other direction.<p>What will change:<p>- The majority of vehicles sold will be full-electric.<p>- The way people live will be changing. A lot more co-ops, co-living, and even straight-up communes.

The past decade in a number of ways represented less of a change from a technological perspective than the several leading up to it, and I expect that will most likely continue.  The alternative would be a massive new technology that changes everything, like AGI, or possibly level 4&#x2F;5 self driving vehicles, but I don&#x27;t expect either of those are coming in the next 10 years.  Could be something else no one sees coming, but I doubt it.  So for now I think we&#x27;re on the tail end of an S-curve of change that has spanned several decades and numerous individual technologies.<p>So, specific predictions:<p>-fully driverless cars will see some limited use, perhaps with remote monitoring, but will not be ubiquitous.<p>-electric cars though will become very popular, with most new cars being electric.<p>-solar and wind installations will continue to grow.  We&#x27;ll probably see some innovation around distribution and metering as a result of electric vehicles and&#x2F;or renewables, like smart home panels that pause charging when load is high or renewable production is low, or even draw from the electric vehicle to provide supplemental power when necessary.  I doubt those things will be common in 10 years, but they&#x27;ll be at least talked about.<p>-AI will continue to have more niche applications, but will not result in major societal change or job loss.<p>-no country will meet the current Paris climate agreement thresholds.  However, climate change will widely be recognized as a serious problem.  Climate change denial will continue the shift from &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; to &quot;not caused by humans&quot;, and then to, &quot;even if caused by humans, nothing we can do&quot;.  However the denial side will carry less weight, and most first world governments will have implemented carbon taxes or other schemes to reduce greenhouse gasses.  We will be on course for &gt; 2 degrees of warming though.<p>-There will be presidents from both parties in the White House after Trump.<p>Generally I expect where there are large changes, they will be political&#x2F;geopolitical, not technological.  I expect some change to be driven by increasing polarization and by the pressures of climate change.

Looking back, they look subtle and not as drastic as we would imagine but I think the next 10yrs is when greater changes are going to happen.<p>Technology and Privacy\n- Rise of quality internet speeds. We have had slow jumps from 3g to 4g but the jump to 5g will be the first meaningful change in relation to internet speeds. It will be like jumping from 2g straight to 5g. This is dependent on telcos companies realising more people want good services.\n- Airtel exiting a few African countries. At least for Kenya, am calling it on Airtel quitting the market and we will have new entrants who will either buy airtel or new telcos will enter the scene.\n- Online e-commerce stores like Jumia will struggle. For Jumia specifically, I see them exiting or being bought with another company.\n- Increase in logistics companies will benefit more from intra-trade. \n- Apple will make its first big push in Africa. Having almost hit saturation point in china and India, it will be time for them to push into the African market launching official stores, introducing hackathons and pushing MacOs into the scene through promoting local made apps&#x2F;content.\n- Open source will be adopted more. Moving away from walled gardens like chrome in favour of firefox and even Linux gaining more users. A result of mistrust with current state of privacy.\n- Twitter will pivot, die or be bought \n- An African social media company will displace Facebook in Africa just like in Russia and China. If not, most countries will have their own thing going.\n- Self driving cars won’t enter the African scene. Maybe the next decade. Major infrastructure investments still need to be done to catchup. This will also affect other autonomous things like drones.\n- The decade of African unicorns  (private companies worth a billion dollars) \n- Intentional companies like uber, glovo,  amazon, KFC, etc will see a decline as people start adopting local&#x2F;African centric companies. \n- Fin tech startups are a bubble that will burst and die down this decade. \n- More foreigners will continue launching in Africa with massive financial backing but will have to move entire operations within the continent.\n- More African companies will let employees work from home\n- \n- Surveillance in Africa will take off. Street cameras, DNA, online, tracking of phone calls and chats. This will be pushed more by China and human rights problems will still be prevalent.\n- Africa will have the biggest cyber security risks with even more people adopting tech. \n- Blockchain will finally become useful as governments adopt it to increase transparency and efficiency.\n- One stable coin&#x2F; crypto currency will gain adoption for regional and intentional transfers displacing banks and mobile money.\n- Mobile money will still be huge but push from banks will mean more people will be banking and using mobile banking apps for transfers with service like Pesalink in Kenya gaining a lot of traction. Banks partnering might develop the tool for the point above this.\n- The dot com generation (born 1980 onwards according to me) will lead push in funding local startups with African venture capital companies starting up.<p>Politics and economy \n- All dictators will fall\n- Younger presidents will be elected (below 60yrs) in more counties \n- Rwanda will be in top 3 biggest economies in Africa by the end of the decade\n- Urban rural migration will reverse with more developments in outside towns\n- Like the rest of the world, Artificial intelligence use like deep fakes and fake news will wreck havoc and continue to be a big problem in politics especially during elections.\n- Airplane ticket prices will become affordable especially intentional to other African counties.\n- Moving around Africa will be flawless with more countries doing away with visas with East Africa becoming the single biggest market. This will face stiff competition with west African countries moving to single currency. I don’t think East Africa will push for single currency anytime soon. \n- A few African countries will sink into recession as they struggle to payback China. Infrastructure growth will slow down and we might see the return of the West into Africa as they try to gain favour with new projects\n- We will see less Made in China and more Made in (insert African country)\n- More international companies will transfer their ‘low level’ work force like companies into Africa Ethiopia as a leading example.<p>Religion &amp; culture \n- More Africans will shun religion with traditional and indigenous tribes being on their death bed. This might also lead to radicalised and extremist groups continuing to cause terrorism but eventually it will die down maybe in the next decade\n- Islam will be the only religion with an increase in followers by the end of the decade\n- FGM will be illegal in the entire continent \n- Same as early child marriages.<p>Energy and climate change\n- Increase in energy demands means alternative green energy will be main focus for African countries to keep up with energy demands. We will even see more data centres being setup in more African counties to serve more localised content. \n- I wont rule out African countries adopting old energy sources like coal. General thinking is we have had the least impact in effects of climate change. Other nations got rich through coal and oil. Why not us? I dont support the argument but it can’t be ruled out. \n- A new push for nuclear energy and at least 1 country joining the nuclear arms race.\n- Plastic bags will be banned in the entire continent.<p>Tourism &amp; entertainment \n- With climate change destroying more national parks, African countries will have to find new ways to sustain their economies away from tourism which might mean rise of theme&#x2F;amusement parks. Maybe Disney  <U+FE0F>\n- We will see more african artists breaking into the intentional scene and having the first African artist with a song with over a billion views in YouTube.\n- African made movies will enter the international scene doing world premieres.\n- E-sports will be huge with growing global trends."],"time":["2020-01-04 09:50:21"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cmehdy"],"id":[21947684],"kids":{},"parent":[21941278],"text":["1.

Surveillance increases throughout the world (in numbers of cameras, privacy-invading devices and techniques, changes in legislation, improvements in AI), as well as counter-measures to AI-powered tools (wearables&#x2F;clothes with specifically crafted noise to deceive detection algorithms, randomize gait, etc). Very little is won by people on the legislation front despite protests, since tracking ties in so well with advertising that there is enormous financial leverage and lobbying working on it.<p>3.

Still, the improvements don&#x27;t compare quite as much with Canada, the population of which increases at the highest rate in western countries thanks to immigration (including a lot of skilled workers), its increasingly better weather (one of the only relatively lucky countries facing climate change), and its bridge between US-UK-EU via new agreements (with UK and perhaps EU).<p>6.

Deep Fakes will <i>NOT<\/i> substantially alter public discourse or cause a widespread erosion of public trust. (0.78)<p>To be sure, there will definitely be a lot of hand wringing, particularly among older generations, but younger generations will quickly adjust the same way they adjusted to Photoshop. For the most part, nothing will change.<p>2. Machine Learning will become widely regarded as a dead end for real AI progress. (0.65)<p>This is already a non-niche opinion, but by the start of 2030, it will be the consensus of almost everyone in the field, and current claims about massive progress from systems like GPT-2 will be <i>widely<\/i> seen as hopelessly naive in hindsight.<p>3. Chrome will still be the dominant browser. (0.7)<p>No other browser will have passed Chrome in market share. This doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t be making progress, just that 10 years is not enough time for anyone to catch up.<p>4. Javascript will still be the dominant language on the web. (0.95)<p>WASM will open up a lot of interesting opportunities and make a lot of cool technologies possible. Most web devs will ignore it, and most web coding will still be done in Javascript. Sorry, Bernhardt.<p>5. PCs will still be around, people will still buy laptops. (0.9)<p>The mass migration to tablets and obsoletion of PCs that people have been talking about forever will still not have happened. The PC&#x27;s place as a non-niche, common consumer device will be reinforced by the continued rise of convertible laptops, which will make tablets less distinct and less attractive on metrics other than cost.<p>-----------------<p>Risky predictions<p>-----------------<p>6. Krita (specifically Krita) will become reasonably competitive with programs like Clip Studio. (0.35)<p>Krita will occupy the same space as Blender, in which it will be regarded by the general public as a similarly viable, serious contender with professional programs.<p>7. Matrix will become a defacto standard in the Open Source &amp; security community over platforms like Signal, Wire, etc... (0.3)<p>Interoperability and more open clients will cause a snowball effect. Platforms like Signal will still have better security, but that won&#x27;t matter. Everyone will recommend that you use Matrix purely because it works with everything, and will have good enough security for most things.<p>8. Apple will swallow its pride and make a convertible Macbook with a touchscreen. (0.4)<p>The argument that consumers widely don&#x27;t want touchscreens on Laptops will become impossible to defend. There will be a Macbook that has one, and it will probably be a convertible. The iOS and Mac OS merger may also happen, which will make iPads into a paired-down version of the Macbook, rather than a completely separate product.<p>---------------------<p>Out-there predictions<p>---------------------<p>9. Mastodon will become a &#x27;serious&#x27; Twitter competitor among the general public. (0.15)<p>Mastodon will not only still be around, and will not only still be usable for niche communities, it will be seen in the general, non-techy public as a reasonable alternative to Twitter, and Twitter will be forced to respond to it, particularly where younger generations are concerned.<p>10. Eating meat will be a political indicator.

For IT pros, some classic sysadmin skills - such as patching cables, administering RAID devices, physically ordering PC components and configuring PC operating systems- will become obsolete (because it gets also more complicated.

Network pollution caused by 5G and&#x2F;or similar. Average person will have their home littered with random appliance transmitters they have no awareness about.<p>5. Actually controlling what your computers do will be a more esoteric and in-demand skill.

There will be little organized response of the Western world to this, barring significant new popular movements in the US&#x2F;EU. Non-US NATO countries will be mostly left to their own devices, with some fear of criticizing China by private citizens.<p>3. Russia will be moving towards becoming a client state of China, possibly with subtle hints of warlord decentralization.<p>4. The populist camp in the West, depending on the country, will be either flirting with China or evolve towards a kind of McCarthyism (some hints of that in the GOP nowadays). The establishment camp will be battered by unpopular but kinda necessary policies around pension reform, climate change etc. It&#x27;s possible that a new camp based on the likes of Greens and Pirates, or something unquestionably leftist will gain viability.<p>5.

The impacts of climate change are felt not as a bang but as a cacophony of whimpers - severe weather events wipe billions from local economies in vulnerable areas, protracted recoveries and financial mismanagement in the wake of such disasters are the norm and not the exception as are ‘soft exits’ where there’s no real recovery at all and the area is left to rot with media being expertly manipulates into falling silent. With the right eye, most of the front page of any given newspaper will  become issues easily linked to the impacts of climate change. Reactions to this will be paradoxical - increased development of vulnerable areas (Miami, flood plains, hurricane alleys) and employ harmful techniques that act to deepen the problem in future (concrete, fossil-fuel-dependent movement of material over long distances). The collective consciousnesses awareness of the locked-in and second-order effects of. Linate change will slowly widen, taking into account things like the 30-year lag, clathrate gun, albedo, and an acute awareness of the CO2 PPM measurements of their locale.<p>2. Developed nations decline thanks significantly to repeated election of divisive, ineffective politicians and the neutering, budget cutting and general reduction of the public service that executes on an increasingly constrained vision with greater focus on media perception over results. Which ever side prevails in any particular election will cheer loudly yet their champion will prove just as ineffective as their opponent was imagined to be. This applies to the USA and Britain for sure but likely also many other democracies.<p>3. The middle class squeeze will continue and the bottom-of-the-hill ambulances in the form of social services, health and mental care will continue their steady march to privatisation, fuelled by the class divide that sees the uppers not rely on such things and so be easily drawn to the raw profit of liquidating it. There will be increasing calls for UBI while the ongoing failure to sustainably fund partial basic income, the pension, will progress.<p>4. Alternative living arrangements such as tiny houses, van dwelling, intentional communities, Airbnb and even straightforward lodging will be increasingly punished&#x2F;regulated in paradoxical complement to the wider issues of eroding social services and climate change. Telecommuting&#x2F;remote work will continue to be a niche, enviously studied by office-dwelling dreamers tracking the lives of a small number of success stories carving their niche (and also revenues) in the blogosphere.<p>5. We will see increased calls for intensified urbanisation and migration to tackle the obvious increasing poverty divide between nations&#x2F;regions and provide a path to renewed GDP growth. This will have the net effect of furthering political divides, increasing per-capital emissions, and draining the skills base of developing nations.<p>6. The imagined bunkers which we would all retreat into as a means of survival from the world will not eventuate in a literal sense except where some billionaire crafts an elaborate folly that we all get to bray over in our news feed. However, bunkers will come to exist in less literal ways - households will continue to shrink, more people living alone with pets and no kids. Social circles will also shrink and the next generation of minds will be crafted by the distant yet immediate judgment of their peers and yet they will rarely meet in person and the expenditure of personal energy in such an endeavour (or indeed any endeavour at all) will become vanishingly rare. Our diets will be made up of increasingly single-serve, processed substances delivered directly to us in single-use packaging.<p>You know after typing all this out I’ve realised it’s just as much a summation of the past decade as a projection of the next one.

VR cafes, similar to the Internet cafes of old, will become a mainstream choice for entertainment, especially for teenagers and young adults. Half-Life: Alyx will be a major contributor in establishing industry conventions that other developers will build upon.<p>2. Piracy will drastically increase for video content following the fragmentation of streaming services. A subscription to have access to all streaming services will appear, and we&#x27;ll have completed the loop back to cable television.<p>3. Electronic voting will be adopted in a few more countries. One will have an election hacked, resulting in a different party being elected than the one people actually voted for. A major scandal following that will halt the trend.<p>4. Web development will continue to remain highly fragmented. There will be fewer and fewer individuals that understand all the layers of applications due to continually exploding complexity. Containerization will be taught as a core competency in any development course. Firefox will gain 10% of market share, but Chromium-based browsers will remain king. JS will lose market share but will remain at the top.<p>5. There will be a rising trend in using neural networks to prepare APIs and interfaces for the most common app types, and it&#x27;s going to be advertised as magic. It will result in a decrease in entry-level freelancing jobs, and a decrease in the revenue of companies based on providing no-code websites - unless they&#x27;re the ones that offer the service.<p>6. A new standard for designing apps will appear from one of the tech giants and be adopted into the mainstream after 2 or 3 years, similar to Material.<p>7. There will be a massive push in many major cities to discourage personal vehicle ownership, proposing the use of public transportation or bikes&#x2F;electric scooters instead. Part of the push will be in decommissioning lanes, the other in taxes.<p>8. Gen Z will turn out as a generation of extremes. To the surprise of many, tech illiteracy will be a serious problem.<p>9. There&#x27;s going to be a global scare due to a superbug, i.e. a virus that is resistant to antibiotics. It may get as far as having border lockdowns.<p>10. China will continue its rise to power, and individual freedoms will continue to decrease. On a related note, Hong Kong will be subdued in a subtle manner, and a history rewrite will be attempted.<p>11. There will be an economic recession within three years. Many companies will feel the effects on their bottom line from decreased sales and will try to automate entry-level positions in response.<p>12. Mirroring what another poster said in this thread, deepfakes will become so commonplace that only lived experiences will remain fully credible; and yes, there will be an industry based around trying to sell content as being fully unedited.<p>13. Open offices will finally start fading out, remote work will become more mainstream. Despite experiments in several countries, the 8-hour workday will remain the norm.<p>14. Again mirroring other posters in this thread, crypto won&#x27;t have a massive breakout, though it will continue to rise in popularity.

People with Masters+ in Material Science, Biomedicine, Aeronautics, Mechatronics&#x2F;Robotics are king.<p>11.) People that know how to setup data processing pipelines to facilitate #10 are still valuable. As are those who know how to build the systems that robots rely to navigate and manage their work. Specialize or die.<p>12.) Recession. Reduction in prices of housing, but consolidation of the housing market into the hands of the elites who no longer want anything to do with VC.<p>13.) Many IT, agricultural, warehousing, retail, grocery, and trucking jobs are lost. IT takes the biggest hit.<p>14.) Machine Learning is tapped out. No AGI. Insights from Big Data aren&#x27;t what they are cracked up to be. ML helps discover patterns for drug discovery, helps robots to orient in space and see surroundings, but the logic is still driven by humans.<p>15.) Crypto goes to 0.<p>16.) Species loss and human sprawl continues.<p>17.) &quot;Peak software startup&quot; reached in 2018. Next startups are in medicine, energy, space, environmentalism. This is good. Bad for coders though.<p>More positive thoughts:<p>18.) Incredible advances in medical diagnostics. Routine screening (for wealthy people) includes full body MRIs and ML detection of cancer.

The corporate debt bubble will initiate the correction, with Softbank as well as other financial institutions taking a huge hit &#x2F; collapsing due to risky investments relating to maximizing growth &#x2F; revenue without paying attention to net income. The Canadian and Australian real estate bubbles will also burst, although these corrections may happen in 2021 rather than 2020. A new approach to setting interest rates will be assessed by the Federal Reserve in either 2021 or 2022.

Full autonomous driving won’t be completely delivered, although each car will come with features which allows drivers to take a break from driving on long stretches of highway routes approved for autonomous driving. This will initiate a massive wave of layoffs of truck drivers, as companies start building branches near traffic routes approved for full autonomy and laying off workers to try to cut costs.<p>5.

Advanced generalized artificial intelligence will not be completely established, although humanity will take major steps toward creating one as new approaches to tackling ‘deep’ learning start taking hold. Prolog type interpreting engines and tree based &#x2F; CORELS based engines which attempt to infer rules will be built underneath neural networks, delivering more generalized functionality and creating new capabilities for automation.<p>9. Uber will become bankrupt within 3-5 years, losing out to Lyft &#x2F; other entrants. Google will lose market share in the search space, although this will be offset by gains in the cloud computing (fueled by its quantum computing breakthroughs), self-driving, and AI&#x2F;ML space. Apple and Amazon will take major hits, fueled by their lack of customer focus and a shift in maximizing shareholder value rather than focusing on the customer experience. Microsoft will take a hit during the next correction, although they’ll continue to flourish under Satya Nadella.<p>10.

The 1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of the U.S. as the sole hyperpower was an abnormal state, and the 2020s will see the world finishing a decades-long readjustment to a truly multilateral world, with independent military pacts and spheres of influence by 2030.<p>3.

There may be a recession or even depression, increased political polarization, and maybe even a major war between great powers, but tight federal policing over states, the lack of any militarily strong neighbors, resource availability, strong communications, and simple inertia will mean no serious discussion of systemic weaknesses on the scale of decolonization or secession like those held in the U.K.<p>4.

Otherwise, there will be larger manufactured components for just Lego style plug together houses.<p>(23) Medical research will make good or better progress in control of obesity.<p>(24) Warehousing will become nearly fully automated.<p>(25) Automation in manufacturing will expand rapidly.<p>(26) New materials, e.g., carbon fiber, Kevlar, plastics, adhesives, etc. will grow quickly for cars, buildings, etc.<p>(27) There will be much more fossil fuel extraction from the continental shelves of the continents, especially in Asia.<p>(28) Solar power with batteries and fossil fueled backup generators will become much more popular due to more rural housing that, finally, needs no connections for electric power, telephone, Internet, water, sewer, or anything else, thus greatly lowering the costs of rural housing.  Such rural housing will also drive more home schooling based on the Internet.  Small communities, of say, a dozen homes on some 100 acres of land will grow up and maybe have their own small nuke for electric power, including for home HVAC.<p>(29) Generally cost of living will go down significantly due to some of the above -- buying direct from factories, much cheaper housing, cheaper cars, more automated manufacturing, due to home schooling, no more school taxes and, thus, much cheaper local taxes, due to rural living, much less in government services, e.g., snow plowing, traffic lights, road and sewer construction, and, thus, much lower taxes.<p>(30) Due to (29), etc., a much higher birth rate.<p>(31) Due to the information via the Internet, much better informed voters and much better politics and government.<p>(32) Also heavily due to the Internet, much cheaper alternatives to traditional college.<p>(33) The US will solidly stop the flows of illegal drugs into the US, and Mexico will make a lot of progress recovering from a narco state.<p>(34) The US will make good progress toward astoundingly capable unmanned jet fighter planes.<p>(35) CRISPR techniques will make astounding progress in plant and animal <i>breeding<\/i>.<p>(36) Generally a lot of prices will get pushed down due to lower prices for oil and natural gas from fracking, continental shelf drilling, and ANWR drilling, higher agricultural productivity from better seeds, feeds, equipment, and computer based information, more automation in manufacturing, direct selling from factories to end users, more efficient order processing, warehousing, and shipping, generally more computing and automation.  But the low interest rates are causing lots of capital investment, low unemployment, and higher wages.  Higher interest rates would risk depression from prices falling from the improved efficiencies and higher unemployment; so interest rates need to stay low to avoid recession due to falling prices."],"time":["2020-01-03 13:27:33"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["cocoggu"],"id":[21944237],"kids":{},"parent":[21941278],"text":["Politics:<p>- Trump will get reelected, but the next US president will be a democrat.<p>- In Europe, although the last 10 years were led by the rise of extreme right and conservatives, socialists and ecological parties will take the lead in most countries.<p>- China will keep being very conservative and totalitarian and most people will just accept it.

Decided to post so I could look back with a chuckle in 10 years. Here are some 20&#x27;s predictions split up into different categories.<p>Technology:<p>- The web will continue to eat everything. Local applications outside of gaming&#x2F;office work all but die, replaced by web apps, wasm payloads, and electron apps.<p>- Self Driving cars continue to be &quot;just around the corner&quot;<p>- Smartphones reached a design peak in the 10&#x27;s and we will be surprised that they don&#x27;t radically change in the 20&#x27;s<p>- Electric vehicle sales eclipse ICE<p>- Lab grown meat finally happens (released at similar to meat prices) but is a complete flop because it&#x27;s not &quot;real&quot;<p>- Slow and steady battery tech improvements are going to unleash a ton of innovation in this decade we can&#x27;t anticipate yet.<p>Culture:<p>- Pot is legalized federally and a general wave of decrim for other substances like psilocybin&#x2F;lsd goes mainstream.<p>- A president or serious presidential candidate will have their nudes leaked and it will be a huge deal for about a week and then nobody will care. They go on to win the election :p<p>- Privacy becomes even more dead than it is now. Private cameras and audio assistants are already ubiquitous; imagine that but 10x. All us nerds will continue complaining and the general public won&#x27;t care.<p>- Boomers begin retiring en-masse but they have not saved enough. Expect lots of stories about medical bankruptcy and boomers having to take minimum wage jobs to stay afloat. I also expect the &quot;lazy millenial in the basement&quot; trope to completely reverse and become &quot;millenials helping boomers age in place&quot;<p>Business:<p>- The news industry continues to be a mess. Local papers that are struggling now all go under leaving only the very large &quot;Papers of Record&quot; left. TV news declines as everyone shifts to online.<p>- Streaming video becomes a very big deal. I expect a new platform to ascend and for all new &quot;News&quot; and &quot;Entertainment&quot; personalities to pop up. Think Joe Rogan but 10x. Presidential Candidates will have to go on these shows to be taken seriously.<p>- Of the faang stocks I expect Apple and Netflix to do poorly this coming decade. Apple has little innovation left in it and Netflix has a ton of competition. Facebook and Google I expect to be solid businesses still but not innovative. Amazon will continue to dominate to the point that anti-trust is seriously considered.<p>- I expect a recession to hit in the next 3 years. It&#x27;s going to really hurt Boomers who are trying to catch up on underfunded 401ks. It will be a short recession though because any stock correction of note will be aggressively countered by fed policy and government spending. There will be no serious consideration given to austerity. Inflation will finally be unleashed by this process.<p>Global:<p>- Closed internets become common. The Great Firewall or similar techniques will be adopted in many countries to stifle dissent but also as a means to stop ubiquitous hacking.<p>- Africa becomes the new global growth hot spot - it already has been happening but this is the decade everyone realizes it and rushes in like they did to China.<p>- Kim Jong-un will still run NK and still be shooting off rockets every 6 months or so to get attention.<p>- Global warming effects will really set in and be obvious to everyone. The talking points on this will completely shift from denial to fatalism (&quot;well its already a little damaged so why not more?&quot;).

Pro gamers in korea now indistinguishable from kpop.<p>- VR hand controllers continue to evolve making current designs look like the N64 controller.<p>- VR&#x2F;AR finds commercial use outside of the gaming industry, but VR gaming still leads the market with Cubicle Simulator.<p>- AI used heavily in cgi, computer graphics, and animation industries.  Animators now work for more hours and less pay.<p>- Online dating becomes even easier, swiping becomes too 2010&#x27;s.  Loneliness increases even further.<p>- Elon gets first man on mars, Elon bores tunnels and builds a base on mars.  Elon builds solar panels to power base on mars.

The US stops subsidizing the global order, pulling back substantially from international involvement. Its continued international presence is primarily felt through alliances, but its military more openly acts like a mercenary force. Global geopolitics reverts to the mean, and a series of wars between now-unshackled regional powers in other areas of the world follows.<p>2. The US builds a military presence on another celestial body.<p>3. The US and UK ink a trade agreement after Brexit. The agreement is comparable to Lend-Lease in its blatant favoritism for the American side. The Brits take it anyway because it protects them from an economic depression.<p>4. The US intervenes in Canadian and Mexican politics&#x2F;internal affairs.<p>5. China&#x27;s Communist Party collapses. Capital flight and a demographic inversion (reaping what was sown by the One-Child Policy) produces a nation that cannot stand up to the survival pressures of a more-disorderly world. Unable to continue subsidizing its aging population, the current central planners lose their grip on power and something new replaces their influence.<p>6. The European Union fractures. Germany rearms itself.<p>7. Renewable energy turns out to be overhyped almost everywhere - except Texas, which leads the world in renewable energy production.<p>8. The US federal government legalizes at least one current Schedule I substance.<p>9. Medicine, law, and real estate are disrupted by technology in the way taxis and hotels were in the 10&#x27;s. Medtech, lawtech, and proptech become popular buzzwords. Retired&#x2F;aging Baby Boomers invest their money heavily in these sectors during the decade, fueling a new wave of startups in each field.<p>10. Investigative journalism exposes something horrifying a big tech company did (think something comparable to Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;), and that exposure galvanizes public opinion in favor of substantially increasing regulations on tech companies. SaaS margins go down across the board as a result.<p>11. MMT becomes the prevailing ideology for economists, who use it to justify continued quantitative easing. Goldbugs and bitcoiners continue rooting for the collapse of fiat money, and central banks aren&#x27;t really questioned outside the political fringes until the end of the decade.<p>12. AI research - another AI winter. No major advances of the state of the art.<p>13. AI application - we invent many more ways to apply neural networks, and solve many practical problems previously thought unsolvable.<p>14. The political gyre widens in the US, as the factions continue to live in their own alternate versions of reality. A major crisis shatters this polarization, eventually leading to a renewed American nationalism and civic pride as old institutions are destroyed and new ones are built in their place.<p>15. Cryptography becomes the only &quot;trustworthy&quot; way to verify digital information in a world of deepfakes. A big public blockchain gets a new lease on life as a public identity management system.<p>16. The first consumer-grade quantum computing hardware is launched, with a minimum of 8 qubits.<p>17. There is an IOT confidence crisis. When people realize their smart devices power botnets, a de-teching consumer movement brings purely mechanical devices &quot;with no computer attached&quot; back into vogue.<p>18. There is significant pollution cleanup in the oceans. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not driven by climate altruism - it&#x27;s driven by a desire to harvest and reuse plastics, because oil is too expensive for much of the rest of the world to consider making them from scratch.<p>19. Genetic engineering cures cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer&#x27;s, or some other major disease. The ethics of genetic engineering thus enters the public consciousness and debate - and the tone of that debate is just as divisive as the abortion debate.<p>20. We discover some sort of physical anomaly which violates the Standard Model.

Major institutions, universities, companies, open-source projects are paralised by those issues, up to the point where some of those institutions disappear<p>* Student debt bubble explodes. As with the subprimes, no banker go to prison, and the only consequence is merger between big players in the Banking &#x2F; Asset Management industries. Finance is becoming more and more an oligopoly.<p>* Cars are totally banned from most city centers in Europe and Asia. e-cargo bikes are the main mode of transport globally.<p>* Parcel delivery are heavily taxed by environmental laws. Amazon goes bankrupt. Alibaba buys AWS, which now stands for Alibaba Web Services.<p>* Planes are heavily taxed, and it becomes hard to travel across the world<p>* Labour laws and classic employment contract are now seen as a way for the ultra rich to enslave people. People are now fighting for the freedom to work as freelancers.<p>* Apple watch and other wearable  are  still useless. Air-pods are still not a platform. The exception is smart glasses that start to appear in the second  half of the decade<p>*  Security on the internet is a major issue. 2FA is required by law, and companies must certify their backend by 3rd parties according to ISO certification (as it’s the case for most physical goods)<p>* Inequalities between developed and developing countries continue to decrease fast. This, + environmental laws on imported pollution, means it’s now better to manufacture locally. Factories are back in the US and in Europe.<p>* Crypto currencies are not a thing.<p>* Bitcoin still exists and is worth $100k+ but is still extremely volatile and is not used in real life.<p>* Cash is not accepted in most shop anymore<p>* Banking is global. Illegal activities, fraud and tax evasion becomes more and more difficult as all transactions are tracked and reconciled. In particular, credit card fraud on the internet is almost  no longer a thing.<p>* Intelligence agencies have won the first war of privacy (i.e. they have backdoors in ISP, WhatsApp, FB, etc.). From now on, this war starts again every 5 years with new services trying to resist. Some try to operate from space.<p>* Ederly care is an unsolved  problem globally. Scandal about mistreated ederly people appear every other week.<p>* Political debate in Europe is no longer about right or left wing, it’s National vs European, with the first European parties winning significant national elections by 2025<p>* Still no nuclear  fusion<p>* Still no shortage of petrol<p>* A new scripting language appears, focusing on making network API calls easy and building GUIs.

Public pensions in the US will start cutting benefits and&#x2F;or getting tax increases to avoid bankruptcy. Which of these is done will vary by state&#x2F;city; both will lead to drawn-out legal battles. Social Security&#x27;s reserve won&#x27;t quite be depleted, but people will be talking more seriously about how to address it. Democrat politicians will be mixed between cutting benefits and increasing payroll taxes; Republican politicians will support just rolling over the deficit into the general fund, further increasing the national debt.<p>2. The US won&#x27;t be formally at war, but it will be engaged in one or more significant, costly occupations or proxy wars based on questionable pretenses (a la WMDs in Iraq) despite public opposition. DRC is my best guess as to the location.<p>3. The IRR of commercial solar and wind installations will be over 30% annualized. However, natural gas will continue to be the single largest energy source in the US, and new coal plants will still be constructed due mostly to special-interest-driven subsidies. Nuclear fusion still won&#x27;t be viable, and fission still won&#x27;t be adopted at any significant scale in the US.<p>4. China&#x27;s GDP will exceed the US&#x27;s, though not on a per-capita basis. It will continue to indoctrinate its citizens and perpetrate human rights violations comparable to Nazi Germany (though not at the same scale), and the Western world will continue to generally not care. Hong Kong will not gain sovereignty and will mostly lose its autonomy.<p>5. Negligible measures will have been taken to address climate change, including in the US. Warming continues to outpace even the most aggressive projections. The National Flood Insurance Program will consistently have shortfalls in the tens of billions per year, effectively subsidizing coastal properties in Florida just as it does today.<p>6. US health insurance will continue to be dominated by employer-provided coverage. There will be a public option, but few care providers will accept it because it reimburses at a lower rate than private insurance, and it will only be used by &quot;gig economy&quot; workers, or whatever that sector evolves into. Spending per capita will be about double that of the rest of the Western world.<p>7. Amazon will be forced to spin off AWS; this will be big news at the time but mostly won&#x27;t have much effect. Each will be a trillion-dollar company. Amazon Retail will finally figure out how to automate &quot;boring&quot; everyday purchases including groceries. (For posterity: currently they only have Subscribe And Save, which is great if you know exactly how long it takes you to use a tube of toothpaste.)<p>8. Microsoft will open-source the Windows kernel. Azure will be larger than AWS despite a generally inferior product suite. People will still be writing VBA for the Azure version of Excel.<p>9. Facebook will still be ubiquitous, but young people won&#x27;t even bother adding their friends on it anymore, since they only use it to keep up with extended family. Instagram will go the way of MySpace. Facebook will own the most popular dating app for a year or two, though that whole space will be a revolving door.<p>10. GCP will be shuttered, since Google still won&#x27;t figure out how to sell to enterprise. Meanwhile, they&#x27;ll use data from one or more genetic testing companies to figure out the exact genes that determine susceptibility to different forms of advertising. Also, they&#x27;ll release another messaging app.<p>11. Netflix will be far less valuable and less ubiquitous than it is today, to the point that its inclusion in &quot;FAANG&quot; will seem anachronistic. Apple will still make the best mobile devices, but it will undermine its position as a status symbol due to the introduction of cheaper devices.<p>12. SF&#x27;s housing issues will only get worse. Saudi-backed VC funding for US startups will dry up, and while capital will still be available, it will no longer make financial sense for most startups to start in the Bay Area. The only new startups in SF will be started by, and exclusively hire, former employees of FAANG + unicorns. (More generally, programmers&#x27; salaries will become even more bimodal, and the relationship between coding ability and salary will become even more tenuous.) For other startups, there won&#x27;t be a new centralized startup hub (though Austin will probably be the closest), and this decentralization will lead to increases in bootstrapping and remote work.<p>13. Urban and inner-ring suburban housing in desirable US cities will continue to get more expensive, and housing elsewhere will continue to get cheaper, since new college grads will increasingly need to move to these cities to find decent jobs. (Empty nesters mostly won&#x27;t downsize to condos, although there will be an uptick in news articles presenting anecdotes about the ones who do.) Urban taxpayers will increasingly subsidize infrastructure for rural communities as this happens, though they&#x27;ll continue to mostly not notice or care. Most, though not all, of these cities will have implemented good housing policy by 2030, but new construction still won&#x27;t keep up with demand, and the lack of construction in the 2010s will have a lasting impact on the availability of housing in the 2nd and 3rd price quintiles.<p>14. Wealth inequality in the US will continue to increase. The US will implement a wealth tax, but it will have so many exemptions (housing, trusts, holdings in certain corporate entities) that the only beneficiaries are tax lawyers. Low-income people will only ever see a tiny fraction of their paychecks, as landlords and utility companies will require that employers pay them directly.<p>15. Despite continued subsidies for the meat and dairy industries, cheap fast food (e.g., whatever replaces the McDouble) will be plant-based by 2030. We still won&#x27;t have a good lab-grown steak, but most staples will have readily available plant-based replacements, some of which will be better than the real thing. Vegans will still only make up a couple percent of adults in the US (and ~10% of yuppies), but the median American will only eat real meat 2-3 meals a week.<p>16. Python will finally get good tooling for EDA and become the de facto standard for data science. R will be viewed in industry the same way SAS is viewed today, though it will continue to see use in academia.<p>17. Non-tech companies will rightly give up on building out ML teams in-house for basic&#x2F;standard problems, outsourcing that work to platforms like Sagemaker instead. They will continue to hire people with the job title Data Scientist, who will mostly be responsible for conveying to management a combination of pretty graphs and basic statistical reasoning.<p>18. Document databases will mostly disappear. They&#x27;ll be replaced in part by JSONB-style columns in relational databases, but more importantly, better tooling will make schema changes (and integration with application code) for relational databases much less painful, and keeping the schema in the database will be widely accepted as a Good Thing.<p>19. Home Internet service will be uncommon, except for geeks and people in rural areas - most will pay for mobile network access on a per-device basis, including for computers. People will occasionally reminisce about the funny SSID names they came up with back when wi-fi was a thing.<p>20. The current state of the art in ML is a dead end when it comes to achieving AGI, and we are approaching another AI winter, though this will still be controversial in 2030. It&#x27;s still good enough to achieve autonomous cars that outperform human drivers, though they&#x27;ll still be niche.<p>21. Quantum computing will make significant progress, though it won&#x27;t have any practical applications yet. Many cryptocurrencies based on quantum cryptography will be developed; these won&#x27;t see significant adoption as mediums of exchange, though they&#x27;ll create a new generation of crypto millionaires in much the same way as last time. Today&#x27;s cryptocurrencies will fade into irrelevance over time, and Libra will never materialize."],"time":["2020-01-03 13:14:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["jtolmar"],"id":[21943885],"kids":{},"parent":[21941278],"text":["Computer technologies:<p>- Autonomous cars are mixed into regular cab&#x2F;rideshare traffic, with percent of fleet varying from city to city depending on weather, consistency of markings, construction, and so on.

As its internal infrastructure matures, China depends less on western countries and more on its investments in Africa.<p>- The next global recession hits after a major economy passes a large infrastructure&#x2F;spending bill, improving bonds as an investment.

Facebook (surveillance) and Disney (media&#x2F;propaganda) will the most notable new entrants. A socialist candidate with a lot of momentum in the US will get buried in an obviously corrupt&#x2F;illegal way. Nothing will be done.

The poor will be left behind, and we&#x27;ll have multiple Katrina-like natural disasters. Trade between countries will decrease. Especially trade between US&#x2F;China. No progress on an international climate change agreement. Little progress on emissions -- most progress will come bottom-up from ICE cars being phased out.

The middle class will evaporate.<p>- China, India, Saudi Arabia and their allies will become more powerful politically, economically, technologically and especially militarily, most especially in both cyber and nuclear warfare.<p>- The above will lead to an even more dramatic rise in nationalism and the rejection of globalism in the West. The UK will be seen to have come out unscathed by leaving the EU which will cause a crisis for the EU as more states fight federalization, reject directives and propose to leave themselves. The unrest and uncertainty will drive the Euro through the floor.<p>- Trump will be re-elected. The following government will be headed by a Democrat embracing nationalism and vowing to put American&#x27;s first by taxing &quot;the rich&quot;, implementing UBI, healthcare, creating government jobs, etc.<p>- There will be at least one massive economic crisis in North America, likely the overvaluation of stocks through indexes held by massive pension funds causing a &quot;re-evaluation&quot; of many stocks we&#x27;re currently taking for granted. Europe will go through far worse as mentioned above.<p>- There will be at least 1 major cyber security related incident that will affect a country in a way that will change the nature of national access to the internet forever.<p>- Jeffrey Epstein still won&#x27;t have killed himself.<p>Tech:<p>- Rejection of petroleum based products in the name of battling climate change will drive up the costs of consumer goods. Stagnating or falling income will cause people to buy less goods. Working longer for less pay will give people less free time. Consumption will therefore instead be turned toward services, especially services that promise to give you back time by automating household chores, providing day-to-day needs such as food and mind-numbing entertainment, especially in VR which I expect to be gamified to be as addictive and escapist as possible.<p>- I expect there will be little autonomous vehicles everywhere. Peace and quiet in our skies will no longer be a thing. Our sidewalks will have a lane full of autonomous delivery bots.<p>- Coupled with the above, electric vehicles will become the norm. However, they won&#x27;t be owned by consumers unless you&#x27;re very rich. They&#x27;ll be be predominantly available as fleets used via subscription to access. Initially it&#x27;ll seem glamorous but as with the airline industry, longer term we will be compelled to share the vehicle with other riders, sat on materials that cannot stain, with targeted ads for other services played throughout the duration of the trip.<p>- AI will prosper but not general AI, mostly very well crafted advanced automation and mostly developed in the non-West.<p>- DevOps will move to just Dev as Ops becomes almost entirely automated.<p>- One cloud provider will prevail, the others will be relegated to being niche afterthoughts or disregarded altogether.<p>- Med-tech will become normalized and people will end up expected to wear at least one device that is continually monitoring and reporting on their health. That data will of course be packaged and sold to be used against them by advertisers for, again, various services we&#x27;ll be told we &quot;need&quot;.<p>- Privacy and the expectation of privacy will be gone forever. The governments will launch their full scale attack on encryption under the guise of protecting children or terrorism, others will take advantage of the backdoors created in it, and those seen to be trying to protect their privacy will be seen as people with suspicion and therefore subject to further monitoring.<p>- Spurred by the above, cryptocurrencies will enjoy a brief revival as some try to move money privately but will ultimately be cracked down on and controlled as a &quot;threat&quot;.<p>Prove me wrong 2020&#x27;s!<p>Edit: Just scheduled an email to myself with this link for 01&#x2F;01&#x2F;2030.

Because the old guard supporting these dogmas is falling out of vogue.<p>- Really great advances made with CRISPR and immunotherapy, especially with respect to cancer treatment. The immune system already targets cancer or disease-state cells, but perhaps we can give it a little nudge?<p>- Human cloning. It isn&#x27;t at all infeasible, just politically&#x2F;morally questionable. Someone will do it.<p>- Insurance companies get ahold of biometric and DNA data. They&#x27;re salivating for it. Google&#x27;s purchase of Fitbit is scary. 23andme&#x27;s recent sale of data is also troubling.<p>===== Politics &#x2F; Global &#x2F; Society =====<p>- Democracy begins to fade. Trump&#x27;s war on the media is the canary in the coal mine. Social platforms erode our critical thinking and ability to see through the miasma. The success of China&#x27;s surveillance state and the fact that they can succeed without democracy sends the wrong message to the rest of the world.<p>- Diversity increases in Hollywood, high-paying jobs, and political candidates. Racism and sexism begin to wane.<p>- Millennials and GenZ (Zoomers? Zoomies? :P) come to the political forefront. GenZ is more politically active than GenX or the Millennials. There may be some cross-generational war with some younger candidates campaigning on cutting social security, pensions, and benefits.<p>- As more young people move to cities, housing prices in all major cities will skyrocket. They&#x27;re already steep, but this trend will continue. Housing prices in the suburbs will collapse as boomers retire&#x2F;downsize and nobody wants to live there.<p>- People spend even more time on screens.<p>===== Economics =====<p>- We won&#x27;t have a recession at the same level of the 2008 recession.<p>- China has a recession.<p>- Cryptocurrency is dead, no thanks to government regulation and crackdown. Bitcoin is $0.01.<p>- We become a cashless society.<p>===== Energy &#x2F; Transportation =====<p>- Elon Musk becomes even wealthier. Tesla catches on like wildfire with lower-cost models, and they dominate the EV market with their healthy lead. But the real story is SpaceX leap frogging defense contractors and becoming the world&#x27;s gateway to space. Starlink, if successful, might spawn a new era of connectivity.<p>- Yet, gasoline still remains the dominant fuel for automotive transportation. EVs are still in the minority.<p>- Trains come back in vogue as a hipster option for Millennial travel.<p>- Nuclear still isn&#x27;t being built out in the US beyond a few scattered projects (eg. Vogtle).<p>===== Deep Learning &#x2F; Hardware =====<p>- While deep learning isn&#x27;t as big as proponents made it out to be, but we don&#x27;t face another AI winter. There will be huge applications in media (Hollywood will be a big customer), process optimization, computer vision, and other areas. We&#x27;ll even see it creep into consumer products.<p>- Creative tools are greatly enhanced with deep learning and other techniques (computer vision, better models), leading to a creative explosion.<p>- No self-driving cars. Yet. Weather, inconsistent roads, bad drivers... It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>- Moore&#x27;s law holds &#x2F; is beaten. Deep learning is the driver.<p>- Embedded devices languished for awhile (IOT), but are finally going to be hella cool and novel. Wearables, biometrics. But they remain a huge exploit vector.<p>===== Cloud =====<p>- Anger at managed cloud computing lock-in sets in. We might see a swing back to the data center.<p>- Edge computing is a huge thing. Despite Google Stadia failing, companies vie to run video games in the cloud.<p>===== Web &#x2F; Social Media =====<p>- The web dies and is replaced by more garbage like AMP, walled gardens like Facebook, Slack, and (now) Reddit. Chrome has removed URLs. RSS is dead. Lots of people are very angry at Google.<p>- Lots of federation &#x2F; distributed projects to try to fight back. None of them really take hold since they&#x27;re not backed with the same staffing or scale as the incumbents.<p>- In what remains of the web, Rust&#x2F;ASM has replaced Javascript.<p>- New privacy laws lead to adtech backlash. The masses don&#x27;t care, but politicians, lawyers, and those in tech do and now have leverage.<p>- Facebook (the site) is full of older conservatives and has gone the way of MySpace.<p>- A few new social media sites come out, gain traction, and don&#x27;t sell out to Zuckerberg.<p>- Twitter eats itself and loses engagement. It still doesn&#x27;t have a viable alternative.<p>- Reddit becomes absolutely awful and starts to look more like Facebook or Digg than the site we used to use. They have succeeded in monstrous growth at the expense of the community. This leads to a very successful IPO. Unfortunately, nothing really replaces it.<p>===== Tech =====<p>- Antitrust cases brought against Amazon, Apple, Google, and&#x2F;or Facebook. None of them are broken up. Only slaps on the wrist.<p>- Microsoft thrives, Google dives.<p>- Slack gets disrupted. It&#x27;s just chat.<p>- Rust becomes the most popular programming language and sees deployment everywhere: OSes, servers, games, web apps, embedded, ... the ecosystem explodes.<p>- Tech shifts away from SF. It&#x27;s too expensive. Look to the southeast: Austin, Atlanta, Charlotte. Also distributed workforce growth by leaps and bounds.<p>- Death to the open office floor plan.<p>===== Entertainment =====<p>- Disney and Netflix get disrupted by a new form of media. They may still be players, but classical filmmaking is old-world thinking. Look at what teens watch these days. They want to be both involved and passive, creative and destructive. Twitch, YouTube, Fortnite are good examples. Tech eats Hollywood.<p>- More radical&#x2F;experimental new forms of video games. Games that let you play alongside celebrity streamers. Interesting MMOs and new concepts like battle royale.<p>- More cool stuff like Twitch Plays Pokemon (did that happen this decade?)<p>===== Misc =====<p>- We&#x27;re going to see really cool (and really scary) applications for drones. People will use them to commit theft and vandalism (spray paint? knocking out windows?), and maybe even kill people.<p>- Still no answer on P vs NP.<p>- Still no discovery of life on Mars (or elsewhere).<p>- Singularity isn&#x27;t happening.<p>===== Personal =====<p>- I&#x27;ll get to use Rust professionally.<p>- I&#x27;ll finally launch a startup."],"time":["2020-01-03 02:47:54"],"type":["comment"],"deleted":{},"dead":{}},{"by":["ossworkerrights"],"id":[21941535],"kids":{},"parent":[21941278],"text":["Pretty concerned about how the EU will evolve.

Distributed Internet - A combination of tech companies that have become too large, and government overreach result in an encrypted and distributed internet.  The large companies of the past are not gone, but are slowing becoming irrelevant.  Teens, and Gen-Z (zoomers?) will most likely be the first to start adopting.  Boomers, and older millennials will be slower to adapt.  The large companies are also facing a 2 sided battle as they also battle Washington.<p>2.  World un-united - In the post Trump world, the US no longer operates the infrastructure required for the post-ww2 united world we&#x27;ve been used to.  This means countries will have to significantly increase their military spending, and more problematically, they will have to find new markets to export to (since most countries lack a large millennial generation to sell to.) The strong social spending European countries have become used to will start to dry up.  The result will be the continuation in more authoritarian populist strong man leaders.  As recession, and lack of social spending, combined with increased military spending start to increase, the 2020&#x27;s will look a lot more like 1930&#x27;s.  Germany will be particularly hard hit.<p>3.  The US starts to become more aware of the Rural&#x2F;City divide.  In the early part of the decade, issues such as gun control will result in increased tension as &quot;Red America&quot; rises up against &quot;Blue America&quot; realizing it has no political power left, and &quot;Blue America&quot; is using it&#x27;s power to change the things it cares about.  Initially these disputes are isolated geographically to a few areas.  Likely Virginia, and Washington&#x2F;Oregon.  But it might expand into something bigger... which in my opinion is one of the biggest wildcards of the future.<p>4.  An over leveraged China will stumble, It will be plauged with trade issues, and demographic issues.<p>5.  Software Engineering will split, highly skilled engineers will make more than ever before, but there will be a very large base of newly minted &quot;lower skilled&quot; software devs that make a lot less money.<p>6.

That makes sense to me in a sense that the word &quot;trip&quot; isn&#x27;t a coincidence-- a really fun intense vacation in a foreign country also alleviates depression for a month or two. You swear that when you come back things will be different, but then you have to answer slack messages at 9pm, and your project is slipping at work, and your wife is flirting with strangers every time you go to a bar, and well... in a month or two you&#x27;re back to feeling exactly the same way you did before (until you take the next vacation).<p>Second, people who discover psychedelics go on a multiyear quest for enlightenment. They keep taking various drugs, keep feeling like they understand things better and better, get sucked into the psychedelic social vortex of other truth-seekers, and generally believe that their life is full of meaning and is going to turn around at any moment. Except by any objective measure they&#x27;re still nervous wrecks-- they have every physiological symptom of stress and depression, and aside from temporary alleviation of their symptoms (see part one), they always regress to the mean.<p>Third, after a few years of this people eventually reach a fork. Most people realize that their psychonautic journey is at best leading them in circles, and at worst is causing their life to spiral down the drain. So they give it up, get a job without 9pm slack messages (or find a better way to adjust to stress), marry someone who isn&#x27;t constantly on the verge of cheating, start doing regular exercise, and generally find a way to settle into a reasonably balanced life.<p>A small minority of people double down, grow out their (usually grey by then) hair down to their shoulders, go to festivals and workshops, talk of energy and chi and chakras, stare into the eyes of strangers, and touch each other&#x27;s faces.<p>Generally speaking, I haven&#x27;t run into anyone yet who found a third path.
